House Sends Impeachment to John Conyers
by Bob Fertik
By a bipartisan vote of 251 - 166 , the full House of Representatives sent Dennis Kucinich ’s 35 Articles of Impeachment to the Judiciary Committee .
That means Chairman John Conyers now has the power to decide whether to hold impeachment hearings – or not .
Incredibly , 24 Republicans voted with 227 Democrats ; the 166 no votes came exclusively from Republicans .
So what will Conyers do ?
When the Downing Street Memo was published on May 1 , 2005 , Democrats.com worked closely with Conyers to hold the famous basement hearings featuring Cindy Sheehan , Ray McGovern , and John Bonifaz .
In August 2006 , Conyers published all of the evidence of Bush ’s crimes in The Constitution in Crisis .
Many of us believed he would begin impeachment proceedings if Democrats won the House , which they did that November .
But in the spring of 2006 , Nancy Pelosi declared impeachment “ off the table . ”
And when Democrats took control and Conyers was sworn in as Judiciary Chairman , he fell firmly into line behind the Speaker .
( Conyers insists Pelosi did not threaten to deny him the Chairmanship . )
Since 2005 , Conyers has received millions of impeachment petitions .
Hundreds if not thousands of activists have spoken to him personally .
But he remains adamantly opposed to hearings , for one simple reason : he fears it will hurt the Democratic candidate for President ( now Barack Obama ) in November .
Of course there is n’t one scintilla of evidence to support Conyers ’ fear .
It is based entirely on the 1998 election , when Newt Gingrich turned the Starr Report ( published online on September 9 ) into a campaign issue but lost a small number of seats by overplaying the issue in TV ads .
Despite those small losses , Republicans held the majority and voted to impeach Clinton 6 weeks after the election , on December 19 .
And two years later , despite a massively unpopular impeachment , Republican George Bush got close enough to Al Gore to steal the election .
And one reason it was close was that Democrats believed impeachment made Clinton too “ toxic ” to campaign even in Arkansas , which would have put Gore over the top in the Electoral College even without Florida .
Of course there is no comparison between impeaching Clinton for consensual sex and impeaching Bush for 35 High Crimes , including a disastrous war of aggression based on lies .
And the difference is reflected in polls – only 26 % of Americans wanted to impeach Clinton in 1998 , while 43 % of Americans wanted to impeach Bush in our last poll on July 8 , 2007 .
( Of course the Corporate Media refuses to ask about impeachment in their own polls .

Christian Bale has promised we 'll never see Robin in one of the new Bat - movies , telling a reporter : " If Robin crops up in one of the new Batman films , I 'll be chaining myself up somewhere and refusing to go to work . "
What do you think - could a Dark Knight sequel benefit from having a little plucky kid acrobat jumping around and cracking jokes , to lighten the mood ?

Personally , I doubt you could fit the cute sidekick into the noir - inspired world of Chris Nolan 's Batman movies ?
Even Frank Miller , whose Batman : Year One inspired Nolan 's vision , has failed to make Robin work in his All - Star Batman And Robin The Boy Wonder comic .
The original Batman comic only lasted about a year before Robin turned up in Detective Comics # 38 , and the comics have been struggling fitfully to return to their lone - hero roots ever since - most notably after killing off Robin in the late 1980s .
What do you think ?
Would Robin ruin the Bat - movies ?
Or could Nolan and co. pull it off ?

Fox host highlights ' affectionate ' embrace between Bush , openly gay congressman
During a staid , post - State of the Union discussion of the nation 's fiscal policy , something caught Brit Hume 's eye .
The Fox News anchor interrupted commentator Nina Easton to highlight an embrace between President Bush and Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
Frank is also an openly gay Member of Congress .
" Hold on a second , what we just saw there was an interesting moment , a moment of friendship and almost affection between the president and none other than Barney Frank , " Hume said as Frank and Bush hugged .
" Who I think it 's fair to say is one of the most liberal Members of Congress , also one of the smartest guys up there , but , uh ... "
Easton cut him off to point out how closely Frank has worked with the administration on fiscal policy .

Fear is our national pastime .
As a society , we have a long history of getting whipped into a collective frenzy over threats to our health or children that are nearly ( or completely ) non-existent .
No danger is too small or remote to be exaggerated and screamed from the headlines .
5 Three Mile Island
On March 28 , 1979 , what should have been a minor plumbing problem somehow escalated into a reactor fuel meltdown at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station in Pennsylvania .
Within five days , the Governor had ordered the evacuation of all children and pregnant women ( fuck you , dad ! ) within a five - mile radius of the area .
Since that time , the name Three Mile Island has been synonymous with nuclear disaster .
Hooters even named one of their hottest ( and most delicious ) wing sauces after it !

But unlike other nuclear disasters , Chernobyl for example , which caused at least 4,000 eventual deaths , Three Mile Island was responsible for a whopping zero fatalities .
In fact , there were n't even any injuries .
Later tests revealed that the level of radiation people were exposed to in the five - mile radius was equivalent to the amount of radiation a person is exposed to while flying on a commercial airliner .
In other words , the danger was nil .
So why all the ruckus ?
Much like that restraining order Catherine Zeta - Jones slapped us with a few years back , we blame Michael Douglas for this .
Just 12 days prior to the incident at TMI , The China Syndrome premiered .
In the film , Michael Douglas plays a television news reporter who surreptitiously films a nuclear power plant crew as a near meltdown is taking place .
As luck would have it , the events depicted in the movie almost perfectly mirrored what occurred at TMI .
With the movie stirring public debate about the safety of nuclear power , there was no way the incident at TMI occurring just days later would do anything less than scare the ever - loving shit out of people .
And that 's exactly what it did .

" Hi , I 'm a giant asshole . "
In 1979 , Three Mile Island killed fewer people than ...
Robot attacks .
Ford factory worker Robert Williams was killed when a robot hit him in the head , thus outranking Three Mile Island 's death toll , 1 - 0 .
The increased awareness of the potential consequences of humanity 's carbon emissions has generated intense interest in renewable energy sources .
One nonrenewable technology that has also received significant attention is nuclear power .
Although nuclear is n't truly renewable — there are finite sources of usable uranium — it has the significant advantage of being emissions - free once the construction and fuel isolation steps are completed .
Although nuclear power does carry significant baggage in terms of safety and proliferation concerns , a significant barrier to its adoption remains the long - term storage of nuclear waste , some of which will remain a health threat for millions of years .
Now , in a Policy Forum published in this week 's Science , two former members of the US Geological Survey argue it's time to start addressing that issue by opening a long - term storage facility to pilot studies .
The problem the authors address is unlike anything humanity has ever faced .
Some of the waste from nuclear plants will retain harmful levels of radioactivity for tens of thousands to millions of years .
Beyond basic issues of securing and identifying it in a way that will persist even if our current culture does n't , we will also have to encase it in a way that will be stable on geologic time scales .
In the US , a proposed solution to the storage problem was to use areas in the desert Southwest where the water table remains hundreds of meters below the surface of geologically consolidated and stable mountains .
According to the authors , the trouble started with the selection of the site for the US storage facility .
Initial legislation called for the full evaluation of three potential sites before choosing a final one ; instead , five years later , Congress short - circuited the process and selected Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
This action , according to the authors , obscured the fact that Yucca Mountain was on the list of finalists for a variety of well - documented technical reasons .
From there , the article discusses how the inherent uncertainties of science and engineering have left the public and legal system with a poor picture of our understanding of long - term storage .
Science is poorly equipped to provide the certainty that everyone would like to see for a project of this nature , and engineering faces clear limits when predicting the behavior of structures over periods that are longer than human civilization has existed .
" There is unlikely to be complete closure , " the authors write .
" Nor will honest disagreements among scientists and engineers regarding some YM [ Yucca Mountain ] issues likely ever cease . "
Despite the uncertainties , the authors argue that there are very real reasons to start using Yucca Mountain : 60,000 metric tons of waste , currently stored in 72 sites , " many adjacent to metropolitan areas and all next to rivers , lakes , or the ocean . "
It 's easy to default to inertia while waiting for greater certainty about Yucca Mountain or hoping something better comes along , but the authors argue that the current storage system creates far too much risk for this to be an acceptable path .
The paper argues that storage in the facilities at Yucca Mountain is not irreversible ; if problems arise , the waste could be temporarily removed , or adjustments to the structural properties could be made .
In fact , the authors argue , experience with pilot programs may be the best way to start reducing some of the outstanding uncertainties that are making the current debate so difficult .
Without this knowledge , we may never be able to refine long - term models of waste storage .
What is perhaps most striking about the discussion is that the message of the authors focuses on helping the public understand that science is actually not a method of establishing certainty —
" There need be no embarrassment to admit to the limitations of our explanatory and predictive capabilities , " they write .
Getting the public to realize that science can make the very best predictions possible despite residual uncertainties remains a significant challenge for nearly every case where science has to be translated to policy .

width = ” 250 ″ height = ” 178 ″ align = ” right ” alt= ” ” Answer Conyers ’ Impeachment Request !
From the NATIONAL IMPEACHMENT NETWORK :
On June 5 , John Conyers agreed to a meeting with a group of CodePinkers .
He challenged them to explain how to he should overcome the five reasons why impeachment is not possible .
His reasons are below , with my suggested or possible rebuttals in parens .
Please use your own wording to rebut his objections , but no accusations , no emotion , no rants — as respectful as can be .
Then mail or fax them to Chairman Conyers , with the notation that here are rebuttals to his objections to impeachment .
Ask him to please consider these rebuttals carefully .
( EVEN if you ’ve done it a million times before , we must keep chipping away at it , and now is the perfect time — maybe the only time — to do it ! )
The 5 reasons Mr. Conyers gives for not impeaching ( I have paraphrased ) :
1 . While the majority of people in this country want Bush gone , they do n’t want impeachment .
( Rebuttal :
What facts or polls do you use to support your contention that people do n’t want impeachment ?
Our interactions with the public for years now indicates otherwise . )
2 . The corporate media will slay us .
( Rebuttal : Is n’t the object to carry out justice ?
If the media tries to slay the Dems for that , then it seems the Dems have plenty of reason to slay that corporate media !
The Dems should have more faith in the people , and should understand the people know the truth when they hear it . )
3 . No time .
( We all know the answer to that one .
Clinton and Nixon , both in a matter of months .
Besides , all we ’re asking for now is hearings , to begin exposure of this administration .
The rest will take care of itself . )
4 . No votes .
( Again , Besides , all we ’re asking for now is hearings , to begin exposure of this administration .
The rest will take care of itself , and the votes will be there once the people begin to overrule political motivation . )
5. Election defeat .
( We know this one too : Historically , the impeaching party has won in a landslide .
His staffer ’s suggestion that while the Republicans won the presidential election after Clinton , they lost seats in Congress .
We can easily argue that there is likely no or little correlation at all — or , that even Republican voters were disgusted with that “ impeachment . )
Chairman Conyers indicated he would welcome our individual Congressional reps onto the ( I believe Wexler ? ) letter that currently has 15 signers , five of whom are on the Judiciary Committee .

The Student Scholars for 9/11 Truth catch up with John Edwards in the hope that the Senator would tell the truth .
Edwards did admit to attending the meeting , echoing statements he made to We Are Change where he told cameras that he did attend , but declined to explain why there is so much secrecy .
Edwards replied , " That ’s a good question ; you should ask them that . "
" I ’ve only been there one time ; I just went and spoke ; I ’m not a member of the group , " Edwards elaborated .
This time , Edwards downplayed the significance of the meeting .
" All I did was go .
They had a Republican and a Democrat .
I gave like a 20 - minute talk on the presidential election . "
However , Edwards denied that his appearance at Bilderberg had anything to do with being selected as Kerry ’s running mate .
" No , because I was n’t his running mate then . "
The Bilderberg group has a deserved reputation as kingmaker , as Bill Clinton , George Bush , Tony Blair and other leaders met there before gaining office .

Premature babies can often be vulnerable Even very premature babies benefit from skin to skin contact with their parents , research suggests .
A Canadian study found that cuddling babies born as early as 28 weeks reduced the stress of painful medical procedures which many must undergo .
Writing in the journal BMC Pediatrics , the McGill University team said it might aid the recovery process .
UK neonatal units do not always encourage skin to skin contact , said a London - based expert studying the issue .
There is already some evidence that regular cuddling can help babies , even those dependent on incubators , not only by promoting their health , but by encouraging a parental bond which could be important to their progress in months to come .
Neonatal units can be very intimidating places , and parents often do not know the best way to get involved
Professor Linda Franck
Institute of Child Health
This study is the first to look at extremely premature babies , born between 28 and 31 weeks .
It was previously thought by some experts that such young babies were not developed enough to benefit from human touch .
A common test used in neonatal units is the " heel prick " blood test , which produces a sample which can be used to check blood sugar levels .
This is inevitably painful for the baby , and in some cases , it can take minutes for this distress to recede - which could be a problem for a baby whose health is in the balance .
The McGill researchers carried out the test on some babies who were being actively cuddled , skin to skin , measuring facial expressions , heart rate and blood oxygen levels to assess the amount of pain suffered .
Pain scores after 90 seconds for the cuddled babies were much lower than for those who were not cuddled .
Half the cuddled babies did not show any facial expression of pain when undergoing a heel prick test .
Lead researcher Celeste Johnston said that the shorter recovery time could help maintain the baby 's health .
" The pain response in very preterm neonates appears to be reduced by skin - to - skin maternal contact , " she said .
Parent pressure Professor Linda Franck , from the Institute of Child Health in London , said that parents were often not encouraged to have skin to skin contact with their premature babies in UK neonatal units , despite growing evidence that it could help .
She said : " Neonatal units can be very intimidating places , and parents often do not know the best way to get involved .
" Parents want to do the right thing , but the message is difficult to get out there .
" This study suggests that , even for the very youngest premature babies , skin to skin contact can reduce the stress response . "
She is currently carrying out a pilot study in four London units which is using a variety of methods , including skin to skin contact , to encourage parents to become more involved with the care of their newborn children .

The sexual and feminist revolutions were supposed to free women to enjoy casual sex just as men always had but according to Professor Anne Campbell from Durham University in the UK ( 1 ) , the negative feelings reported by women after one - night stands suggest that they are not well adapted to fleeting sexual encounters .
Men are more likely to reproduce and therefore to benefit from numerous short - term partners .
For women , however , quality seems to be more important than quantity .
Also for women , finding partners of high genetic quality is a stronger motivator than sheer number , and it is commonly believed that women are more willing to have casual sex when there is a chance of forming a long - term relationship .
Professor Campbell looked at whether women have adapted to casual sex by examining their feelings following a one - night stand .
If women have adapted , then although they may take part in casual sex less often than men because of their stricter criteria when selecting partners , they should rate the experience positively .
To test the theory , a total of 1743 men and women who had experienced a one - night stand were asked to rate both their positive and negative feelings the following morning , in an internet survey .
Overall women 's feelings were more negative than men's .
Eighty per cent of men had overall positive feelings about the experience compared to 54 per cent of women .
Men were more likely than women to secretly want their friends to hear about it and to feel successful because the partner was desirable to others .
Men also reported greater sexual satisfaction and contentment following the event , as well as a greater sense of well - being and confidence about themselves .
The predominant negative feeling reported by women was regret at having been " used " .
Women were also more likely to feel that they had let themselves down and were worried about the potential damage to their reputation if other people found out .
Women found the experience less sexually satisfying and , contrary to popular belief , they did not seem to view taking part in casual sex as a prelude to long - term relationships .
According to Professor Campbell , although women do not rate casual sex positively , the reason they still take part in it may be due to the menstrual cycle changes influencing their sexual motivation .
Indeed , during the ovulatory phase ( between days 10 to 18 of their cycle ) , women report increased sexual desire and arousal , with a preference for short - term partners .

Uproar as Turkey plans virginity tests
The human rights pressure group , Human Rights Watch , has called on Turkey to withdraw an order authorising virginity tests on nursing students suspected of having sex .
Imposition of this test on girls - and the subsequent denial of education opportunities based on test results - represent an intolerable form of gender discrimination
Human Rights Watch
In a letter to Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit , Human Rights Watch said that the order introduced by Health Minister Osman Durmus was a " profound violation of women 's human rights " .
The regulation says that girls studying at government - run nursing high schools should be expelled for having sex , and that those under suspicion should be subjected to gynaecological examinations .
It also says that , once expelled , girls should be forbidden from studying at any government institution .
Rat poison
The order has sparked an uproar in Turkey , with angry protests being made by women 's and human rights groups .
When it is enshrined in law that the state can force girls to take virginity tests it has an effect on millions and millions of girls
Martina Vandenberg , Human Rights Watch Forced virginity tests on girls suspected of having had premarital sex were common until the practice was banned in 1999 , when five girls attempted suicide by taking rat poison rather than submit to the tests .
Pre-marital sex under the age of 18 is illegal in Turkey .
" Imposition of this test on girls - and the subsequent denial of education opportunities based on test results - represent an intolerable form of gender discrimination , " Human Rights Watch said in its letter .
A representative of the group 's Women 's Rights division , Martina Vandenberg , told the BBC that the Health Minister 's order was an attempt to circumvent the 1999 ban .
She said the students - aged 14 to 18 - were children under international law , and had a right to education .
Grounds for suspicion
She added : " When it is enshrined in law that the state can force girls to take virginity tests , it has an effect on millions and millions of girls in Turkey , in the sense that there is constantly the threat of a virginity exam hanging over their head . "
Even innocent activities , such as having a picnic with boys , could be perceived in Turkey as grounds for suspicion , she said .
The Health Ministry 's order technically avoids the ban on forced virginity tests , because students enrolling at nursing schools would be voluntarily submitting themselves to the rules of the establishment .

I have been asked many by people if I really believed the survival time graph on the ISC site was truly an accurate representation of how long a new system had once connected .
The answer to this is yes for most home users and systems that are internet facing .
It can be longer depending on the system , what sits in front of it and what it is used for .
The survival time is currently around 4 minutes for unpatched systems .
That is not much time at all and the window has shrunk over the past couple of years .
If you want to do your own experiment by placing a sacrificial system out there , its really a fun thing to do !
Do n't patch the system and see how long it takes before it receives its first probes and actually becomes compromised .
Just make sure you monitor and its not used against others .
If you really want to do this , I 'd advise checking out the Honeynet Project .
The battle , in my experience , is waged between the admins and management who want to get this system up and working and security who is saying not until its been patched and its security posture confirmed .
More than once , I 've dealt with a compromise of a system that was place on the network before it was hardened .
I got the same answer every time " We needed it working ASAP " .
However , more time was spent playing clean up from it than if it was just done right the first time .
What I 'm really curious about are any experiences that you have had for survival time on the internet that you can share .
Please feel free to sanitize them as necessary and let us know if they can be posted .
What was placed on the network and why ?
What was the impact , if any , to other systems ?
How long was the system out there before it was compromised .
Also , if you have been able to use the survival time graph as a method of showing why its important to properly secure a system first , please let us know that too .
Update 1100 UTC by Daniel Wesemann :
ISC reader Dr. Neal Krawetz deliberately exposed the management ports of several brands of cable modem / home router devices to the Internet to see if they would be compromised .
Within the week that the experiment lasted , none of them were .
Thorsten Holz from the German Honeynet Project wrote a very interesting blog entry , complete with statistics and graphs , in response to this ISC diary .

While the survival time measured varies quite a bit across methods used , pretty much all agree that placing an unpatched Windows computer directly onto the Internet in the hope that it downloads the patches faster than it gets exploited are odds that you would n't bet on in Vegas .
Using a NAT router and a correctly configured personal firewall is the way to go - both these measures help a lot to improve the odds in favor or your PC .
McCain asked about PNAC and 9/11 at town hall David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 10 , 2008
Print This Email This During a town hall event in Portsmouth , OH on Wednesday , John McCain was asked by a member of the audience whether his links to the parent organization of the Project for a New American Century explain why he has been reluctant to support calls for a new investigation of 9/11 .
The questioner began , " I was curious about a document .
Back in September of 2000 , the Project for a New American Century , or PNAC , whose members included Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Jeb Bush and Paul Wolfowitz , wrote a document entitled ' Rebuilding Americans Defenses . ' "
As McCain turned and paced away from him , the questioner continued , " In it , they state , quote , " The process of transformation , even if it bring revolutionary change , is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor . "
" Now , many Americans believe that that ' new Pearl Harbor ' event took place on 9/11 , " the questioner went on , as McCain grimaced slightly .
" And according to a recent New York Times and CBS News poll , 84 % of Americans believe that there were some criminal elements of our government involved in 9/11 . "
Calls of disapproval began to arise from the audience , but the questioner shot back , " Hold on ! " and continued asking McCain , " Can you tell us about your role as -- hold on -- as president of the ' New Citizen Project , ' founded in 1994 , which served as a chief fund - raising and parent organization to PNAC ?
And is this one of the factors that has made you so reluctant to support the victims ' family members and first responders who are begging for a new investigation into 9/11 ? "
The boos became louder at that point , and McCain grimaced again , turned his back and walked away , but the questioner insisted , " It 's a serious question . "
" I have a serious answer , sir , " McCain replied , " and that is that it was Joe Lieberman and I -- a Democrat -- that sponsored the legislation for the 9/11 Commission .
...
And very frankly , the administration was not , shall I say , enthusiastic about the establishment of that commission .
... I am proud of what the 9/11 Commission did .
I am proud that we have enacted many of the reforms ... that they recommended .
And I will stand by their recommendations and their conclusions , as will the overwhelming majority of Americans . "
" It 's a free country , " McCain concluded .
" You are free to disagree with their conclusions .
But I am proud to have been one of those who was , along with Joe Lieberman , responsible for the establishment of the 9/11 Commission . "

The Bohemian Grove and The Nuclear Weapons Industry : Some Connections
( Originally published in 1987 , information in this article is not current .
Contract information is not up to date , positions held by individuals have changed , some individuals named have died , and the status of some facilities has changed . )
The data used to compile this paper covers an eight year period and is incomplete .
It should not be assumed that all individuals named are present at the same time at the grove .
Who speaks to whom and about what is not known to the writer .
No attempt has been made to contact individuals named to confirm their attendance at the grove .
Positions and titles may not be current .
Several topics should be mentioned that this article does not deal with : uranium mining - the front end of the nuclear weapons industry , the health effects of radiation and the bomb , the strong historical role of the Bohemian Grove in the development of the United States ' nuclear weapons program , and the extensive accusations of fraud by weapons contractors .
Caspar Weinberger is a member of the club and is Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan who is also a member .
( The President does not attend while in office . )
Weinberger gave a speech at the grove in 1981 on the subject " Rearming America . "
Harold Brown is a club member and was Secretary of Defense for President Carter .
Brown was a former Director of the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory .
Charles Duncan in 1980 is listed as a guest of Harold Brown at the Grove .
Duncan was then head of the Department of Energy , the branch of the U.S. Government that makes nuclear bombs .
General Dynamics Corporation is primarily in the weapons business , building the Trident nuclear missile submarine , cruise missiles , and FB - 111 bombers .
In 1982 , 88 percent of General Dynamics net sales were to the U.S. Government .
In 1985 , General Dynamics was number two in Department of Defense contracts with $ 7,439,914,000 in sales .
In 1982 they were number one with about $ 5,891,000,000 .
In 1979 , David S. Lewis , General Dynamic 's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was listed as a guest of former General Dynamics Chairman Roger Lewis at the Grove .
Their camp was Owl 's Nest , one of over one hundred residence groupings inside the Grove .
Owl 's Nest is the camp Ronald Reagan belongs to .
General Dynamics Executive Vice President and Director Lester Crown was listed as a Grove guest in 1979 also .
The Crown family and their associates owned over 20 percent , more then 5,000,000 shares of General Dynamics stock according to the 1980 Corporate Data Exchange Profile .
Forbes magazine in 1986 estimated the Crown family fortune as over 1.3 billion dollars .
CEO David Lewis , who resigned not long ago in the wake of scandals , held more than 200,000 shares of stock .
General Dynamics Director Thomas G. Ayers , former Commonwealth Edison of Chicago Chairman , was on the 1981 guest list .
Rockwell International is a mainstay of the nuclear weapons industry .

Cuba took another leap away from Fidel Castro 's creaky egalitarian model yesterday when it swept away the wage restraints that have kept surgeons and taxi drivers on much the same salaries for the past 50 years .
The latest and most dramatic liberalisation by Raul Castro appears to be aimed at bringing to communist Cuba the Chinese - style economic reforms he admires so much .
But the move falls far short of the political reforms that Cubans , both inside and out of the country , long for .
The new wage policy is the latest change by President Castro , who officially took over on 24 February but has been running the country since July 2006 when his older brother , Fidel , 81 , suffered serious health problems .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Since February , Mr Castro , 77 , has allowed Cubans to buy personal computers and mobile phones , rent cars and even stay overnight in hotels previously only accessible to foreigners , provided they can afford it .
He has shaken up the economy to pay farmers better and ease the impact of the world food crisis .
He has commuted death sentences and released a handful of political prisoners .
But his secret police have also broken up meetings of dissidents .
The decision to scrap one of the fundamental pillars of socialism , in place for the past 50 years , was revealed in an eye - popping item in the Communist Party newspaper , Granma , yesterday .
In its deadpan style , Granma stated that " the socialist principle of distribution will be achieved wherein everyone earns in accordance with his contribution , in other words , pay in accordance with quality and quantity " .
In remarks that will be astonishing to generations who have grown up on a diet of hardline Communist Party doctrine , Carlos Mateu , the deputy Labour minister , said in the article : " This [ new ] salary system should be seen as a tool to help obtain better results in output and services .
" Generally , there has been a tendency for people to earn the same , and that egalitarianism is not helpful .
" That is something that we have to fix ... because if it is harmful to pay workers less than they deserve , it also is harmful to pay them what they have not earned . "
The decision may reflect a need to keep a lid on civil unrest in the country .
Food - price inflation has hit Cuba more than most , because so much of what the country consumes is imported .
The nation 's sugar industry is bankrupt and virtually all the chickens consumed in Cuba are imported from the United States
But by sweeping away wage restraints , the authorities may now have to contend with social tensions caused by inequalities .
The iron grip of the Communist Party over so many aspects of people 's lives remains in place , as do the privileges accorded to the party elite , a source of great resentment in the country .
The reforms could be risky , as the race for private wealth could unleash forces which prove too much for the Communist Party to contain .
The pace of change has been fast and furious since Mr Castro took over from his brother this year .
Last month the authorities even said they were ending restrictions on sex - change operations .
But while the changes have been popular , they are also seen as cosmetic , because Cubans are paid so badly .
The measure is part of the government 's policy to get the moribund economy on the move again .
The idea is to give people earning a typical salary of just $ 17 ( £ 8.75 ) a month an incentive to work hard and make money .
Cuban salaries are too low for families to survive on and are supplemented by a crude system of rationing .
Every Cuban family gets a single bar of soap a month , a portion of rice and " ground beef " that is more than 50 per cent soy .
The ration system has given the Communist Party tight control over families , but it is widely abused and open to corruption .
CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
Wondering how consumers are coping in such a troubled economy ?
Look at what 's selling instead of which sales are tanking .
As consumers muddle through all that is plaguing the U.S. economy , they have battened down the hatches and sharply shifted their spending habits , turning to money - saving options that run the gamut from transportation to health as they find ways to pay for dramatic increases in gasoline and food .
What emerges is a new paradigm of consumerism that some experts believe will live long after this economic crisis is resolved .
" Suddenly consumers are focused on buying what they have to have as opposed to buying what they want to have , " said Howard Davidowitz , chairman of Davidowitz & Associates , a New York - based retail consulting and investment - banking firm .
" This is a permanent change for Americans , who will face a declining standard of living over the next 20 years , " he added .
Consider this :
Truck and SUV sales are losing air as quickly as a popped tire but hybrids and fuel - efficient car sales are holding their own .
Sales of scooters , which can cover twice as much ground on a gallon of gasoline as America 's favorite Toyota Camry sedan , are gaining as fast as prices at the pump .
Sales at department and specialty stores have been in the dumps for many months .
But sales at drug stores and most deep - discount stores are in rally mode as more people opt for stores closer to home and those perceived as value giants .
Meanwhile , home - seamstress haven Jo-Ann Fabrics JAS , - 2.53 % delivered surprisingly strong first - quarter earnings after a stretch of dismal results , thanks in part to robust sales of sewing notions , quilting and craft items .
Same is true for Michael 's Arts and Crafts , suggesting that consumers are going back to the basics as they spend more time at home .
At the grocery store , the soaring costs for chicken , fresh strawberries and beans are leading consumers to the frozen - and canned - foods aisles where the prices are more palatable for a family of five .
Even Spam is making a comeback .
" This is impacting every single American right now , " said Dan Houston , president of Principal Financial .
" No one 's immune . "
Phil Rist , a principal at BIGresearch who has been appraising consumer attitudes and patterns for some time , agrees with Houston and has consumer surveys to back it up .
" Even the rich are bitching , " he said .
Yes , even the rich are joining the cut - the - corners club , according to a bevy of reports .
Take dining patterns :
When BIGresearch asked if they had cut down on going out for meals this year , 36.2 % of those with household incomes over $ 100,000 said they had -- a 13 percentage point jump from a year earlier .
A tightening up on restaurant meals from January through March of 2008 accounted for most of the increase .
The Food Marketing Institute recently reported that 83 % of consumers are eating home - cooked meals in , of all places , their own homes at least three times per week .
FMI also found that wealthier households are more apt these days to buy food to make at home than lower - income households that tend to pick up cheap burgers and fries at fast - food restaurants .
A spending freeze
The latest update of the Principal Financial Well - Being Index found that more Americans are pinching pennies when it comes to everyday spending .
Since April , 56 % of workers and 55 % of retirees told Principal that they have pared spending because of the economy 's woes .
That 's significantly more than workers , at 38 % , and retirees , at 32 % , who said the same thing only six months ago .
More than two - thirds of both groups said they 're forking over about $ 100 more a week on groceries compared with last year .
About half of both groups are eating out less and also stocking up on store or generic brands more often , while more than one - third of them are giving up convenience and premium items for cheaper alternatives .
Another one - third is stalking multiple stores in search of sales .
But what are they buying ?
According to Information Resources Inc. , which uses point - of - sales information on consumer products as a measure of shopping behavior as well as surveys to over 110,000 households , they 're forgoing fresh fruits and vegetables in favor of the frozen varieties because they 're cheaper .
Do n't confuse that with frozen prepared foods .
They 're shunning those to cook from scratch , but using the frozen vegetables , fruit and meats instead of the fresh products .
In the last year , sales volumes of frozen pizza fell 3 % while receipts for frozen dinners and entrees dropped 4 % .
Yet sales volumes of frozen vegetables were higher by 4 % while frozen poultry sales jumped 8 % .
Sales of Spam -- the shoulder - pork - in - the - can luncheon meat -- are up some 10 % amid a price hike and were a big contributor to parent company Hormel Foods ' HRL , - 0.91 % second - quarter profit growth .
" We 're still seeing very robust sales , " Chief Executive Jeff Ettinger said on the quarterly conference call of Spam and Hormel Compleats , " because I think the consumers in this environment are still seeing those as excellent values versus some of their alternative meal options . "
Over - the - counter treatment
Consumers are also turning to analgesics and cold medicines to treat ailments on their own rather than seek -- and pay for -- a doctor 's visit .
Sales of thermometers , for example , surged 8.3 % in the last year .
" We 're in a transformation from a real - live , in - your - face consumer perspective , " said Thom Blischok , president of IRI Consulting and Innovating .
" People wo n't stop using toilet paper , but they will stop using other products . "
Blischok sees three major consumers trends occurring that vary by income .
Those making under $ 50,000 a year are redefining what goes into their shopping carts , choosing hot dogs instead of steak .
" They 're finding ways to stretch the meal dollar by going back to just the essentials , " he said .
The mid-tier consumer in the $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 income range is " selectively deselecting " in what Blischok called a " substitution strategy . "
They 're choosing to buy cheaper wines and to swap out bottled water for tap with a purifier , he said .
Those earning $ 100,000 and above are doing something similar in what Blischok labeled " de- prioritizing . "
" These people are asking themselves , ' Do I really need a $ 100 bottle of wine ?
Would n't a $ 40 bottle do , ' " he said .
All income groups are also switching to " affordable indulgences , " he said .
Rather than opting out of something like , say , ice cream , many consumers will get a quart instead of a half gallon , or they 'll decide to buy coffee grounds to brew at home rather than buy Starbucks drinks daily .
In a recent IRI survey , 55 % of respondents said that they were buying smaller quantities of their favorite treats and 66 % said they were cutting back spending on groceries that were n't essential .
Among the more disconcerting findings in that survey was that one - third of consumers said they will buy fewer healthy products because they 're more expensive .
Forty - six percent of those were earning $ 35,000 or less .
Scooting ahead
Elsewhere , consumers are giving up their gas - guzzling cars for short - distance driving and jumping on scooters .
" Scooter sales are through the roof , " said Johnny Scheff who owns Motoworks Chicago .
Scooters , which are like super - bicycles with motors , can get anywhere from 60 miles to , some owners insist , 95 miles on a gallon of gas , depending on their size .
Scheff is already seeing sales triple what they were a year ago and expects scooter sales to make up 80 % of his business this year versus 20 % traditional motorcycles .
" My business has turned into a scooter shop overnight , " he said .
At Vespa , sales in May surged 105 % , according to Chief Executive Paolo Timoni , and are on track for a 40 % year - over - year increase .
He points to rising gas prices and the efficiency of the Vespa compared to an SUV or a truck as well as a capitulation of sorts among American consumers .
" They 're finally getting it , " he said .
" People have been using scooters in Europe for years and there was a stigma about it in the U.S .
That 's changed now with gas prices so high . "
Finally , consumer confidence sunk to a 16 - year trough in May , inflation expectations touched an all - time high and spending intentions were scaled back for most categories , according to the latest economic data .
But consumers ' plans to buy new TVs hit a fresh high , further underscoring their desire -- or plain need -- to find entertainment at home .
David Rosenberg , Merrill Lynch 's chief economist in North America , thinks nesting has become a trend .
" In order to get from point A to point B without spending $ 75 filling up the tank , households now seem bent on cocooning by staying home to watch television rather than drive to the local theater and shell out more than $ 11 to watch a film -- and an extra $ 5 to get there , " he said .

This week , Seoul has been playing host to a meeting of ministers from the Organisation For Economic Cooperation And Development ( OECD ) , focused on the expanding Internet economy .
The meeting is serving as a chance for many groups to have their say about what they'd like to see that future look like ; the Electronic Frontiers Foundation is one of the groups attending , and they 've worked with the OECD 's Trade Union Advisory Committee to craft a statement of principles ( PDF ) going by the name of the Seoul Declaration .
The statement is wide - ranging , but hits many of the issues that the EFF has promoted in the past : free expression , balanced intellectual property policies , and ' Net neutrality .
The meeting agenda focuses on how the growing Internet economy can influence social and economic development .
Items slated for discussion include the growth of a global online economy , how to tap into that to improve social and economic welfare , and the convergence of devices and content on the ' Net .
But the conference also focuses on less well - defined issues , such as how to ensure that the new capabilities are used in ways that promote privacy , security , and consumer protection .
It 's also serving as a venue for exchanging ideas on how to use the Internet to foster creativity and innovation .
With a broad remit like that as the backdrop , the Seoul Declaration covers a lot of ground in its three pages .
Some of the principles fit directly into the themes of the meeting , such as its support for transparent privacy protection policies .
Other sections focus on the concerns traditionally associated with the trade union organization that is introducing the declaration , such as an inclusive and diverse digital society and promotion of worker training and access .
There are also a few things that must have just seemed like generally good ideas , such as calling on the OECD to promote policies that lower the carbon footprint of the IT industry .
Still , roughly half of the points of the declaration , including the sections on transparent privacy policies and consumer protection , fit nicely into the major concerns of the EFF , which is attending the meeting and has helped craft the declaration .
The statement takes a strong stance on freedom of expression , stating , " We urge the OECD to defend freedom of expression and to oppose mandated filtering , censorship of Internet content , and criminalization of content that is protected under international freedom of expression standards . "
It calls for greater democracy in the Internet governance process , and promotes ' Net neutrality .
Two sections also focus on open access to information .
One calls for a balanced intellectual property policy , and calls on member states to endorse the guidance that the OECD has already crafted in this area .
The declaration takes a similar approach to the dissemination of scientific and academic knowledge , supporting existing OECD guidance ( PDF ) on fostering the exchange of public knowledge .
The declaration was to have been presented as the meeting wrapped up at noon US Eastern time today , and the EFF was hoping to have as many signatories on board as possible .

Food has become the new gold .
Investors weary of the real - estate bubble - burst have poured millions of dollars into grain futures .
This has succeeded in driving up prices even more .
Now we are witnessing a global panic as nations are waging a run on our wheat harvest .
Foreign investors have begun to stockpile wheat by placing orders on U.S. grain exchanges that are two or three times larger than normal .
This has led U.S. mills to place large orders in the fear that there would soon be no wheat left at all .
Asian countries have placed huge orders with little concern over how high the prices are going .
Grain prices are currently rising more in one day than they have in entire years .
Regardless of the price the grain is selling .
People need to eat .
Food prices are causing upset worldwide .
We are seeing an unprecedented wave of hunger rolling through the poorest nations of the world .
Between early 2005 and early 2008 prices rose 80 percent according to the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization .
So far , most of the increase is being absorbed by distributors and processors but consumers are feeling the pinch as well .
The world 's food supply and demand has grown into a situation of civil turmoil .
After violent riots in Port - au - Prince , Haitian Prime Minister Jacques - Édouard Alexis was forced to step down recently .
At least 14 countries have had food - related violence occur recently .
To control the unrest , some countries are digging deep to increase food subsidies .
The U.N. World Food Program has issued warnings of an alarming surge in hunger in areas such as North Korea and West Africa .
Wheat has now begun to moderate slightly as farmers rush to plant more wheat now that profits are rising .
Analysts predict that prices may come down possibly 30 percent in the next few months .
Even so , this would still leave prices up 45 percent .
Prices are not expected to go back down to where they were in early 2006 so this means that the world must accept the reality of more expensive food .
Countries that have driven up the food demand are now dealing with the cost of their own success -- rising prices .
China is trying to reassure its people by announcing reserve grain holdings of 30 to 40 percent of annual production , but fears persist .
There are widespread reports of grain hoarding .
In India , the government recently restricted all import duties on cooking oils and banned exports of non-basmati rice .
The impact in India is being felt the most among the poor .
Even in Japan , a country with a distinct aversion to genetically modified grains ; manufacturers are taking a risk by importing them for use in processed foods for the first time .
Inflation in the EU hit 3.6 percent in March , the highest rate since the euro was adopted almost ten years ago .
Food and oil prices are mostly to blame .
Back in the U.S. , consumers are reducing quality and increasing quantity if something can be purchased at a better unit price .
The root cause of price surges varies from crop to crop , but the crisis is being fueled largely by an unprecedented linkage of the food chain .
A big reason for higher wheat prices is the drought in Australia .
Wheat prices are also rising because U.S. farmers have been planting less or moving their wheat to less fertile ground .
This is due to the fact that they are planting more corn for biofuels .
At least a fifth and possibly as much as a quarter of the U.S. 2008 corn crop will be allocated for ethanol .
As food and fuel combine , it has given American farmers a huge opportunity for large profits after years of stable prices .
The global food trade never became the kind of well - organized process that made the price of manufactured goods such as electronics uniform around the world .
Where food has been concerned , subsidies designed to protect farmers have distorted the real price of food globally and prevented the market from normal price adjustments as global demand has risen .
If market forces had played a larger role in food trade perhaps the world would have had more time to adjust to the gradually rising prices .
As it stands now , higher food prices are here to stay .

Report : Guard , Reserves using hardware their grandfathers used David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The final report of the independent Commission on the National Guard and Reserves , released last week , warned that the United States is unprepared for natural disasters or terrorist attacks because the Guard and Reserves lack adequate training and equipment .
According to 13 News in Hampton Roads , VA , " The Commission on the Guard and Reserve says soldiers use hardware their grandfathers used , and that so much gear is in Iraq , nine out of ten units do not have what they need to do their jobs , so they cannot defend against a major attack here at home . "
Units are even less combat - ready now than they were a year ago , when the Commission reported that 88 % of units were unprepared for combat .
The report , which is the result of a comprehensive two - year study mandated by Congress , urges that " Congress and the Department of Defense must make major changes in laws , rules , regulations , personnel , and funding systems in order to sustain an operational reserve . "
Seeing " no reasonable alternative to the nation 's continuing increased reliance on its reserve components , " the Commission recommended that those components be upgraded to serve as a fully operational part of national defense .
However , it warned that the price tag would be high .
The Pentagon has already promised that the Guard and Reserves will get more up - to - date equipment .
However , that alone will not address the further strains that the war in Iraq has caused for the entire Armed Forces .
This video is from 13 News , WVEC Hampton Roads , broadcast February 7 , 2008 .

A new Transportation Security Agency ( TSA ) policy will block passengers from flying if they do not have proper ID , but only if they exhibit defiance .
Passengers who merely forgot to bring ID will still be permitted to fly , but will be subjected to a physical screening and enhanced baggage screening .
" Passengers that willfully refuse to provide identification at security checkpoint will be denied access to the secure area of airports .
This change will apply exclusively to individuals that simply refuse to provide any identification or assist transportation security officers in ascertaining their identity , " TSA said in a policy statement .
" This new procedure will not affect passengers that may have misplaced , lost or otherwise do not have ID but are cooperative with officers . "
Prior to enforcement of this policy , passengers without ID were still permitted to fly after undergoing the more invasive screening regardless of their attitude or their reason for not showing ID .
Security researcher Chris Soghoian sharply criticized the policy and argues that it fails to resolve properly the concerns he raised in a 2007 research paper which revealed that passengers without ID could circumvent no - fly list restrictions .
It will merely punish activists , he says , without improving security .
" With hundreds of millions of dollars having already been spent on the various no - fly lists , it is at least interesting to see that someone at TSA is now spending time on fixing the loopholes in the system .
The most glaring of this has long been the fact that passengers can refuse to show ( or claim to have forgotten ) their ID , " Soghoian wrote in a blog entry .
" TSA 's new rule , while perhaps motivated by a desire to beef up security , is significantly flawed .
Terrorists will lie , and claim to have lost their ID — while law - abiding citizens wishing to assert their rights will be hassled , and refused flight . "
Soghoian , whose house was raided by the FBI in 2006 after he published a proof - of - concept web application for making forged airline boarding passes , has long been a vocal critic of the TSA 's practices .
He made headlines earlier this year when he disclosed security vulnerabilities that he discovered in TSA 's traveler redress web site .
His report sparked a Senate investigation which also uncovered disturbing irregularities in the process used by TSA to award the contract for the site .
This is n't the first time that TSA ID policies have faced criticism and scrutiny .
The previous policy was challenged in court by Electronic Frontier Foundation cofounder John Gilmore .
At the time , the court supported the policy of allowing passengers to fly without ID if they underwent the full screening .
TSA claims that the function of the new policy is to " enhance the agency 's risk - based focus on people , not things , " but the entire approach lends strength to the arguments made by critics who say that the TSA peddles security theater rather than legitimate security .

PLX Kiwi is Scangauge ’s Big Brother
The Scangauge II ( and Scangauge before it ) has long been a necessary part of practicing EcoDriving effectively .
It ’s a neat device because it gives you instant feedback , which not only allows you to improve your driving , but also helps you implement various hypermiling tips most effectively .
However , Scangauge wo n’t have a total market share for much longer , as PLX Devices has released a new , and intriguing device called the Kiwi .
Like the Scangauge , the PLX Kiwi takes data from your car ’s OBDII diagnostics port .
This means that the device is plug and play , making it accessible to most drivers , but will only work on 1996 + vehicles .
All older cars ( like mine ) are out of luck .
Â
The Kiwi uses the data is collects to not only show you what fuel economy you ’re getting , but also to instruct you on how to get a few more MPGs .
This is the part that ’s really interesting , and the reason the device costs a steep $ 299 .
PLX ’s cute video can say more about how it works than I can , so check it out :
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgNPwB-auu4
The website claims that the average driver can save quite a bit of fuel .
In my experience , this is definitely true , though I do n’t know if the Kiwi is really necessary to do it .
Most people can realize these improvements without any instrumentation , though those of you looking for more profound savings will probably need instrumentation .
I ca n’t say yet whether it works or whether I would recommend it , but if you ’re motivated I think the purchase price could be recouped in gas savings , especially with gas looking to stay up above $ 4 / gallon .
You can bet PLX will be receiving an email from ecomodder as we look to test this thing out with both experienced EcoDrivers and complete newbs .

A reader writes :
Is it really so puzzling why lower middle class people go to church but have higher rates of abortion , illegitimacy , and divorce ?
Very often people who lack a quality are the ones who obsess ostentatiously about it .
That applies , not just to family virtue , but to many other traits -- intellect , culture , beauty , class , professional achievement .
People who insecure about possessing a quality compensate by displaying conspicuous signs that they have it .
A paralegal , for example , anxious about her class , will carry a Gucci handbag to try to show that she is rich and fashionable .
An aristocrat , living on inherited money earned four generations ago , is more confident and wears a favorite five year old jacket when she walks outside in the snow .
The same pattern applies to family virtue .
A liberal who lives in Boston and has been married to the same woman for twenty years has no need to proclaim his virtue ; it is evident in his own life .
The man from Alabama who has divorced and fathered a child out of wedlock is acutely conscious of his lack of virtue and is nervous about the impression it will give to other people .
He covers his soiled family life with the clean blanket of churchgoing and vocal participation in groups devoted to conservative causes .
But why does this lead to opposition to gay marriage , when gay marriage promotes the virtues of fidelity and stability ?
I strongly support gay marriage and believe that it promotes family virtue .
But if we are trying to explain ( but not excuse ) why the churchgoing divorcees oppose it , the answer is that they see homosexuality , married or not , as non-traditional .
The churchgoing divorcees are not asserting their family virtue , logically conceived , but their family virtue as traditionally defined .
It is the traditional definition of family virtue that prevails in the communities where the churchgoing divorcees are trying to ingratiate themselves , as a way to compensate for and cover their fractured family lives .
And while an argument can be made that gay marriage is compatible with tradition , gay marriage is not the same as that tradition , which has historically been bitterly bigoted and hostile towards homosexuality .

In the eyes of the military , it ’s a simple numbers game .
But the recruitment process for America ’s armed forces is changing , and so is the look , feel , and policy of the military itself .
According to national statistics , felony waivers for recruits have been doubling almost every year for the past several years .
Military.com reports :
“ The number of felony waivers granted by the Army grew from 411 in 2003 to 901 in 2006 , according to the Pentagon , or about one in 10 of the moral waivers approved that year .
Other misdemeanors – from petty theft or writing a bad check to some assaults – jumped from about 2,700 to more than 6,000 in 2006 , representing more than three - quarters of moral waivers granted by the Army .
Army and Defense Department officials defended the waiver program as a way to admit young people who had made a mistake but overcome past behavior . ”
Felony waivers consist of the worst elements , but there are also ‘ conduct waivers ’ for recruits who have had small issues on their records such as traffic tickets and minor drug offenses .
Conduct waivers for Army recruits rose from 8,129 in fiscal 2006 to 10,258 in fiscal 2007 .
For Marine Corps recruits , they increased from 16,969 to 17,413 .
“ In particular , the Army accepted more than double the number of applicants with convictions for felony crimes such as burglary , grand larceny and aggravated assault , rising from 249 to 511 , while the corresponding number for the Marines increased by two - thirds , from 208 to 350 .
The vast majority of such convictions stem from juvenile offenses .
Most involved theft , but a handful involved sexual assault and terrorist threats , and there were three cases of involuntary manslaughter . ”
The changing face of the military and increased use of felony waivers is even angering gays , who have already felt scorned for years because of the military ’s ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ policy .
Not only are recruits with felony waivers being signed up with the military , they ’re also promoted faster .
“ The Army study compared the performance of soldiers who came in with conduct waivers against those who did not during the years 2003 - 2006 .
In that time , 276,231 recruits enlisted in the Army with no prior military service .
Of those 6.5 percent , or nearly 18,000 had waivers .
In a comparison of both groups the study found that soldiers who had received waivers for bad behavior :
– Had a higher desertion rate ( 4.26 percent vs. 3.59 percent ) .
– Had a higher misconduct rate ( 5.95 percent vs. 3.55 percent ) .
– Had a higher rate of appearances before courts - martial ( 1 percent vs. 0.71 percent ) .
– Had a higher dropout rate for alcohol rehabilitation failure ( 0.27 percent vs. 0.12 percent ) .
But they also :
– Were more likely to re-enlist ( 28.48 percent vs. 26.76 percent ) .
– Got promoted faster to sergeant ( after 34.7 months vs. 39 months ) .
– Had a lower rate of dismissal for personality disorders ( 0.93 percent vs. 1.12 percent ) . ”
But this is all old hat .
Felony waivers , while on the rise , have been used for years .
It ’s just a matter of changing times , right ?
We used to hold our military to a higher moral standard , not only because of the deadly weapons of war the tax payer funds , but also because we send these boys and girls across the world to set an example to others as to how Americans behave .
But another aspect of the changing military , and one harder to justify , is the use of illegal aliens in the different branches of the armed forces .
Recruiters have been caught trying to enlist illegal aliens , but of course official military policy is to deny that illegal immigrants are targeted , because as of right now it ’s against policy to do so .
“ There are currently about 37,500 foreign nationals from over 200 countries serving in the active duty forces and reserves .
Seventy - one have died in Iraq and three in Afghanistan .
The law currently provides for expediting the citizenship applications of U.S. service personnel , who become eligible to apply the first day they enlist .
The presence of non-citizens in the U.S. armed forces dates back to the 18th century — “ more than 660,000 military veterans became citizens through naturalization between 1862 and 2000 , ” according to a report by the nonprofit CNA Corporation . ”
This ‘use but deny ’ policy strategy has been brought to light more so in the past year , especially with the DREAM ACT which was introduced in 2007 as part of the Amnesty Bill .
“ The Development , Relief , and Education for Alien Minors Act , or DREAM Act , is part of the stalled package of proposals that many in Congress are seeking to resurrect .
The proposal , applicable to an estimated 750,000 undocumented residents of military age , stipulates that those who arrived in the United States before age 16 , graduated from high school , and meet other qualifications could immediately enter the path to citizenship in exchange for at least two years ’ service in the armed forces . ”
Mexican citizen groups have also claimed that US recruiters have been seen near the border on enlistment drives .
“ According to Prensa Latina on Friday in Culiacan , the capital of the northern state Sinaloa , civil activist Ildefonso Ortiz Cabrera told reporters that US military officers use young men of Latin American origin to recruit for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Then there ’s this news report from Los Angeles that shows immigrants , some of which are admitted illegals , confessing to being approached by US recruiters .
There ’s also footage taken showing immigrant recruits training at the facility , which has grounds beside a mall in LA .
When the reporters are discovered by Marine officials , the immigrant recruits are shown running inside the complex to hide from the reporters ’ cameras .
It ’s easy to see tyranny in motion when the United States military openly hires felons , and goes against its own policy to also hire illegal aliens in return for citizenship and goodies .
The British Empire used foreign mercenaries for over 200 years in their reign .
Is this the example we want to follow ?
Uncle Sam used to look for the best and brightest , the few and the proud .
Now the Army is scraping the bottom of the barrel to fill replacement slots , that is until it can automate the whole thing and shut out all humans in return for robots and space based weapon platforms .
When the entire military is made of chrome and metal and terminator robots are manning death camps , the days of hired thugs and illegal aliens will seem like a wonderful trip down memory lane , as will be the idea of our once free Republic .

Elected representatives from Canada , the U.S. , and Mexico have agreed to a plan to introduce simultaneous legislation in an effort to stop the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) of North America .
This cross border cooperation will go a long way in further exposing the North American Union agenda .
In addition , legislators have agreed to launch a Task Force to renegotiate NAFTA that will be chaired by NDP Trade Critic Peter Julian .
It also includes U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur ( D - Ohio ) , the Honourable Yeidckol Polevnsky ( Senator of Mexico State and Vice - president of the Mexican Senate ) and the Honourable Victor Quintana ( Deputy of the State Chihuahua , Mexico ) .
This is all in an effort to overhaul NAFTA and make it a more fair trade deal .
Julian will also be working with Kaptur and Mike Michaud ( D - ME ) to try and defeat the Colombia Free Trade Agreement .
Julian said , “ The NDP has been campaigning across Canada to expose and stop the SPP .
We ’ve held over 20 public forums in more than twenty cities and a dozen more are being planned for the spring of 2008 .
These forums have been held to speak out on the grave concerns surrounding the SPP and to help ensure that Canadians from coast to coast to coast get informed and have their say .
This trinational initiative with colleagues from the U.S. and Mexico takes us to a new stage in our fight to stop the SPP . ”
Discontent towards NAFTA is festering in Mexico , which has seen huge protests by farmers .
Since 1994 , one quarter of the rural population of Mexico and two million jobs have left the country .
Mexican Senator Polevnsky said , “ It is indispensable that legislators from all three North American partner countries work together to design an alternative project that takes into account each nations sovereignty , environmental protection , economic competitiveness , migration , and labor rights . ”
With all this talk about renegotiating NAFTA , the U.S. ambassador to Canada , David Wilkins recently acknowledged that he believes that it is too important to do away with or make any dramatic changes to .
He pointed to the fact that , regardless who wins the American presidential election , NAFTA will stand .
The SPP is an expansion of NAFTA , and is essentially the framework for a North American Union .
On the heels of the next SPP Leader Summit that will be held in New Orleans on April 21 and 22 , opposition towards a North American Union is growing in Canada , the U.S. , and Mexico .
My Republican congressman , in the spirit of fully representative democracy , has discovered how to best serve his constituents :
Let ’em vote on what he ought to do .
Rep. John R. “ Randy ” Kuhl , R - N.Y. , has sent his constituents a franked , four - color mailer announcing the “ Fix Washington Project ” :
Congressman Kuhl wants to hear from you .
Between May 16th and July 18th , Congressman Kuhl is seeking your input and ideas regarding any federal issue .
Residents of the 29th district can e-mail , call or fax their ideas to the Congressman ’s office .
Once all of the ideas have been submitted , five will be chosen and posted on Rep .
Kuhl ’s website to allow his constituents to from the list of five .
The idea that gets the most votes will be introduced on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives .
[ emphasis in original ; press release ]
Rep .
Kuhl ’s mailing says , “ Now is the time to fix Washington . ”
Now ?
He ’s been in office for 43 months and he ’s just figured out now is the time ?
It ’s hardly surprising that Rep .
Kuhl is asking for legislative initiatives — he ’s had so few of his own .
According to the Library of Congress Thomas service , he has filed only 12 bills in the 110th Congress ; four have no co-sponsors and five have only one or two co-sponsors .
His bills seek to :
• support designation of a week as “ National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week . ” ( 84 co-sponsors )
• recognize the 100th anniversary of Glenn Curtiss ’s achievement of record - breaking speed and his contributions to the motorcycle and aircraft industries .
( 26 co-sponsors )
• support the goals and ideals of the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Walk . ( 1 co-sponsor )
• recognize the Canandaigua Veterans Affairs Medical Center on its 75th anniversary .
( 2 co-sponsors )
• amend title 38 , United States Code , to provide for an assured adequate level of funding for veterans health care .
( 2 co-sponsors )
• amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce the Federal excise tax on highway motor fuels when the weekly United States retail gasoline price , regular grade , is greater than $ 3.00 per gallon .
( 1 co-sponsor )
• authorize the United States Department of Energy to remediate the Western New York Nuclear Service Center in the Town of Ashford , New York , and dispose of nuclear waste .
( no co-sponsors )
• to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to evaluate the significance of the 1816 Farmington Quaker Meetinghouse located in Farmington , New York , and the suitability and feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System as part of Women ’s Rights National Historical Park , and for other purposes .
( 8 co-sponsors ) .
• provide for investment and protection of the Social Security surplus .
( no co-sponsors ) .
• offer an amendment numbered 114 printed in the Congressional Record to instruct the Comptroller General of the United States and the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a study concerning the land and sea travlers [ sic ] of the Western Hemisphere Travel Implementation Act.
( no co-sponsors ; amendment withdrawn )
• offer an amendment numbered 115 printed in the Congressional Record to instruct the Comptroller General of the United States and the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a study at the Northern Border .
( no co-sponsors ; amendment withdrawn ) .
Nine of his bills remain parked in committee .
This is the legislative record of my representative in Congress .
This is the congressman who wrote to me and his other constituents : “ Three - quarters of Americans think that Washington is on the wrong track .
I , like you , am tired of the partisan politics and games that only lead to additional frustration and yield zero results .
I need your help to fix Washington . ” [ emphasis in original ]
Representatives in Congress are paid $ 169,300 annually .
Their retirement and pension benefits are substantial .
They receive a Member ’s Representational Allowance for office expenses that reached between $ 1.2 and $ 1.4 million in 2005 .
They may buy or lease virtually any vehicle ( and the gasoline ’s included ) at taxpayer expense .
They receive significant health benefits .
They get to be addressed as “ Congressman ” or “ Congresswoman ” for the rest of their lives .
And people give them money .
In his federal fundraising career , Rep. Kuhl has pocketed $ 3,082,985 ( nearly 60 percent from PACs ) .
If he leaves office with money in the fundraising bank , so to speak , he retains control over the balance , as did retiring Rep. Thomas M. Reynolds .
Despite all these privileges — and responsibilities — as a congressman , Rep. Kuhl has reduced the American system of government to a reality game show .
And surely it ’s possible that he has plenty of inept company among his remaining 434 peers .
Rep .
Kuhl is standing for re-election in November against a strong Democratic challenger , Eric Massa , who lost by only 2.9 percentage points after the Republicans poured in several hundred thousand dollars in the waning weeks of the 2006 mid-terms to hold onto the seat .
Rep. Kuhl has an insignificant record of filing legislation .
He has shown little political independence , voting with the GOP majority virtually in lockstep .
And now he ’s asking for his constituents to do his thinking for him .
From his mailer :
If you ’ve ever wondered why Congress has n’t thought of something , now is your chance to finally get that idea into law .
Congress has n’t “ thought ” of something because too many members do so little significant , intellectually astute and honest thinking .
Rep .
Kuhl ’s mailer is evidence of such political folly .
Rep .
Kuhl ’s record of legislation probably typifies that of many , if not most , members of Congress .
Legislation of substance is rare , held at bay by divisive partisanship .
Rep .
Kuhl ’s latest , outrageous franked mailing ( “ This mailing was prepared , published and mailed at taxpayer expense ” ) is good reason for his constituents to indeed vote — on ousting him in November .
WASHINGTON
-- Lawmakers eager to curb speculation in oil markets got support Monday from witnesses who told a House subcommittee that oil prices could fall sharply if Congress put strict limits on trading in energy futures by investment banks , pension funds and other financial investors .
Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are aggressively exploring ways to rein in what they believe is excessive speculation driving skyrocketing oil prices .
" Speculators " in the oil futures market have become a prime target on Capitol Hill , as lawmakers look to respond to voter anxiety about soaring motor fuel prices .
A hearing Monday before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations highlighted fundamental disputes over the role of financial investors in the recent spike in oil prices .
Two signs on the doors leading from the visitors ' clubhouse at U.S. Cellular Field to the first - base dugout read , " NO BOTTLED WATER ON THE BENCH . "
What 's this ?
Athletes can't drink water ?
Even in the humid Chicago summers ?
Here 's the explanation I got :
Gatorade is Major League Baseball 's " official sports drink . "
So instructions were sent that no player could be seen drinking anything but Gatorade in the dugout .
Not even Aquafina , which is the " official water " of MLB .
Not even bottles of water with the labels removed .
White
Sox clubhouse personnel said if players take bottled water onto the bench , all the bottled water will be removed from the clubhouse as punishment .
So remember , the biggest threat to baseball is n't steroids or HGH or amphetamines or runaway ticket prices or four - hour games .
It 's water .

Mafia will steal millions of biometric identities , MPs warned
Plans for biometric identity cards and a national ID database will play into the hands of Mafia bosses , MPs have been warned .
Crime bosses would get hold of a person 's unique fingerprint data and capture his or her identity forever , said Ross Anderson , professor of security engineering at Cambridge University .
In evidence quoted by a new Commons report , he says : ' There is a fundamental security engineering problem with biometrics as opposed to the cryptographic keys in your chip and pin card .
Biometric identity cards could be less secure as your details , such as fingerprints , cannot be changed if they are stolen .
' Once your biometrics become compromised , you can not revoke them .
It is not practical to do eye or finger transplants .
' Once you start using biometrics on a very wide scale , for all sorts of everyday transactions , the Mafia will also have your biometrics .
' You do not know which shops are owned by the Mafia but if you end up having to put your fingerprint on the glass every time that you buy a can of Coke , sooner or later the Mafia will have the biometrics of millions of people . '
The powerful Commons ' Home Affairs Committee called on the Home Office to prepare ' contingency plans to be implemented in the event of a loss or theft of biometric information from its databases ' .
ID cards for British citizens will be introduced from next year .
They will be voluntary until the next Election , after which the Commons will vote on making them compulsory .
But David Cameron would scrap the project if he becomes Prime Minister .
A Home Office spokeswoman said : ' Biometric information will be encrypted from the moment a person is enrolled right through to the National Identity Register .
' Once on the register , they will be protected by the physical and technical controls that are in place .
' The biometrics store will be held at a very high security level as we understand the importance and risks around unauthorised exposure of biometrics . '

The enemies within humanity , the psychopaths in the shadows of power , are losing their quest for dominion over humanity and the world .
They are starting to run scared .
If we look to the cycles of human history the challenge has always been for the common people to live decent and prosperous lives despite the psychopathic elites relentless obsession with institutionalizing various forms of slavery , subjugation , murder and dominance to live in idle luxury at the commoners  expense .
A century ago , communications were limited to acoustic only performances and the telegraph .
Today , words , sounds and images can be delivered to the multitudes ; broadcast live on cable and satellite networks ; cut , spliced , reengineered and delivered instantaneously around the world to TVs , computers , ipods and iphones .
Huge advances have also been made in the areas of societal manipulation , mass mind control , political subterfuge , surveillance and war making .
With much avarice and arrogance , the elite has waged a covert war on humanity using all the modern tools at their disposal .
But they have gone too far and too fast this time , even as their multigenerational scheme moves closer to fruition .
Their blatant violations of everything decent people believe in have only served to awaken the resistance to their scheme .
All the fluoride in the water supply , all the neurotoxins in the food chain and all the incessant , multi-directional mind control programming from babyhood to retirement has not been able to overcome the indomitable human spirit .
We are winning .
Every transgression against humanity , individually and collectively , only strengthens our resolve and swells our ranks .
More and more people are no longer buying into their propaganda that the " conspiracy theorists " and " anti-government extremists " are kooks and nut cases and the government is here to help us .
The evidence is obvious and mounting that there is a conspiracy , the people no longer have a government that belongs to them , the Constitution is history and the economy is not what they are telling us it is .
Even with all the distracting entertainment , media misinformation programs and an abundant credit supply to provide our every consumptive indulgence , the flock is breaking out of the fence .
Bilderbergers forced from the shadows
The Bilderberg group , the conspirators forming the global elite have been flushed out of the shadows .
The relentless pursuit of the Bilderbergers by Jim Tucker , Alex Jones , Daniel Estulin and others has finally shone enough light on their dark planning sessions that they have had to publicly acknowledge their formerly disavowed existence .
They doubled their already massive security force for this years Chantilly , Virginia , Bilderberg meeting .
For the first time ever , the Bilderbergers issued a press release and a list of attendees , providing public acknowledgement that government leaders are meeting in secret with the globalists .
WE The People have forced them to provide the evidence that many of our top officials have violated the Logan Act , a federal felony and are in league with the global conspirators .
Fiat empire to crash ?
Ambrose Evans - Pritchard reports , " The Royal Bank of Scotland has advised clients to brace for a full - fledged crash in global stock and credit markets over the next three months as inflation paralyses the major central banks . "
This is not the first time financial doomsayers have been published .
Last falls imminent doom economic predictions have failed to fully manifest , but we are still feeling the pinch , especially at the gas pumps .
Will the festering economy turn into a systemic infection ?
In the short term WE lose from the likely chaos and calamity of global financial meltdown .
In the long term WE win by having humanity experience the fallacy and fraud of the Fiat Empire and finally learn the value and wisdom of the type of sound money mandated in Article One , Section Eight , Clause Five of the Federal Constitution .
Political power brokers busted The Nevada Republican Convention was shut down when the vote was going heavily in favor of Ron Paul .
This upset even McCain supporters because it was obviously unfair even to someone who would actually vote for John McCain .
We are winning because Nevadas Ron Paul contingent now has a quorum and can restart the convention with or without the party hacks that shut it down .
Similar shenanigans in the Washington State Republican Convention , with at least 165 documented procedural and rules violations showed even the party faithful how desperate and corrupt the party bosses have become .
The wave of the Ron Paul Revolution will continue to challenge the power elite .
We win when they violate the political process .
Oklahoman sovereignty ?
The Oklahoma State Legislature recently passed House Joint Resolution 1089 by a vote of 92 to 3 , which declares in part :
" THAT the State of Oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States .
" THAT this serves as Notice and Demand to the federal government , as our agent , to cease and desist , effective immediately , mandates that are beyond the scope of these constitutionally delegated powers . "
Idaho and several other states including Pennsylvania and Colorado passed similar measures back in the 90s , which so far has amounted to some fuzzy - wuzzy feel good words on the books .
Will Oklahoma actually do anything with their new law , like move the unconstitutional federal agencies out of their state , stop collecting federal gas taxes and stop taking federal monies ?
Regardless of the functional outcome , a vote of 92 to 3 shows that the federal psychopathocracy has lost much favor with the peoples representatives in Oklahoma .
Oklahoma is OK !
Impeachment
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio has filed a thirty - five count Articles of Impeachment to impeach President Bush , which is nt likely to go anywhere now that it is buried in a committee .
But Congress did have to endure a three - hour reading of the High Crimes and misdemeanors of the Commandeerer - in - Chief .
Last year , Kucinich led a charge to impeach vice - President Dick Cheney , a proper first step .
Kucinich has threatened to lay down a 60 - count Articles of Impeachment and take up eight hours on the floor of the Congress if his resolution is ignored .
Some of Kucinichs present charges include :  Misleading the American people and Congress to believe Iraq possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction , to manufacture a false case for war ;  Invading Iraq absent a Declaration of War ;  Falsifying accounts of U.S. Troop deaths and injuries for political purposes ;  Reckless misspending and waste of U.S. tax dollars in connection with Iraq and U.S. contractors ;  Illegal detention , torture , foreign rendition and imprisoning children ;  Supporting terrorist organizations within Iran , with the goal of overthrowing the Iranian Government ;  Creating secret laws ;  Violation of the Posse Comitatus Act ;  Spying on American citizens without a court - ordered warrant ;  Announcing the intent to violate laws with Signing Statements ;  Tampering with free and fair elections ;  Corruption of the administration of justice ;  Obstruction of the Investigation into the Attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Impeachment is a pale form of justice for those charges .
What is really needed are indictments at the world court for the primary members of the Bush administration , or better yet , extradition to an Islamic court with jurisdiction over actual crimes commited on their soil .
The end of petro-dominance ?
The Rockefeller clan began its American dynasty by supplying the commodities of war to the Union Army during the " Civil War . "
Soon thereafter the Rockefellers invested in the emerging petroleum market , quickly establishing a monopoly on what has become the lifeblood of the industrial age .
The control of oil is the control of nearly everything in our modern world .
Can they maintain their monopolistic lockdown of energy dominance ?
Numerous inventors have found solutions to the inefficient and polluting , petroleum - powered , piston engine .
Some have achieved fantastic results , like the Pogue Carburetor and GEET Technology , but failed to produce marketable products on a large scale , largely due to suppression from the oil cartel .
A few inventors have even met untimely demises .
The information age and the Internet have produced an unstoppable army of backyard tinkerers that the petro-clans Men - in - Black wont be able to keep up with .
Witness the emerging HHO revolution .
Not anything new , HHO or Browns Gas is simply electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen , which is then delivered , on demand , to your cars intake manifold .
Other complimentary systems can be added to further enhance results .
Newer vehicles need a special electronic unit to manage the oxygen sensors input to the cars computer .
Complete systems have been improving efficiency from 40 percent to over 100 percent .
Other catalytic processes like the PICC converter promise even greater results .
What has made the difference from a few suppressed inventors to a revolution ?
Information now travels at the speed and breadth of the Internet .
It s gotten out of the oiligarchys hands .
HHO systems and technology are easily within reach of savvy Americans with some basic tools and skills .
Watch this emerging industry spread like a wildfire burning $ 4 plus gasoline .
Beyond oil
Tesla Motors has begun delivering its first production Roadsters .
A Japanese company has invented an electric - powered car that runs entirely on water .
Genepax in Osaka , Japan , has demonstrated a car that uses a liter of any kind of water even salt water to drive for about an hour at a speed of 50 miles per hour .
That s about 200 MPG on water !
" The car will continue to run as long as you have a bottle of water to top it off from time to time , " said Genepax CEO Kiyoshi Hirasawa .
" It does not require you to build up an infrastructure to recharge your batteries , which is usually the case for most electric cars . "
Once the water is poured into the tank at the back of the car , the generator converts it to create electrical power .
Genepax said it had just applied for a patent and is hoping to collaborate with Japanese auto manufacturers in the future .
Desperate cover-up
How far will the demonizers and slanderers go to suppress the exposure of the criminal elements within the psychopathocracy ?
Radio talk show host Michael Reagan , stepson of the late President Reagan , recently called for the murder of political activist Mark Dice of The Resistance .
Dice has been mailing letters and DVDs to troops in Iraq with evidence that the events of 9/11 were an inside job and their deployment in Iraq is based on false pretexts .
Reagan said on the air : " Excuse me folks , I m going to say this .
We ought to find the people who are doing this , take them out and shoot them .
Really .
You take them out , they are traitors to this country , and shoot them .
You have a problem with that ?
Deal with it .
You shoot them .
You call them traitors , thats what they are , and you shoot them dead .
Ill pay for the bullets . "
Reagan added , " How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of a firing range .
Tie him to a post , dont blindfold him , let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice . "
Dice is demanding that Reagan be fired immediately .
" Calling for the murder of someone because you disagree with their political stance is absolutely unacceptable , un American , and possibly illegal , " says Dice of TheResistanceManifesto.com .
You can call Michael Reagans boss at 703-302-1000 to let them know you want Michael Reagan FIRED !
You can also complain to the FCC at 1 - 888 - CALL - FCC .
His death threats were aired Tuesday , June 10th during the second hour of the Michael Reagan Show .
Didnt we pass a PATRIOT
Act so that Americans could be free from the threat of terrorism ?
Isnt Michael Reagans conduct legally defined as terrorism and prohibited under the PATRIOT Act , perhaps even as a capital crime ?
Is the PATRIOT Act only for you and me , not the minions in the employ of the psychopathocracy ?
Such reactionary misconduct as Mr. Reagans only helps us win .
First he discredits himself , then he brings more attention to our cause so more people learn the facts and break free from their programming .
Liberty at the Liberty Bell ?
Michael Marcavage , director of the evangelistic organization " Repent America , " was recently convicted for exercising his free speech rights at the Liberty Bell Center in Philadelphia .
He was standing on a public sidewalk at the Independence Historical Park , preaching a message against abortion .
Marcavage was fined over $ 400 and prohibited from going to Independence National Historical Park or its sidewalks as a term of his one - year probation .
" Proclaim liberty throughout all the land " is the inscription on the Liberty Bell but a National Park Service Ranger demanded he move to a " free speech zone " some distance from the park , where he could continue preaching under the permission of a " verbal permit . "
Marcavage refused the " permit , " claiming the right of free speech .
Magistrate Judge Arnold Rapoport found Marcavage guilty of " interfering with agency functions " by violating the " verbal permit " he refused to accept .
When federal courts and agency enforcers so blatantly violate the First Amendment they prove WE have no Constitution left and WE win the war for the publics mind without even fighting it .
The YouTube revolution
Why are we winning ?
Because this is a war for our minds .
Our enemies have been laying down their program since before we were born .
Their techniques use an all encompassing , cradle to grave closed loop , with all the technology unlimited budgets can afford .
But WE have technology too .
The Internet , digital cameras , DVDs and YouTube provide us with the tools to crack the programmers  program .
Our media is emerging while theirs is fading .
Internet II
So what does the psychopathocracy plan to do to stop us ?
Shut down the Internet .
Paul Joseph Watson , of PrisonPlanet.com reports , " More than two years ago , in an article entitled , The End of the Internet ? , The Nation magazine reported , " The nations largest telephone and cable companies are crafting an alarming set of strategies that would transform the free , open and nondiscriminatory Internet of today to a privately - run and branded service that would charge a fee for virtually everything we do online .  "
Internet 2 , as it is being called , will track and store information on our every move in cyberspace in a vast data - collection and marketing system .
Watson continues , " One of the fathers of the Internet , David Clark , who served as chief protocol architect for the governments internet development initiative in the 1980s , has been given $ 200,000 by the National Science Foundation to covertly work on a whole new infrastructure to replace todays global network . 
" Clark has vowed to create a brave new world  in designing the new Internet , characterizing that he wanted the new network to be a coherent security architecture . 
" In an October 2006 speech , Homeland Security director Michael Chertoff identified the web as a terror training camp ,  through which disaffected people living in the United States  are developing radical ideologies and potentially violent skills . 
" Chertoff pledged to dispatch Homeland Security agents to local police departments in order to aid in the apprehension of domestic terrorists who use the Internet as a political tool . "
Do these imbeciles really think WE , the people of this world , will pay every time we visit a website , only to be tracked and recorded and fed a line of Homeland Gestapo B.S. ?
The absurdity of their proposition is a guaranteed win for WE the people !
Talk about crazy
One element of the federal government has instituted some responsible regulations for public safety , while the military side continues its reckless disregard for its own troops and every one around them .
SSRI drugs like Prozac and Zoloft have been demonstrated to induce suicidal and homicidal behavior in a percentage of the drugs users .
The FAA has recently banned the use of SSRI drugs by commercial pilots and air traffic controllers because of the associated risks .
However , it is reported that approximately 50 percent of the troops in Iraq are taking SSRI drugs to cope with the stress .
Suicide rates are substantially higher among Iraq war veterans and there have been numerous incidents of returning vets who have killed family members for no particular reason and occasionally without any mental recall of the event .
SSRI drugs can induce a certain type of seizure , impairing cognitive function and leading to suicidal and homicidal events .
The FAA has recognized this danger and responded to it while the military continues to be irresponsible .
The fallacy of the benefits of the pharmaceutical drug culture , its dangers and costs are being exposed by lawsuits and science .
The alternatives , including just plain avoidance , are becoming more popular .
The Pharma - cartel is losing on many fronts , in spite of its high dollar lawyers , lobbyists , advertising and campaign contributions .
They lose ; we win .
Ron Paul
We create customized treatment plans for each patient .
It all starts with a conversation to understand your goals and desired outcomes .
Four young residents of a North Philadelphia house who circulated petitions questioning police - surveillance cameras were rousted from their home Friday and detained 12 hours without charges while police searched their house .
Daniel Moffat , 28 , a co-owner of the house , said police had no warrant when they entered .
The house was examined by officials from several government agencies and then shuttered by the city 's Department of Licenses and Inspections .
" This leaves me homeless , without access to things I need .
My whole life is disrupted , " Moffat said yesterday .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Medicare is lurching toward disaster and it is too late for the Bush Administration and Congress to do anything about it , U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt said on Tuesday .
Beds lie empty in the emergency room of Tulane University Hospital in New Orleans February 14 , 2006 .

He said the next administration will have to act to stop rising costs and get control of the $ 400 billion federal health insurance plan for the elderly , which now covers 44 million people .
“ Higher and higher costs are being borne by fewer and fewer people .
Sooner or later , this formula implodes , ” Leavitt said in a speech to the right - leaning Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute think - tanks .
“ There is serious danger here , ” he added .
“ Medicare is drifting towards disaster . ”
Leavitt ’s speech echoes repeated warnings from other federal government officials who have noted that Medicare spending is projected to be 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 .
A separate report released on Tuesday from the National Cancer Institute estimated that Medicare spent $ 21 billion on cancer alone between 1999 and 2003 .
“ The disaster is not inevitable .
If we act now , we can change the outcome .
In health care , the core problem is that costs are rising significantly faster than costs in the economy as a whole , ” Leavitt said .
But the administration of President George W. Bush and the current Congress are out of time , Leavitt said .
“ So , given the strong possibility this wo n’t get fixed in the next 266 days , I would like to add some general advice on the creation of a political construct for action and a general strategy to solve the problem , ” Leavitt said , saying he was speaking as a Medicare Trustee and not as a government official .
Leavitt said paying for each medical action separately is wasteful and “ it often results in bad referral decisions , sloppy hand - offs , duplications , fraud , and poor quality of care .
The result is inappropriate care and unnecessary cost . ”
Last week the Government Accountability Office blamed HHS in part for this , saying the agency had not used its powers to force hospitals to provide better care and less waste .
“ It troubles me that this matter is not receiving more attention in the presidential candidates ’ discussions .
The next president will have to deal with this in significant part , ” he said .

Boy Dies After Parents
Tie Him to Tree Parents charged after allegedly tying son to a tree for two nights .
June 13 , 2008  --
A couple accused of tying their 13 - year - old son to a tree for two nights to punish him for disobedience has been charged with murder in his death , authorities said Friday .
Brice Brian McMillan , 41 , of Macclesfield , N.C. , told a deputy that the child was being disobedient and was forced to sleep outside Tuesday while tied to a tree , the sheriff 's office said .
The teenager was released Wednesday morning but again tied up that night for bad behavior , authorities said .
The boy was left tied to the tree until the following afternoon when his stepmother found him unresponsive , Sheriff James Knight said in a statement .
Dwight Jefferson , an emergency responder with Pinetops Rescue Squad who was first on the scene , said he did not know the cause of the child 's death .
" What we found was a 13 - year - old laying on the ground -- CPR being done by his father , " Jefferson said .
" Then we took over . "
Knight said the boy was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead .
It was not immediately clear what the couple used to allegedly tie up the boy .
McMillan and Sandra Elizabeth McMillan , 36 , also have been charged with felony child abuse .
Two other children at the home , ages 7 and 9 , have been placed in the custody of the Department of Social Services , authorities said .
They are being held in the Edgecombe County Detention Center under no bond .
The sheriff 's office said they did not know if the couple had an attorney .
Macclesfield is about 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) southeast of Rocky Mount .
Update | 7:50 p.m. : FARGO , N.D. –-
As a presidential candidate , Senator Barack Obama has not been known for holding an abundance of news conferences .
That was not the case here on Thursday , when he called two in a span of four hours .
So what prompted him to call a second afternoon session to talk specifically about Iraq ?
Mr. Obama was scrolling through news reports on his Blackberry – taking particular note of stories about his Iraq policy – when he told his advisers he wanted to better explain a statement he made earlier about continuing to “ refine my policies ” regarding a timeline for withdrawing troops from Iraq .
“ We ’re going to try this again , ” Mr. Obama said , standing behind a lectern that was hastily set up on the lawn of a park here .
“ Apparently I was n’t clear enough this morning on my position with respect to the war in Iraq . ”
In doing so , Mr. Obama illustrated the complexities surrounding Iraq policy and the presidential campaign .
After being a political beneficiary in the Democratic primary for being seen as the strongest anti-war candidate , many of the nuances that have long been tucked into Mr. Obama ’s policy have begun to emerge .
So does Mr. Obama still stand behind his proposed timeline to withdraw the majority of American combat troops in 16 months , at a pace of one or two a month ?
This morning , he answered the question like this :
“ My 16 - month timeline , if you examine everything that I ’ve said , was always premised on making sure that our troops were safe .
I said that based on the information that we had received from our commanders that one to two brigades a month could be pulled out safely , from a logistical perspective .
My guiding approach continues to be that we ’ve got to make sure that our troops are safe and that Iraq is stable .
I ’m going to continue to gather information to find out whether those conditions still hold . ”
In the afternoon , this is how he addressed the same topic :
“ I ’ve also said that I would be deliberate and careful in how we got out , that I would bring our troops home at a pace of one to two brigades per month and that pace would have our combat troops out in 16 months .
That position has not changed .
I have not equivocated on that position , I am not searching for maneuvering room with respect to that position . ”
Mr. Obama ’s positions on Iraq have never tilted as far left as many Democrats would have preferred – remember a debate last year when he declined to say specifically when troops would be out of Iraq ?
– his statements here provided the latest indication of the way changing circumstances in Iraq have added fresh challenges to keep anti-war supporters on his side while pursuing what he calls a responsible end to the war .
Mr. Obama is heading to Iraq this month .
He said he intended to collect new information from U.S. commanders on the ground and he would “ refine ” his policies accordingly .
But does that include the 16 - month timetable ?
Not specifically , he said , but it also could depend upon the number of troops needed to train Iraqi forces and fight terrorism .
“ There ’s been a major debate in terms of how we should structure training for Iraqi military and police .
What kinds of troop presences will we need in order for that to occur ? ” Mr. Obama said .
“ What kinds of troop presences do we need to have a counter terrorism strike force in Iraq that ensures that Al Qaeda does not regain a foothold there .
Those are all issues that obviously are going to be determined by the facts on the ground . ”
In the end , one of the biggest differences between Mr. Obama ’s first and second appearances in front of the cameras here on Thursday was his emphasis .
The first time , he did not include a line saying that he specifically intended to end the war .
By the time he returned for Take Two , that line was a prominent one .
“ Let me be as clear as I can be , I intend to end this war , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in and I will give them a new mission and that is to end this war – responsibly , deliberately , but decisively . ”
Original Post | 2:28 p.m. : FARGO , N.D. – Senator Barack Obama said Thursday the United States cannot sustain a long - term military presence in Iraq , but added that he would be open to “ refine my policies ” about a timeline for withdrawing troops after meeting with American military commanders during a trip to Iraq later this month .
Mr. Obama , whose popularity in the Democratic primary was built upon a sharp opposition to the war and an often - touted 16 - month gradual timetable for removing combat troops , dismissed suggestions that he was changing positions in the wake of reductions in violence in Iraq and a general election fight with Senator John McCain .
“ I ’ve always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability .
That assessment has not changed , ” he said .
“ And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground , I ’m sure I ’ll have more information and will continue to refine my policies . ”
As he arrived for a campaign stop in North Dakota , Mr. Obama told reporters on Thursday that he intended to conduct “ a thorough assessment ” of his Iraq policy during a forthcoming trip to the country .
He stressed that he has long called for a careful and responsible withdrawal of American forces , but he declined to offer a fresh endorsement of his plan to remove one to two combat brigades a month .
“ My 16 - month timeline , if you examine everything that I ’ve said , was always premised on making sure that our troops were safe , ” he said .
“ I said that based on the information that we had received from our commanders that one to two brigades a month could be pulled out safely , from a logistical perspective .
My guiding approach continues to be that we ’ve got to make sure that our troops are safe and that Iraq is stable . ”
He added , “ I ’m going to continue to gather information to find out whether those conditions still hold . ”
It ’s been more than two years since Mr. Obama has visited Iraq , which Republicans have used as a point of criticism .
After dismissing an invitation from Mr. McCain to visit Iraq together this summer as a “ political stunt , ” Mr. Obama began making preparations for his own trip to Iraq .
Dates of his visit have not been disclosed for security reasons , aides said , but his trip will be part of a Congressional delegation in his capacity as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
“ My job is to make sure that the strategic issues that we face , not just in Iraq , but in Afghanistan , Iran and Pakistan , ” Mr. Obama said , “ that those are all taken into account and dealt with in a way that enhances America ’s national security interests over the long term . ”
Update | 4:15 p.m. : Republicans seized on Mr. Obama ’s remarks , saying he was stepping away from the position he took in the Democratic primary campaign .
“ There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience , ” said Alex Conant , a spokesman for the Republican National Committee .
“ Obama ’s Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician . ”
Mr. Obama said such criticism was misguided , saying : “ My position has not changed , but keep in mind what that original position was .
I ’ve always said that I would listen to commanders on the ground . ”
Brian Rogers , a McCain spokesman , issued the following statement :
Who is Phil Gramm ?
You might have heard his recent statement that America is a “ nation of whiners ” about the economy .
He is a co-chair of McCain ’s presidential campaign and arguably his main economic advisor — McCain once called Gramm his “ financial guru ” .
So let ’s look at Gramm ’s economics :
Gramm was responsible for the “ Commodity Futures Modernization Act ” in 2000 , which unleashed risky new investment instruments ( which Warren Buffett called “ financial weapons of mass destruction ” ) that led to the Bear Stearns bailout and the current epidemic of mortgage foreclosures .
Enron CEO Ken Lay was chair of Phil Gramm ’s 1992 re-election campaign to the US Senate .
Gramm ’s wife was a director of Enron from 1993 to 2001 .
Gramm co-authored Reagan ’s first budget , which drastically cut Social Security benefits .
According to former official of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and current law professor Michael Greenberger “ Gramm has been a central player in two major economic crises — the credit crisis and the incredibly high price of energy . ”
So when Gramm tells you to stop whining , it is because you are getting in his way of becoming McCain ’s Secretary of the Treasury and costing you even more money .

FBI agents investigating government watchdog Scott Bloch have subpoenaed any records that would reveal whether concerns about the 2004 elections prompted him to clear Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice of ethics violations .
Bloch , the U.S. special counsel who investigates federal employee whistleblower complaints , found no merit to allegations that Rice , then President Bush ’s national security adviser , timed some of her trips to boost Bush ’s 2004 reelection campaign .
The FBI is investigating whether Bloch obstructed justice by destroying computer files to hinder an outside inquiry into allegations that he retaliated against employees who opposed his policies .
He ’s also suspected of making false statements to investigators .
FBI agents , who searched Bloch ’s office and home Tuesday , subpoenaed 17 of his current and former employees to appear before a federal grand jury and asked them to bring any documents related to possible tampering of records in the office ’s electronic investigative tracking system , McClatchy has learned .
Officials with knowledge of the investigation also told McClatchy that the FBI has subpoenaed records about the decision to assign Rice ’s case to an investigator .
The officials asked to remain anonymous because they were n’t authorized to discuss the investigation .

There has been a lot of controversy within the 9/11 Truth movement about this bold new novel , The Shell Game by , Steve Alten .
Some people passionately support it while others chastise the author for not including or coming to the conclusion of Inside Job .
While the Author sources and presents evidence of vast criminal activity by the US government in relation to the attacks on September 11th , 2001 he does seem more inclined towards the let it happen theory .
This has some within the Truth movement questioning Alten 's agenda for writing the book and why they should support it .
To those that are disappointed or suspicious of this book I can only ask that you set aside your bias for a few hours and read the book with different eyes .
Of course this book cannot stack up to the full story some would like to tell , but that is because the eyes of those storytellers are already open .
To new eyes , this story and its easy delivery has the potential to raise many questions in many minds that had never questioned before .
Imagine the blinds slowly opening upon a darkened room on a bright sunny morning .
Rays of truths that splinter behind the minds awakening eye  an undeniably new and unstoppable day has arrived .
That 's powerful .
Steve Alten effectively interjects solid facts that relate to many 9/11 crimes ( and other crimes ) within this administration  as well as other levels of government , while telling what he calls a ' cautionary tale ' .
Not only are these facts interspersed in the story , there are also multiple blistering quotes blatantly and heroically featured at the beginning of each chapter .
The references to September 11th , 2001 are used as a foundation of ' background precedents ' to help weave and move the story being told  which is the story of a coming Inside Job by way of a US government manufactured nuclear holocaust in LA .
The attack needed in order to begin an attack against Iran as the presented perpetrator .
. .
Sound familiar ?
The Shell Game is an excellent book .
Where I would normally describe a book this well formatted as an ' easy read ' , the gravity of the subject and the implications in the story are not easy .
With three Heroines and a Hero this important political thriller is laid out in digestible chapters that quickly pull the reader deeper down the rabbit hole leading him / her to some potentially gut wrenching conclusions about what we do n't know .
* Well done Steve Alten .
Congratulations on making the list , # 31 and climbing .

Obama vetting telco immunity foe Dodd in VP search Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama is considering picking Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) as his vice president , in a move that could calm rocky waters with the Democratic candidate 's progressive base .
Obama 's campaign has asked Dodd to turn over information as part of its VP vetting process , the Associated Press reported Friday .
" There 's been some inquiries , yeah , " Dodd said .
" They ask for a lot of stuff .
I 'll leave it there . "
The news came three days after Obama backtracked on his earlier promise to support a filibuster of a new surveillance law ; Dodd was instrumental in opposing the law , an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Dodd became something of a hero to progressive activists because of his efforts to fix the FISA law -- introducing an amendment to strip a telecom immunity provision and mounting a nearly 10 - hour filibuster that scuttled the bill in the Senate last year .
Once Dodd exited the primaries in January , many of his supporters seemed to back Obama , who echoed Dodd 's criticism of President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program and promised to vote against any bill that let the phone companies who facilitated it off the hook .
When Obama indicated he would break that promise , tens of thousands of his supporters organized on the candidate 's social networking site urging him to change his mind .
They were outraged when he refused .
Very few have indicated that they wo n't vote for Obama because of his FISA shift , but the seemingly politically motivated move has sapped some of the enthusiasm from Obama 's base .
Whether a Dodd spot on the ticket could fix that remains to be seen .
Dodd , 64 , could complement Obama in other ways , too .
A five - term senator , he has a lengthy foreign policy resume and is a fluent Spanish speaker with particular interest in Latin American affairs .
However , he recently has struggled with allegations he received discount mortgages from Countrywide , a key player in the subprime loan scandal ; Dodd chairs the Senate Banking Committee .
Obama has stoked speculation about his vice presidential search this week when he made an unscheduled apparent visit to one of his search committee members , Eric Holder , and traveled to New York with Caroline Kennedy , another search team member .
Dodd 's name has been absent from most speculation about who Obama would choose .
Amid speculation about potential vice presidential candidates , some have refused to comment while others have been coy .
On Wednesday , Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri shook her head and cut off a question about whether Obama or his team had asked her for documents to review .
" I 'm not going to talk about it , " she said .
Responding to the same question , Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius issued a statement , saying : " The decision and timetable for the best person to help Sen .
Obama lead the country is entirely up to him .
All of us who support Sen .
Obama have been asked to direct questions about his choice for vice president to the campaign . "
A few others indicated they had n't been approached , including Delaware Sen. Joe Biden .
He said he is not seeking the job but also indicated he could n't turn it down if asked .
Still , he said : " I made it clear to him and everybody else , I never worked for anybody in my life .
I got here when I was 29 .
I never had a boss .
I do n't know how I 'd handle it . "
Freshman Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado said he had not been approached .
Recently , others thought to be on Obama 's list have indicated they lack interest in the job .
Virginia Sen. Jim Webb issued a statement Monday that said he had told Obama he intended to remain in the Senate and " under no circumstances will I be a candidate for vice president . "
With wire reports
Conversation Victor and I had in the car :
Me : Oh my God , did you see the name of that cemetery ?
“ Resurrection Cemetery ” .
What a terrible name for a cemetery .
Victor :
It ’s because they believe in the resurrection of believers , dumbass .
Me : Still .
Some things just should n’t be resurrected .
Just what we need is a bunch of damn zombies wandering the earth .
Victor : Yeah , that ’s not “ resurrection ” .
That ’s “ reanimation ” .
Me : Same difference .
Although I guess “ Reanimation Cemetery ” would be slightly more disturbing .
Victor :
It ’s not the same difference .
Zombies are reanimated , but they do n’t have their previous mental capacity so it ’s not a resurrection .
Technically it ’s “ zombification ” .
Me :
Well if you want to get all technical , then how about vampires ?
Victor : Um … they ’re fine ?
Me : No . I mean , vampires have their “ previous mental capacity ” , thus by your logic they are resurrected .
They might as well name it “ Jesus - Is - Bringing - Back - Vampires Cemetery ” .
Victor :
It ’s not the same thing because when you resurrect someone from the grave they are n’t undead .
Me : No , they are TOTALLY undead .
That ’s like the very definition of the undead .
Victor : No . A vampire is undead .
The resurrected are n’t undead .
Me : I think you do n’t know what “ undead ” means .
Victor : I THINK YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT UNDEAD MEANS !
Me : God , calm down , Darwin .
Do n’t get all crazy just ’ cause I threw a vampire monkey - wrench in your faulty zombie logic .
Victor : * sigh * Look , there are all sorts of exceptions you are n’t considering .
You can reanimate someone without making them a “ zombie ” .
For example , you can just bring them back simply to perform a task .
Me. Yeah .
And that ’s called a zombie .
Victor :
No , because they would n’t crave brains .
They ’d just have a job to do .
Look it up .
Me : Oh I will look it up .
I ’ll look it up in “ The Dictionary Of Shit That Does n’t Exist ” .
Victor : * glower *
Me : I wonder if this is the weirdest fight we ’ve ever had .
Victor : Not even close .
Comment of the day : A quick google seach on resurrection and reanimation turned up that “ There is a difference between resurrection and resuscitation , or re-animation .
Resurrection refers to putting on a new , glorified body , while re-animation , or resuscitation , mean raising the person in the old , mortal body in which they died . ” ( ref )
So zombies are re-animated , vampires are undead , and Jesus and Meredith Grey were resurrected .
As for the comment I saw about zombies being made up – the brain - eating in films was made up , but they ’re based on voodoo , just like in other films such as Weekend at Bernie’s .
~ Cyniclite
Updated to add : I just realized Meredith Grey never got a glorified body , so she was just resuscitated .
I should have said Jesus and Robocop were resurrected .

Rep. Mucarsel - Powell discusses the urgent need to enact the Heroes Act
Back in April , Toyota announced that it would be gobbling up a larger percentage of Fuji Heavy Industries , makers of the Subaru brand of vehicles .
Today , that deal has been made official as Fuji announced the sale that increases Toyota 's voting rights in the automaker to 16.16 percent from 9.50 percent .
This deal had been made possible by a newly revised Japanese law that went into effect last year .
Toyota had initially purchased about nine - percent share of the company from General Motors , which no longer owns any part of Fuji Heavy .
According to reports , Toyota paid about a ten - percent premium for the increased share , as well .
Its total outlay of cash for the new shares is 31.11 billion yen ( $ 291.1 million ) , for which it receives 61 million additional treasury stocks .
Here 's hoping that this new deal ushers in the upcoming new AE86 all the more quickly .

Minyanville professor Adam Michael is commenting on the Geopolitics of Peak Oil .
Oil Price Sensitive to Geopolitics
A few weeks ago , I highlighted the fact that the US Government was topping off the strategic petroleum reserve at a time when oil prices were over $ 100 and during an election year .
I also mentioned that Vice President Cheney was in the Middle East at the end of March and I would add that President Bush met with Vladimir Putin just a few weeks ago .
Something did n’t smell right and based on the trading in crude in the past few weeks , we 're starting to understand why .
This week , we learned that the Israelis did in fact bomb a Syrian nuclear reactor last year and the United States in now claiming that the North Koreans were assisting the Syrians in their efforts .
Today , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff accused the Iranians of increasing its efforts to train and arm insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan and there are rumors of an American ship firing a warning shot at the Iranians .
Folks , the saber rattling is getting louder and its no wonder that crude is back to all - time highs .
I ’m not sure what the agenda is , but it does appear that the Bush administration is trying to 1 ) force a confrontation or 2 ) get everyone to the negotiating table .
This feels like high stakes poker to me .
The crude oil market has shown how sensitive it is to every little supply disruption .
There simply is not enough product to go around and demand has shown no sign of abating .
So how do you play the energy markets ?
I ’m not sure you do …sometimes it 's better to be on the sidelines .
Right now may be one of those times .
Crude Thoughts
Today we found out that the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Resource ( SPR ) rose to a record 700.9 million barrels , and is increasing at a rate of 62,000 barrels a day .
Why would the U.S. be increasing reserves with oil over $ 100 ?
The government ’s own Energy Information Agency projects crude to fall for the next two years , why would n’t the U.S. wait for lower prices to top off our SPR ?
It did n’t feel the need to keep filling after Katrina and oil was only $ 50 / barrel .
With gasoline at $ 4 / gallon , you would think the political forces would want oil down going into an election , not the other way around .
Perhaps there is something the government knows that we do not ???
I would also note that I have been hearing increased " Iran chatter " again .
All these rumors regarding Iran over the past year have proven false , but the fact that the US is increasing oil reserves has certainly got my attention , especially after Vice President Cheney was in the Middle East in the past few weeks where you would think lower oil prices would have been one of his objectives .
I would also note that President Bush is meeting with President Putin this weekend - I wonder what they will be discussing .
Something is not adding up here ...

Hey
Phun is my most favourite applications in the world .
It ’s the 2D physics sandbox that lets your really play around with physics in a fun way .
For a long while it was only available on Windows ( and I think Linux ) .
People were always asking when it would be released on Mac , and that date is finally here .
If you head over to Phun ( it might re-direct because of an error with the site ) you can download the application .
Open up the image and copy the application and supporting files into a new folder within your application .
You can then run the application and start playing with Physics .
The application is n’t set out like a normal app .
You do n’t have any of the little bits and bobs in the menu bar .
Instead everything is located within the window .
Your blocks and located on the left .
The world is located on screen , and the extra settings , such as play , are located at the top .
You can find more information about how to work the program in the tutorial section .
As I have mentioned many times before , this is a really fun application , you will spend hours on end playing about with motors , blocks , gravity , water and many other things to see how they work and interact within each other .
Its also a very good application , I think , to use within schools .
You can use the video below to get an idea of how it works .
Download the program , and like the best things in life it is free , mess around and see what you can come up with .
My favourite parts are playing with motors and firing things off into the distances .
As well as this making things that resemble cars is also great fun .

The " No Drill " Map
( CNSNews.com )
- Huge basins of untapped oil can be found on federal lands throughout the United States , according to a new report from the federal government .
But much of it cannot -- and may never be -- recovered , because it lies under national parks and national monuments , or it is subject to environmental laws and restrictions that make drilling prohibitive .
The report , which was produced at the request of Congress by the Department of Interior 's Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , said there are 279 million acres under federal management where oil and gas could potentially could be extracted .
More than half of it is totally off - limits to drillers .
" The total onshore resource is 31 billion barrels , " said BLM 's lead scientist Richard Watson , who authored the report .
" Of that , 19 billion barrels are currently inaccessible or 62 % .
A little over 2 billion barrels , or 8 % , is accessible under what we call standard lease terms . "
If you add in the 85.9 billion barrels of oil that lie offshore , as determined by the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , there are 117 billion barrels of oil on lands owned or managed by the U.S. government .
But all expansion of offshore oil recovery is currently off - limits .
Adding in what 's available on privately held land , the figure rises to 139 billion barrels of oil , according to the government - more than the known oil reserves of Iran , Iraq , Russia , Nigeria or Venezuela , respectively .
The biggest untapped land - based oil deposit in the United States lies within ANWR , the Artic National Wildlife Refuge , which is currently off - limits .
" We estimate there is something on the order of 7.7 billion barrels in that one area alone , " Watson said .
But setting aside Alaska , there is untapped oil on federal lands all across the United States , the government reported , with oil pockets found in Oregon , Washington state , Montana , Wyoming , Florida -- even in the Appalachian Mountains .
" In the lower 48 states , there are about 12 billion barrels onshore , " Watson noted .

Moped - Style Electic Scooters
Today , electric scooters or electric mopeds are just as powerful as their gasoline - powered counterparts , with the added advantage of being virtually silent , clean machines that can plug into a standard electrical socket to recharge .
Typically , a charge will give you enough juice to travel 20 - 60 miles , depending on the scooter and battery system .
Most scooter comes with lead - acid or nickle - metal hybrid ( NiMH ) batteries , but they can usually be upgraded to the more expensive lithium - ion batteries , which are lighter and last longer .
A scooter ’s top speed is usually limited or “ governed ” to 25 - 28 mph in the U.S. in order to be classified as a “ moped ” .

Squeezing some family fun between campaign stops , Sen. Barack Obama kicks a soccer ball to his 10 - year - old daughter Malia and , with a wink to a reporter on the sidelines , confides one of his wife Michelle ’s secret talents :
“ She is the best Hula - Hooper I know .
Once she gets the rhythm going , she can drop to her knees ! ”
And what about the Democratic presidential nominee ?
“ That is one thing you will never see – me Hula - Hooping .
I think that ’s clear . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Also clear :
That even on the campaign trail , this is a brood almost like any other , with set routines ( chores ! ) , boundaries ( $ 1 allowance ! ) and playtimes ( movie nights ! ) .
The Obamas opened up to PEOPLE – first , at the family ’s three - story home in Chicago in June , and again on July 4 , at a park in Butte , Mont. , where the family campaigned and celebrated Malia ’s birthday – about the task of raising two girls , including 7 - year - old Sasha , under the public eye .
PEOPLE : Someone told me today that you do n’t do birthday presents .
Michelle :
No , because we spend hundreds of dollars on a birthday party and movie tickets and pizza and popcorn …
Barack :
That sleepover is enough .
We want to teach some limits to them .
And their friends bring over presents .
Michelle :
They get so much stuff that it just becomes numbing .
Malia believes there is still a Santa Claus even though she ’s a little wary because some of her friends are non-believers .
But Malia says , “ Ma , I know there is a Santa because there ’s no way you ’d buy me all that stuff . ” [ Laughing ]
So what does a slumber party at the Obama house look like ?
Barack :
They ’re pretty noisy .
Michelle :
The older they get , they just talk a lot .
But they ’re at the age where they ’re pretty self - sufficient .
[ For Malia ’s birthday ] we ’re going to go swimming , see Wall - E , make pizzas , have sundaes .
Barack : I usually go for the swim but this time I want to go to the movie just because Wall - E has gotten great reviews .
I find actually that children ’s movies are the best movies these days .
But I ’ll probably , after that , peel off until the cake .
Michelle : [ Laughs ]
“ Peel off . ”
Do you give your girls an allowance ?
Michelle :
Sorta , kinda .
[ Laughs ]
Barack : I ’m out of town all the time , so Malia will say , “ Hey , you owe me 10 weeks ! ” …
Originally , we were giving her a dollar a week as long as she did all her chores .
It turns out that she ’s been doing her chores even without prompting from the allowance , which makes me feel guilty that she ’s been carrying on her end of the bargain and I have n’t been as consistent .
What types of chores ?
Barack : Setting the table , rinsing the dishes .
Michelle :
They have to clean up their half of the third floor where they play .
They have a closet of toys they have to clean up .
They have to practice their piano every day .
What does discipline look like in your house ?
Barack : Mommy raising her voice .
Michelle :
It ’s usually a lecture .
It ’s a lot of conversation .
Or it ’s separating them .
Or it ’s saying if you guys ca n’t decide nicely what program to watch , then you do n’t get to watch anything .
It ’s sort of pulling away a privilege .
But in all honesty , we do n’t have to discipline –
Barack :
If you ask them to do something , they ’re like any other kid …
Michelle :
They ’ll whine a little bit .
Barack :
They ’ll test boundaries .
But if you say , “ Guys , this is what we need to do … ”
Michelle :
An example of this is one night I was going out , I had to do a fund - raiser , and I told Malia , “ You guys really need to have an early bedtime because you ’ve got to get up tomorrow and have a busy day . ”
So my mom was there , and my mom does n’t adhere to bedtime .
She ’s kinda , “ Well , maybe you wanna start taking your bath … ”
But that night , she said she sat down to watch TV with them and they both got up , turned off the TV and left .
And my mom was like , “ Where are you going ? ”
And they said , “ We have got to go to bed early today , Grandma . ”
And they went downstairs , took their baths and went to bed , and my mom was just stunned .
In normal times , what ’s the division of labor at home between the two of you ?
Barack :
I was doing the checkbook , the house and car repairs , the grocery shopping .
Michelle :
That was a long time ago .
Barack : I would sometimes do the laundry – although not fold , I have to confess .
Michelle :
Which is really pretty useless .
Barack :
But clean clothes , that ’s something .
… I mean , look , I gotta be honest .
For the last 17 months I ’ve been on the road 98 percent of the time .
Michelle :
His job is to be there when requested .
Right now , it ’s important for him to be at parent - teacher conferences , piano recitals , things that are important to the girls .
It ’s less the household stuff because the household works ; it ’s more being there for them , which he has done an outstanding job at .
There are few things that he ’s missed that were important to them .
Last year , when we first met , Malia said that she sometimes wished maybe you would n’t win .
Do you think they still have those mixed feelings ?
Barack : I am absolutely certain because we ’ve talked about it – that they are not looking forward to moving .
They have a wonderful life in Chicago , they have lifelong friends in Chicago and the prospects of having to make new friends , that ’s never something that kids are looking forward to .
So I ’m sure that there ’s a part of them that says we wo n’t be heartbroken if things do n’t work out .
And if they said tomorrow , “ I do n’t want you to be President , I want you to be Daddy ” ?
Barack :
Well , so far those issues have n’t been mutually exclusive .
We talked about this before we started and Michelle and I monitor their attitudes pretty closely .
Michelle :
They ’ve been stable .
Their lives just have n’t changed that much .
Barack :
And our job , more than anything , is to make sure that in addition to monitoring whether or not they ’re feeling sad or neglected at all , that they ’re also not feeling special because their dad is running for President .
Michelle :
That ’s right .
Barack :
One of the things I ’ve been really happy about is how nonplussed they ’ve been by the whole thing .
They do n’t bring it up , they do n’t talk to their friends about it .
If anything , they ’re actually more courteous and more careful with other people now than they were before I ran .
Did you talk about that , their behavior in a fishbowl ?
Barack :
It was more just like making sure the same standards we set before we were in the public eye were maintained .
Michelle :
Be considerate of how other people might feel , you know , empathize .
Put yourself in the place of other people .
Barack :
And just never think that you ’re better than anybody else .
Or worse than anybody else .
Michelle :
That ’s also one of the reasons why we do n’t campaign with them a lot .
Because no matter what you do at a campaign setting , they are special , right ?
It ’s Fourth of July and everybody is singing “ Happy Birthday ” to Malia . …
And everybody loves the kids so they get special treatment .
That ’s nice for a day or two , but they need to go back home , just so they realize that this is n’t life .
Barack :
Which is good when they ’re doing activities like soccer .
Malia loves soccer , but she ’s still so tall and gangly compared to some of these little kids who are zipping around her , although she ’s getting better .
The fact that she ’s not good at everything right away – and Sasha ’s not good at everything right away – means learning lessons about having to work hard at something and improve .
How are you preparing them for possible life in the White House ?
Michelle : Slowly .
We talk to them about it as they are curious .
…
They ask about schools and making friends . …
Their anxiety has nothing to do with the White House ; it has everything to do with what kids think about : “ If I have to go to a new school , will I make friends and what about my old friendships ? ”
Can you tell me how this experience has changed your marriage ?
Barack :

Just following the plans
Last fall , I ran the Wide Finder Project .
The results were interesting , but incomplete ; it was a real shoestring operation .
I think this line of work is interesting , so I ’m restarting it .
I ’ve got a new computer and a new dataset , and anyone who ’s interested can play .
The Story Thus Far · I ’ll use this entry as a table - of - contents for the series as it grows .
The Problem ·
The problem is that lots of simple basic data - processing operations , in my case a simple Ruby script , run like crap on modern many - core processors .
Since the whole world is heading in the slower / many - core direction , this is an unsatisfactory situation .
If you look at the results from last time , it ’s obvious that there are solutions , but the ones we ’ve seen so far impose an awful complexity cost on the programmer .
The holy grail would be something that maximizes ratio of performance increase per core over programmer effort .
My view :
Anything that requires more than twice as much source code to take advantage of many - core is highly suspect .
Last Time & This Time ·
There were a few problems last time .
First , the disk was n’t big enough and the sample data was too small ( much smaller than the computer ’s memory ) .
Second , I could never get big Java programs to run properly on that system , something locked up and went weird .
Finally , when I had trouble compiling other people ’s code , I eventually ran out of patience and gave up .
One consequence is that no C or C++ candidates ever ran successfully .
This time , we have sample data that ’s larger than main memory and we have our own computer , and I ’ll be willing to give anyone who ’s seriously interested their own account to get on and fine - tune their own code .
The Set - Up ·
This time , the computer is a T2000 , with 8 cores and 32 threads .
It ’s actually slower ( well , fewer cores ) than the semi-pre - production T5120 I was working with last time , but it ’s got over 250G of pretty fast disks , which I ’ve built a ZFS pool and one filesystem on .
I ’ve also staged all the ongoing logfiles from February 2003 to April 2008 there , 45G of data in 218 million lines .
It ’s Internet - facing , with ssh access and port 80 open ( not that I ’m running a Web server yet ) .
Want to Join In ? · I ’ve set up a WideFinder Project Wiki .
The details of how to get started are there .
For now , anyone with a wikis.sun.com account can write to it , which I ’m hoping will be an adequate vandalism filter .
You really can't make this crap up .

A U.S. House committee chairman has begun an investigation into the electrocutions of at least 12 service members in Iraq , including that of a Pittsburgh soldier killed in January by a jolt of electricity while showering .
Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said Wednesday he has asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to hand over documents relating to the management of electrical systems at facilities in Iraq .
Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , 24 , died January 2 of cardiac arrest after being electrocuted while showering at his barracks in Baghdad .
WASHINGTON  Justice Department officials illegally used “ political or ideological ” factors in elite recruiting programs in recent years , tapping law school graduates with Federalist Society membership or other conservative credentials over more qualified candidates with liberal - sounding résumés , an internal report found Tuesday .
The report , prepared by the Justice Department ’s own inspector general and its ethics office , portrays a clumsy effort by senior Justice Department screeners to weed out candidates for career positions whom they considered “ leftists , ” using Internet search engines to look for incriminating information or evidence of possible liberal bias .
One rejected candidate from Harvard Law School worked for Planned Parenthood .
Another wrote opinion pieces critical of the USA Patriot Act and the nomination of Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court .
A third applicant worked for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and another posted an unflattering cartoon of President Bush on his MySpace page .
Another applicant , a student at the top of his class at Harvard who was fluent in Arabic , was relegated to the “ questionable ” pile because he was a member of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , a group that advocates civil liberties .
And another rejected candidate said in his essay that he was “ personally conflicted ” about the National Security Agency ’s program of wiretapping without warrants .
DIGG THIS
I may not be first , but I predict Ron Paul ’s new book The Revolution : A Manifesto will be a runaway best seller .
A frightening thing for the other candidates : they have n’t done their homework .
They will have nothing to offer at examination time when the American People ask : " What have You written lately — and how does it relate to restoring and protecting our Original Liberties and God- Given Rights ? "
They can cram if they wish , by reading some of Dr. Paul ’s other books .
Even if they cannot agree with anything in Dr. Paul ’s new book it may be a good idea for all of them to read it very carefully , because we will all have to deal with the principles sooner or later .
" Facts are stubborn things , " said John Adams .
What are they afraid of ?
What would be so terrible about returning America to the Rule of Law Under the Constitution ?
Would it be such a dreadful thing ?
Can it be done ?
Would it destroy the economy ?
How can we know ?
Truth is , the Constitution , though alien to the mindset of most Americans , is still the supreme Law of the Land . — Article VI , Clause 2 .
And we are wise to consult this Compass constantly to determine if we are on the right heading .
Are we moving away from the Constitution toward tyranny and despotism or are we moving toward the Constitution and the Liberty with Prosperity that would attend Lawful , Limited Government .
Shall we be ruled by an elite or governed by ourselves through our own written laws ?
" In free Governments the rulers are the servants , and the people their superiors & sovereigns . "
~ Benjamin Franklin
Dr. Paul is teaching us to read and learn our own Constitutions and Laws .
We have no king ; no dictator — and we acknowledge no human being as " Leader of the Free World [ an oxymoron ] "
You can check the Constitution and you will not find " Leader of the Free World " listed under the lawful duties of the President .
The relative length of Articles I , II , and III are worthy of consideration .
Article I is longer by far than the other two .
This is not for nothing .
It speaks of the limited powers we delegated to the Congress — and its powers include the authority to remove presidents and judges .
Think of this the next time you see some " arm twisting " or bullying tactics being used by the White House .
The Executive has no lawful powers but those granted by the Constitution and the laws made by the Congress in pursuance thereof .
It has no prerogative to invent new authorities or make war at pleasure .
The Supreme Court has no authorities outside of those granted .
It Cannot Make law .
And the Congress has the sole power to constitute tribunals [ courts ] inferior to the Supreme Court .
It wo n’t be a " cake walk " to get back to the beginning — and it will require a few intellectual " surges . "
Nevertheless , I fail to see why we should not at least consider it as an option .
I think it ’s easy to rule out the possibility of a presidential debate focusing on specific details of Constitutional Law or the United States Code .
Any opponents to Dr. Paul would be completely unarmed and defenseless in such a contest .
Thankfully we do n’t have to wait for the other candidates to enter the dialog .
They can lead , follow , or get out of the way .
While they all sleep — the Revolution reawakens .
As Dr. Paul is careful to point out , his " Revolution " is nothing more than a return to original principles and original intent .
Bring It On !
We should encourage a battle of books as the next stage in this campaign season .
This could be the beginning of a dynamic phenomenon in America politics .
What if Hillary , Obama , and McCain , or their ghost writers , decide to write books to combat Dr. Paul ’s new book , The Revolution : A Manifesto ?
If this causes Americans to read and compare , we may be entering a whole new era with an engaged American body politic that begins to raise its literacy and its expectations closer and closer to Constitutional levels .
They could wake up one morning expecting Liberty .
Just imagine , if the People , in great numbers , could once again grasp this : " A popular Government , without popular information , or the means of acquiring it , is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy ; or , perhaps both .
Knowledge will forever govern ignorance :
And a people who mean to be their own Governors , must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives [ emphasis added ] . "
~ James Madison
The Manifesto as a Catalyst
Dr. Paul , of all people , knows that his use of the word " Manifesto " in his title is controversial and will provoke discussion and comparisons to other Manifestoes as well as to the platforms of his opponents .
I can think of a handful that I have read .
These include , the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels , the Humanist Manifestoes I , II & III , as well the Christian Manifesto by the late Christian apologist Dr. Francis Schaeffer .
Rush Limbaugh wrote The Way Things Ought to Be , and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin wrote What Is To Be Done .
And who [ but the Republican Party ] could forget the Gingrich and his Contract with America ?
Some speak and write with the intent to ensure Life , Liberty and Happiness for their fellow man — to protect his life and property .
Others speak and write to deceive , manipulate , control and dominate .
Those who learn to read , compare , and practice critical thinking , can choose to support or oppose based on their own convictions and political philosophies .
Government by consent requires fully informed consent .
The reason Dr. Paul would win any battle of the manifestoes hands down is that he is all full of Constitutional solutions for American problems — and he can cite chapter and verse .
The others have no truck with the Founding Fathers and the Framers of the Constitution .
Therefore , the more Americans read and think , the closer we will be to a Ron Paul Administration .
And this is a phenomenon that could accelerate over the next few months , especially if it were combined with more " money bombs " and more fresh recruits for his volunteer army of internet super wonks .
It would seem that many of the most creative folks on the web are also liberty minded and incredibly intelligent and creative .
Let ’s not only predict this acceleration — let ’s instigate it — by promoting Dr. Paul ’s book .
Challenge your fellow citizens to read it .
Bring it up in every conversation .
Encourage them to compare all the candidates ’ words , writings and voting records .
Obviously , the free flow of information combined with increased literacy will tend toward a better - informed and free - thinking public .
This is the opposite of what the other candidates are counting on .
They rely on cheap tricks of all sorts — hoping they will be able to handle softball questions in rigged media events and fake debates — and get just the right one - liner or Willie Horton Moment to pull it out .
Substance is their archenemy .
Not so with Dr. Paul , who , like Jackie Chan , does all of his own stunts .
The Manifesto of 1848 would not conflict with the platforms of the other three major candidates .
They may or may not know how closely their platforms replicate Socialism / Communism .
But Karl Marx and Frederic Engels could be writing for both major parties today if they were alive — and most of the party faithful would n’t take note .
If you do n’t believe it , take some time and read the Ten Planks of the Communist Manifesto and compare them to the de facto government in these United States and the major - party platforms .
Property is taken by coercion and force to build the illusion of a workers ’ paradise while a powerful elite freely mixes egalitarian rhetoric with Institutionalized Grand Theft .
Someone [ it may have been Lenin ] said , " Communism is just Socialism in a hurry . "
Three major candidates are in a hurry in the direction of socialism and only one stands firm for Liberty and the Constitution .
The others should put all their plans in writing so that we can make complete comparisons .
By now I think many Americans are aware of the manipulative nature of the MSM as well as their tendency to work against Liberty and the Rule of Law .
Perhaps the MSM should also be compelled to explain why they tend to promote almost anything that works against Liberty and Freedom .
Which Manifesto would they prefer ?
And what about Academe ?
How many of their Neo -Marxes are pitching for the Ivy League ?
Between now and November please buy and read Dr. Paul ’s Manifesto .
Read it and compare it to Anything written or spoken by the other candidates .
Get everyone you know to read it .
If you are a neophyte [ and most of us are ] you can purchase the Elementary Catechism on the Constitution of the United States , written for children in 1828 , with a companion book I have compiled : The Bill of Rights — EXPOSED !
For a really comprehensive compendium of Americanism read The American Ideal of 1776 and compare it to Dr. Paul ’s book if you like .
I think you will be well pleased .
For a product to help you wash your own brain as you drive or work around the house we offer an audio CD of The Law by Bastiat .
The Truth is now made Manifest : Americans who are well informed and love Liberty have an opportunity , come next November , to Elect a True Patriot who Loves the Rule of Law !
Accept no imitations or substitutions .
There is Only One Major Candidate !
The Best of Bill Huff
Welcome
Helvetic Brands is an independent design consultancy that creates successful branding strategies based on international style principles .
Our approach is classical , relevant and adapted for tomorrow .
Within minutes , the formerly deadly intersection is secure .
In just a few years ' time , Lockheed Martin will start shipping the Mule to conflict hotspots .
The US Army has 1700 on order for 2014 .
About 15 Warfighter brigades will be equipped with the units , constituting a human to robot ratio of 29:1 .
Many will be used to clear minefields and carry gear , but half will be armed .
The Foster - Miller company fields something similar in the way of Armed Unmanned Ground Vehicles ( UGVs ) .
Three Swords robots - tracked devices the size of a chest of drawers fitted with light machine - guns - were tested in Iraq last summer by the US Army ( tinyurl.com /6bf47y ) .
The company is promoting a heavily armed version called Maars , which can be programmed to recognise no-fire zones ( tinyurl.com /qpn4n ) .
" The robot has n't fallen over once , " says David Byers , assistant program manager for the Mule .
" In fact , last summer in testing it was being used to pull soldiers out of a ditch . "
In the past five years , military use of robots has increased dramatically .
The US Army alone has fielded more than 6000 robots , many of them in Iraq and Afghanistan .
They are mostly used for reconnaissance and to disarm explosives , but there are regular news reports of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles performing missile strikes on insurgents they were monitoring .
" A lot has been learned from UAVs , " says David Chang at West Point Military Academy .
" UGVs are almost a decade behind UAVs in development and the technological challenges are far greater .
Picture the difference for a UAV at 20,000 feet with no obstacles and contrast that with a UGV , which must navigate in a dense urban environment .
Sensors , fusion of information , detecting negative obstacles and real - time control is imperative to ensure safety . "
Mr Byers says autonomous convoy experiments with the Mule , where the UGVs follow each other in a flocking pattern , have been going well .
" If the robot is lost , inertial navigation systems can put it out of harm 's way .
If the operator is taken out ( injured , killed or loses contact ) then control can be transferred to another authorised party . "
The reaction from the US Army has been overwhelmingly positive ( tinyurl.com /544nrt ) .
The British Army would not comment on whether it plans to use armed robots , but it already incorporates many of the unarmed models in its operations .
Stefan Kern , one of the organisers of the European Land Robot Trial , says : " The German Army is strongly investigating the use of unmanned ground vehicles , but armed robots are not the focus of this process .
Short - term realisable robots are the major challenge at the moment . "
But no one believes the robots will be completely autonomous any time soon .
" There are still challenges to be overcome in situational awareness and tactical behaviours .
When these units are eventually fielded , there will always be a human in the loop to make the tough decisions , " Mr Chang says .
Mr Byers agrees .
" There will always be a soldier involved , at least part - time , " he says .
In Australia , a company called Metal Storm has adapted the Packbot , produced by its US partner iRobot .
The Packbot is usually used to gather sensory data on dangerous locations and has been adapted into a semi-autonomous killing machine called the Warrior .
It can automatically fire at three targets in about 1.2seconds , selecting the appropriate munition for each target .
Stationary versions of Metal Storm weapons are already used for perimeter security .
According to Joe Dyer , of iRobot , the real benefit of the system is its resilience .
As he succinctly puts it : " A robot can shoot second . "
Don Nimblett , of Lockheed Martin is confident that army units with robotic capabilities will have a clear advantage over their enemies .
" Battlefield perception is much better with the robots , " he says .
" So the real advantage is in our situational understanding . "
You only have to watch the video of a Swords cruising into a potential combat zone , its gun turret rotating , to get the idea .
The only force outside the US with plans to deploy armed robots is the South Korean Army .
Last year Samsung announced it had built an armed sentry to be deployed at the border with its northern neighbour .
It is essentially a machine - gun turret without the manoeuvreability or firepower of its US rivals .
For now , the US Army has the clear advantage in armed robotics .
The technology it is developing gives them and their allies the ability to outmanoeuvre and outgun enemy combatants with unprecedented ease .
But wo n't that be unfair on human opponents who do n't have the US Army 's resources ?
Mr Byers is dismissive : " I hope it is unfair .
You should never go into a fair fight . "

I never gave much thought to what people thought when they learned I was a smoker .
I tried to make sure I only smoked in places where I was confident that my secondhand smoke would n’t phase anyone , and figured that it was my life and my body and no one had the right to tell me what I should and should n’t do .
To a certain extent , I still think that way .
But , when my brand new husband came home and announced that he ’d decided to become an ordained preacher and help people better understand their chosen religion , I realized that my smoking was n’t just my problem any longer .
At every church I ever attended , the preacher ’s wife was heavily involved in all of the activities .
In order for a community church to love my husband ’s work , they would have to accept me .
I also knew that if they sensed that in most parts of the country , a preacher ’s wife who smoked was going to have a difficult time finding acceptance .
I ’ve always been high strung and nervous .
Nicotine helps me calm down , especially during stressful times .
I really did n’t think I ’d reached the point in my life where I was ready to give it up .
So , instead of quitting nicotine , I simply gave up my standard cigarettes and started using V2 Vertx instead .
As far as I ’m concerned , it ’s been the perfect solution .
I found it on a site with the title V2 Vertx + Vertx Plus Review :: Read My Full Breakdown + Real E - Cig User Ratings if you ’re interested .
Although it is possible to go completely nicotine free with V2 Cigs , I prefer the vapor juice that has just a little bit of nicotine in it , which seems to be enough to help soothe my nerves .
I ’ve found that the vapor created by the V2 Cigs really does taste and feel like cigarette smoke .
What it does n’t have is the nasty smell that standard cigarettes produce .
I can use the vaporizer all day long and not have to worry about whether or not my husband ’s parishioners are offended by the smell of smoke .
Being a preacher ’s wife means that people tend to show up at my front door and want to talk .
Even if they catch me on a nicotine break , this is n’t a problem .
The V2 Cigs are battery operated , as soon as someone knocks on my door , I can shove the vaporizer into my pocket and not give it a second thought while I greet my visitor .
They ’re the same size as a regular cigarette so they can be easily slid into the pocket of anything , even the ridiculously tiny ones that have been built into skinny jeans .
For me , V2 Verx Cigs have been the perfect solution .
They allow me to continue to use nicotine to stay calm and relaxed , without having to worry about whether or not my habit is taking a toll on my husband ’s chosen career by offending some church members .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama and John McCain are now about tied in Gallup Poll Daily tracking of voter preferences for the general election , nevertheless , in a June 9 - 12 Gallup Poll , Obama leads McCain 52 % to 41 % in public perceptions of who will win in November .
Democrats are slightly more confident that their presumptive nominee will prevail in November -- 76 % say Obama will win -- than Republicans are about McCain 's chances ( 67 % ) .
What tips the balance of national opinion more strongly in favor of Obama is that , by a nine - percentage point margin , independents join Democrats in believing Obama is likely to win .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking of the presidential election over the same period as the June 9 - 12 Gallup Poll shows Obama beating McCain among registered voters in the East and West , while he roughly ties McCain in the Midwest and trails McCain by a substantial margin in the South .
Nevertheless , roughly half of voters in all four regions believe Obama is the more likely of the two to win .
Similarly , perceptions of Obama 's electability by age do n't exactly line up with his presidential support patterns across the same groups .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking spanning June 9 - 12 shows adults aged 18 to 34 to be his strongest support group , giving him a 24 - point lead over McCain , compared with a virtual tie between Obama and McCain among those aged 35 to 54 and a six - point lead for McCain among those 55 and older .
While one might expect younger Americans to be the most idealistic about the chances of the first black nominee for either major party winning the presidency , they are in fact the least likely to believe he will win .
Adults aged 18 to 34 are essentially divided between choosing Obama and McCain as the likely winner : 48 % predict an Obama win vs. 45 % for McCain .
By contrast , the majority of Americans 55 and older say Obama will win .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking shows women backing Obama over McCain , 50 % to 38 % , while men prefer McCain to Obama , 48 % to 42 % .
Nevertheless , both genders are more likely to believe Obama rather than McCain will win the election .
Bottom Line
They say perception becomes reality .
At this early stage of the general election campaign , perceptions of who can win are working in Obama 's favor , even among older generations of Americans and Southerners who are more likely to back McCain for the presidency .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 822 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted June 9 - 12 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking results on the Obama - McCain race are based on telephone interviews with 2,536 registered voters interviewed June 9-10 and June 12 , 2008 .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Diary from the middle of nowhere
BBC environment correspondent David Shukman reports on the plastic peril facing the remote Pacific atoll of Midway .
Plastic debris collects around the atoll , scene of a seminal World War II battle , with serious consequences for its wildlife .
FRIDAY 28 MARCH - THE BAG BATTLE OF MIDWAY
Time to hand over a gift from the other side of the world : a cloth carrier bag from the very distant town of Modbury in Devon .
Rebecca 's campaign links Midway to Devon 's Modbury
The connection behind this offering is the camerawoman Rebecca Hosking , who is from Modbury and came here to film on Midway two years ago .
She was so moved by the plight of the dying albatrosses that on her return to Devon she began a campaign against plastic waste which has gathered national momentum .
I 'm told the Modbury cloth bag will now feature in Midway 's visitor centre alongside the horrific array of plastic toys and cigarette lighters and toothbrushes found in the bellies of the seabirds .
On the subject of toys , thanks to those of you who 've offered suggestions for the identity of the much - travelled toy soldier I found during the beach clean - up .
One suggestion is that it 's Gigantor , a robot from a cartoon popular in Japan and the US back in the 60s ; another that it's a model of Ted Hughes ' Iron Giant .
Either way I 'm going to add many more miles to his voyaging because he 's staying in my pocket for the journey home , a battered reminder of the current threat to Midway .
I take a few moments for the echoes of Midway 's past .
I 'm shown the cinema built for the military in 1941 - it 's totally unchanged , a fabulously evocative period piece .
The walls are decorated with huge , original murals depicting scenes of wartime valour - hardy construction workers or daring beach assaults .
Midway has evidence of its battles past Valour of a different kind is needed now .
As the refuge manager , Barry Christenson , sees it , in World War Two the US forces had good intelligence on their enemy and a plan for how to respond .
By contrast , there 's now limited intelligence on the whereabouts of the plastic threat and no plan for a response at all .
So what 's the answer ?
He hopes that people will start to think about the consequences of their use of plastic .
That way , a bit less may end up killing the wildlife here .
I can't help thinking that this Battle of Midway will take a lot longer than the last one .
THURSDAY 27 MARCH - THE BEST AND WORST Midway 's story of beauty defiled casts a powerful spell .
I gather there is huge interest in our coverage .
At our vantage - point overlooking the ocean , I just finish a live broadcast for the Ten O'Clock News when the studio director comes on the line from London saying a friend of hers has seen our reports and wants to volunteer to join the plastic clean - up .
The colours are spectacular I have seen what seems to be the best and the worst of this place .
I am a bit colour blind but even I can tell that the colours of the lagoon are so ridiculously pure - even lurid - that we can't help calling out to each other to point them out .
In the clear light of morning , the first stirrings of the albatross chicks never fail to make me smile .
I swear that in the five days I 've been here I 've seen a few start to make their first steps and even shake out their misshapen wings .
Maybe it 's just that they are winning me over .
I find myself riveted by the ritual play of pairs or trios of the adolescent albatrosses - a dramatic bobbing of the heads , a beak tucked under one wing and then a spirited and synchronised trumpeting .
On board a launch there is a cry as someone spots the miraculous sight of spinning dolphins - they really do leap out of the water and hurl themselves around .
I catch sight of everyone grinning .
As we accelerate to what feels like an incredible speed , the dolphins playfully keep ahead of us .
It is as if they are performing for Rob Magee 's camera .
And then there is a far less showy community of humans here - earnest , committed , smiling .
They live in the shadow of Midway 's military past - whitewashed barracks and lots of concrete - but somehow create the delightful atmosphere of a hamlet with a real sense of purpose .
Which is just as well .
Because people here have to contend with Midway 's darker side - a plastic invasion that threatens to be overwhelming .
Every day or so brings more plastic waste - to the beaches , to the birds and to the outer reefs .
I visit one reef with John Klavitter , one of the experts here , and standing waist - deep in surprisingly cold water , he shows me how to cut the tough plastic of nets and ropes .
It is a horrible job because the fibres snag on the sharp twists of coral .
Without boots and gloves we would be cut to ribbons .
And despite hacking away for several minutes , it feels like we have hardly started .
I look up and wish I had n't noticed another load of netting on a rock next door .
We have severed so much plastic from the coral that the kayak we are loading threatens to capsize .
You need a pretty strong sense of morale to deal with a threat this big .
But Midway is such a precious place that , whatever the odds , no one talks of giving up the battle .

Advertisement WEDNESDAY 26 MARCH - THE PLASTIC LEGACY
Anyone missing this little toy , some kind of futuristic space warrior ?
I found it on a beach during a clean - up operation .
On an island far , far away ...
New ' battle of Midway '
One bird saved
It has a lot of miles under its belt - it must have travelled across a great tract of the Pacific Ocean to get here .
How do I know ?
Well , for one thing there are no children on Midway and have n't been for years .
Also , it was buried amid a vast tangle of fishing nets , bottles , computers , crates and baskets , all of which had drifted here on one of the world 's great ocean currents , the North Pacific Gyre .
Like something out of the film Toy Story , this little figure must have spent months at sea , surviving storms and maybe even being swallowed by an albatross and fed to a chick that then died .
Who knows ?
Maybe a child dropped it overboard during a holiday cruise .
Or it was chucked into the rubbish and somehow got swept into the sea .
Maybe a household in Japan or California was having a spring - clean and , with the children growing up , the toys were no longer wanted .
Any ideas ?
Please let me know .
Witnessing a beach clean - up is like peering into a darker side of our throwaway culture .
Scientists are looking at the long - term consequences Warning on plastic tide
The invisible threat
We talk about " throwing away " but in reality " away " can mean a place like Midway .
And the cost is grisly .
The island is littered with the bodies of albatrosses that have n't made it .
Their stomachs are brimming with plastic .
Brightly coloured , and similarly shaped to the birds ' much - loved diet of squid , the tiny plastic items we use every day often prove lethal .
Disposable cigarette lighters are a favourite .
Without even trying too hard , we collected 62 in a short stroll along the shore littered with dead birds .
I 'm not a smoker so I do n't know how long those lighters last before the fuel runs out .
A week or two ?
Well , their legacy is far , far longer .
Midway is stunningly beautiful and about as remote as you can get .
But look more closely at what 's lying in the sand and the outside world feels very close indeed .
TUESDAY MARCH 25 - LULLABY OF BIRDS ' LAND
You could set a great thriller on Midway ; Hitchcock would have loved it .
Incredibly isolated , thousands of miles from the nearest continent , this precious but tiny speck of land not only carries eerie reminders of the horrible costs of war , but also there 's one life - form that clearly dominates - the bird .
Here , the albatross is king
In pictures
Count the Laysan albatrosses , for example , and you reach nearly two million .
By contrast , count the human beings here and you do n't get much past 60 or 70 .
My arrival , with producer Mark Georgiou and cameraman Rob Magee , has added three more .
Everywhere we go , we are massively outnumbered .
There are albatrosses on every patch of grass , in every gap in the concrete laid in World War Two , even in the dusty potholes of the roads .
No surprise , but when the wind drops the air is heavy with a mild but unmistakeable whiff .
Spice of life
The sounds of Midway are more welcome .
In addition to the whistling and cries , there 's a loud rattling as the adolescent albatrosses clatter their beaks in play .
It 's a wonderful avian concert - though , being totally frank , to have any chance of sleeping through the rising volume of dawn I do need ear - plugs .
We humans are quiet by comparison .
Apart from the weekly flight from Honolulu , there 's only the odd rumble of the golf - buggies used to get around and the occasional crackle of a walkie - talkie .
Pollution is one more problem the birds could do without Life here is gently paced , and exceptionally friendly .
The US Fish and Wildlife Service runs things - long gone are the more muscular military days .
Now , no one passes without a wave or greeting .
We stay in the old officers ' quarters in a Cold War building , clean if austere , and our footsteps echo in the long whitewashed corridors .
Up a short path is a canteen where Thai contract staff serve up three good meals a day .
The head chef , Pong , urges me to try his spicy soups .
A little bar overlooking a beach opens most evenings .
Sunday night is bowling night in an alley left by the US Navy when it pulled out in the 1990s .
A stencilled military sign warns that anyone too obviously intoxicated will be refused service .
Another notice , overlooking the sea , recalls how Midway , just a hundred miles or so east of the International Date Line , used to be the last to host a service on Easter Sundays .
Conflict zone
This island is still shaped by its role in conflict .
It 's a constant battle to clean up the waste on Midway
A global problem
Two large guns flank a memorial to the epic battle in 1942 in the waters nearby when Japan 's superior fleet was suddenly , crushingly stopped in its tracks - a turning point in the entire war .
In those times , Midway was a vital military asset .
A channel was blasted through the coral reef , the island was enlarged to carry a longer runway , and many of the birds were killed to keep the flight paths clear .
Now Matt Brown , deputy manager of the Midway Atoll Wildlife Refuge , says we are the guests on the birds ' island .
When darkness falls , we 're urged to keep the lights down because the petrels here are nocturnal and I 've heard at least one of the confused birds slam into a brightly - lit window .
The albatrosses are settling for the night now , and everyone is careful to avoid them .
But from beyond these shores , mankind is the source of a very modern threat to these birds - plastic waste surging in with the tide .

What are these ?
Thomas L. Friedman Mr. Bush , Lead or Leave
It is hard to find the words to express what a fraudulent , pathetic excuse for an energy policy President Bushs new plan is .
The “ La Mente Bilingüe ” research team that doctor Itziar Laka leads in the Faculty of Arts at the University of the Basque Country analyses bilingual processing of language .
The aim is to find out how the brain acquires and manages languages and to discover in what way languages being similar or different is influential in this process .
In order to understand how we become fluent in a language and to better comprehend bilingualism , the La Mente Bilingüe ( “ the bilingual brain ” ) research team at the Faculty of Arts of the University of the Basque Country UPV / EHU analysed the acquisition process for languages .
As Doctor Itziar Laka , Director of the team , explained , “ language is not something that circulates out there somewhere ; although we have ways of representing it , language exists in the brain ” .
In October 2007 they began the BRAINGLOT project , focusing on bilingualism , in collaboration with numerous research teams and under the coordinating leadership of Dr. Nuria Sebastián from the University of Barcelona .
This project links neurosciences and linguistics and , within this , “ we respond to the questions most concerning linguistics :
How are languages organised in the brain ?
Does there exist some interchange of influences between them ?
Is it important that the languages are similar or not ?
When is a second language learnt ? ”
Acquisition of language
Despite much research on acquisition of languages amongst monolingual persons , scientists still have to ask themselves basic questions about bilingual acquisition :
How do babies realise that they are in a bilingual environment ?
What are the clues for them in discovering this ?
How is discrimination between languages produced in infants ?
“ We have just begun research in this line and working with children requires taking it slowly , the prior preparation period being very long ” , explained Ms Laka .
For the moment , work is being carried out with small children of four , five and six and the aim is to undertake the study with even younger children .
In fact , we start to be fluent in a language before birth ; if we wait for a child to say its first words in order to study the acquisition process for or the initiation of a language , it is too late ” .

The acquisition of languages amongst bilingual persons is a theme that is as complex as it is mysterious “ For example , if we analyse two syllables that sound the same with a machine that measures sound frequencies , we will see that they are not exactly the same ; so , how does the baby know it is hearing the same syllable ?
What is – for him or her – “ the same ” or “ different ” ?
The Mente Bilingüe team aims to respond to these questions by means of an experimental methodology and , to this end , the researchers are preparing specific material based on their investigations in the field of phonology .
Different ways of processing the language
“ We do not know how bilingual persons represent and manage their languages and it is in the monolingual situation that we understand the processing mechanisms better - bilingualism being much less understood ” , explained Ms Laka .
As regards the structure of the language , the order of words is a good example for studying bilingualism .
“ Basque has a free order of words , but something we linguists call neutral or canonical order exists , i.e. that which requires less effort from the brain ” , she explained .
According to the terminology of linguistic typology , Basque is a SOV ( subject - object - verb ) language , and Spanish or English are , on the other hand , SVO type .
In the Mente Bilingüe team we want to find answers to questions such as : “ For those persons whose mother language is Spanish and then learn Basque after the age of five , which of these typologies or word orders do they use in language processing ?
Do they use the same mechanisms for processing word order as do native Basque speakers who have subsequently learnt Spanish ? ”
The Mente Bilingüe researchers employ two methodologies , amongst others , to investigate the order of words : one analysed the behaviour of word order processing and the other the electrophysiology involved in the processing ( the electric signals produced in the brain ) .
This last technique is known as ERP ( Evoked Response Potential ) .
In the behavioural methodology the experimental individuals were sat in front of the computers of the Elebilab laboratory at the Faculty of Arts .

Either written or auditory cues were provided by the computers with sentences of various structures and the time measured for the individuals to read / listen and respond to the prompts .
“ For example , the brain needs much less time for processing the Basque sentence , ‘ otsoak ardiak jan ditu ’ ( the wolf has eaten the sheep ) than to understand ‘ ardiak otsoak jan ditu ’ ( the wolf has eaten the sheep ) , although both are grammatically correct ” .
The ERP technique is useful for analysing how we process the language .
The subjects wear a cap fitted with 60 electrodes , with the aim of measuring the electricity generated by the brain .
“ This is very valuable information for us as it enables us to measure with precision the effort made by the brain given certain structures ” , Dr Laka explained .
The first research work undertaken in the Basque Country using the ERP technique was published in 2006 by the member of Mente Bilingüe , Mr Kepa Erdozia .
Apart from questions of syntactic processing , they are also analysing the effect of age on the bilingual brain with respect to phonology , vocabulary and grammar , amongst other phenomena .
“ To date , we know the age of acquisition of a language influences the phonology , given that those learning a language at infancy do not have an accent when speaking ; those learning at an adult age may or may not ” , explained Ms Laka .
In the same way , it is well known that the age of acquisition of a language does not have an influence on vocabulary .
“ As regards grammar , our research shows that it should not be understood as a whole but that inside it there are some phenomena that do show effects of acquisition and others that do not ” , she added .
Bilingual control
The researchers at the University of Barcelona who have collaborated with the UPV / EHU team have concluded that highly proficient bilingual individuals and those less competent in one of their two languages do not employ the same mechanisms to change from one to the other .
Also , the fact of having to control two languages with frequency trains the brain and this training may slow down the loss of certain cognitive features that appear with ageing .
“ We are investigating to see if these effects found amongst bilingual persons who speak Catalan and Spanish are replicated in those who speak Basque and Spanish , in order to judge if the distance between languages has any effect ” , states Dr. Laka .
For scientists this is of great interest – analysing and comparing two bilingual populations who share one of their two languages .
Moreover , Catalan and Spanish are very similar syntactically , while Basque and Spanish are highly dissimilar in this respect .
As regards phonology , the reverse is the case , Spanish differs more from Catalan than it does from Basque .
Thanks to this , researchers can better distinguish the effects in the brain that distance has between languages .
There are places where I do n't exactly ... fit in .
Square peg , round hole .
The ballet , for example .
I do n't belong at the recital .
Or a trendy night club .
I hate it there .
Hate the music , hate the crowds of shallow people , hate the guy making eleven bucks an hour deciding who gets into the place , I just hate it .
Now , a day spa , that 's a whole other level fidgeting in my chair .
I 'm a barbershop guy .
I dig the old school hot lather , straight razor shave and a haircut .
( Two bits . )
In my shower is Head & Shoulders shampoo and Ivory soap .
That 's it .
No exfoliating lotions , no astringents , no facial masks .
Meat and potatoes .
Shampoo and soap .
I 'm a simple bloke .
An antonym of metrosexuality .
When I called in to book my spa treatment , I was told I could use a complimentary car service to get there .
I already felt uncomfortable with the whole situation and declined .
The subway will be fine .
Huge mistake .
In between 86th and 79th Streets , the 1 train stopped in the tunnel .
Then the lights dimmed .
Then the air conditioning shut off .
Then I think I had a stroke .
Twenty - two minutes later , I was on the move again .
My sweat glands were just as aggravated as I was .
They rebelled and sent forth torrents of anger .
By the time I got to the Dorit Baxter Day Spa on 57th Street , I was more than a little worse for wear and tear .
Alright , that is sugar - coating it .
I looked like hell .
Like Patrick Ewing in the second quarter of a playoff game .
Dripping .
Niagara freaking Falls .
I received a few odd looks and borderline stink - eyes from the spa staff until I explained my plight .
I think they thought I had swam there from New Jersey .
Friendly Mollye , part of the AXE staff hosting the event , sympathized with my ordeal and offered me a bucket of water .
" Do you have a trough that I can dunk my head in ?
That would be great .
" With three ice waters chugged , I sat down in the spa lobby .
I flashed on Henry Jones Sr. telling Indy , " My boy , we are pilgrims in an unholy land . "
It was a completely foreign environment to me .
Along the far wall was a group of padded chairs that had water basins and spigots where your feet would be .
That must be for pedicures , I thought .
There was a familiar sight on the wall in front of me , 60 - inch flat - screen television .
But ESPN was n't on it .
( sigh ... ) The telly was running a series of AXE ads on a loop .
One of the spots uses the word " undercarriage . "
Every time the word came up , I laughed .
Every time .
Undercarriage , that 's hilarious .
Solidarity .
That 's what I needed .
Some others with an Adam 's apple that were feeling as uncomfortable as I was .
I kept looking for another man , counting in my head , 11 , 12 , that 's 13 woman and me .
Ah , there 's anoth -- I stopped that thought .
There was another guy , but it did n't really count .
He was apparently in a Sean Hayes impression contest .
He had an over - the - top campy act going .
I 'm pretty sure his name was Sebastian .
Sebastian seemed more than comfortable in his spa issued robe .
As he flitted around the room , he was sipping on an dirty martini .
I swear .
There 's another guy .
Two more guys .
Okay , I feel better .
Another of the AXE gang , Katie in the green dress , came over to say that she spoke with the spa staff - and apparently told them that I was dripping sweat on the carpet - and sweetly said , " Johnny , if you would like to take a shower before your treatments , that would be okay .
" Yep , feeling real cool now .
" I'm fine . " I said .
I went into the restroom to towel off .
Sitting in the lobby area , I felt very self conscience .
Everyone seemed to be staring at me .
They knew I did n't belong there .
I felt like the stock broker at Yankee Stadium that is obviously there because his firm was given box seats .
It 's his first live sporting event , he looks uneasy , does n't know what 's going on in the game , he even looks awkward with a hot dog .
I felt like that guy .
So I went into my military style shoulder bag and pulled out my book .
I 'll just read while I 'm waiting .
That 's a good idea .
I 'll look less conspicuous .
The tome I had with me was a collection of essays from Hunter Thompson .
( " The Great Shark Hunt , " if you 're curious . )
I laughed to myself as I thought this was most likely the first time Hunter has ever been read in a day spa .
I think ole ' Raoul Duke , may he rest in peace , would have liked that .
Mollye walked over with my spa treatment " menu " to examine .
AXE has three new body washes that are coming out , and I was going to choose one of the three to give a test run .
I gave the menu a once over .
These were my choices of services ; I did like that the product to be used was called AXE Snake Peel Shower Scrub , but it did n't quite feel right .
Snake Peel , though , well done .
Points for a possible Beastie Boys reference , but still not the treatment that I was going to take out for a spin and kick the tires .
The procedure description started with , " Gym rats and tough guys ... "
I 've heard enough .
I 'll have that one .
Let 's butch this up a bit .
After changing into the spa issued robe , with only underpants on underneath and a pair of foam slippers on my feet , I was escorted down the long , narrow corridor of the spa .
The rooms were all named , with their titles painted on in turquoise .
Names like " Sage Brush " and " Sea Breeze . "
My room was named " Strawberry Fields . "
I took that as a good sign .
Standing in Strawberry Fields with my robe tied tight , the stranger who was about to scrub me down gave some instructions .
I felt bad that I did n't understand her that well .
( She spoke a little broken English , bless her heart ... )
The only phrase I deciphered was , " like a diaper . "
I sheepishly expressed confusion , so she demonstrated .
She took the cloth from the table and showed me how to tuck it in - between my legs , covering my bum and junk .
You know , like a diaper .
Then she told me to lay on the table when I was ready .
She stepped outside of Strawberry Fields .
I put on the diaper / cloth / thing - What in the swaddling clothes am I doing ? - and laid down .
For the next half hour , I was scrubbed tops to tails with one of AXE 's new body washes .
Now , here is where is AXE is smart .
I was being cleansed not with a sponge or a shower poof or whatever the hell you call those thingees , but with a " Shower Tool . "
A Tool. Brilliant .
Whoever came up with that spin deserves a raise .
Relaxing was difficult .
Being washed by a stranger has only happened to me six or seven other times .
( Long stories , you do n't want to hear them . )
In time , I was able to settle down and almost enjoy the process .
I 'd be lying if I said I was n't skeptical about the procedure going in .
How much difference could this treatment possibly make ?
But I 'll be damned if ten minutes in I did n't have a magical tingling sensation all over .
I felt clean .
It was different .
Interesting .
I think I felt " exfoliated , " but having never experienced that before , I 'm not quite sure .
After a thirty minute scrub , it was time to rinse off .
Diaper Lady told me to get into the shower , and a towel would be left for me when I was finished .
Okay , no worries .
Well , my scrubber was a little quick on the draw with the towel retrieval .
In she walked to Strawberry Fields right before I popped into the shower .
And , there 's my penis ... She said sorry over and over and left the towel .
I 'm not sure who was more embarrassed .
Alright , so far so good .
I walked down the hallway to another room when -- Hey Sebastian , having a good time ?
Of course you are .
He had another dirty martini in his hand .
He was loving it .
Next on the docket was the full body massage .
I 've only had a real massage one other time in my life .
When I was 17 - years - old on a Caribbean cruise ship .
Funny story ;
In international waters , you only have to be 18 to gamble .
I had scoped out the proceedings for a couple days - casing the joint like Danny Ocean - saw that the ship 's casino seemed pretty lax and thought I may as well take a shot .
The third night I went to the pit boss and gave this sob-story .
" Hey man , sorry to bother you , can you help me ?
I got pick - pocketed today in Cozumel .
They got everything .
Money , ID , Social Security Card , everything .
So , I can't prove I 'm 18 .
But I played here last night , she should remember me . "
I pointed to a cute blackjack dealer .
The pit boss said to her , " You remember this kid ?
You carded him last night ? "
I grinned slyly at my mark .
To this day , I do n't know why , but she backed up my story .
" Yeah , he played here last night .
I remember him . "
Wow , it worked .
" Okay kid , you can play .
Cash him in .
" I won big playing craps that night while my family slept soundly below decks .
As the night wound down and the sun began to peek over the Atlantic Ocean 's curved horizon , I took my winnings and got a massage .
( From an actual Swedish girl . )
I still do n't think my parents know this story .
The following day we were walking to dinner and an older gent that I had played dice with yelled out , " Hey kid !
Nice roll last night ! "
" What is he talking about , honey ? " I have no idea , Mom .
Not a clue .
Okay , back to my tale .
Only having one previous massage , I was a wee bit shaky on the etiquette .
I know ballpark , locker room , steak - house and pick - up basket ball etiquette .
Massage etiquette , not so much .
The kind masseuse , a pretty Jamaican girl , told me to " get undressed , " put a towel on , and lie down with my face in the hole .
You know what I mean .
Then she left to room .
Do I leave my Underoos on ?
I do , right ?
I can't go buck - booty - bare - assed - naked .
That 's not what she meant , is it ?
I figured it was much better to be wrong with underwear on than way wrong with underwear off .
I 'll play it safe .
Underpants are staying on .
I still do n't know if that was the correct interpretation of my instructions but I already had a penis incident on the books .
I was n't going to chalk up another one .
The lights dimmed and the massage started .
The music in the spa was what you would expect it to be .
Very new - agey .
Songs featuring dolphin noises , crashing waves and sitars .
There was an odd plinky version of Ennio Morricone 's " The Good , The Bad and The Ugly " theme .
A tad unsettling to be honest .
Then in the middle of nowhere , came " Level " by The Raconteurs .
It was almost as if the staff slipped the song into the rotation just to make me feel more at home .
During my massage I thought about Moe Green getting whacked in " The Godfather . "
It really is the perfect place to ice someone .
Halfway through , I was so relaxed that Nicky Santoro could have jammed an ice pick into my eye socket and I may not have minded .
With my massage done and feeling looser than Paris Hilton , I switched back into my regular clothes .
Coming out of the changing area , a sweet lady came over to greet me .
She asked me to have a seat and we chatted for a bit .
She asked how I enjoyed my experience and I told her how I have no business being here but actually did enjoy it .
She mentioned I looked much more relaxed now than when I staggered in off the street .
I then found out that she was Dorit , the owner of the spa .
So when I was told the manicure was next and she sat there smiling and encouraging me , how could I have said no ?
She was so charming I could n't decline for fear that I would offend .
It was like when you are completely full but your buddies mom puts more pot roast on your plate .
You better eat it , buster .
I took a deep breath .
" What the hell , " I 've come this far .
Bring on the manicure .
I was really unsure about this .
I sat down and - oh , hello Sebastian , enjoying your pedicure ?
Of course you are .
And another dirty martini I see .
Atta boy .
I sat down at the nail station .
( Is that what it 's called ?
I have n't the foggiest ...)
My nail technician looked at my hands for a minute or two .
I imagine that to her , someone that does nails in a posh spa all day , my hands must have looked like they were gnawed on by rabid squirrels .
The first move she made was to cut off a hangnail the size of a surfboard from my left thumb .
The big bastard made a thunk when dropped into the wastebasket below .
Katie reappeared and offered me a cocktail .
I 'm a teetotaler , do n't drink at all , so I asked for a Coke .
She brought me the beverage and asked if I wanted the straw left in .
" You know , with all this , I think the tiny red straw is a step too far .
A little much . "
Katie softly nodded in agreement and removed the straw .
Sebastian had three straws in his seventeenth dirty martini .
There I sat , nursing a Coca - Cola , having my nails reupholstered .
I could n't tell you what the liquids and concoctions were the girl was using .
Some had a rubbing alcohol smell , but they could have been Mountain Dew , I would n't have had any idea .
After a clipping and a pass with that sandpaper stick , the technician buffed my nails to a dull finish with what looked like a giant sugar - cube .
I do n't think it was a sugar - cube , but I can't be sure .
Nail Girl kept telling me to relax .
Over and over again , " Relax , relax your hands . "
I really think I am , love .
I 'm trying to relax , it 's the best I got .
" Can I do your cuticles ? " " Why not , " I said as I swallowed the last gulp of my Coke .
Why not .
The next instrument that came out appeared to be a miniature shoehorn .
It was dipped into another phantom liquid - it could have been barbeque sauce for all I know - and did ... something to my cuticles .
I 'm not sure what besides push them back .
Then she tore off some cotton batting , wound it on a bamboo shoot and rubbed another clear liquid on my fancy - looking fingernails .
Not a clue what was going on now .
I did n't ask any further questions .
" Would you like a clear polish ? " " That 's the same shade I got .
" Of course it is Sebastian .
" No thank you .
I think we 're done , " I said confidently .
A quick peak at my cheap Casio calculator wristwatch showed that it was 8:45 .
Game 4 of the NBA Finals starts in about half an hour .
" Time for your pedicure Johnny .
" I looked at my Casio again .
I looked at my nails .
Wow , those look good .
I looked at Sebastian .
I could n't do it .
If I missed Game 4 - which turned out to be an instant classic - to have my toes polished I 'd never be able to live with myself .
I politely passed on the pedicure , thanked my hosts for one of the oddest evenings of my life , and left the spa with my gift bag of AXE products in tow .
With the harsh commuting experience I had getting there , I decided to take the car service home .
As the Town Car made it 's way up Broadway to get me home , my Mum called .
I told her I was just leaving a day spa .
" Very funny , honey , what were you really doing ? "
I really was at a day spa , Mom .
Laughter was all I heard on the other end of the phone .
Uncontrollable laughter .
" YOU ?
At a day spa ?!? "
She may still be laughing .
Even my loving
Mum thought it was ridiculous that I had even stepped foot into the building .
What time is it ?
9:15 .
I 'll make tip - off .
Before I went home , I made damn sure I picked up a huge cheeseburger to eat during the game .
I had to balance this night out somehow .
Andrew Giuliani speaks with Tiger Woods at the Westchester Country Club during the 2001 Buick Classic .
Woods played with Andrew during the Pro-Am tournament .
( AP Photo / Kathy Willens ) A Loyal Reader has alerted us to the following lawsuit : Rudy Giuliani 's son , Andrew , has been kicked off the Duke University golf team and is suing to get back on .
The 22 - year - old aspiring pro golfer claims in a federal suit that Duke 's new golf coach trumped up a series of allegations to force him out and turn his classmates against him .
Here 's the scoop from Newsday ; and here 's the complaint .
" I ...
I made recently a short test with an eco-driving simulator .
By applying all eco-driving tips , a normal driver is able to reduce his energy consumption in an urban circuit from 7.3 l/100 km to 5 liters .
That means , at a price of 1.40 € per litre of gasoline and 15 000 km per year , that the driver is saving 500 € .
Let ’s imagine that the drivers would apply just some of the tips , we are still speaking of impressive savings , in money terms for the citizens and in CO2 emissions for the planet .
Eco -driving entails no investment , no need for sacrifice .
It is simply a matter of responsible behaviour , keeping in mind some principles when driving , which make sense and are beneficial in all respects : not only for our planet and economy , but also for our health and our safety .
One could ask :
Why do so few people eco -drive ?
The reply is quite obvious : because we have not been educated to do that !
Only recently are eco-driving principles really becoming part of the syllabus for obtaining a driver ’s licence .
That means that only new drivers have been taught to drive intelligently .
Save more than fuel
10 tips to help you drive more efﬁciently .
Keep your car well serviced and check the oil level regularly .
Correctly maintained cars can operate more efﬁciently and help reduce CO2 emissions .
Check your tyre pressure every month .
Under - inﬂated tyres can increase fuel consumption by up to 4 % .
Remove unnecessary weight from your boot or back seats .
The heavier the car , the harder the engine has to work and the more fuel it consumes .
Close your windows , especially at higher speeds , and remove empty roof racks .
This will reduce wind resistance and can lower your fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 10 % .
Use air conditioning only when necessary .
Unnecessary use increases fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 5 % .
Start driving soon after starting the engine and turn off the engine when stationary for more than one minute .
Modern engines enable you to just get in and go , thus reducing fuel consumption .
Drive at reasonable speeds and above all , drive smoothly .
Every time you accelerate or brake suddenly , your engine uses more fuel and produces more CO2 .
When accelerating , change up gears as early as possible .
Higher gears are more economical in terms of fuel consumption .
Try to anticipate traffic flow .
Look at the trafﬁc as far ahead as possible in order to avoid unnecessary stopping and starting within the ﬂow of trafﬁc .
Consider car sharing for work or leisure .
You will help reduce congestion and fuel consumption .
Together with Europia ( European Petroleum Industry Association ) the European Commission has launched a campaign to promote energy efficient driving .
Leaflets with a roll of tips that help drivers reducing their fuel consumption will be made available at filling stations all across Europe .
Some 45 000 stations will receive the leaflets in one the biggest public information campaign I can remember ( surely the biggest on Energy ) .
The press from the Comission anouncing the campaign can be read in full here Andris Piebalgs wrote in his blog about this “ intelligent driving ” : website was made promoting the campaign on - line .
Go there and click your flag of choice , you 'll be presented with some funny cartoons exemplifying the tips ( nice to send around to your friends perhaps ) .
Here are the 10 tips being promoted in the leaflet [ pdf 2.9 Mb ]
Following these tips will not likely have any impact on world oil prices , but they are one step that each EU citizen can take to ease the dependence on oil and at the same time diminish the economic backlash from high fuel costs .
Finally there 's a video worth watching on EUtube on the subject ( possibly good educational stuff too ) :
For the past two years , a mysterious disease has been wiping out honeybees in the US and Europe .
This catastrophe could have a devastating effect on our food supply : about a third of the human diet comes from insect - pollinated plants , and the honeybee is responsible for 80 % of that pollination .
This is how one should imagine a possible global catastrophe : no big bang , just a small - level interruption with devastating global consequences .
There is an air of mystery to this mass death .
Although the same thing is happening all over the developed world , local investigations point to different causes , such as the poisonous effects of pesticides , or the loss of the bees ' sense of spatial orientation caused by the electronic waves of our communication machines .
The multiplicity of causes makes their links with any effects uncertain , which invites the temptation to look for a deeper meaning and consider the so - called " spiritual ecology " : is a beehive not a kind of slave colony , a concentration camp where bees are ruthlessly exploited ?
What if Mother Earth is punishing us ?
The best antidote to this spiritualist temptation is to bear in mind the lesson of Donald Rumsfeld 's theory of knowledge - as expounded in March 2003 , when the then US defence secretary engaged in a little bit of amateur philosophising : " There are known knowns .
These are things we know that we know .
There are known unknowns .
That is to say , there are things that we know we do n't know .
But there are also unknown unknowns .
There are things we do n't know we do n't know . "
What Rumsfeld forgot to add was the crucial fourth term : the " unknown knowns " - things we do n't know that we know , all the unconscious beliefs and prejudices that determine how we perceive reality and intervene in it .
In the case of the disappearing bees , there are things we know that we know ( their vulnerability to pesticides ) and things we know that we do n't know ( say , how the bees react to human - caused radiations ) .
But there are , above all , the unknown unknowns and the unknown knowns .
There are dimensions of how bees interact with their environs which are not only unknown to us , but which we are not even aware of .
And there are many " unknown knowns " in our perception of bees : all the anthropocentric prejudices that spontaneously colour and bias our study of them .
The most unsettling aspect of such phenomena is the disturbance in yet another type of knowledge , in what the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan called " knowledge in the real " : the " instinctual " knowledge that regulates animal and plant activity .
This can run amok .
When winter is too warm , plants and animals misread the hot weather in February as the signal that spring has began and start to behave accordingly , thus not only rendering themselves vulnerable to late onslaughts of cold , but also perturbing the rhythm of natural reproduction .
Something of this kind is probably happening to bees .
We pride ourselves for living in a society in which we freely decide about things that matter .
However , we are constantly in the position of having to decide about matters that will fundamentally affect our lives , but without a proper foundation in knowledge .
This is frustrating : although we know that it all depends on us , we cannot predict the consequences of our acts .
We are not impotent but - quite the contrary - omnipotent , without being able to determine the scope of our powers .
While we cannot gain full mastery over our biosphere , it is in our power to derail it , to disturb its balance so that it will run amok , swiping us away in the process .

Canadian Industry Minister Jim Prentice introduced his answer to the American Digital Millennium Copyright Act today as planned , and it's even worse than the US DMCA .
The Canadian DMCA allows every single exception to copyright to be eliminated by adding DRM : whatever the law allows you to do , a corporation can take away , just by using DRM to prevent you from doing it .
Breaking DRM is illegal , unless you fit into a tiny , narrow , useless exception for security research .
It used to be that Parliament got to write copyright law .
Now , it 's Hollywood companies , who get to overrule Parliamentary law with whatever " business rules " they put in their DRM .
Michael Geist has the depressing analysis .
Makes me want to cry .
Watch this space for tips on getting in touch with your MP to make sure that this farce dies in Parliament .
1 . As expected , Prentice has provided a series of attention - grabbing provisions to consumers including time shifting , private copying of music ( transfering a song to your iPod ) , and format shifting ( changing format from analog to digital ) .
These are good provisions that did not exist in the delayed December bill .
However , check the fine print since the rules are subject to a host of strict limitations and , more importantly , undermined by the digital lock provisions .
The effect of the digital lock provisions is to render these rights virtually meaningless in the digital environment because anything that is locked down ( ie. copy - controlled CD , no - copy mandate on a digital television broadcast ) cannot be copied .
As for every day activities like transferring a DVD to your iPod – those are infringing too .
Indeed , the law makes it an infringement to circumvent the locks for these purposes .
2 . The digital lock provisions are worse than the DMCA .
Yes – worse .
The law creates a blanket prohibition on circumvention with very limited exceptions and creates a ban against distributing the tools that can be used to circumvent .
While Prentice could have adopted a more balanced approach ( as New Zealand and Canada 's Bill C - 60 did ) , the effect of these provisions will be to make Canadians infringers for a host of activities that are common today including watching out - of - region - coded DVDs , copying and pasting materials from a DRM'd book , or even unlocking a cellphone .
The liability for picking the digital lock is up to $ 20,000 per infringement .
While that is the similar to the U.S. law , the exceptions are worse .
The Canadian law includes a few limited exceptions for privacy , encryption research , interoperable computer programs , people with sight disabilities , and security , yet Canadians can't actually use these exceptions since the tools needed to pick the digital lock in order to protect their privacy are banned .
In other words , check the fine print again – you can protect your privacy but the tools to do so are now illegal .
Dig deeper and it gets worse .
Under the U.S. law , there is mandatory review process every three years to identify new exceptions .
Under the Canadian law , its up to the government to introduce new exceptions if it thinks it is needed .
Overall , these anti-circumvention provisions go far beyond what is needed to comply with the WIPO Internet treaties and represents an astonishing abdication of the principles of copyright balance that have guided Canadian policy for many years .

The White House supports rescinding the pay cut , but objects to the way the legislation would finance the plan , largely by reducing spending on private health plans .
Both chambers of Congress are expected to move quickly to try to override the veto , beginning with the House .
" I support the primary objective of this legislation , to forestall reductions in physician payments , " Bush said in a statement .
" Yet taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians is wrong . "
Lawmakers are under pressure from doctors and the elderly patients they serve to void the rate cut , which kicked in on July 1 .
The cut is based on a formula that establishes lower reimbursement rates when Medicare spending levels exceed established targets .
Instead of a cut , the legislation would freeze rates for 2008 and would increase them by 1.1 % in 2009 .
The legislation generates the revenue necessary to pay doctors more by reducing spending on private health insurance plans .
Those plans serve more than 9 million people through the Medicare Advantage program .
Insurers and the Bush administration argued that the changes lawmakers sought will lead to benefit cuts and to fewer Medicare Advantage plans .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that over the course of five years , enrollment in Medicare Advantage will grow to 12 million rather than to 14.3 million .
However , Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans believe that the government 's payments to the plans are too generous and that those payments drive up costs for the taxpayer as well as all 44 million participants in the program .
While the focus on the bill has largely been on changes for doctors and private insurers , virtually every type of health care provider as well as millions of patients have a stake in the legislation .
For consumers , lawmakers lowered the copayments for mental health treatment and allowed more people to qualify for the government 's help in paying their monthly premiums .
For providers , such as pharmacists , the legislation ensured that they 're paid promptly by Medicare drug plans , and also delayed changes that would have cut their reimbursements when dispensing generic drugs for Medicaid patients .

A British tycoon and father of two has been a man and a woman ... and a man again ... and knows which sex he'd rather be
By Helen Weathers for the Daily Mail
Property tycoon Charles Kane is , by any standards , a very successful man .
He has a multi-million - pound property portfolio , a law degree , a £ 250,000 , 52ft motor yacht , a top - of - the - range Mercedes and a wardrobe stuffed with designer suits
And yet , he is far from happy .
Despite all these attributes , which should act as a magnet to certain women , the one thing missing from his life is a lasting and fulfilling relationship .
In the past year not one of his few and far between romances has lasted longer than six weeks and more often than not they end rather abruptly after the first date .
Businessman Sam Hashimi with his wife Trudi in 1990 before he became designer Samantha Kane
Either the woman suddenly stops returning his calls after discovering his secret or , if they do n't care too much about hurting his feelings , dismiss him with a withering : " I want a real man . "
" There is nothing I want more than to fall in love and get married , " says 48 - year - old Charles .
" It is like a knife to my heart every time I am rejected .
" I am a real man .
I feel 100 per cent a man , but I am a sensitive , modern man .
People can be so narrow - minded .
All I want is to be accepted and loved for who I am . "
The big secret stopping this from happening is a rather startling one .
Charles is believed to be the only person in the UK to have undergone two sex change operations ; the first to turn him into a woman and the second to turn him back into a man after he realised he'd made a horrible mistake .
Born Sam Hashimi , the divorced father - of - two had a sex change in 1997 to turn him into glamorous blonde Samantha Kane .
Then , in 2004 , after seven years living as a woman , he decided he wanted to be a man after all .
He is now in the unique position of knowing what it is like to be both a woman and a man , and he has reached the conclusion that it is much better being a man - even with the current disadvantages .
" The trouble is , I would much rather be the man I was before all this , " he says .
Charles blames his ghastly predicament on the UK's then top expert on transsexualism , gender psychiatrist Dr Russell Reid - now retired - who in 2007 was reprimanded by the General Medical Council for rushing patients into sex - change treatments .
Dr Russell Reid was found guilty of serious misconduct by a GMC panel who rebuked him for his " lack of caution in initiating hormonal and surgical gender reassessment treatment in patients without more careful and thorough investigation and assessment " .
Charles was one of those who complained and , while the hearing was ongoing , he was already in the process of changing back into a man .
Having decided he was not a true transsexual , but had been ' confused ' after the break - up of his 12 - year marriage , Charles had his breast implants removed and underwent three private operations after being referred by the gender clinic at London 's Charing Cross Hospital to reconstruct his male genitalia , using skin grafts from his stomach .

He has to take strong doses of testosterone daily - by applying a gel to his body , because he can't produce the male hormone naturally , and although he says his new genitals look normal , intimate relations with a woman can be achieved only by means of a concealed pump .
I meet Charles at his £ 2 million property in Holland Park , West London , where he cuts a debonair figure in a double - breasted suit and tie .
It has taken four years of hormone therapy to turn him into someone who does indeed pass as a man - but vestiges of Samantha still remain .
Cosmetic surgery has left him with a very feminine nose , while £ 6,000 worth of veneers have given him a smile any Hollywood starlet would be proud to possess .
His skin is likewise peachy smooth with just a hint of downy hair where stubble should be .
The constant sweeping of his hair out of his eyes with a delicate hand is also a very feminine gesture .
You can see he certainly would have made a convincing woman .
But what is so fascinating is his unique take on what life was like as a woman compared with being a man .
" At first it was very enjoyable being a woman , especially being a beautiful woman in business .
" People notice you and it is much easier to make your presence felt at a meeting .
I was flattered by the attention .
" I became much more creative as a person , and less aggressive .
Whereas , once as a man it had taken me seconds to make a decision , I would think things through much more carefully , weighing up all the options before deciding what to do .
" People completely underestimate the effect of male and female hormones .
Speaking from my own experience , they affect every part of your life , physically and emotionally .
" And then there is the sex .
As a man , sex was a very physical and more enjoyable experience , but as a woman it was much more dependent on my mood and emotions .
" As a man , I thought about sex every day , but as a woman if I had n't had sex for a couple of months I was n't really bothered .
" Sex as a woman is n't as good anyway .
It is not as intense . "
Although Charles was initially thrilled with his transformation into a woman - and a beautiful one at that - the novelty soon began to pale and he began to wonder if he was merely playing a part rather than feeling like a real woman .
" The worst part about being a woman is being treated as a sex object .
I became very irritated when men I was just not interested in kept coming up to me with the worst chat - up lines I 'd ever heard , " says Charles .
Even though I was a woman physically , in many ways I felt I still had a male brain .
I was still interested in the world , what was happening , current affairs , business and sport , but the women I mixed with did n't share that interest to the same degree .
" In fact , I found being a woman rather shallow and limiting .
So much depends on your appearance , at the expense of everything else .
I was n't interested in shopping .
" My female friends would spend hours shopping for clothes , trying on different outfits .
" But having been a man I knew exactly what would suit me and appeal to men .
I could walk into a shop and be out again in five minutes with the right dress .
" Nor have I ever been interested in celebrity magazines or the things that interest other women , but when I tried to talk to men about blokey things they did n't take me seriously .

" Also , because I 'd once been a man , I knew exactly how they thought and responded to women , so there were no surprises and no mystery for me .
It all became rather boring .
" Something else I found difficult to cope with were the moods and depression which I believe were caused by taking the female hormone oestrogen .
" As a man , I was never depressed .
If something bothered me , I would simply shrug it off and move on .
As a woman , I felt as if I was on a rollercoaster of emotion .
" A disagreement with a boyfriend or friend would affect my mood for days . "
The story of how a successful businessman and family man came to embark on this transsexual odyssey is as bizarre as it is remarkable .
Having studied engineering after he left school , he met and married his blonde wife , Trudi , and they had two children , a daughter now aged 23 , and a son aged 22 .
An ambitious alpha male , Sam ( original name ) landed a job heading the investment arm of a Saudi - owned company and launched an unsuccessful takeover bid for Sheffield United FC .
He made millions developing property .
" Trudi was in my eyes the perfect woman , she was the love of my life , but I was a typical man who concentrated too much on my work and not enough on my family .
" I thought that if I gave her a nice house and she had plenty of money to spend at Harrods , she'd be happy , but she was n't , " says Charles who also admits he had a couple of affairs during his marriage .
" When she left me for another man , I was absolutely devastated and our split became acrimonious .
" I was prevented from seeing my children , which destroyed me .
I 'd been hugely successful building up a property portfolio , but at the time of our divorce the economy plunged and I lost a lot of money in the recession .
I felt diminished as a man . "
Charles now believes he suffered a complete mental breakdown , during which he started to question everything , including his sexuality .
As a teenager he'd had a crush on another boy and in his confusion he started going to gay and transvestite clubs , during which he came into contact with transsexuals .
" I went through a bit of a wild phase , experimenting .
I 'd always felt my sexuality was very fluid , even though I 'd never been attracted to men when I was married to Trudi , " says Charles , whose marriage collapsed in 1995 .
" I met people at these transsexual clubs who'd kept saying how fantastic it was to be a woman , how great the sex was , how happy they were , and I started to wonder if I should become a transsexual , too .
" But I can see now that I was n't really transsexual .
A true transsexual is someone who is so determined to be a woman that they do n't care if they look like an 18st trucker in drag .
I just wanted be the perfect woman .
I was acting out a fantasy . "
It was through these transsexual clubs that Charles heard about Dr Russell Reid , and duly made an appointment in 1997 .
" It was all so quick , " says Charles .
" We spoke about my fantasies of being a woman and he diagnosed gender dysphoria and gave me female hormones .
" I was brought up to trust doctors and being in a severely depressed and confused state I accepted the diagnosis without question . "
Gender realignment guidelines , which are not legally binding , say patients should have been living in their gender role for at least three months before being prescribed hormones and should have at least 12 months of that treatment before surgery .
Charles had his sex - change operation just six months after his first appointment with Dr Reid , and the day after a failed court battle to gain access to his children , who were then aged 12 and 13 .
Did n't he have doubts about such a drastic course of action ?
" You have to understand I was on my own , " says Charles .
" I had lost my wife and my family .
I had no one to talk to , no one to tell me I might be making a mistake .
" I believe that all my actions stemmed from the acute psychological distress of not being able to see my children . "
At the time , though , Charles was thrilled with his transformation into a woman .
Re-inventing herself as an interior designer , Samantha Kane became a huge success in her own right , mixing with the jet set , with whom she sipped champagne in the best hotels and bars in Cannes and Monte Carlo .
Samantha became more depressed , but the main catalyst for her decision to live as a man again was ostensibly the collapse of her engagement to a wealthy British landowner , who was aware of her sex - change operation .
" Initially , he was n't bothered that I 'd once been a man , but the longer we were together , the more he mentioned it , " says Charles .
" He 'd say things like ' so and so does n't think like that because she 's a real woman ' .
I realised I 'd never be fully accepted as a woman . "
But he reveals the real reason for undergoing such traumatic surgery to become a man again was the hope that it might reconcile him with his estranged children , who he has n't seen for 13 years .
" I really hoped , more than anything , that if I turned myself back into a man they might agree to see me again , " says Charles .
" After the operation , I put out feelers through extended family to see if they 'd meet me , but I received a message back saying they 'd rather leave things as they were .
That was a terrible blow .
" So nothing has really turned out the way I hoped .
Sometimes , it can be a very lonely existence .
I thought going back to being a man would be the end of the story , but it 's not .
Becoming a man again has been much harder than I ever imagined .
" After what I 've been through , I now think that sex - change operations should n't be allowed .
They should be banned .
" We live today in a consumerist society where we all believe we can have everything we want , but too much choice can be a dangerous thing . ' "
He laments the level of counselling he 's received both times , but ultimately comes across as someone who is still as confused as ever about who he is and what he wants to be .

Astronomers have uncovered an extreme stellar machine -- a galaxy in the very remote universe pumping out stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year .
In comparison , our own Milky Way galaxy turns out an average of just 10 stars per year .
The discovery , made possible by several telescopes including NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , goes against the most common theory of galaxy formation .
According to the theory , called the Hierarchical Model , galaxies slowly bulk up their stars over time by absorbing tiny pieces of galaxies -- and not in one big burst as observed in the newfound " Baby Boom " galaxy .
" This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom , producing most of its stars all at once , " said Peter Capak of NASA 's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena .
" If our human population was produced in a similar boom , then almost all of the people alive today would be the same age . "
Capak is lead author of a new report detailing the discovery in the July 10th issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The Baby Boom galaxy , which belongs to a class of galaxies called starbursts , is the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe , with brightness being a measure of its extreme star - formation rate .
It was discovered and characterized using a suite of telescopes operating at different wavelengths .
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope and Japan's Subaru Telescope , atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii , first spotted the galaxy in visible - light images , where it appeared as an inconspicuous smudge due to is great distance .
It was n't until Spitzer and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope , also on Mauna Kea in Hawaii , observed the galaxy at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths , respectively , that the galaxy stood out as the brightest of the bunch .
This is because it has a huge number of youthful stars .
When stars are born , they shine with a lot of ultraviolet light and produce a lot of dust .
The dust absorbs the ultraviolet light but , like a car sitting in the sun , it warms up and re-emits light at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths , making the galaxy unusually bright to Spitzer and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope .
To learn more about this galaxy 's unique youthful glow , Capak and his team followed up with a number of telescopes .
They used optical measurements from Keck to determine the exact distance to the galaxy -- a whopping 12.3 billion light - years .
That 's looking back to a time when the universe was 1.3 billion years old ( the universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old today ) .
" If the universe was a human reaching retirement age , it would have been about 6 years old at the time we are seeing this galaxy , " said Capak .
The astronomers made measurements at radio wavelengths with the National Science Foundation 's Very Large Array in New Mexico .
Together with Spitzer and James Clerk Maxwell data , these observations allowed the astronomers to calculate a star - forming rate of about 1,000 to 4,000 stars per year .
At that rate , the galaxy needs only 50 million years , not very long on cosmic timescales , to grow into a galaxy equivalent to the most massive ones we see today .
While galaxies in our nearby universe can produce stars at similarly high rates , the farthest one known before now was about 11.7 billion light - years away , or a time when the universe was 1.9 billion years old .
" Before now , we had only seen galaxies form stars like this in the teenaged universe , but this galaxy is forming when the universe was only a child , " said Capak .
" The question now is whether the majority of the very most massive galaxies form very early in the universe like the Baby Boom galaxy , or whether this is an exceptional case .
Answering this question will help us determine to what degree the Hierarchical Model of galaxy formation still holds true . "
" The incredible star - formation activity we have observed suggests that we may be witnessing , for the first time , the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe , " said co-author Nick Scoville of Caltech , the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Survey , also known as Cosmos .
The Cosmos program is an extensive survey of a large patch of distant galaxies across the full spectrum of light .
" The immediate identification of this galaxy with its extraordinary properties would not have been possible without the full range of observations in this survey , " said Scoville .

“ So , how many miles does it get ? ”
It was a Sunday morning , and we were looking at my car , and so I mentioned that I had started to change the way I drove .
As a result ( driven by a little monitor display ) I was now getting about 10 – 20 % better mileage than the estimate I was given when I bought the car .
“ Yup , ” said the pickup driver I was talking with , “ I ’ve started doing the same sort of thing .
Slow down a bit , do n’t accelerate as hard , the little things .
And you know what ? ”
He went on , “ a lot of other folk have started driving that way too .
Of course you ’ve still got the hot rods , but in general . . . . ”
Of course it helps that we live in a relatively small town , in more of a rural setting .
Across Indiana , the Prius was holding its own in the 70.3 –70.7mpg range while I was traveling in the standard 48 – 53 mph range using SHM of IG14 and TPS of 18 whenever I could .
As soon as I crossed the Ohio border ( time : 10:47 CST ) , an off the rear quarter wind began to increase and so did my speeds .
30 miles past the border , the Prius picked up to 71.7 mpg .
Another 60 miles and she was up to 73.1 mpg .
I had two quick bathroom breaks inside Ohio but only lost maybe 9 minutes total while the Prius stayed booted up through the stops .
And just as some three years ago , we had to start learning the new phrase “ demand destruction " , it may now be time to learn about the new term “ Hypermiling . ”
Because , in terms of improving mileage performance neither they nor I in the league of those that can get more than 70 mpg out of a Prius , a feat highlighted on the CBS Morning Show the other week .
The story of how the shoot took place , in itself an introduction to hypermiling , and the adventure of the drive itself is detailed at CleanMPG forums , with the highlights including
Inside Ohio and 389 miles out , Benno had to refuel while I was only two pips down .
Benno in the Standard had traveled 389 miles on 9.37 gallons for a calculated 41.5 mpg and 45.3 mpg per the FCD .
He was playing with the screen and reset his FCD about 100 miles prior but I calc ’ed the actual from start to reset and reset to fill .
I also passed him while he was refueling but it was not long before he flew by for the second time !
As I say this level of change is not yet widespread , but perhaps one of the impacts of the higher price has been a more conservative driving style from those who have not , in the past , given it much thought .
Yet , as Leanan caught in a Drumbeat piece last Sunday there is no appetite , as yet , to make practices , such as lower speed limits , mandatory yet .
For all the griping about spiking gas prices , there ’s no clamor for the return of the little - lamented 55 mph speed limit of the ’70s and ’ 80s — though most agree it reduces consumption and saves money .
“ It ’s not that people have n’t thought of it — just no one is even close to discussing implementing it , ” said Therese Langer , speaking for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy .
“ It ’s not high on anyone ’s list . ”
Cars , in general , get better mileage than they did back in the 1970 ’s when the limits were in place , particularly when the limits are below 60 mph .
However it is not a lost cause .
Historically speeds on the German autobahn have not been restricted , but this April Bremen were the first to introduce a limit - albeit at 120 kph ( 75 mph ) , though there is a difference between the parties on what should be done .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , leader of the pro-business conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) , has ruled out introducing a national speed limit as proposed by her SPD coalition partners .
The SPD voted at a party conference last year to introduce a speed limit of 130 kph ( 80 mph ) on motorways to help reduce CO2 emissions .
Interestingly Wikipedia notes that only three places have no general speed limit , Nepal , the Isle of Man , and the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh .
We are heading out for family related vacation and associated social events for the next three weeks , and may post from the road , if facilities will allow , but it will also give me a change to see how my mileage changes as we do drive more extensively – with most of the driving likely to occur along the East Coast .
Most of the suggestions for improving mileage performance are relatively straightforward , and though there are a more advanced techniques out there , I am not ( at least yet ) that much of a fanatic that I am likely to be following them all .
On the other hand I am going to print the list out , and see how some of them at least work out as we make our trip .
And who knows , as the numbers start to creep up on that little monitor every time I shut the engine off , I may become more under its control .
We ’ll just have to see .

House votes to expand Bush wiretap powers , telecom immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 20 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Less than 24 hours after introducing a controversial measure to expand President Bush 's authority to spy on Americans , the Democratic - controlled House of Representatives on Friday voted to approve the administration - and Republican - supported bill , sending it to the Senate where it will likely be adopted .
Senator Barack Obama defended the new bill as a ' compromise ' from last year 's Protect America Act .
Civil liberties and privacy advocates forcefully panned the measure , which was crafted behind closed doors in negotiations among moderate Democrats , Republicans , the White House and telecommunications lobbyists .
" Its Christmas morning at the White House thanks to this vote , " Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLUs Washington Legislative Office , said in a news release .
" The House just wrapped up some expensive gifts for the administration and their buddies at the phone companies . "
Friday 's vote represented the beginning of the end in a legislative battle aimed at reining in the warrantless surveillance program Bush acknowledged instituting after 9/11 .
" Immunity for telecom giants that secretly assisted in the NSA 's warrantless surveillance undermines the rule of law and the privacy of every American , " said Electronic Frontier Foundation Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" Congress should let the courts do their job instead of helping the administration and the phone companies avoid accountability for a half decade of illegal domestic spying .
If this legislation passes the Senate and is signed into law , the American people will have lost their last best chance to discover the true scope of the president 's wiretapping program and to determine whether or not the law was broken . "
EFF is representing plaintiffs in more than 40 lawsuits alleging the telecoms broke the law and violated their customers ' privacy by facilitating the warrantless wiretaps .
The House had earlier proved to be a bulwark in the way of the president 's attempt to retroactively legalize his conduct and excuse from legal oversight the telecommunications companies that assisted him .
That wall fell Friday .
Pressure mounts on Obama to oppose Now activists are turning their attention to the Senate , and pressure is mounting on Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to step up and lead an effort to block the latest FISA bill .
" We look to leaders in the Senate who value the rule of law to stand up and strongly oppose this blanket immunity for telecom lawbreakers , " Bankston said , " and in particular urge Senator Barack Obama to lead his party in rejecting this false compromise . "
Obama was initially cautious about reacting to the FISA compromise .
After RAW STORY and others asked his communications director about the issue Friday , Obama issued a statement indicating he was generally supportive of the deal , calling it a " marked improvement " over a temporary FISA update passed last summer .
The Illinois senator did say he would " work ... to remove " a telecom immunity provision .
" It is not all that I would want .
But given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay , " Obama said in the e-mailed statement .
" So I support the compromise , but do so with a firm pledge that as President , I will carefully monitor the program , review the report by the Inspectors General , and work with the Congress to take any additional steps I deem necessary to protect the lives  and the liberty  of the American people . "
( Obama 's full statement is reprinted below )
The Democratic candidate was criticized earlier this week for endorsing Rep. John Barrow , a pro-immunity Georgia Democrat , who is in the middle of a primary campaign against a progressive State Senator .
When the Senate passed an earlier FISA bill in February , Obama supported amendments to strip immunity from it .
He supported a filibuster after that amendment fail , although the Illinois senator did not vote on the final bill itself .
Pelosi , Hoyer lead effort in opposition to majority of Dems Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shepherded through a surveillance bill opposed by the majority of their caucus .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act update passed 293-129 , with support from just 107 Democrats .
Opposing the measure were 128 Democrats and one Republican , Rep. Timothy Johnson of Illinois .
" Watching the House fall to scare tactics and political maneuvering is especially infuriating given the way it stood up to pressure from the president on this same issue just months ago , " Fredrickson said .
" In March we thought the House leadership had finally grown a backbone by rejecting the Senates FISA bill .
Now we know they will not stand up for the Constitution . "
Pelosi said the only choice the House had was between the FISA update it considered Friday and a worse version passed by the Senate earlier this year .
A FISA update the House approved in March , that did not include immunity and earned praise from civil libertarians , was apparently no longer an option because Democrats decided it could not pass the Senate .
She said she was unsatisfied with the immunity provision , which leaves telecommunications companies " with a taint , " but she said the overall bill was acceptable because it improved on the Senate version .
The House compromise requires intelligence agencies '
Inspectors General to review the warrantless wiretapping program , instead of the independent judicial review that would have come from the lawsuits moving forward .
Acknowledging the controversy in the bill , Pelosi did n't attempt to prevent the defection of a majority of the Democratic caucus .
( This , by the way , stands in stark contrast to the way in which Republicans ran the House ; they would not even bring a measure to the floor if it did not have majority GOP support . )
" I 'm not asking anybody to vote for this bill , " Pelosi said at the end of her floor speech .
" I just wanted to let you know why I am . "
Barack Obama released the following statement on the FISA compromise :  Given the grave threats that we face , our national security agencies must have the capability to gather intelligence and track down terrorists before they strike , while respecting the rule of law and the privacy and civil liberties of the American people .
There is also little doubt that the Bush Administration , with the cooperation of major telecommunications companies , has abused that authority and undermined the Constitution by intercepting the communications of innocent Americans without their knowledge or the required court orders .
 That is why last year I opposed the so - called Protect America Act , which expanded the surveillance powers of the government without sufficient independent oversight to protect the privacy and civil liberties of innocent Americans .
I have also opposed the granting of retroactive immunity to those who were allegedly complicit in acts of illegal spying in the past .
 After months of negotiation , the House today passed a compromise that , while far from perfect , is a marked improvement over last year 's Protect America Act .
 Under this compromise legislation , an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue , but the President 's illegal program of warrantless surveillance will be over .
It restores FISA and existing criminal wiretap statutes as the exclusive means to conduct surveillance  making it clear that the President cannot circumvent the law and disregard the civil liberties of the American people .
It also firmly re-establishes basic judicial oversight over all domestic surveillance in the future .
It does , however , grant retroactive immunity , and I will work in the Senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses .
But this compromise guarantees a thorough review by the Inspectors General of our national security agencies to determine what took place in the past , and ensures that there will be accountability going forward .
By demanding oversight and accountability , a grassroots movement of Americans has helped yield a bill that is far better than the Protect America Act .
 It is not all that I would want .
But given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay .
So I support the compromise , but do so with a firm pledge that as President , I will carefully monitor the program , review the report by the Inspectors General , and work with the Congress to take any additional steps I deem necessary to protect the lives  and the liberty  of the American people . 
Update , March 2011 : It ’s been nearly three years since we published this article , and Obama 's birth certificate is still the subject of much discussion , and still the subject of our fact - checking efforts .
This article was published in June 2008 and has been the most widely read PolitiFact article in our history .
Claims about Obama 's birth continued to circulate , so a year later , on July 1 , 2009 , we published " Obama 's birth certificate : Final chapter .
This time we mean it ! "
It explored whether a White House spokesman lied when he claimed Obama 's birth certificate is actually posted on the Web and whether a bill in Congress would protect Obama from having to release his birth certificate .
We ’ve also created a category -- Obama birth certificate -- so you can review all our fact - checks in one place .
Here 's our original story as published in June 2008 :
It started as a whisper , a trickle of nagging doubt .
" As a concerned citizen , I 'm wondering if there is n't something fishy going on with the Obama certificate . "
" I have serious doubts about the purported ' birth certificate ' you were sent . "
" Something does n't smell right . "
Soon , e-mails and blog posts were flying .
As the pace quickened , the tone sharpened .
" You should be apologizing ... for your misinformation regarding BO bogus birth certificate , that you claimed was genuine ! "
At full throttle , the accusations are explosive and unrelenting , the writers emboldened by the anonymity and reach of the Internet .
And you can't help but ask :
How do you prove something to people who come to the facts believing , out of fear or hatred or maybe just partisanship , that they 're being tricked ?

Sen . Barack Obama 's birth certificate is a document PolitiFact.com had sought for months .
Countless chain e-mails , seeking to paint him as a secret Muslim , speculated that his full name included Muhammed ( or Mohammed ) .
Some said he is not an American citizen .
As a fact - checking news Web site , we went to extensive lengths to sort out the truth .
We got a copy of his 1992 marriage certificate from the Cook County ( Ill . ) Bureau of Vital Statistics .
His driver 's license record from the Illinois Secretary of State 's office .
His registration and disciplinary record with the Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois .
Not to mention all of his property records .
Not one of these documents shows a Muhammed ( or Mohammed ) in Obama 's name .
They all read " Barack H. Obama " or " Barack Hussein Obama . "
The ultimate document we sought was Obama 's birth certificate .
Unlike the other documents , Hawaii birth certificates are n't public record .
Only family members can request copies , so when the campaign declined to give us one , we were stalled .
On June 13 , 2008 , Obama 's campaign finally released a copy , while launching a fact - check Web site of its own , Fightthesmears.com .
The site is a direct response to allegations about Obama that wo n't go away : He 's Muslim .
He took the oath of office on a Koran .
He refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance .
PolitiFact has researched all of these accusations and none of them are true .
When the birth certificate arrived from the Obama campaign it confirmed his name as the other documents already showed it .
Still , we took an extra step :
We e-mailed it to the Hawaii Department of Health , which maintains such records , to ask if it was real .
" It 's a valid Hawaii state birth certificate , " spokesman Janice Okubo told us .
Then the firestorm started .
• Where is the embossed seal and the registrar 's signature ?
• Comparing it to other Hawaii birth certificates , the color shade is different .
• Is n't the date stamp bleeding through the back of the document " June 2007 ? "
( Odd since it was supposedly released in June 2008 . )
• There 's no crease from being folded and mailed .
• It 's clearly Photoshopped and a wholesale fraud .
• • •
At PolitiFact.com , we 're all about original sources .
We do n't take anyone at their word or take the reporting of other media organizations as proof .
We go to the heart of the story , the source of the truth — original , corroborating documents .
When the official documents were questioned , we went looking for more answers .
We circled back to the Department of Health , had a newsroom colleague bring in her own Hawaii birth certificate to see if it looks the same ( it 's identical ) .
But every answer triggered more questions .
And soon enough , after going to every length possible to confirm the birth certificate 's authenticity , you start asking , what is reasonable here ?
Because if this document is forged , then they all are .
If this document is forged , a U.S. senator and his presidential campaign have perpetrated a vast , long - term fraud .
They have done it with conspiring officials at the Hawaii Department of Health , the Cook County ( Ill . )
Bureau of Vital Statistics , the Illinois Secretary of State 's office , the Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois and many other government agencies .
Sounds like a Vince Flynn novel .

Peter Goelz knows a little something about conspiracy theorists .
He was managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board in 1996 when TWA Flight 800 crashed off Long Island , killing 230 people .
While the NTSB 's investigation found no evidence of sabotage or terrorism , the Internet was stocked with insistent accusations .
" We were right at the beginning of this Internet lunacy , " Goelz said in an interview with PolitiFact .
" And there were a variety of crackpot Web sites and Web commentators that generated all sorts of rumors .
The principle one was that TWA in fact was shot down by an errant Navy missile in ... a live - fire exercise off the Hamptons . "
Nine miles off Long Island , in the middle of summer .
And then a full - scale coverup by the Navy and all the sailors involved .
" I am sure that we spent another $ 10 - million , perhaps $ 20 - million , out of a $ 50 - million investigation , to just knock down and put to bed these kinds of rumors , these insidious rumors , " Goelz said .
" We felt like we had to answer every question because it was such a public and dreadful and confounding event . "
Goelz , who is now a communications consultant in Washington , D.C. , says the Internet has given a platform to anyone to say anything .
And a way to find others who want to hear it .
" Online , they can be almost anything , " he said .
" They can be the crusading investigators that they always wanted to be . "

The Hawaii Department of Health receives about a dozen e-mail inquiries a day about Obama 's birth certificate , spokesman Okubo said .
" I guess the big issue that 's being raised is the lack of an embossed seal and a signature , " Okubo said , pointing out that in Hawaii , both those things are on the back of the document .
" Because they scanned the front … you would n't see those things . "
Okubo says she got a copy of her own birth certificate last year and it is identical to the Obama one we received .
And about the copy we e-mailed her for verification ?
" When we looked at that image you guys sent us , our registrar , he thought he could see pieces of the embossed image through it . "
Still , she acknowledges : " I do n't know that it 's possible for us to even say beyond a doubt what the image on the site represents . "
• • •
And there 's the rub .
It is possible that Obama conspired his way to the precipice of the world 's biggest job , involving a vast network of people and government agencies over decades of lies .
Anything 's possible .
But step back and look at the overwhelming evidence to the contrary and your sense of what 's reasonable has to take over .
There is not one shred of evidence to disprove PolitiFact 's conclusion that the candidate 's name is Barack Hussein Obama , or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released is n't authentic .
And that 's true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the Internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Democratic - led U.S. congressional panel on Tuesday authorized a subpoena of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff in its probe of possible U.S. torture of suspected terrorists .

House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers of Michigan was expected to move within days to subpoena David Addington , who the administration maintains is immune from being required to testify to Congress .
If Addington refuses to show up , a court fight is likely , but it may not be resolved until after President George W. Bush and Cheney end their terms in January and leave office .
Regardless , Conyers pushed ahead .
“ The administration ’s use of harsh interrogation methods -- with approval of the Justice Department and other administration lawyers -- requires the strictest scrutiny and oversight , ” Conyers said .
“ In the view of the many reports that Mr. Addington played a key role in shaping interrogation policy and drafting legal memos on the subject , it is very important to hear from him , ” Conyers said .
Without debate , a subcommittee of Conyers ’ panel approved a resolution authorizing him to subpoena Addington .
Cheney spokeswoman Megan Mitchell said : “ We have not yet received a subpoena .
Once we do , we will review and respond accordingly . ”
Bush maintains that the United States does not torture , but he has refused to discuss interrogation techniques , saying he does not want to tip off the enemy .
The CIA has acknowledged using a simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding on three terrorism suspects , but says it stopped using that method in 2003 .
Waterboarding has been condemned by human rights groups , foreign countries and many U.S. lawmakers as torture .
The subcommittee authorized the subpoena shortly before beginning a hearing on treatment of enemy combatants .
Those who testified were primarily legal and academic figures who discussed what amounts to torture and the scope of the administration ’s power to establish interrogation methods .
Former Attorney General John Ashcroft has agreed to testify at a yet - to - be scheduled hearing .
John
Yoo , a former deputy assistant attorney general , also agreed to testify at a later date after facing a possible subpoena .
Bush has invoked executive privilege in rejecting congressional subpoenas for a number of current and former administration officials , many sought as witnesses in the 2006 firing of nine federal prosecutors .
In March , the House Judiciary Committee filed suit in U.S. District Court asking it to direct White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten to produce subpoenaed documents and order former White House counsel Harriet Miers to comply with a subpoena and testify about the ousted prosecutors .
A ruling is not expected for at least several months .
Cheney ’s counsel , Kathryn Wheelbarger , in a letter to the subcommittee , argued Addington cannot be required to testify .
“ The office of the vice president remains of the view that the courts , to protect the institution of the vice presidency under the Constitution from encroachment by committees of Congress , would recognize that a chief of staff or counsel to the vice president is immune from compulsion to appear before committees of Congress , ” Wheelbarger wrote .
Obama : After 9/11 , 'we were asked to go shopping ' David Edwards
Published : Wednesday July 2 , 2008
Print This Email This
In a bastion of the religious right , Barack Obama is talking up the importance of volunteerism , part of a flag - draped week focused on God , country , service , veterans and freedom - and on cribbing themes from the successful campaigns of President Bush .
Wednesday 's main message was the need to boost service by all Americans in all spheres - the military , overseas and in neighborhoods .
In the prepared text of Obama 's speech , he said the quiet following Friday 's Fourth of July celebrations would be a good time to look beyond the " bustle and busyness " of everyday obligations to find a way to contribute .
" I hope you take that moment to think about what you can do to shape the future of this country we love , " the Democratic presidential hopeful was to say in a University of Colorado gym .
" Loving your country should n't just mean watching fireworks on the 4th of July . "
Obama talked in almost achingly personal terms about the impact service had on him , as a boy who " spent much of my childhood adrift " and often had little idea " who I was or where I was going . "
But early in college , he said , values like hard work and empathy resurfaced " after a long hibernation . "
He eventually found himself working as a community organizer in a devastated South Side Chicago neighborhood , and said he was transformed .
His call is a clear echo of Bush 's " love a neighbor like you 'd like to be loved yourself " refrain , an enduring and prominent staple of Bush 's own runs for the White House as well as his campaigning for others in midterm election years .
But to Obama , the problem is not that Americans are not willing .
It 's that they have neither been asked nor given enough opportunities .
In a clear slap to Bush , he decried that Americans " were asked to go shopping , " instead of something larger , in the wake of the 2001 attacks .
" We have lost precious time , " he said .
His solution is a major proposed expansion of government national service programs , first unveiled in Iowa in December , that would cost $ 3.5 billion a year .
His campaign said he would fund the spending with some of the savings from ending the war in Iraq and by canceling a new tax break for multinational corporations .
One new piece announced Wednesday would create a new " Green Vet Initiative " offering counseling , job placement and mediation with industry for veterans wanting to enter the rapidly expanding renewable energy field .
Other highlights of the plan include : increasing the all - volunteer military , expanding AmeriCorps , doubling the size of the Peace Corps , expanding YouthBuild , in which low - income young people build affordable housing ; expanding service programs involving retired people and anyone over 55 , and creating a tax credit making the first $ 4,000 of college tuition free for students who conduct 100 hours of public service a year .
On a day the Democratic presidential candidate 's Republican opponent , John McCain , was in Colombia touting the benefits of free trade deals , Obama also was addressing the United Steel Workers union 's annual conference in Las Vegas via satellite and burnishing his military credentials with a planned visit to the U.S. Air Force Academy and Peterson Air Force Base , both based here .
Obama 's time here brought him onto the home turf of James Dobson , the popular and influential evangelical leader who founded Focus on the Family and with whom the Democratic candidate has sparred .
Dobson recently said that Obama , in a 2006 speech , was " deliberately distorting " descriptions of Bible passages to suit his policies .
Obama shot back that Dobson was " just making stuff up . "
As an unexpected entry in the battleground column for this November 's election , Colorado is one of the chief places where Democrats see a chance to turn a reliably red state into a blue one .
Its biggest city , Denver , was chosen to host the Democratic convention in August where Obama will officially take the nominee crown .
In 2004 , Democrat John Kerry made a play for the state but lost it 52 percent to 47 percent to Bush .
But Obama chosen it as one of the states where he is airing the opening television ads of his general election race .
And Obama 's choice of Colorado Springs - instead of more Democratic friendly towns such as Boulder , Pueblo or Denver - for his visit Wednesday showed the degree to which he is courting Republican religious voters .
A religious political action committee supporting Obama has a new pro-Obama radio aid to highlight his faith - and is airing it on Christian radio in Colorado Springs among other places .

VidMate is one of the most famous Android applications for downloading videos from streaming websites .
Although it mostly focuses on downloading videos from YouTube .
The app still lets you download from various other sources as well .
Since Google is n’t a fan of letting people download content from YouTube , you wo n’t find VidMate on the Play Store .
So let us guide you through the download and installation process of the latest VidMate v3.4.6 .
Getting VidMate v3.4.6 on Android
Android does n’t allow you to directly install applications from third parties without enabling it through the settings .
So if you ’re interested in installing VidMate you ’ll need to go through three steps .
Allow applications from Unknown Sources to be installed .
Downloading a genuine APK of VidMate .
Installing VidMate v3.4.6
Allowing applications from Unknown Sources
Simply go to your device ’s settings and scroll down to tap Privacy & Security settings .
Look for a checkbox next to “ Unknown Sources ” and tick it so your phone may install applications from sources other than Google ’s Play Store .
It ’s important to mention that you should be very careful of which applications you install on your phone .
People often fall prey to fake android apps which do n’t actually perform the promised and only act as malware on your phone .
Downloading a genuine APK of VidMate
The best way to get an authentic VidMate APK is to go directly to their own download page .
Doing so should prompt you to download the APK file which contains everything you ’ll need to install the app on your device .
It is important to double check that you only download from genuine sources and not from third parties .
So remember to only get the APK file from VidMate ’s own website and nowhere else .
Installing VidMate v3.4.6
After you ’ve finished downloading the APK file , simply open it and you ’ll be prompted to install it .
You ’ll also be asked to allow various permissions to be granted .
Once the installation has been completed you ’ll have full access to all the features VidMate grants .
Updating Vidmate
When it comes to updates though , you wo n’t really have Google Play helping you out .
You ’ll have to manually download the next version ’s APK file and install it over your existing one .
In order to do that simply go to VidMate ’s download page we linked above and go through the same steps .
Unfortunately though , all of this only works for Android devices because they do n’t need to be jailbreaked like iOS devices if you wish to install third party apps .
Apple users are mostly stuck with apps only from the iTunes App Store unless they decide to jailbreak .
After an all night drinking binge things went a little too far .
You find yourself in jail holding up a sign and getting a picture you will never forget .
As much as this bites , at least you are n’t these guys … or are you ?
10 . Never mention Sex in the pen
9. Bambi : Kmart by day , Stripper by night
8 . Say that to the judge .
7 . Better hope you are n’t sharing a cell with one .
6 . He must have been busy … your whole life .
5 . About bunnies ?
No .
4 . Better hope you ’re in jail for less than that .
3. Arrested Drunks go to jail .
2. Except in this case .
1 . No , but you are awesome .
Typical Reaction to the Revelation That I Do Not Own a Cell Phone , By Year
1998 : Solidarity ( " Yeah , me neither - - I hate those things ! " )
1999 : Envy ( " Lucky you ; I had to get one for work . " )
2000 : Indifference ( " Okay , what 's your home phone number then ? " )
2001 : Encouragement ( " You should get one - - you can play Tetris on them now ! " )
2002 : Confusion ( " I thought you were , like , a tech guy . " )
2003 : Sympathy ( " They 're getting pretty cheap .
You 'll be able to afford one soon . " )
2004 : Irritation ( " So how am I supposed to get a hold of you ? " )
2005 : Derision ( " If we go out tonight I 'll send you a fax . " )
2006 : Skepticism ( " Are you serious ? " )
2007 : Awe ( " Wow , you 're like the last one . " )
2008 : Incomprehension ( " You do n't ... how ...? " )
The Indiana Jones of Economics , Part I
A few years back the Wall Street Journal dubbed me the Indiana Jones of economics .
In reality , that title more rightfully belongs to Robert Jensen , an economist at Brown University who is doing some of the most interesting and adventurous economics studies these days .
Jensen has documented how cell phones revolutionized fish markets in India , how simply telling students in the Dominican Republic once about the high value of an additional year of school can impact their choices years later , and how introducing T.V. into rural India affects the position of women .
The real reason I call Jensen the Indiana Jones of economics is because of another paper he has written in which he and co-author Nolan Miller set out to find one of the elusive Holy Grails of economics : a Giffen good .
A Giffen good is one where increasing the price for the exact same good actually leads people to buy more of the good .
In economic terms , the price elasticity of such a good is positive , rather than negative .
The way economists measure elasticities is often by looking at what is called an “ arc elasticity . ”
Jensen tells his story in three parts which we will post over the next three days , aptly entitled “ Raiders of the Lost Arc Elasticity . ”
Raiders of the Lost Arc Elasticity , Part I
By Robert Jensen
Several years ago , my colleague Nolan Miller and I set out on a thrilling adventure .
OK , this being economics , both “ thrilling ” and “ adventure ” are relative terms .
But , the story does involve the search for an elusive , fabled prize shrouded in mystery , travel to far - off lands , and the promise of immortality .
We had set out to find a Giffen good , a journey we just recently completed .
So , what ’s a Giffen good ?
It ’s a ( theoretical ) violation of one of the most sacred and holy laws of economics : the Law of Demand .
It has excited and intrigued economists for over a century , though no verified example had ever been found .
The Law of Demand says that if the price of a good goes up , the quantity demanded decreases .
A Giffen good is one where when the price goes up , the quantity demanded increases .
It ’s named after Sir Robert Giffen , a 19th century British civil servant and economist who is believed to have first suggested the possibility .
How might this happen ?
Imagine you are extremely poor , just barely able to afford enough to eat .
And for simplicity , pretend there are only two foods : a basic , staple food like bread that gives you a lot of calories and fills your stomach at a relatively low cost , and a luxury food like meat , that tastes good ( indulge me , vegetarians ) or adds variety to your diet , but is very expensive , offering few calories per dollar .
So , if you ’re really poor , you ’ll eat a lot of bread to fill your stomach and get your calories — then with whatever money you have left over , you buy a bit of meat to make yourself happy .
You ’re going merrily along like this , until the price of bread goes up .
Now you ca n’t afford the same bundle of bread and meat you were buying before .
You have two choices :
1 . Eat less bread and more meat .
2 . Eat more bread and less meat .
Actually , if you enjoy being alive , you really only have one choice : option two .
The problem with option one is that if you cut back on bread , you lose a lot of calories and a lot of bulk to fill your stomach .
And because meat is so expensive , you get very few calories from the small amount you add to your diet .
So , since you were just barely getting enough to eat before , you would end up with too few calories and a grumbling stomach .
Eventually , you might even end up dead .
But if you instead cut back on meat and eat even more bread than before — while you may enjoy your diet less — you ’ll at least get enough calories and fill your stomach .
Really , you have little choice .
So you break the Law of Demand : the price of bread goes up , and you end up eating more of it .
Anyone who has ever sat through introductory economics has probably heard about Giffen goods .
Maybe you were told about potatoes during the Irish famine .
If so , you were mislead .
The potato example has been disproved .
The search for an alternative example has lead economists to explore crazy , far - out cases , like the demand for fermented whale bile among river - dwelling southern Kazoo from 1873 to 1875 .
But these searches always came up empty .
In fact , just a few years before his death , Nobel Laureate George Stigler wrote that the best proof that no Giffen good exists is that whoever found one would attain immortality ( in the economics profession , anyway , which is one - half a step above being the most famous asphalt engineer ) — and since this is such a great reward , people must have already looked everywhere for one .
Despite this declaration , we were determined to find the elusive Giffen good !
( Oh , the blog title .
For technical reasons , the way you explore demand is through estimating an “ elasticity , ” which tells you how the quantity demanded changes when the price changes — all in percent terms .
In the Giffen case , where quantity demanded increases when price increases , you would have a positive price elasticity .
And for even more technical reasons , you really want to estimate the “ arc ” price elasticity .
Yes , a long way to go just for a bad pun ) .
So , to rephrase :
We were determined to find the elusive positive arc price elasticity of demand !
Next time : Catastrophe strikes !

This is an astounding success for the free and open source software community , and is a direct result of the success of Linux and other open source software solutions in the mobile phone market .
Linux has gone from nowhere to being the second most popular platform for smartphones .
Experts have predicted a bright future for Linux , with ABI Research suggesting that it will appear on more than 200 million phones by 2012 .
It has been suggested that the driver for Nokia 's initiative is the competitive threat provided by the Google - led Android consortium and the The LiMo ( Linux Mobile ) Foundation , which are both sponsored by a number of prominent telecoms and mobile manufacturers .
Symbian , which will now be distributed free , is likely to make large inroads into Microsoft 's tenuous 11 per cent share of the smartphone market , as the proprietary option becomes less appealing for reasons of cost and efficiency .
Following Nokia 's buy - out of Symbian , three quarters of the world 's smartphones will soon be running free software .
Assuming we take into account Nokia 's figures of 200 million users and ( the less likely figure ) of 4 million developers , Nokia 's purchase of Symbian - and the subsequent open source release of Symbian under the auspices of the non-profit Symbian Foundation - is probably the largest ever donation of software to the free software community .
Nokia denies that this is so .
More significant has been the rapid growth of Linux in the mobile sector .
Linux brings many advantages for mobile manufacturers that are not necessarily specific to Linux , but derive from free software licensing and the open source development model .
The code is modular and visible , which makes it easier to adapt to specialised hardware .
Open sourcing Symbian brings the same advantages , new resources , developers , and collaborative input from other manufacturers .
David Rivas , Nokia vice president for devices research and development , notes that : " The natural evolution of the Symbian platform and the mobile industry has been heading in this direction for quite a while .
Its encumbent on all of us in the industry to change with the times , so rather than thinking of this as being a direct response to any particular initiative its really a matter of growing with the times and making the overall platform as competitive as it possibly can be . "
The gizmo that rides on top
For some years the drift in the smartphone industry has been towards free software solutions .
Unlike the home computing market the OS is transparent and the user interface is fairly limited .
Nobody cares which operating system is running behind the interface .
Manufacturers of mobile devices operate in a rapidly changing environment with short product life - cycles and shorter time - to - market .
The compelling arguments for manufacturers to deploy Linux on smart phones have been the same as those that apply to HPC and server manufacturers .
Pooling knowledge and resources on the technology and feeding back software changes to the community is of mutual advantage to all the players .
Sharing the technology improves performance and reduces the overall costs for everybody .
The market is highly competitive , and every new product comes to market with a new range of features .
The availability of a memory - efficient modular operating system that is easily adapted to new hardware environments is an invaluable commodity , and the profit margins being what they are , freedom , " as in beer " , is hard to compete with .
The industry has recognised the advantages of free software for some time , and has dispensed with out - dated reservations .
What matters is that the software is cheap and efficient , and gives you a competitive edge over your rivals .
Software at the OS level , and much higher up the stack , is not what distinguishes the product .
The product is distinguished by the gizmos that ride on top .
The OS affects time - to - market , the cost of hardware and software development , the limits of battery life and memory , and the flexibility and reliability of the product , and this is where Linux and free software have proved themselves .
Gaining an education
Linux , even on a mobile device , is more scalable than many of the systems with which it is in close competition .
This is because of the modular and scalable pattern that has dominated Linux development since the beginning .
With a bit of tweaking here and there you can run it on any device , and if does n't quite work , you can strip it down , and pick at the code and find out why .
Development is therefore much faster , and support can be found from an expanding ecosystem of developers and companies who specialise in producing hardened versions of Linux for mobile devices .
Gasoline made from pig manure might not smell nice , but sometimes you 've just got to pinch your nose and bear it .
In a study published today in the journal Fuel , researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology provided the most detailed analysis yet of pig manure - based biofuel .
It 's not quite ready for the road , they found , but researchers now know what to fix .
Even more importantly , said NIST fuel expert and study co-author Tom Bruno , the methods used in the study could transform fuel analysis .
" The real significance of what we have done is not so much contributing to the development of this particular fuel source , but rather the development of a measurement technique that can be applied to all manner of fuels , including those derived from bio or renewable feed stocks , " Bruno said .
Bruno 's samples came from an experimental pig manure processing plant designed two years ago by Yuanhui Zhang and Les Christianson at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
By heating and pressurizing manure , they turned it into crude oil .
Boasting a manure - to - fuel efficiency of 70 percent , the researchers predicted that a single pig 's production - cycle excretions could yield 21 gallons of crude oil and a neat per-pig profit of $ 10 .
Multiply that by the 100 million pigs slaughtered each year in the
U.S. , and it's a billion - dollar industry .
And while the amount of oil produced would be relatively small in comparison to total U.S. fuel consumption , every drop counts – and it could help rehabilitate the
110 million tons of waste produced each year on U.S. hog farms .
Much of that waste ends up in rivers , and has fed the expansion of a New
Jersey - sized dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico .
That , however , remains hypothetical .
The NIST analysis showed that so - called pig manure crude is still quite crude .
It 's about 15 % water by volume , reducing its energy efficiency , and suffused with sulfur , heavy metals and nutritional supplements – all of which could end up back in the air .
Pig crude , said Bruno , is at present " less ' clean ' than petroleum - derived fuel .
Of course that will change if the process is tweaked . "
Such tweaks require further fine - grained analysis of the fuel – and though NIST is n't actually involved in its production , other researchers could use their methodology , which improved upon the so - called distillation curve traditionally used to measure fuel composition and performance .
As with regular distillation curves , Bruno 's team observed the fuel 's change during heating .
But they did so by heating the sample in precise gradations , broke down the energy and pollutant content of fuel burned at each stage of heating , and bombarded leftover char with neurons to detect the heavy metals inside .
That process gives an unusually clear picture of the fuel , and can be used to analyze other biofuels .
" Could that have a carbon emission impact , either in revising current estimates or improving fuel use ? " I asked .
" You betcha , " he said .

Business Groups , Defense Lawyers Launch Attack on Corporate Criminal Liability
22 Corporate Crime Reporter 28 , July 14 , 2008
A group of big business groups and corporate defense lawyers have launched a frontal attack on corporate criminal liability .
They have hired the former head of the Enron Task Force , Andrew Weissmann , to lead the assault .
Weissman is a partner at Jenner & Block in New York City .
And they have picked an obscure environmental crimes case as their vehicle .
The case is United States v. Ionia Management SA .
The company was convicted in 2007 of dumping waste oil and falsifying records and was fined $ 4.9 million .
The conviction was appealed to the Second Circuit .
And there , the Chamber of Commerce , the National Association of Manufacturers , and other business groups , jumped in .
They filed an amicus brief arguing that strict liability has no place in the criminal law .
That even if Ionia had the gold standard compliance program , it would n’t have mattered in this case because the standard jury instruction was used – that is – if even the lowest level employee acted illegally , that employee ’s intent would be imputed to the corporation .
And the corporation would be found guilty of the crime .
“ Let ’s assume you have a company that has these stellar , Grade A , gold standard compliance program – a program that the Department of Justice and the SEC would say is perfect , ” Weissmann said in an interview with Corporate Crime Reporter .
“ Under the current standard for corporate criminal liability , if the lowest level employee , in spite of that program , commits a crime – the company can be held criminally liable . ”
“ What is the point of that ?
There is nothing that you would ask the company to do differently in terms of its conduct .
It still has a great program .
There is no behavior that you are seeking to punish or deter .
And that is precisely because under the current standard , you are strictly liable .
And strict liability and criminal law usually do n’t go hand in hand . ”
What did the District Court do wrong ?
“ The court gave the standard instruction , which held the company strictly liable for the conduct of the employee , ” Weissmann says .
“ It did not allow the company to argue that it had an effective compliance program that was in place and that the individuals who may have committed the crime were acting in contravention of a policy that was not just on paper , but was in fact was enforced .
That ’s just a factual issue .
Whether the company could prove that to a jury is another question .
But the company was not even given the chance to argue that it was unfair to impute the intent of the employees to the company . ”
Weissmann would require the prosecution to prove that the corporation lacks “ effective policies and procedures to deter and detect criminal actions by their employees . ”
And he would restrict corporate criminal liability to where senior corporate officers are at fault .

Sure , it ’s easy enough for one person to attempt energy self - sufficiency : put a solar panel on your roof , run your car on biodiesel , and you ’re halfway there .
But how easy is it for an entire town to become self - sufficient ?
That ’s the question that Reynolds , Indiana has been trying to answer for the past 3 years .
In 2005 , Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels declared the town to be BioTown , USA — a model of energy self - sufficiency for the state .
The town was chosen mainly because of its small size ( pop. 547 ) , excellent rail and road access , and proximity to organic waste ( within 15 miles of more than 150,000 hogs ) .
According to the BioTown website , the finished project will showcase efficient methods of converting biomass into energy , use bioenergy to fuel homes and businesses throughout the town , promote alternative energies across the United States , and show that agricultural energy is safe , reliable , and consistent .
These are certainly some lofty goals for such a tiny town , and progress on the project has been slow .
In fact , external signs of energy independence in Reynolds have been few and far between .
So where does the project stand now ?
As of June 9th , the White County Area Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of a re-zoning to allow construction of a methane gas - producing digester .
This would use animal and human waste to create methane , which would power local homes and businesses .
However , there are still many hoops for the town to jump through before achieving energy independence .
While the proposed methane digester will be useful , it may not be enough .
And even if it is , the White County Commissioners still need to ultimately decide whether to approve the re-zoning request .
Reynolds is a prime example of why communities need to prepare for energy crises far in advance .
If it takes a prominent project such as BioTown , USA nearly 5 years to achieve their goal — with a population of 547 — how long will it take grassroots initiatives in larger towns and cities ?

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
A massive blast targeting the Danish Embassy in Pakistan Monday killed at least six people and wounded as many as 18 , authorities said .
The scene of devastation in Islamabad Monday after a suicide car bomb attack near the Danish Embassy .
The blast left a four - foot deep crater in the road .
Confusion lingered about the attack in the capital city of Islamabad and the number of casualties .
Police at the scene said a suicide car bomber pulled up next to the embassy at about 1 p.m. and detonated explosives .
But Senior Superintendent of Police Ahmad Latif told CNN that authorities could not immediately label it a suicide attack .
Likewise , a medical worker told CNN the explosion killed eight people , including a young child and at least one foreign national .
But Latif put the number of fatalities at six and said none of the dead were foreigners .
Among the wounded , he said , was a Brazilian citizen of Pakistani descent .
Watch Pakistan 's foreign minister respond »
Authorities differed on the number of wounded as well , with figures ranging from five to 18 .
No embassy official was seriously hurt , Latif said .
It is not uncommon for preliminary casualty figures to vary : police cautioned that the numbers could rise .
Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller condemned the act .
" My immediate reaction is that you can only condemn this , " said Stig Moeller .
" It is terrible that terrorists do this .
The embassy is there to have a cooperation between the Pakistani population and Denmark , and that means they are destroying that .
They 're destroying the Pakistanis ' ability to connect with Denmark .
It is completely unacceptable . "
Watch the aftermath of the deadly attack »
The blast , heard more than two miles away , sheared off the embassy 's front wall and kicked in its metal front gate .
The impact blew out the building 's windows and also damaged the offices of a non-profit organization .
The Danish and the EU flag , knocked off their staff , hung limply from a spot on the embassy balcony .
Pakistan Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir told reporters at the scene that police are beefing up security at embassies and foreign missions throughout the city .
" I just want to assure everybody that the government will do everything to protect the diplomatic missions and also the security and safety of the citizens of Pakistan , " he said .
The explosion was the first deadly attack in Islamabad since a bomb was hurled over a wall surrounding an Italian restaurant on March 15 .
That explosion killed a Turkish woman and wounded 12 people , including four U.S. FBI agents .
After Monday 's attack , dozens of cars -- blanketed with dirt kicked up by the blast -- littered the street , their windows knocked out .
Rescue workers carried away a bloodied person , covering his body with a blanket .
Pieces of shoes and tattered clothing lay amid the rubble .
Police said the attack targeted the embassy .
Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries , such as Pakistan , have been the scene of protests since Danish newspapers reprinted cartoons that Muslims say insult their prophet .
In February , several newspapers in Denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons of Islam 's prophet , Muhammad , after Danish authorities arrested several people who allegedly were plotting a " terror - related assassination " of the cartoonist , Kurt Westergaard .
Westergaard 's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse .
He said he wanted his drawing to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror .
However , many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist .
Islam generally forbids any depiction of the prophet -- even favorable ones -- fearing that it may lead to idolatry .
Two years ago , demonstrations erupted across the world after some newspapers printed the same cartoons .
Some protests turned deadly .
The protests prompted Danish officials to temporarily close the embassy in Islamabad .
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for Monday 's blast .
In the past , authorities have blamed Islamic militants for carrying out attacks inside Pakistani cities .
The country experienced a month - long lull in attacks after a new government took office in March and set on a course to negotiate with militants .
But since then , attacks have picked up again .
CNN 's Reza Sayah contributed to this report .
All About Terrorism • Pakistan
In his first television interview , German cannibal Armin Meiwes describes the taste of human flesh , provides a decent recipe for steak , explains his fascination with the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel — and insists that he ’s a normal person .
DDP Armin Meiwes , serving a life sentence for killing a man and eating more than 20 kilos of him , insists he is a normal guy .
Armin Meiwes , the German cannibal serving a life sentence for killing and eating a man who begged to be devoured , has described how the meat tasted of pork and how he prepared an elaborate meal of human steak in a green pepper sauce with croquettes and Brussels sprouts .
In his first television interview , broadcast on Monday night on the RTL channel , Meiwes , 46 , looked relaxed and healthy as he spoke about his decades - long yearning to consume another man .
The case came to light in December 2002 , and the grisly details made world headlines .
Meiwes filmed himself killing , disembowelling and cutting up the corpse of computer engineer Bernd Brandes , 42 , whom he had met after posting messages in Internet chatrooms seeking “ men for slaughter . ”
“ Yes , people who ca n’t think their way into this find it monstrous .
But in principle I ’m a normal human being , ” he told his interviewer Günter Stampf , who has written a book , “ Interview with a Cannibal , ” based on 30 meetings with Meiwes in jail .
The interviews were approved by the Frankfurt district court that convicted him .
“ I sauteed the steak of Bernd , with salt , pepper , garlic and nutmeg .
I had it with Princess croquettes , Brussels sprouts and a green pepper sauce , ” said Meiwes .
He said the meat was a little tough .
He froze meal - sized portions of Brandes , some in the form of minced meat , and ate more than 20 kilograms of it in the months following the March 2001 killing .
Lifelong Fantasies
During his two trials in 2004 and 2006 , Meiwes said he had always dreamt of having a younger brother — “ someone to be part of me ” — and had become fascinated with cannibalism as a way to fulfil that obsession .
His desires were fuelled by the Internet , where he had contact with around 400 men interested in cannibalism .
He found a perfect match in Brandes , who was obsessed with being eaten .
“ The first bite was of course a peculiar , indefinable feeling at first because I had yearned for that for 30 years , that this inner connection would be made perfect through this flesh , ” Meiwes said in the interview .
“ The flesh tastes like pork , a little bit more bitter , stronger .
It tastes quite good , ” he said .
He said that when he was a child , he had enjoyed his mother reading him the fairy tale “ Hansel and Gretel , ” about a witch who traps two children and prepares to eat the boy .
“ The bit where Hansel is to be eaten was interesting .
You would n’t believe how many Hansels are whizzing around the Internet . ”
Police estimate that around 10,000 people in Germany alone share Meiwes ’ fascination with cannibalism — either eating human flesh or being eaten .
Meiwes , serving his sentence in a prison in Kassel , central Germany , could be eligible for parole after serving a mandatory 15 years in jail .
A psychiatric examination conducted ahead of his trials concluded that he is not insane but has a “ severely disturbed soul . ”
“ I want to undergo therapy , I know I need that and I hope it will be done at some point , ” said Meiwes .

An Antarctic Total Solar Eclipse
Credit and Copyright : Fred Bruenjes ( moonglow.net )
Explanation : The Sun , the Moon , Antarctica , and two photographers all lined up in 2003 Antarctica during an unusual total eclipse of the Sun .
Even given the extreme location , a group of enthusiastic eclipse chasers ventured near the bottom of the world to experience the surreal momentary disappearance of the Sun behind the Moon .
One of the treasures collected was the above picture -- a composite of four separate images digitally combined to realistically simulate how the adaptive human eye saw the eclipse .
As the image was taken , both the Moon and the Sun peaked together over an Antarctic ridge .
In the sudden darkness , the magnificent corona of the Sun became visible around the Moon .
Quite by accident , another photographer was caught in one of the images checking his video camera .
Visible to his left are an equipment bag and a collapsible chair .
The New York Times ( NYT ) is in the business of changing the American culture , especially what it perceives as really bad American habits .
One of them is free speech .
In an article ( Unlike Others , U.S. Defends Freedom to Offend in Speech ) the NYT tried to address the issue of the different approach that American judicial system takes on the important issue of free speech .
The article is a marvelous study in the architecture of deceit .
What is omitted and what is included create a much distorted picture of the issue at hand .
It all starts in the first paragraph :
“ A couple of years ago , a Canadian magazine published an article arguing that the rise of Islam threatened Western values .
The article ’s tone was mocking and biting , but it said nothing that conservative magazines and blogs in the United States do not say every day without fear of legal reprisal . ”
What is excluded from this paragraph , and the rest of the article , is any mention to what was “ mocking and biting ” in the Maclean ’s article .
It ’s a very useful omission .
And it ’s all more useful since the article proceeds to talk about racial epithets , Nazi regalia , the American Nazi Party marching in Skokie , Ill. , Ku Klux Klan and other hateful stuff .
The reader is to infer that the content of the Maclean ’s article came pretty close to all of the above anathemas .
But if the NYT were to mention parts of the actual content of the Maclean ’s article it would make the American case for free speech .
Namely , that the effort to control or ban hateful speech ends up suppressing all speech no matter how well reasoned and defended .
Regulation and control of political speech by the state leads to its control by the governing elites and that ’s what the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution tries to avoid .
And this is precisely what the Maclean ’s case proves .
Here is another paragraph from the NYT piece :
“ But even Mr. Lewis , a liberal , wrote in his book that he was inclined to relax some of the most stringent First Amendment protections “ in an age when words have inspired acts of mass murder and terrorism . ”
In particular , he called for a re-examination of the Supreme Court ’s insistence that there is only one justification for making incitement a criminal offense : the likelihood of imminent violence . ”
Someone should inform Mr. Lewis where the people who commit “ acts of mass murder and terrorism ” come from .
Hint : countries with quite different traditions of free speech than the United States .
And here is another one :
“ Jason Gratl , a lawyer for the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Association of Journalists , which have intervened in the case in support of the magazine , was measured in his criticism of the law forbidding hate speech .
‘ Canadians do not have a cast - iron stomach for offensive speech , ” Mr. Gratl said in a telephone interview .
“ We do n’t subscribe to a marketplace of ideas .
Americans as a whole are more tough - minded and more prepared for verbal combat . ’”
We do know that the Canadian Association of Journalists does not subscribe to any sort “ of marketplace of ideas . ”
We can see that in the writing .
The uniform and compliant subscription to the command and control milieu of left - wing clichés proves as much .
Mr Bush was greeted by Mrs Merkel as he arrived in Germany US President George W Bush says he wants to pursue diplomacy to deal with Iran 's controversial nuclear programme , but " all options are on the table " .
Mr Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said further sanctions against Iran were possible .
" The first choice is to solve it diplomatically and that 's exactly what we 're doing , " Mr Bush said .
Mr Bush was speaking after talks in Germany and is now in Italy on what is likely to be his last tour of Europe .
His talks with Chancellor Merkel also covered Afghanistan , the Middle East peace process and the global issues of climate change and the cost of energy and food .
At their joint news conference in Meseberg , Mrs Merkel said : " We ca n't exclude further sanctions " against Iran , but they would have to be agreed in the UN Security Council .
" The last round [ of sanctions ] has to be put into effect , " she added .

On Tuesday , Mr Bush attended a summit with EU leaders in Slovenia , where they threatened Iran with further sanctions unless it suspended nuclear enrichment .
He said an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be " incredibly dangerous " to world peace .
Mr Bush is to meet Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Pope Benedict XVI in Rome on the latest leg of what is being seen as an eight - day farewell tour of Europe .
His arrival in Rome coincided with an anti-war march through the centre of the city to the American embassy .
The demonstration drew about 1,500 people and was peaceful - unlike a larger protest last year that saw scuffles between protesters and police .
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the authorities are taking no chances and exceptional security precautions are in place around the residence of the American ambassador where the president is staying .
Protesters called for an end to the Iraq war and for troops to come home A no - fly zone has been imposed over the city , tram and bus services have been diverted , and electronic devices will make it impossible to use mobile phones within a wide area while the president attends a series of official engagements within the city walls .
After meeting the Pope on Friday , President Bush will first travel to France and then to the UK .
During the trip , Mr Bush has held out the prospect of a global deal on combating climate change , which he said could be achieved by the end of his term in office in January .
Zimbabwe call
As well as issuing its warning on Iran , the leaders at the Slovenia summit discussed the crisis in Zimbabwe , urging the UN to send monitors to the country to check on its human rights situation ahead of the 27 June presidential run-off .
They also called for urgent progress in talks for a world trade deal , which European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said would be good for developing countries .

George W Bush on Iran
EU and US back in step Bush bids farewell Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue The UN Security Council has approved three rounds of sanctions against Iran .
These include asset restrictions and travel bans on Iranian individuals and companies said to be involved in nuclear work .
The sanctions also ban the sale to Iran of so - called dual - use items , which can have either a military or civilian purpose .
Barclays Bank , based in the UK , has already responded to such pressure and ended all dealings with Iran 's Saderat Bank and Bank Melli , which are on the US list of Specially Designated Nationals .
All US businesses trading with anyone on the SDN list must block their accounts immediately and end any business involvement .
Tehran meanwhile has told Iranian banks to transfer assets and investments from European banks to Iran 's central bank .

Consumerist 's Meg Marco sez , " One of our readers describes flying with no ID under the new TSA policy , first hand : "
After about 15 minutes , the main supervisor , Laurie , arrived .
Again , Laurie was exceedingly nice and professional , but seemed a little more concerned than Brenda .
She asked if I was sure I did n't have photo ID , like a credit card with my picture on it , or even a CostCo card .
I wound up going through my wallet in front of her to show that I did n't , and she pointed to various cards and receipts in it to ask if they were IDs .
I wound up showing her everything to prove I was telling the truth .
She repeatedly said they had no way of " verifying " that I was who I said I was , and that someone could have stolen my credit card and traveled under my name .
I did n't want to mention that they should n't need to verify who I am , because I was afraid they could then say I was n't cooperating and deny travel on that ground .
In fact , I even mentioned several times that I wanted to fully cooperate with them because I was aware that was a component of the new regulation , and they assured me that I was .
Finally satisfied that I did n't have ID , Laurie took my boarding pass and went away .
She came back a few minutes later having photocopied it , and also had an affidavit that she requested I sign .
It asked for my name and address , and stated in small print at the bottom that I did not have to fill it out , but if I did n't I could n't fly .
It also said that if I choose to fill it out and then provided false info , I would be in violation of federal law .
John Sneed 's farm is either a weed Waikiki or a hay fever sufferer 's Hades .
Ragweed and lamb 's quarters flourish on this hilltop 90 miles east of Kansas City , spreading their leaves luxuriously in the sun and sinking roots deep in the sandy loam .
Pigweed , horsetail and golden rod , unmolested by chemicals and cultivators , mature to robust adulthood , producing seeds that are spread by the wind .
Indeed , Mr. Sneed encourages all his weeds to breed .
Long ago Mr. Sneed discovered that weed pollen is worth a considerable amount to a handful of pharmaceutical manufacturers , who turn it into medications to diagnose and treat allergies .
Some weed pollen sells for $ 6 a gram .
In 1986 Mr. Sneed and two sons turned this runny - nose harvest into nearly $ 150,000 in cash .
Along with the soybeans , corn and livestock they produce , the Sneeds ' 800 - acre farm earns enough to support three families .
'' The dictionary defines a weed as an unwanted plant , '' said Mr. Sneed as he gingerly stepped across rows of milk weed and English plantain he sowed several weeks earlier .
'' As far as I 'm concerned we do n't have any weeds because I want them all . ''
Across the country , family farmers are turning away from traditional crops and livestock and finding new ways to earn money .
Mr. Sneed , though , is a rare breed who has discovered the delicious greed in weeds .
'' He 's the only commercial weed farmer I know of , and I would have heard if there are any others , '' said George M. Coleman , director of manufacturing for Hollister Stier , an allergy medicine manufacturer in Spokane , Wash . , and a division of Milses Incorporated , a pharmaceutical company in Elkhart , Ind .
Critics said the posters for tougher rules had racist undertones Voters in Switzerland have rejected a move to make it even harder for foreigners to obtain citizenship .
In a referendum , they voted 64 % against a bid to revive the practice of approving citizenship candidates by secret ballot and scrapping appeals .
Secret ballots were outlawed five years ago by the supreme court , which judged them to be discriminatory .
Switzerland has one of Europe 's highest numbers of foreign - born residents - more than 20 % .
Many Swiss said not allowing voters to have the final say on who became a citizen violated the country 's system of direct democracy , the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports from Berne .
However , opponents of Sunday 's poll , which was called by the nationalist Swiss People 's Party , suspect the real agenda behind it was not Swiss democracy , but how best to keep certain groups out of Switzerland , our correspondent adds .
Twelve years of residence Initial reporting of the poll results showed that the measure to raise the threshold for citizenship was soundly defeated , gaining approval in only one of Switzerland 's 26 cantons ( states ) .
Swiss laws on naturalisation are already tough .
Candidates for citizenship must live in Switzerland for at least 12 years , they have to pass tests in one of the official languages of the country , and culture , and those born in Switzerland have no automatic right to citizenship .
The final hurdle is approval by the local community , sometimes at a town meeting .
The supreme court outlawed secret ballots five years ago after it became clear that some towns were regularly rejecting candidates from the Balkans , Turkey and Africa , while approving those from Western Europe .
It also gave those rejected the right to appeal .
The Swiss People 's Party , the largest in parliament , wants the secret ballots back and the right to appeal removed .

OGDEN , Utah ( AP ) --
A man who kicked down a door to rescue a woman from a burning building was surprised at the greeting he received .
" She was mad at me for coming in , " said Allen Donehoo , a delivery man who noticed smoke billowing out of the building when he made a restaurant stop on Friday .
" I said , ' I 'm sorry , there 's a fire ' and tried to get her out .
She was n't coming too easily . "
Smoke was entering the basement apartment even as the woman resisted Donehoo 's rescue attempt .
Donehoo said she was worried about her cats , which he thinks were all rescued .
" I do n't think she realized the severity of it , " he said .
" The whole top of the building was in flames . "
The woman 's apartment was one of three in the home .
Investigators believe an unattended candle in one of the other apartments started the fire .
There were no injuries .

Mary Tillman has a message for the National Football League :
Help me find out what happened to my son .
Inspired to serve his country after 9/11 , Pat Tillman gave up a lucrative career with the Arizona Cardinals to join the Army in May 2002 .
As a Ranger , he participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom , then fought in Afghanistan , where he was killed in April 2004 .
Tillman ’s death was mourned coast to coast , and the public and his family were told by the Pentagon that he died a “ warrior ’s death ” charging up a hill , urging on his fellow Rangers .
His funeral was nationally televised , and Arizona Sen .
John McCain , now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , was among those delivering eulogies .
President Bush took time from his 2004 reelection campaign to address Cardinal fans on a Jumbotron during an emotional halftime ceremony in which the Arizona franchise retired Tillman ’s jersey number .
Yet the circumstances of his death turned out to be an obscene hoax .
Tillman was , in fact , killed by friendly fire .
Now , after six investigations and two congressional hearings , there remain many unanswered questions about Tillman ’s death and the Army ’s initial investigation of it .
His family has challenged the Bush administration , the Pentagon and the media to uncover the truth .
To keep the public pressure on , Mary Tillman has written a book , “ Boots on the Ground at Dusk : My Tribute to Pat Tillman . ”
In a recent interview with me , she was highly critical of the actions of the NFL because she believes it continues to bathe in the glory of her son ’s patriotic sacrifice while doing little to help the Tillman family find out how Pat died .
“ I think the [ NFL ] has not gone out of its way to help , ” she told me .
The league has “ exploited Pat , just like the military .
... [ It has ] a beautiful statue to him at the Cardinals ’ stadium .
I do n’t know if that ’s more for us or the [ NFL ] .
I feel like it ’s more for the league . ”
War and patriotism , of course , have long been associated with the culture of football .
Quarterbacks are routinely referred to as “ field generals ” who throw “ bullets ” and “ bombs . ”
Some coaches walk the sidelines with the gravity of a Gen. George Patton .
Military airplanes overfly many stadiums before games begin .
Military recruiters often set up booths at football facilities .
The NFL has seized on Pat Tillman as another way to connect with the red , white and blue sports fan .
Earlier this year , former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue brought together the NFL and the United Service Organizations to build the Pat Tillman USO Center at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
And the league just opened an exhibit dedicated to Tillman at its Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio .
Now the Tillmans want the NFL to help them speed up the latest congressional hearing into Pat Tillman ’s death .
The league certainly seems to have the clout to get things moving .
Owners of professional football teams are some of the wealthiest and best - connected people in the United States .
In the 2004 election cycle , NFL and other sports teams owners gave $ 14.6 million to Democrats and Republicans , as well as to independent political committees .
San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos gave a $ 4 - million donation to the Progress for America Voter Fund , which backed Bush .
As Kent Cooper of PoliticalMoneyLine , a nonpartisan research group , told USA Today , “ I do n’t think the public is generally aware that [ pro team owners ] give these big donations . ”
Last year , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , which is overseeing the inquiry , asked the administration for all documents related to Tillman ’s death and cover -up .
The administration gave the committee what it described as “ mostly press clippings ” because of “ executive branch confidentiality interests . ”
The committee ’s chairman , Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , and its ranking minority member , Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( R - Va. ) , protested that the documents shed virtually “ no light on these matters . ”
Meanwhile , 20 veterans who saw combat in Iraq and Afghanistan took the extraordinary step last August of writing a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , asking his help in securing the release of the requested documents .
Unfortunately , the league has not responded to Mary Tillman or the veterans .
“ If this [ a death of family member or friend under unclear circumstances ] had happened to any one of us , ” said Mary Tillman , “ Pat would have gone through a wall to find out the truth .
So , it ’s the least I can do and the least any one of us can do [ to find out how he died . ] ”
And that should include the National Football League and Goodell .
Dave Zirin is the author of “ Welcome to the Terrordome : The Pain , Politics and Promise of Sports . ”
SOME people would just as soon ignore the culinary potential of the Carolina flying squirrel or the Waldoboro green neck rutabaga .
To them , the creamy Hutterite soup bean is too obscure and the Tennessee fainting goat , which keels over when startled , sounds more like a sideshow act than the centerpiece of a barbecue .
But not Gary Paul Nabhan .
He has spent most of the past four years compiling a list of endangered plants and animals that were once fairly commonplace in American kitchens but are now threatened , endangered or essentially extinct in the marketplace .
He has set out to save them , which often involves urging people to eat them .
Mr. Nabhan ’s list , 1,080 items and growing , forms the basis of his new book , an engaging journey through the nooks and crannies of American culinary history titled “ Renewing America ’s Food Traditions : Saving and Savoring the Continent ’s Most Endangered Foods ” ( Chelsea Green Publishing , $ 35 ) .
The book tells the stories of 93 ingredients both obscure ( Ny’pa , a type of salt grass ) and beloved ( the Black Sphinx date ) , along with recipes that range from the accessible ( Centennial pecan pie ) to the challenging ( whole pit- roasted Plains pronghorn antelope ) .
Justice Undone
I did n’t get my man , but I helped to remind people what he ’s done .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 3rd June 2008 .
I realise now that I did n’t have a hope .
I had almost reached the stage when two of the biggest gorillas I have ever seen swept me up and carried me out of the tent .
It was humiliating , but it could have been worse .
The guard on the other side of the stage , half hidden in the curtains , had spent the lecture touching something under his left armpit .
Perhaps he had bubos .
I had no intention of arresting John Bolton , the former under-secretary of state at the US State Department , when I arrived at the Hay Festival .
But during a panel discussion about the Iraq war , I remarked that the greatest crime of the 21st century had become so normalised that one of its authors was due to visit the festival to promote his book .
I proposed that someone should attempt a citizens ’ arrest , in the hope of instilling a fear of punishment among those who plan illegal wars .
After the session I realised that I could n’t call on other people to do something I was n’t prepared to do myself .
I knew that I was more likely to be arrested and charged than Mr Bolton .
I had no intention of harming him , or of acting in any way that could be interpreted as aggressive , but had I sought only to steer him gently towards the police I might have faced a range of exotic charges , from false imprisonment to aggravated assault .
I was prepared to take this risk .
It is not enough to demand that other people act , knowing that they will not .
If the police , the courts and the state fail to prosecute what the Nuremberg tribunal described as “ the supreme international crime ” ( 1 ) , I believe we have a duty to seek to advance the process ( 2 ) .
The Nuremberg Principles , which arose from the prosecution of the Nazi war criminals , define as an international crime the “ planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties , agreements or assurances ” ( 3 ) .
Bolton appears to have “ participated in a common plan ” to prepare for the war ( also defined by the principles as a crime ) by inserting the false claim that Iraq was seeking to procure uranium from Niger into a State Department fact sheet ( 4,5 ) .
He also organised the sacking of Jose Bustani , the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( 6,7 ) .
Bustani had tried to broker a peaceful resolution of the dispute over Iraq ’s alleged weapons of mass destruction ( 8 ) .
Some of the most pungent criticisms of my feeble attempt to bring this man to justice have come from other writers for the Guardian .
Michael
White took a position of extraordinary generosity towards the instigators of the war ( 9 ) .
There are “ arguments on both sides ” , he contended .
Bustani might have received compensation after his sacking by Bolton , “ but Bolton says that does not mean much .
That is sometimes true . ”
In fact Bustani was not only compensated at his tribunal ; he was completely exonerated of Bolton ’s charges and his employers were obliged to pay special damages ( 10 ) .
White suggested that Iraq might indeed have been seeking uranium from Niger , on the grounds of a conversation he once had with an MI6 officer .
Alongside the British government ’s 45 - minute claim , this must be the best - documented of all the false justifications for the war with Iraq .
In 2002 , the US government sent three senior officials to Niger to investigate the claim ( 11 ) .
All reported that it was without foundation .
The International Atomic Energy Agency discovered that it was based on crude forgeries ( 12 ) .
This assessment was confirmed by the State Department ’s official Greg Thielmann ( 13 ) , who reported directly to John Bolton ( 14 ) .
No evidence beyond the forged documents has been provided by either the US or the UK governments to support their allegation .
White also gives credence to Bolton ’s claims that the war in 2003 was justified by two UN resolutions – 678 and 687 – which were approved in 1990 and 1991 , and that it was permitted by Article 51 of the UN Charter .
The attempt to revive resolutions 678 and 687 was the last , desperate throw of the dice by the Blair government when all else had failed .
When it became clear that it could not obtain a new UN resolution authorising force against Iraq , the government dusted down the old ones , which had been drafted in response to Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait .
This revival formed the basis of Lord Goldsmith ’s published advice on 17th March 2003 .
It was described as “ risible ” and “ scrap[ing ] the bottom of the legal barrel ” by Lord Alexander , the former chair of the Bar Council ( 15 ) .
After the first Gulf War , Colin Powell , General Sir Peter de la Billiere and John Major all stated that the UN ’s resolutions permitted them only to expel the Iraqi army from Kuwait , and not to overthrow the Iraqi government ( 16 ) .
Lord Goldsmith himself , in the summer of 2002 , advised Tony Blair that resolutions 678 and 687 could not be used to justify a new war with Iraq ( 17 ) .
Article 51 of the UN Charter is comprehensible to anyone but the lawyers employed by the Bush administration .
States have a right to self - defence “ if an armed attack occurs against ” them , and then only until the UN Security Council can intervene .
On what occasion did Iraq attack the United States ?
Is there any claim made by the Blair and Bush governments that Michael White is not prepared to believe ?
Conor Foley , writing on Comment is Free , suggested that my action “ completely trivializes the serious case ” against the Iraq war ( 18 ) and claimed that I was seeking to “ imprison … people because of their political opinions ” ( 19 ) , as if Bolton were simply a commentator on the war , and not an agent .
Does he really believe that the former under - secretary did not “ participate in a common plan ” to initiate the war with Iraq ?
What other conceivable purpose might the State Department ’s misleading fact sheet have served ?
And what more serious action can someone who is neither a Law Lord nor a legislator take ?
Bolton himself maintains that my attempt to bring him to justice reflects a “ move towards lawlessness and fascism . ” ( 20 ) This is an interesting commentary on an attempt to uphold a law which arose from the prosecution of fascists .
But there is one charge I do accept : that my chances of success were very slight .
Apart from the 300 - pound gorillas , the main obstacle I faced was that although the crime of aggression , as defined by the Nuremberg Principles , has been incorporated into the legislation of many countries , it has not been assimilated into the laws of England and Wales ( 21 ) .
This does not lessen the crime but it means that it can not yet be tried here .
This merely highlights another injustice : while the British state is prepared to punish petty misdemeanors with vindictive ferocity , it will not legislate against the greatest crime of all , lest it expose itself to prosecution .
But demonstration has two meanings .
Non-violent direct action is both a protest and an exposition .
It seeks to demonstrate truths which have been overlooked or forgotten .
I sought to remind people that the greatest crime of the 21st Century remains unprosecuted , and remains a great crime .
If you have read this far , I have succeeded .

The most startling thing about developing with the Django on the Google App Engine is how similar the simple things are .
On the App Engine a concise front page view might look like this :
from snippet . models import Snippet def index ( request ) : recent = Snippet . all ( ) . order ( " - entry_time " ) [ : 5 ] return render_to_response ( ' snippets/index.html ' , { ' recent ' : recent } , RequestContext ( request , { } ) )
Translating this to a normal Django view involves only one change : Snippets.all ( ) .order ( " - entry_time ' ) [ : 5 ] becomes Snippets.all ( ) .order_by ( '- entry_time ' ) [ : 5 ] .
That is the comforting side of the Google App Engine : in most cases someone used to Django can simply start coding with occasional glimpses at the documentation .
However , that does n't really tell the whole story .
Fortunately , I 'm in a storytelling mood , so we 'll delve a bit deeper than the superficial " It 's the Same Damn Thing " angle1 .
Actually , it turns out that really addressing the differences here involves telling two stories : the first is a short one about the Google App Engine platform , and the second is a longer one looking at Django on the Google App Engine .
The Google App Engine Platform
The platform is the real attraction of the App Engine .
This is because Google has made it amazingly simple to develop and deploy applications .
If the Google App Engine had instead been free access to world - class dedicated servers , I do n't think it would be nearly as appealing to developers2 as the present incarnation .
Easy Deployment
Quite simply , the platform handles all the messiness of deployment for you ( what was my PostgreSQL username again , and what did I name the tables , and why did SSH stop accepting my key for automatic login anyway ? ) .
Its difficult to believe how easy the deployment process is .
You fill in a simple YAML file , and then run a simple command at the command line .
Or , you can use an even simpler GUI to handle the deployment .
The upload and syncing may take a minute or two , but your involvement is all of five seconds long , and utterly painless .
BigTable
Not only does GAE free you from most of the difficulties of deployment , it also shields you from many of the details of managing scaling .
You wo n't be setting up servers or sharding your database , instead you 'll just pay more money to Google .
Or , at least that is the dream scenario of using BigTable instead of cluster of relational databases .
Exactly how well the scaling will work out has yet to be seen , and the keys to successful scaling ( or at minimum the keys to failure ) will still be firmly in the hands of the developers and their application design choices .
This will be an interesting area to watch once several GAE applications become successful and start placing higher demands on the platform .
Also -- as a brief aside -- there is definitely an open niche for a few rocking tutorials on how to design models for BigTable .
Google Accounts & Mail
Another benefit , although probably far less important in the long run , is the ability to integrate with Google Accounts and send email via Google 's mail servers .
For applications oriented towards technical users , the former is a great feature , since most people in that group will already have a Google account3 .
In less technical user groups , I suspect the penetration of Google accounts is much lower , but it will still be a helpful option .
The ability to send emails with Google 's servers is a nice little benefit as well , and sufficiently necessary for many webapps that using GAE without the ability would have been rather difficult .
Other than saying " I 'm glad I wo n't have to set up Postfix " there is n't too much more to say on that account .
Now that we 've looked at the Google App Engine platform briefly , lets move on and look at the joys and sorrows of deploying Django on the Google App Engine .
Django on the Google App Engine
The previous segment began by saying the platform is the real attraction of the App Engine , but inevitably the source of its gifts is also the source of its inconveniences and frustrations .
Django and GAE are not bad bedfellows , but GAE does have the tendency to steal the sheets sometimes .
The larger a framework grows the less agile it becomes .
People often bemoan this point about Ruby on Rails with glum frowns and comments like " It works really well when you do what it wants you to . "
Django has largely avoided that fate because of its design goal of having interchangable components ( use your own templating system , use your own ORM , etc ) , but it is not immune to the underlying problem : standardization makes it easy to repeat , but hard to adapt .
Even though its possible to use only a subset of Django , doing so invalidates your existing experience with the pieces that are being replaced .
Thus Django developers coming over to the GAE have to adjust their eyes to grok the new environment , even though it is filled with mostly familiar sights .
Models and BigTable
The biggest change for Django developers is the model framework : Django's ORM has been replaced with something of Google 's design .
This is a necessary change because the models are no longer existing in a relational database but are instead existing in BigTable , but this is also the place where attempts to port an application from Django@Elsewhere to Django@GoogleAppEngine will run into the most resistance .
For an example , lets look at part of the Snippet model I use in my simple syntax highlighting app on GAE .
from appengine_django.models import BaseModel from google.appengine.ext import db CHOICES = ( ' Scheme ' , ' Python ' , ' Ruby ' ) # etc , etc class Snippet ( BaseModel ) : title = db .
StringProperty ( required = True ) highlighter = db .
StringProperty ( required = True , default = ' Python ' , choices = CHOICES ) content = db .
TextProperty ( required = True ) url_hash = db .
StringProperty ( ) parent_hash = db .
StringProperty ()
Instead of storing a direct link to the parent Snippet , I am storing the parent 's hash .
This means I can build a link to the parent Snippet without doing an additional query .
But how would I get the parent 's title ?
Well , one way to do it would be like this :
from django .
shortcuts import render_to_response from models import Snippet def view_snip ( request , hash ) : snip = Snippet . all ( ) . filter ( " url_hash = " , hash ) parent = Snippet . all ( ) . filter ( " url_hash = " , snip .
parrent_hash ) return render_to_response ( ' snippets/snippet_detail.html ' , { ' object ' : snip , ' parent_title ' : parent .
title } , RequestContext ( request , { } ) )
But doing it that way is the relational database way , and since we 're using BigTable , it turns out that is now know as the wrong way .
Instead , we ' retrieve ' the parent 's name by preemptively storing it in the child .
Thus we would change the model to look like this :
class Snippet ( BaseModel ) : title = db .
StringProperty ( required = True ) highlighter = db .
StringProperty ( required = True , default = ' Python ' , choices = CHOICES ) content = db .
TextProperty ( required = True ) url_hash = db .
StringProperty ( ) parent_hash = db .
StringProperty ( ) parent_title = db .
StringProperty ()
And we would do the necessary fetching once and only once when we created the Snippet .
# assuming parent_hash variable exists in environment new_snip = form . save ( commit = False ) parent = Snippet . all ( ) . filter ( " url_hash = " , parent_hash ) snip .
parent_hash = parent_hash snip .
parent_title = parent .
title
This feels a little awkward for someone used to relational databases -- I mean what the hell , why are you caching data in the model itself ?-- but this is how BigTable is best utilized : duplicate data to avoid extra lookups .
For data that changes very frequently , then it may become necessary to fetch that data frequently ( at which point you would start using a different kind of caching : memcached ) , but often simple data redundency is sufficiently flexible to substantially reduce the quantity of performed lookups .
Certainly , this data redundancy also brings with it certain costs .
For example , what do you do if you change the title of a Snippet ?
Well , you have to change the title for the Snippet itself , and for each of its children snippets .
The code might look something like this :
def update_title ( hash , title ) : parent = Snippet . all ( ) . filter ( " url_hash = " , hash ) parent .
title = title parent . put ( ) for snip in Snippet . all ( ) . filter ( " parent_hash = " , hash ) : snip .
parent_title = title snip . put ()
Which is , in all fairness , pretty ugly .
The cost and benefit of this kind of data duplication is going to depend entirely on how much your data is duplicated ( if the average Snippet has zero children , then it has no performance cost , although there is a programmer cost for writing the extra code ) , and how often you make changes ( if a Snippet ca n't change its title , all the sudden the inconveniences become irrelevant ) .
I think the most important thing to remember here is that different caching and design patterns will be necessary to use BigTable effectively .
This is the least cosmetic difference caused by using Django on Google App Engine , and one that needs to be carefully considered while designing an application to run on GAE .
Django.contrib.* and Middleware
Another chunk of Django functionality that is not available on Google App Engine is many of the middlewares and django .
contrib apps .
The authentication and sessions frameworks in particular will be missed .
As one would expect , Google does provide workable -- and in some places perhaps more useful - - replacements , but its yet another piece of Django that has been replaced and will have to be relearned by switchers to GAE .
Unlike the mismatch between BigTable and relational databases , the difference here is between details instead of concepts .
A ported app will need to have chunks rewritten , but the apps themselves -- for the most part -- wo n't need to be redesigned .
Django Helper Project
There are many links and vague but optimistic praises for the Django Helper project which aims to abstract away differences between Django@Elsewhere and Django@GAE .
In the end , I think its a somewhat misguided -- although well intentioned and at times helpful - - effort .
The problem is that creating a layer of abstraction on top of two different things will lead to the minimal subset of both .
Imagine trying to create a library that abstracted away whether you were using Git or Mercurial for your repository : you 'd lose out on the unique features of both , and end up with something less compelling than either on its own .
My experience is that the helper does n't quite work as advertised in a variety of ways , and it makes more sense to do what you can with Django , and then use the Google framework components to supplement Django , rather than pouring a third blend of the two into the koolaid .
Ending Thoughts
Really , I had a very positive experience developing with the Google App Engine , and I 'm looking forward to refining my existing project , and to trying out new projects on it as well .
It eliminates the pain of deploying webapps , which is usually the most difficult -- or at least most capital intense -- part of pushing out a new project .
Before the AppEngine I had two choices for pushing out projects with a small budget ( for the most part consisting of small personal projects ) :
put it on a VPS and pay more $ 20 - $ 40 per month , or put it on a shared host and accept often abysmal performance .
Now , Google App Engine has given me a third option with most of the benefits of the first two , and for that I am grateful .
Whether the barrier to web applications needed to be lowered even further is a discussion for another day , but GAE is certainly an exciting experiment to observe and to participate in .
If you have tried developing with GAE , what were your impressions ?
Do you think it will be a viable platform for webapps ?
According to Wikizine , Wikimedia Foundation websites bring in an astonishing estimated 7 billion + page views per month between Wikipedias and other Wikimedia pages .
This means that for each of the 1.1 billion individuals on the planet who use the internet , Wikimedia sites get an average of five page views per month .
It would also mean that there are more monthly page views than there are people on Earth .
Wikipedia , the most well - known Wikimedia site accounts for only a fraction of this traffic .
Wikinews , Wikisources , Wikiquotes , Wiktionaries and 700 + other Wikimedia projects also contribute to this amazing page view statistic .
If all of these were counted as one by Alexa , chances are the Wikimedia Foundation would outdo Wikipedia ’s already incredibly high Alexa rank .
In other words , if this series of sub-communities were to be treated as a whole it would likely constitute the largest and most visited online ‘ world ’ in the world !
Of course , Wikipedia has spawned a number of interesting offshoot , knock - off and parody communities such as the Uncyclopedia , a content - free encyclopedia that anyone can edit with strange pages on a variety of subjects , real and fake .
This site is somewhere between a spoof of Wikipedia and a take - off on fake news producers like The Onion .
Of course the Uncyclopedia is one of a great number of official and unofficial Wikis on all kinds of subjects .
“ The ice creams produced with the new methods are simply better than any ice creams have ever been , ” Professor Goff said .
“ Quite definitely better in texture , and much better tasting . ”
A tasting by the staff of the Dining section found the Breyers Light Double Churned chocolate ice cream bar with the ice - structuring protein very creamy , even dense .
It was the favorite of five ice cream bars tasted .
The Häagen - Dazs Light and the Breyers Light chocolate ice cream , using low - temperature extrusion , were also very creamy and did not seem to be low - fat .
But tasters found that the new ice creams still lagged behind full - fat versions in flavor .
“ The quest has always been for the taste and texture of full - fat ice cream , ” said Tyler Johnston of Edy’s .
“ Since the 1980 ’s it ’s been about adding ingredients , ” he said , referring to the gels and gums that commercial producers churn into reduced - fat ice cream to improve and stabilize its texture .
“ Now we have a complicated process , but the recipe can be simplified , ” he added , referring to the industrial freezers that reduce the ice cream from minus 5 to minus 25 degrees Celsius for low - temperature extrusion .
The public seems persuaded .
Shelf space for Dreyer ’s / Edy ’s Slow Churned , Breyers Light Double Churned and Häagen - Dazs Light has consistently expanded since they appeared .
The category to which they belong , reduced fat , is the only part of the ice cream market that has been increasing in sales .
As defined by the F.D.A. , light or reduced - fat products can contain up to half the fat grams and two - thirds the calories of the original .
( For a product like Häagen - Dazs dulce de leche ice cream , this means a reduction from 18 fat grams to 7 in the Light line ; a low - fat product can have no more than three fat grams per serving . )
While full - fat ice cream still makes up more than 65 percent of the total market , the International Dairy Foods Association says that sales in the category have been flat for three years and that sales of low - fat and nonfat ice cream have gone down in the same period .
Professor Goff said that outside the United States the significance of the new technologies would be noted not on the palate but on the pallet .
“ American companies are getting ready to export ice cream to China , India , the Philippines , ” he said .
“ These are places that have very real cold - chain issues , ” he said , referring to the challenge of keeping ice cream consistently frozen throughout the shipping process .
Products produced with the new technologies are less affected by partial thawing than traditional ice creams , which become dry , sticky and hard in fluctuating temperatures .
( This is why letting a container of ice cream thaw on the counter before scooping it is a bad idea . )
Bill Clinton has been placing blame on enemies including a brazenly biased media that tried to suppress blue - collar votes , a deep - pocketed anti-war group that endorsed rival Barack Obama and weak - willed party leaders .
Bill Clinton 's enemies list
Listen to audio of Bill Clinton 's conference call below .
With Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign on the verge of defeat , Bill Clinton has been placing blame on enemies including a brazenly biased media that tried to suppress blue - collar votes , a powerful anti-war group that endorsed rival Barack Obama and weak - willed party leaders unable to stand up to either of these nefarious forces .

Pieced together from the former president ’s public remarks at his wife ’s campaign events and a private conversation last week with top donors to her campaign , the theory goes something like this :
After Hillary recovered from a string of losses to rival Barack Obama with March 4 wins in Texas and Ohio , powerful forces conspired to pressure the superdelegates who will decide the nomination to back Obama by discouraging her supporters from voting and trying to hide evidence proving she would fare better than Obama against presumptive GOP nominee John McCain
While the former president has offered parts of this theory publicly , he fleshed it out more explicitly during a conference call last week with maxed - out donors to his wife ’s campaign , a recording of which has been obtained by Politico .
Hear Bill Clinton 's call
After rattling off a series of poll numbers showing Hillary Clinton faring better than Obama against McCain , Bill Clinton told donors : “ We are in the strongest conceivable position electorally and not in a good fix with the superdelegates , because they have felt all the pressure from the Obama side , from the media , from the MoveOn crowd — who they think is an automatic ATM machine for everybody for life .
So , they ’re reluctant to take on all that . ”
While the campaign has been blasting the media for weeks for prematurely calling the race for Obama , President Clinton has added a new entry to his enemy list : MoveOn.org , the anti-war group that endorsed Obama and that , through its political action committee , has raised millions for Democratic candidates , money the Clintons apparently believe has unfairly purchased superdelegate support for Obama .
Campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson offered another interpretation , telling Politico that “ the president was referring to efforts online to pressure superdelegates in support of Sen. Obama , ” pointing to a petition the group circulated in February asking superdelegates to “ let the voters decide between Clinton and Obama , then support the people 's choice . ”
That means supporting the candidate with the most pledged delegates , said MoveOn spokeswoman Ilyse Hogue , who would n’t comment on Clinton ’s charge , except to say that “ we respect the president very much . ”
Hillary Clinton has privately complained about MoveOn before , at a small fundraiser held after the Super Tuesday primaries .
“ They flood into these caucuses and dominate them and really intimidate people who actually show up to support me , ” she said , according to an audio recording obtained by Huffington Post .
In the recording , she also refers to the MoveOn 's fundraising prowess , telling donors that " MoveOn.org endorsed [ Obama ] , which is like a gusher of money that never seems to slow down . "
On his call with donors , President Clinton also directed his fire at the media , asserting that he ’s “ never seen anybody persist against greater odds and against a more hostile media environment and a more imbalanced one ” than the one Hillary Clinton has faced .
This elaborated , or at least amplified , a theme Clinton has been asserting at least since her lopsided loss in North Carolina and surprisingly narrow win in Indiana on May 6 .
“ It ’s over , bag it .
And the rest of you poor folks , you just get in line and stay home ” is how he characterized the media coverage while introducing his wife at an event in Lexington , Ky. , on the eve of the May 20 primaries in Kentucky and Oregon .

“ No , ” his wife ’s supporters shouted in near unison .
Clinton asked the crowd to remember “ every time you turn on the television and you listen to one of those people dissin ’ her , they all have a college degree .
They ’ve all got a good job .
They all got health care .
And they ’re having no trouble fillin’ up their gas tank . ”
He began the Lexington speech by declaring that “ by their own admission , this has been the most slanted press coverage in American history . ”
And this week at a rally in Fort Thompson , S.D. , which — along with Montana — votes Tuesday in the last primaries of the campaign , he posed the query , “ Why are they doing this ? ”
He answered his own question : “ Because if you vote for her and she does well in Montana and she wins in Puerto Rico , when this is over , she will be ahead in the popular vote .
And they ’re trying to get her to cry uncle before the Democratic Party has to decide what to do in Florida and Michigan . ”
That could happen Saturday , when a Democratic National Committee panel will meet to decide whether — and how — to allocate delegate votes from the two states , which were stripped of their say in the nominating process for scheduling their primaries before the DNC wanted .
Clinton won both states , though Obama was n’t on the ballot in Michigan and neither candidate actively campaigned in Florida , and Team Clinton asserts she ’d win both in a general election against McCain .
“ She will win the general election if you nominate her .
They 're just trying to make sure you don't , " Bill Clinton said at the Fort Thompson event .
" It is just frantic the way they are trying to push and pressure and bully all these superdelegates to come out . ”
He then began impersonating an intimidated superdelegate : “ Oh , this is so terrible :
The people , they want her .
Oh , this is so terrible :
She is winning the general election , and he is not .
Oh my goodness , we have to cover this up . "
But on the donor call , he asserted such coverage may be starting to help his wife .
“ It began to backfire on them in the states where people get it , ” he said .
“ I think it actually helped her run up numbers in Kentucky and West Virginia because people were tired of turning on the TV every night and told to get in line or stay home and told that they did n’t matter and that they really did n’t have good sense and they were , after all , just poor blue - collar workers — what did they know ? ”
“ It turned out they knew quite a lot about who would be the best president , ” he continued , asserting that his wife “ has performed magnificently since March 4 , when we got back in this race . …
She has worked her heart out . ”
As has Bill Clinton , according to campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe .
Introducing Clinton on the donor call , McAuliffe said “ nobody has worked harder on this campaign than President Clinton .
He has worked as hard as he did when he was president of the United States . "

Jeffrey Archer is in India on a eleven day six - city trip to promote his latest ( 14th ) novel A Prisoner Of Birth , which he says is modern day version of The Count of Monte Cristo .
( Click on the picture for the Video )
Undoubtedly Indian crowd has charmed him just the way he has charmed the Indian crowd .
Many of us have grown up reading his novels .
His fans in India affectionately call him Sachin Tendulkar of Books .
Sachin Tendulkar he is indeed , after giving so many best selling and popular hits .
What does Archer wish from India ?
Well , he wants to be sold at traffic signals across India .
“ That ’s where , I am told , the top selling authors are sold , ” he says jokingly .
Archer has been one of the best loved authors worldwide .
Even after 30 years of its publication , Kane and Abel is still in demand .
27 million copies of Kane and Abel have been sold and still counting .
He sells almost a 1000 copies a day !
Says Archer , “ a trip to India was more important than one to the U.S.
There are more readers in India than the U.S.
With some 200 millions readers here , that is almost the size of the U.S. population .
There are at least 50 million serious readers in this country .
For me Japan was a big market , but India is emerging as huge now .
I got some 5,40,000 hits on my website last month and almost a quarter were from India .
I am read in 131 languages across 137 countries .
Indian rights are very important to me .
I would love to have a Tamil , a Hindi or a Malayalam version of my latest book . ”
Archer writes for two hours daily .
Though to complete the first draft of A Prisoner of Birth he wrote eight hours every day for 50 days non-stop .
The book has 17 drafts .
Jeffrey Archer has never been short of controversies .
At times , his stories are based on his real life experiences .
A Prisoner of Birth is one such story .
Set in Belmarsh prison , where Archer himself was imprisoned after being convicted of perjury and intending to pervert the course of justice in 2001 .
Some of the characters in this novel have been based on people he met during his prison stint , a period he also sees as one that has had advantages .
“ I realised how privileged I had been , and how we are all prisoners of our births . ”
Archer has been accused of using his wife ’s writings , to which he responds , “ Ridiculous .
Just rubbish .
She is a scientist .
She knows nothing about the kind of books I write .
I wrote three books in prison , she could not have written them for me . ”
What ’s next ?
Archer is working “ a script ” for a film that he intends to turn into a novel shortly .
To be directed by Bruce Beresford , Archers intends to wrap it up shortly .
It is based on a real person , a first for Archer .
BAGHDAD 
An American marine guarding a checkpoint on the western outskirts of Falluja handed out coins with an Arabic translation of a biblical verse to Iraqis entering the city , angering residents and city leaders who denounced it as a serious affront to Islam and an attempt to convert them to Christianity .
As the Marines quickly apologized on Thursday for the episode , Sunni guerrillas struck several times in northern Iraq , killing at least 19 people in two suicide bombings .
Gunmen near Tikrit also used a water tanker to attack an Iraqi checkpoint , but the Iraqi security forces repelled the assault and killed 14 attackers .
In Falluja , a city just west of Baghdad , the Marines pledged to discipline the marine who handed out the coins , which were inscribed with one of the Bible ’s most widely known verses , John 3:16 : “ For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish , but have eternal life . ”
American military officials in Baghdad emphasized Thursday that military regulations barred service members in Iraq from “ proselytizing any religion , faith or practices . ”
I found the following text on a website selling a fuel hydrogenation device .
I wo n’t like to the site , because the device they ’re promoting is almost certainly a scam :
“ Increase your gas mileage 20 - 90 % by adding a supplemental hydrogen generator to your car !
A supplemental hydrogen generator works simply enough – you put distilled water in a special canister in your car , and electricity from your car ’s battery is used to separate that water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The hydrogen is added to your car ’s fuel because hydrogen burns very well ( hydrogen is a very combustible gas ) , and it reduces the amount of gas you use !
The oxygen is added to the air your car breathes in .
Oxygen is needed for combustion , and more of it makes your car more efficient .
One gallon of water is enough to provide oxygen and hydrogen for hundreds of miles ! ”
While there is some science to support adding hydrogen to fuel to improve combustion , the people selling these devices are usually full of …beans .
Here ’s more information about hydrogenated fuels , how they can work , and some advice about spotting a scam .
Adding Hydrogen To Fuel Can Boost Fuel Economy
When fuel and air are mixed together in the cylinder of your engine , you get combustion .
Combustion – which is a fancy word for “ controlled explosion ” – generates force to move a piston , as well as heat .
Of course , different types of fuel combust differently , and this means that altering the chemical composition of fuel can have a pretty big impact on the combustion process .
If we ’re talking about a diesel combustion process that uses diesel fuel , than there ’s quite a bit of evidence that adding hydrogen to this fuel can improve diesel fuel economy :
DynaCERT , which makes fuel hydrogenation devices for commercial diesel trucks , has provided documentation that their devices save fuel
Popular Mechanics has reported similar claims from another device company HyTech Power
Both DynaCERT and Popular Mechanics explain that , because hydrogen combusts more quickly than diesel , adding hydrogen to diesel fuel can improve engine efficiency .
The fast - burning hydrogen additive ensures more complete combustion , to the point that fuel economy can improve as much as 20 % .
While there ’s a dearth of research to support these claims ( I challenge anyone to find a paper about this technology on SAE.org ) , it ’s hard to argue with performance guarantees or 3rd party testing lab results .
There ’s every reason in the world to take these companies at their word .
But for every company like DynaCERT or HyTech Power , there ’s at least one charlatan hawking “ HHO Kits ” that promise to turn water into fuel , with fantastic promises about fuel economy improvements ( like the 90 % promised in the copy at the top of this article ) .
It ’s impossible to believe .
Why Adding Hydrogen To Gasoline Probably Wo n’t Help You
While there is research to suggest that adding hydrogen to gasoline can boost flame speed and enhance combustion ( see this paper , this paper , or this paper from way back in 1936 ) , it ’s unlikely that anyone with a modern gas powered car would see much benefit from hydrogenated fuel .
This is because modern gasoline engines are designed to keep combustion temperatures down , thus negating a lot of the hydrogenation benefit .
If you study the three papers linked to above , you ’ll learn that hydrogen has the following impacts :
The amount of heat from the combustion process increases
This additional heat makes the process more efficient , but it increases the amount of NOx formed during combustion ( NOx is nitrogen oxide , a pollutant )
Because NOx is a pollutant , most modern car engines are designed to stop it from forming .
This is done with EGR ( exhaust gas recirculation ) , which pumps exhaust gases into the engine cylinder before combustion .
These exhaust gases reduce power , intentionally reducing the amount of fuel and air in the cylinder in order to keep temperatures down .
So , basically , pumping hydrogenated gasoline into your engine might * increase combustion temperatures .
But if it does , the EGR system on a modern car is going to respond by putting more exhaust gases into the cylinder .
* Might is the key word here , because there ’s no proof of this actually occurring .
Modern engines are carefully designed and tuned to maximize efficiency while keeping combustion temperatures low , so it may be that adding hydrogen to a carefully designed engine has very little impact .
So , Are Hydrogen Kits A Scam ?
The short answer is maybe .
If it ’s a device sold by a reputable company with supporting third party research and / or some sort of performance guarantee ?
If so , it ’s probably legit .
DynaCERT , for example , has ample evidence to support it ’s claims .
If it ’s a device offered by “ some guy ” on Amazon or eBay , with absolutely no supporting third party research ?
You can throw it in the scam bucket and move on .
If the kit seller promises 90 % improvement in fuel economy ?
Forget about it .
DynaCERT , for example , says that 20 % is the most they ’ve seen .
Research suggests the average benefit is closer to a single digit percentage .
So , somewhere between 5 % and 20 % is within reason .
Anything beyond that is just beans .
Suffice to say , if you ’re looking at a hydrogen kit for your car , truck , SUV , or Peterbilt , it ’s a very good idea to ask for documentation , find out what the refund policy is , and check all the sources they provide .
And if the company claims more than 20 % improvement in fuel economy , it ’s probably a scam .
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act which was passed in the House of Representatives is now heading to the Senate and is slated for passage .
The bill will assemble two bodies to identify and recommend methods of dealing with those who are too radicalized or deemed enemies of the state .
The Southern Poverty Law Center says that membership in hate filled fringe groups is on the rise – groups that advocate genocide and armed revolution .
This is cause for very deep concern .
There are a growing number of Americans who advocate an armed and lethal force populace for the sole purpose of intimidating government - wishful thinking that this will prevent tyranny , and this bill is the government ’s response .
The bill passed the house by 400 to 6 – clearly the government is very concerned about America ’s radicalization and people trying to intimidate them .
However , the term ‘ enemies of the state ’ is too vaguely defined and it is meant to be vague , it really means a multiple of ‘ sins ’ so to speak .
We think we are above the description , but in reality we have become the enemy , not some off shore group of thugs which we have laws regarding now .
The bill is not pretext by Timothy McVeigh or 9/11 ; the bill is about us , we the people , as we are today –violent , polarized , and radicalized .
In the last seven years , we have watched the bill of rights being systematically stripped and the certain amendments to the constitution effectively nullified .
From the calls of tax revolution to armed revolution which have reached the ears of our government , they are reacting with like in kind .
There will be no turning back .
To those who say it ca n’t happen here , I suggest you read about the erosion of our rights in these last seven years – and then answer your own question .
For those who advocate armed revolution , or arming on the pretext of revolution , may be in for a very rude awakening in the not so distant future .
Those who call for arming Americana to prevent tyranny have already contributed to the success of this bill , and in so many ways , will watch what they fear most now befalling them .

Paul Nelson reportingWill Barack Obama bring out more college students on election day than Hillary Clinton would have ?
Some political analysts say " yes . "
The fight over getting the votes of college students seems to have been lopsided for a long time .
Traditionally , the demographic leans toward the Democratic Party .
But , since we live in Utah , a conservative state , it was n't impossible to find a Republican at the University of Utah .
One student told me , " I 'm going to vote for John McCain , " even though his first choice would have been Ron Paul .
Most students I spoke with , though , are going the other direction .
One man said , " I think I 'd probably be safe to say I stand with most students in not supporting the Republican nominee . "
Others also said they were voting Democratic .
While these students are picking sides , they seem to have a good level of respect for both candidates .
One woman said , " I think both parties chose a really good candidate that will represent them well overall . "
Some political scholars say this election may be more friendly than 2004 .
Students do n't seem to have the animosity they had four years ago .
Hinckley Institute of Politics Director Kirk Jowers said , " [ They were ] passionate George W. Bush haters , but not passionate for John Kerry , the man .
For Barack Obama , I find it every day at every speech and every student that comes in , who is a Democrat ; there is a lot of passion for Barack Obama . "
Jowers says the Democrats have scored big with their nomination .
He says Obama brings more college students to the polls than Hillary Clinton would .
But , he says a large group of Clinton supporters do n't like Obama .
" Up to a quarter of them are saying they will not vote for Obama after this primary , " he said .
Plus , there is still tension from Obama supporters for Clinton .
Jowers says , if the election were held tomorrow , it might be a mistake for Obama to have Clinton as a running mate .
But , Jowers says Mitt Romney 's backers used to feel the same way about John McCain , but the two sides have kissed and made up .

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer plans to retire as early as 2017 , a Microsoft representative confirmed Friday .
At a Technology for Government dinner sponsored by the American Electronics Association this week , Ballmer said he plans to leave Microsoft as soon as his youngest child leaves for college , or in about nine to ten years .
" I 've been at Microsoft , as I said , 28 years , " Ballmer said , according to a transcript of the speech provided by Microsoft .
" I tell people I 'm planning on being here another -- here at Microsoft another nine , ten years , till my last kid goes away to college .
I 've got to tell you , for all of us who are involved in this industry , there 's never been a better time .
The next ten years will bring even more innovation and excitement and energy than the last ten . "

A mother of five who says she was sexually harassed and assaulted while working for Halliburton / KBR in Iraq is headed for a secretive arbitration process rather than being able to present her case in open court .
Barker 's attorneys had argued that Halliburton / KBR had created a " boys will be boys " atmosphere at their camps and that sort of condition is not the type of dispute that she could have expected to be within the scope of an arbitration provision .
District Judge Gray Miller , however , wrote in his order that " whether it is wise to send this type of claim to arbitration is not a question for this court to decide . "

Some physical attributes of the homosexual brain resemble those found in the opposite sex .
These images show the amygdala in heterosexual men and women ( labeled HeM and HeW ) and homosexual and women ( labeled HoM and HoW ) ( Image : National Academy of Sciences , PNAS )
Brain scans have provided the most compelling evidence yet that being gay or straight is a biologically fixed trait .
The scans reveal that in gay people , key structures of the brain governing emotion , mood , anxiety and aggressiveness resemble those in straight people of the opposite sex .
The differences are likely to have been forged in the womb or in early infancy , says Ivanka Savic , who conducted the study at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden .
Advertisement
“ This is the most robust measure so far of cerebral differences between homosexual and heterosexual subjects , ” she says .
Previous studies have also shown differences in brain architecture and activity between gay and straight people , but most relied on people ’s responses to sexuality driven cues that could have been learned , such as rating the attractiveness of male or female faces .
Brain symmetry
To get round this , Savic and her colleague , Per Lindström , chose to measure brain parameters likely to have been fixed at birth .
“ That was the whole point of the study , to show parameters that differ , but which could n’t be altered by learning or cognitive processes , ” says Savic .
First they used MRI scans to find out the overall volume and shapes of brains in a group of 90 volunteers consisting of 25 heterosexuals and 20 homosexuals of each gender .
The results showed that straight men had asymmetric brains , with the right hemisphere slightly larger – and the gay women also had this asymmetry .
Gay men , meanwhile , had symmetrical brains like those of straight women .
The team next used PET scans to measure blood flow to the amygdala , part of the brain that governs fear and aggression .
The images revealed how the amygdala connected to other parts of the brain , giving clues to how this might influence behaviour .
Depression link
They found that the patterns of connectivity in gay men matched those of straight women , and vice versa ( see image , above right ) .
In straight women and gay men , the connections were mainly into regions of the brain that manifest fear as intense anxiety .
“ The regions involved in phobia , anxiety and depression overlap with the pattern we see from the amygdala , ” says Savic .
This is significant , she says , and fits with data showing that women are three times as likely as men to suffer from mood disorders or depression .
Gay men have higher rates of depression too , she says , but it ’s difficult to know whether this is down to biology , homophobia or simply feelings of being “ different ” .
In straight men and lesbians , the amygdala fed its signals mainly into the sensorimotor cortex and the striatum , regions of the brain that trigger the “ fight or flight ” response .
“ It ’s a more action - related response than in women , ” says Savic .
‘ Striking differences ’
“ This study demonstrates that homosexuals of both sexes show strong cross - sex shifts in brain symmetry , ” says Qazi Rahman , a leading researcher on sexual orientation at Queen Mary college , University of London , UK .
“ The connectivity differences reported in the amygdala are striking . ”
“ Paradoxically , it ’s more informative to look at things that have no direct connection with sexual orientation , and that ’s where this study scores , ” says Simon LeVay , a prominent US author who in 1991 reported finding differences ( pdf ) in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus between straight and gay men .
But as Savic herself acknowledges , the study ca n’t say whether the brain differences are inherited , or result from abnormally high or low exposure in the womb to sex hormones such as testosterone .

‘ The Constitution is not a suicide pact . ”
After 9/11 , that old saw -- originally coined by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson -- was dusted off .
Lately , it ’s been getting a heavy workout .
On June 12 , for instance , the U.S. Supreme Court released a decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy holding , in Boumediene vs. Bush , that Guantanamo prisoners have the right to ask the federal courts to rule on the validity of their continued detention ( many have been held for years , despite little evidence in some cases that they ’re truly “ unlawful combatants . ” )
Barack Obama praised Kennedy ’s majority opinion for “ re-establishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law , ” but John McCain denounced it as “ one of the worst decisions in the history of this country . ”
The Wall Street Journal ’s editorialists agreed with McCain and hauled out the usual cliches : “ More Americans are likely to die as a result [ of this decision ] , ” they opined darkly .
“ Justice Jackson once famously observed that the Constitution is ‘ not a suicide pact . ’
About Anthony Kennedy ’s Constitution , we ’re not so sure . ”
When invoked with the requisite tone of pompous finality , “ the Constitution is not a suicide pact ” is an effective rhetorical ploy .
Who could disagree ?
Anyway , no one wants to defend suicide pacts .
The very phrase sounds like “ suicide bomber , ” thus managing to subtly imply that those who stand up for basic rights are not only self - destructive but share the ideology of terrorists .

But the Constitution also does n’t contain any footnotes that say , “ Note to our descendants : This Constitution is intended for easy times only .
At the first sign of trouble , feed this document to your dog .
We wo n’t mind .
We only fought a war for it . ”
This Fourth of July , celebrate by rereading the Declaration of Independence , created by more or less the same crowd who brought us the Constitution , 11 years and one war later .
Remember it ?
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . ”
Wild stuff !
To the founders , “ all men ” have “ unalienable rights ” -- not just U.S. citizens in the continental United States .
( If the founding fathers were around today , Rush Limbaugh and Rudy Giuliani would pillory them as limp - wristed , latte - drinking , soft - on - terror liberals . )
It was treasonous stuff too .
When the Declaration of Independence was drafted , there were no U.S. citizens : Instead , there were about 2.5 million scrappy Colonists who legally owed allegiance to the king of England , George III .
But they went to war -- over the little matter of freedom , law and unalienable , God -given rights .
Advertisement
Among their grievances against King George , the rebellious Colonists complained that he ignored the will of their representative bodies , refused “ his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers ” and “ affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power . ”
The Colonists also objected to the denial of “ the benefit of trial by jury ” and the king ’s practice of avoiding the inconveniences of due process by transporting prisoners “ beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses . ”
( George III would have loved Guantanamo . )
The founders had a word for governments that respected rights only arbitrarily and selectively : tyranny .
The signers of the declaration took rights seriously .
They wrote , “ For the support of this declaration , we mutually pledge to each other our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . ”
That was n’t mere rhetoric .
Technically , the signers were all traitors , liable to be executed for treason .
And they accepted that standing up for rights means taking some real risks .
Of the 56 signers of the declaration , about a third fought in the Revolutionary War , and five were captured and severely mistreated by the British .
Several later died .
Many lost children in the war , and about a third had their homes damaged or destroyed by the British .
About 25,000 Colonists died in the war , about 8,000 in combat , the rest of disease -- including an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 who died as a result of mistreatment while prisoners of the British .
Extrapolating to modern population figures , that ’s like losing nearly 300,000 Americans in a war .
The Constitution is no “ suicide pact , ” but the people who founded this nation risked war , prison and death for the sake of unalienable human rights .
Their values guided us through good times and bad , through the Civil War , two world wars and the Cold War .
But today , some Americans seem happy to discard those same precious values in the name of “ security . ”

Sometimes I wonder :
If the founders could have foreseen this , would they have bothered to fight the Revolutionary War ?

Group claims 100,000 signatures in ' Send Rove to Jail ' campaign John Byrne
Published : Thursday July 24 , 2008
Print This Email This SendRoveToJail.com .
That 's the name of the website now claiming to have over 101,000 signatures in their campaign to urge the House Judiciary Committee to cite former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove for contempt .
Rove failed to testify after being subpoenaed by the Judiciary Committee to provide information regarding the selective prosecution of former Alabama Democratic Governor Don Siegelman .
RAW STORY 's reporting on Siegelman 's case , along with that of CBS ' 60 Minutes , sparked a national outcry that resulted in Siegelman being let out of jail pending appeal .
" We call on the the House Judiciary Committee to cite Rove with contempt for failing to comply with a Congressional subpoena , " the petition at the website reads .
" Since Rove regards the law with such contempt , it 's high time the law and Congress hold him in contempt as well .
We demand the [ Committee ] let Rove know he can't decide which subpoenas he obeys and which he ignores . "
Both the Committee and House Democrats have subpoenaed numerous Bush Administration officials .
Some have failed to show up , while others , like former Attorney General John Ashcroft , repeatedly declined to answer , citing their own forgetfulness .
" I must admit , it 's been difficult for me sometimes to distinguish between what I in fact recall as a matter of my own experience , and what I remember from the accounts of others , " the former Attorney General said on July 17 .
Next Tuesday , a coalition of organizations -- including Brave New Films , The Nation magazine , Campaign for America 's Future , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , Progress Now Action and CREDO Mobile -- will deliver the petition to the House Judiciary Committee .
The online petition , created by Brave New Films and housed at SendRoveToJail.com , claims to have amassed over 100,000 names in less than six days .
As of Thursday morning , the total was 101,722 .
" Karl Rove is not above the law , " Robert Greenwald , founder and president of Brave New Films , said in a release .
" Rove 's refusal to comply with a Congressional subpoena makes a mockery of the justice system .
Even former high government officials like Rove are accountable to the law .
Rove needs to learn that we live in a democracy , not a dictatorship . "
" Karl Rove has built a career out of bending the law , but now he seems to feel entitled simply to break it , " added Michael Kieschnick , President of CREDO Mobile .
" We expect the House Judiciary Committee to agree that Karl Rove is in contempt and should be sent to jail if he persists in his flagrant disregard for the laws of this country . "
The " Send Rove to Jail " campaign follows the liberal film company 's " Lieberman Must Go " campaign .
It was also a Brave New Films video that exposed Senator John McCain 's ( R - AZ ) relationship with the controversial Reverend Rod Parsley , forcing McCain to denounce the pastor 's endorsement .

Twenty years ago , Tracy Kidder published the original nerd epic .
The Soul of a New Machine made circuit boards seem cool and established a revolutionary notion : that there 's art in the quest for the next big thing .
Nestled into a wicker rocking chair , among his framed maritime charts and teetering piles of sailing books , Tom West could easily pass for a salty old sea captain .
In fact , rocking back and forth on his porch in the foggy coastal town of Westport , Massachusetts , wearing a worn - out T - shirt and sandals , he 'd prefer it that way .
" Nobody in this town knows who I am , " he says .
" I do n't talk about what I did .
They do n't ask . "
He leans back slowly , lightly gripping the chair 's armrests with weathered hands .
" It offends me when people think they know me because of the book . "
The book , to West and others who lived its story , is Tracy Kidder 's The Soul of a New Machine .
The 1981 best - seller and Pulitzer Prize winner chronicles the dramatic efforts of West and his team of engineers at Massachusetts - based Data General to build a minicomputer known to its creators as " the Eagle . "
In the 20 years since Soul made West a minor high tech celebrity for his gruff , competitive management style and brooding technical vision , PCs and workstations have supplanted minicomputers .
After a long struggle in one hardware market or another , Data General too disappeared , swallowed up last year by storage giant EMC .
Almost all of the Eagle project 's engineers and managers abandoned the sinking company in the early ' 80s , scattering to the four corners of the high tech world and beyond .
West stayed at Data General , finally retiring two years ago to the anonymity of his Westport home , his four boats , and the wireless server he designed and built in his basement .
To someone who knows
West only from the book , he does at first glance defy its characterizations .
For one thing , he 's no longer the thin , bushy - haired figure Kidder describes .
At 60 , he sports a hearty gray beard and a healthy captain 's belly .
He 's also lost his aversion to engineers who work on computers at home - he spends much of his time these days on the Internet .
More striking is his demeanor , which , in stark contrast to the book 's portrayal , borders on jovial .
Today ,
West talks easily about what it 's been like to have such a public record of one part of his life .
" It was an odd experience , that 's for sure , " he muses .
" I think I remember the story more than the event .
Most events happen and I file them away .
This one happened over and over again . "
More than a simple catalog of events or stale corporate history , Soul lays bare the life of the modern engineer - the egghead toiling and tinkering in the basement , forsaking a social life for a technical one .
It 's a glimpse into the mysterious motivations , the quiet revelations , and the spectacular devotions of engineers - and , in particular , of West .
Here is the project 's enigmatic , icy leader , the man whom one engineer calls the " prince of darkness , " but who quietly and deliberately protects his team and his machine .
Here is the raw conflict of a corporate environment , factions clawing for resources as West shields his crew from the political wars of attrition fought over every circuit board and mode bit .
Here are the power plays , the passion , and the burnout - the inside tale of how it all unfolded .
Over two decades , Soul has endured as the high tech story by which all others are judged .
" It was the first book to describe the inner workings of the technology groups , " says Novell CEO Eric Schmidt , " and it did a good job of getting into the psychology of leadership .
The corporate maneuvering was both fascinating and abhorrent to me . "
Soul demanded that followers of technology thereafter see their subject with a new , astute eye .
" I had never read such a book covering the work of engineers , " says Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak .
" The readers got to ' live ' with these engineers for a while .
It 's easy to consider engineers inhuman and hackers dangerous threats when you do n't know them .
I was very sad at the end , that the engineers were not better - respected and marketing folks here were credited with the computer . "
The engineer as artist , scientist , visionary ; the computer builder as protagonist , even celebrity - these cultural figures came into being in Kidder 's Soul and provided a new framework for understanding the progress of the industry .
Of course , the book was only a snapshot of the lives of its characters , most of whom are now , at mid-career , in their forties and fifties .
The Eagle eventually shipped , and when it did , the people who toiled in the basement of Data General looked up and realized they needed something to fill the void .
An engineer 's essential desire , after all , is to design and build a machine and see it through to completion , but completion itself is therefore not the ultimate reward .
In the Eagle days , West called this paradox " pinball . "
In pinball , he reasoned , the prize for winning is getting to play again .
The story of the Eagle engineers since Soul is one of a career - length version of pinball .
West , too , kept playing .
But for him , pinball meant more than building circuit boards .
It was a grand contest requiring an intricate , and at times fierce , corporate strategy .
There was more to a machine than designing it ; there was confronting the business culture that often resisted innovation , and there was the pleasure of beating the other guy .
West played this kind of game for 20 years after Eagle .
He battled on until he was too burned out to fight for the next project , then he took his quarters and went home .
" Engineers are aesthetes , " observes Tracy Kidder , looking back on the hero of Soul today .
" They want technological symmetry .
The smartest engineers at Data General wanted to build beautiful machines .
West was different .
He had another motive .
He was pissed . "
" The smartest engineers at Data General wanted to build beautiful machines .
West had another motive .
He was pissed . "
Signing Up
West usually drove out of Westborough fast after work .
" I ca n't talk about the machine , " he said one evening , bent forward over the steering wheel .
" I 've gotta keep life and computers separate , or else I 'm gonna go mad . " - Tracy Kidder , The Soul of a New Machine
Tom West never prepared himself for what became the Eagle project .
Even today , when hindsight could make the chaotic effort seem like a well - planned scheme , he allows that the whole thing " just kind of happened . "
Then again , that 's how the best engineering efforts often take shape .
West had come to Data General in 1974 from RCA , where he 'd essentially taught himself computer engineering after seven years of traveling the world building digital clocks for the Smithsonian Institution .
Arriving as a line engineer , he quickly jockeyed his way to the head of DG's Eclipse group , which built one of the company 's wildly successful 16 - bit minicomputers .
West was more than just technically adept ; he had a knack for getting a computer out the door .
The drama recounted in Soul began in 1978 , hatched out of a bitter power struggle .
At the time , DG was a player in the multibillion - dollar minicomputer market , part of the late - '70s " Massachusetts miracle " of high tech development .
But due in part to a feud over taxes between Data General founder Edson de Castro and Massachusetts ' governor at the time , Michael Dukakis , de Castro transplanted DG 's lead development team to Research Triangle Park , North Carolina .
Many of the company 's top engineers , including West , refused to uproot their families and move .
Meanwhile , DG was desperate for a new machine .
A year earlier , the company 's arch rival , Digital Equipment Corporation , had released the powerful and quick - selling 32 - bit VAX .
DG 's brass looked on in dismay as sales of VAX swamped those of their slower , 16 - bit machines .
DG needed a 32 - bit computer , and fast .
With the engineering department now split , the North Carolina team was chosen to develop an advanced 32 - bit design that would be far more complex than VAX's .
Dubbed the Fountainhead Project ( FHP ) , after its former home in a Westborough , Massachusetts , apartment complex , the machine would be the company 's chance to leapfrog Digital .
With de Castro ordaining the North Carolina group as the company 's savior , West and other engineers who 'd stayed behind felt slighted .
" The implication was , those guys had the right stuff and we didn't , " says Carl Alsing , West 's soft - spoken deputy in the Eagle days .
" We were being asked to just maintain the old tried - and - true designs and upgrade them every year or two .
We felt a little affronted by that , and that 's how it all got started . "
So West made a brilliant Machiavellian move .
Instead of designing a next - generation processor , his group would simply port the 16 - bit minicomputer to 32 - bit , keeping it reverse - compatible with the old software .
He pitched it to de Castro as insurance ; it would be there if something went wrong in North Carolina .
In fact , he realized , a streamlined approach and its promise of reverse compatibility could be executed more quickly and prove more successful than a brand - new design .
The soft sell worked - the project received tacit approval from de Castro .
Code - named Eagle , the machine would be designed and built by West 's group in the basement of Westborough building 14A / B .
He promised , audaciously , that it could be completed in a year .
" We 're building , " West told Kidder , " what I thought we could get away with . "
West and Alsing corralled a group of managers and hired two dozen young engineers , most straight out of college - " smarter , non-mindfucked people , " West says today .
The new hires split into two groups : the " Hardy Boys , " responsible for the Eagle 's hardware , and the " Microkids , " charged with writing the machine 's microcode .
From its tortured beginnings , the project was layered with the tangible intensity of twentysomething engineers racing against the clock to save the company .
While West was " low - key " about the machine outside the Eagle group , he was the opposite within , telling the kids that the company was on the line , spurring them on with the belief that the Eagle - and they - were DG 's last hope for survival .
" We sublimated everything to the project , " recalls Jonathan Blau , a Microkid on Eagle .
" You worked long hours , seven days a week .
Your head was always in it , and it was fun .
It had that boot camp quality that can't really be repeated . "
West had invented a term for this DG brand of sublimation , in which the machine became the engineers ' lives .
He called it " signing up . "
To Kidder , the combination of the team 's fervor , West 's cunning and taste for vengeance , and the corporate mystery shrouding a computer came as a shock .
At the time a freelance writer struggling to pay the bills , Kidder had been inspired to write about technology after the protests surrounding the opening of the Seabrook nuclear reactor in 1976 .
Over a beer , his editor at The Atlantic , Richard Todd , suggested he look into computers .
Todd knew someone in the business : his old college roommate , Tom West .
Kidder took a sailing trip with West , and after hearing about Eagle , came to the basement of 14A / B to see the project firsthand .
The day he showed up , he says , Alsing immediately shunted him off to the cafeteria .
" There was this feeling of paranoia , " remembers Kidder .
" Then he started telling me these stories .
I thought he was just talking about making molded plastic boxes - the most boring thing in the world .
But they were so passionate about it . "
The Eagle engineers ' passion was nurtured inside - and perhaps in spite of - a company with a reputation for brash attitudes and a culture rife with dictatorial management and cutthroat competition .
This spirit enveloped the competing Eagle and FHP , and in West , the battle revealed a true talent for a brand of fierce corporate gamesmanship .
Kidder describes
West 's tirade about a department he believed was holding up the Eagle : " ' I 'm gonna detonate those guys , ' said West in a flat , calm voice , as if he were planning a business trip .
Then he promised to ' waste 'em . '
He added , ' We 'll string them up by their toes . ' "
Such viciousness toward outside threats may have been understandable .
More mysterious was his aloof management style within his own team .
To the younger engineers , he came off as cold , uncaring ; Soul relates how he would ignore greetings from Hardy Boys and Microkids when he passed them in the hall .
" I would never try to defend that I knew what I was doing , " West says now , looking back .
He was " shy , " he suggests , or maybe " just embarrassed . "
" It really was a thinking game , " he finally says , " and somebody had to keep a clear head about what the overall goal was .
To do that requires a fair amount of insulation and isolation .
Otherwise , you just get caught up in the chatter . "
But perhaps the most convincing explanation for West 's brutal aloofness is postulated in Kidder 's book :
West was attempting to provide the team with a scapegoat , someone to blame for their cramped conditions and unrealistic schedules .
It was West 's corporate agnosticism , Alsing says now , that drove the project and ultimately Alsing himself .
" People expect their company to do the right thing , and usually they 're disappointed , " he says .
" Tom expected the company to do the wrong thing , and he was n't disappointed at all . "
West was protecting the team from his lack of faith , Alsing says , describing West 's philosophy .
" When your company does n't do the right thing , you manipulate it until it does . "
" Somebody 's got to dig ditches .
But it 's a lot more fun to dig ditches where nobody else has dug one before . "
" We used to complain to Tom about working conditions , " laughs Ken Holberger , a manager of the Hardy Boys .
" One time it just got really hot , the ventilation was terrible , and the offices were too crowded .
He 'd look at us and say , ' Well , look how good you 're doing !
Tell me what I 'm doing wrong ! '
Which was certainly a cynical thing to say , but it was funny at the time . "
West 's strategy , if cynical , was effective , and the team somehow brought the machine to life .
The FHP had fallen hopelessly behind schedule , and the Eagle - although it took longer to complete than the year West had promised - became more than " insurance . "
It was Data General 's only hope to rescue itself from permanent 16 - bit obsolescence .
" Tom West took it upon himself and Steve Wallach [ Eagle 's designer ] , as a personal thing , to prove that they could outdo those guys in North Carolina , " says Ed Zander , director of marketing for Eagle and FHP at the time and now president of Sun Microsystems .
" It got very nasty .
At the end of the day , when it came out , the Eagle saved Data General - but Data General was never really saved .
With three years of lost market share to DEC , it never really recovered . "
The machine , officially named the Eclipse MV / 8000 , was announced to the public in April 1980 , in an afternoon ceremony in New York City .
A few members of the team got to go and bask in their roles as company saviors , but the feeling was short - lived .
Because West had shielded them from the politics of DG - something many would n't discover until reading Soul - the Eagle team was unprepared for the backlash the project created .
They believed they had rescued DG , says Microkid Blau , but " unfortunately the rest of the company did n't feel that way , so there was a lot of animosity . "
The FHP team , for one , felt betrayed when its machine was canceled .
And a team that worked in secret - with a crafty leader who bucked the system - could be highly effective , but it also could be dangerous to the powers that be .
A new vice president of engineering had taken over at DG , replacing the pro-Eagle Carl Carman .
The new VP was openly hostile to a group he believed had purposefully defied the interests of the company - " neglecting to point out , " Wallach says now , " that without Eagle there would not have been a Data General . "
The Eagle group was broken up and scattered to various projects , and West was shipped off to Data General 's Japan office before a single MV / 8000 was sold .
By the time Soul was published a little more than a year later , greeted with a glowing review in The New York Times , many in the Eagle group had already left Data General or were about to leave .
Some wanted to start their own ventures .
Some were burned out .
Others were young and simply ready to move on to the next thing .
Dissatisfied with the lack of recognition and opportunities at a company that their herculean effort helped save , and frustrated by the politics of conflict that pervaded DG , they saw little reason to stay .
Holberger still describes the Eagle drama in terms of an old Western , as he did to Kidder 20 years ago .
" I felt like the team members were gunfighters who were brought into town to solve some problem , " he says .
" They shot the place up , and they solved the problem .
And then the town had to figure out what to do with them afterward .
Which was mostly to get rid of them . "
Perpetual Motion
Holberger has noticed that there is almost no one in the basement involved in CPU design who is over 35 .
What happens to old CPU engineers ?
Holberger is 26 now , and though not exactly on his deathbed , he is curious about what a computer engineer does " afterward . "
When Data General ran the Eagle gunslingers out of town , most of them took different routes to a similar destination : the next project .
Having successfully created a machine - seen it through from bare wires and circuits to working computer - they were ready to sign up and do it again .
Even after the burnout and the lack of recognition at DG , they left seeking projects as intense , if not more intense , than Eagle .
They often found them .
And for all the gruffness of West 's management style , none of the Eagle vets look back on the project with anything but fond memories .
Ken Holberger and Chuck Holland , a Microkids manager , left DG in the early ' 80s and traveled similar career paths .
After bouncing around at other hardware companies for a few years , the two founded Epoch Systems , where they designed combination optical and magnetic disc storage .
" Ken and I struck out into the deep West , " says Holland , describing the pioneer spirit of their early startup efforts .
When they sold the company for a pile of cash in 1992 - ironically to EMC , which later acquired DG - neither needed to work again .
Both do .
On his third startup after Epoch , Holberger , at 46 , has the luxury of picking and choosing his projects , the most recent being to serve as director of marketing at Vox2 , which is working on a product that ties cell phones into a home telephone network .
Holland , now 48 , is back working full time for LiveVault , a network backup company he and Holberger founded seven years ago .
" I 've always been driven to create , " he says .
" And engineers want to create something and see it come to the end - the end is everything .
Then , if you ever get there , you wonder what 's next . "
" Engineers want to create something and see it come to the end - the end is everything .
Then , if you ever get there , you wonder what 's next . "
Few Eagle alumni have attained what is generally viewed as an engineer 's corporate grail : a high - level management role at a large tech company .
They have stayed close to the spark of technology , the thrill of projects , the intensity of creation .
" I had high hopes for a management career , " says Carl Alsing , now 57 .
" The hope was that I could leverage my experience and judgment .
That was disappointing , because at the lower levels of management where I ended up , whatever companies said they wanted me to do , they really wanted me to put out fires in the current product and delay any kind of innovation . "
Alsing figures more prominently in Soul than any Eagle architect besides West .
Although in many ways
West 's inverse - tall and lanky , with a quiet , hands - on manner around the younger engineers - Alsing may have known the Eagle leader better than anyone else .
When West first took over the Eclipse group , Alsing , as he says in Soul , went to work for him " largely because he felt that it would be safer to stand on West 's side than not . "
" You see somebody like that and you say , ' I think I 'll stay around and watch this and see what happens , ' " he says now .
" ' Could this be right ?
Is this how the world is ? ' "
So when West left for Japan , Alsing did n't stick around .
In late 1980 , he moved to Silicon Valley to work at Tandem , an early entrant in the fault - tolerant computer business .
Four years later , he jumped to a small startup and began developing optical character recognition technology .
Since the mid-'80s , he has bounced around small companies in the OCR industry , mostly by choice and occasionally by downsizing .
Despite an aversion to large companies , especially in an age in which he says corporate loyalty to employees is nil , he did a one - year stint at Xerox PARC beginning in 1995 .
Since then , he 's worked as an independent contractor .
" I admit what I 'm doing now is more for the satisfaction of designing things myself , " he says .
" So maybe I can only do one man 's work in a year , and I can't get 20 people to do some cool thing .
But it 's fun . "
For Alsing , recently signed on with MagnaWare , an OCR startup in Santa Cruz , California , the core desire is still to innovate , regardless of whether he 's running things .
" Somebody 's got to dig ditches , " he says .
" But it 's a lot more fun to dig ditches where nobody else has dug one before . "
His challenge has been to stay mobile enough to keep up with the pace of change .
" You stay in a place too long , you miss out on new technology and new tools and new ways of doing things , " he says .
" I 've seen friends who stayed too many years in something , and they always find a niche where they become a guru of something and manager of whatnot .
And then when that activity ends and they leave the company or get laid off , they have no skills .
In 10 years , you really are obsolete .
The tools are gone , the vocabulary is different . "
This idea of perpetual movement in the face of looming obsolescence is a constant theme among the Eagle vets .
Like Alsing , most of them had already glided into the next tech market by the time the minicomputer sector crashed in the mid-'80s .
Some struck it rich with their own tech ventures , while others either never made the right play or elected to avoid the risks that startups pose .
A few have stayed put at one company for 15 years or more .
But all of them have been forced to adapt as Moore 's law and the Internet redefined and rebuilt the industry time after time .
" The technology keeps changing , " says Ken Holberger , " and the people keep changing - to track it , to chase it , or to push it , depending on where you are on the curve . "
Jonathan
Blau is the only member of the team who left the high tech world , disillusioned by his post - DG jobs .
He worked for a decade alongside a half - dozen other Eagle vets at a company called Alliant , based in Massachusetts and started by FHP alumni , and eventually found that he " did not perform well under the pressure .
It was not as much fun ; a terrible contrast to my years at Data General .
DG did have that kind of rough edge to it , but we were told we were the heroes , we were going to save the company . "
Blau , a Microkid and Hardy Boy whose voice still crackles with excitement when he talks about solving the Eagle " puzzle , " is now a junk bond analyst at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette in New York City .
After burning out at Alliant , he came back to his hometown and did some software development for an investment bank , gradually transitioning into an analyst role .
Now 44 and content to study rather than build technology , he still sees parallels between the past and present .
" We 'll hire kids out of school , " he says , " and I 'll see what they 're going through , and think back to those times .
It was such an intense experience , where we went through so many cycles of ups and downs throughout the creation of the thing . "
" We used to say for every year of experience at Data General , it 's worth two years at any other place , " adds Steve Wallach .
" And you 'll age four . "
Brooklyn - born , and in his mid-thirties at the time he became a manager on Eagle , Wallach was the technical mastermind behind the computer 's processor .
Kidder describes his eureka moment - how he constructed the processor 's addressing scheme - in a chapter entitled " Wallach 's Golden Moment . "
Portrayed as cheerful but volatile , the Wallach of Soul is a man with a photographic memory who wears cowboy boots and has a tendency to kick the hell out of his office wall when frustrated .
Wallach seems no more mellow at 55 .
But his cowboy boots , if not his Brooklyn accent , are more at home in the offices of Texas - based Chiaro Networks , where he is vice president of engineering .
Outspoken and blunt , he has a roster of funny anecdotes about Soul , each of which he punctuates with a verbal wink like " if you follow what I 'm saying " or " Do you get my meaning ? "
His epitaph , he says , should simply read , " Here lies a computer engineer . "
" Data General did have that kind of rough edge to it , but we were told we were the heroes , we were going to save the company . "
Wallach left DG in 1980 , spending time in California before cofounding a next - generation " mini supercomputer " company called Convex in Dallas .
He tried to get West to join , but while West liked the idea , he could n't muster the enthusiasm .
" He was just burnt , " says Wallach .
The company , successful for a few years , hit the wall quickly when the market was soaked up by workstations in the early ' 90s , and Convex was eventually bought up by HP in 1995 .
But by then , Wallach 's reputation as a gifted hardware mind was already sealed .
He went into what he calls semi-retirement ( working only 40 - hour weeks ) , dabbling in venture capital , consulting for the government 's ASCI supercomputer projects , and serving on the Clinton administration 's IT Advisory Committee .
Last year , when a friend from the venture world told him about Chiaro , a startup developing next - generation optical switches , he jumped at the chance to play a little pinball .
But just as with Eagle , Wallach - who still rolls up his sleeves and does coding at Chiaro - is n't looking for accolades .
" My motivation on Eagle had nothing to do with recognition , " he says .
" I wanted to prove that I could get something out the door .
And I was right and the other guys were wrong .
I 'm not interested in notoriety or bullshit . "
He remembers getting a call a few years ago from a headhunter who was seeking a CTO for a " fast - growing Massachusetts company . "
" I asked him which one , " recalls Wallach .
" He says , ' We ca n't tell you . '
I said , ' If you do n't tell me the name of the company I 'm hanging up . '
He says , ' OK , the company is Data General .
The job is to replace Tom West . '
So I 'm laughing for about a minute or two .
He says , ' What 's so funny ? '
He knew I worked at Data General and nothing else .
And I said , ' Go read The Soul of a New Machine and you 'll understand . '
That 's how I knew Tom West was retiring . "
Playing Pinball
" [ DG vice president Carl ] Carman says the company 's in a lot of trouble if it 's not there by April .
Suppose I quit ?
I could just say , ' Fuck it , ' and go ... I 'm not gonna do the next machine .
I 'm gonna give somebody else a chance to fail .
I 'm gonna get totally out of computers . "
West stopped once in this long , unusually bitter monologue to say : " No , we would n't have a disaster .
We 'd back and fill . "
He seemed to be saying that he had to make himself believe that dire consequences would ensue if his team missed its deadline .
Of all the Eagle team , Tom West seemed the most unlikely candidate to be a Data General lifer .
Soul characterizes him as a wanderer , a former guitar player and folksinger who might rather drift from town to town than see another computer through the DG gauntlet .
Although a master of corporate strategy , West seemed in some ways larger than Data General , too worldly for its confines .
" He 's not a company guy , " says Alsing today .
" Well , he was n't a company guy . "
Kidder even writes in Soul , reflecting on West 's time at DG : " Ever since he had gone to work for Data General , West had been talking about quitting .
Someday he 'd wander off . "
He never did .
In 1980 , with the Eagle project barely completed , DG 's upper management offered him a series of what he calls " unpalatable options " ; Japan seemed the most promising .
While Kidder hints in the book that the transfer was just what West needed , West today says he was " effectively fired . "
" He got the shaft , " concludes Wallach matter - of - factly .
But , says
West , " I thought , ' Well , this will keep me alive for the moment . ' "
Even two decades later , he laments that because of his departure he was n't able to protect the Eagle kids , to prepare them for the bitter end of the project they 'd thrown their lives into .
" Their legacy was the book , " says West .
The MV / 8000 itself managed to keep DG afloat in the minicomputer business , selling briskly for several years .
West returned from Japan after a year to find the machine a success .
Yet without the book , he doubts the Eagle achievements would ever have been recognized .
" The people who shot the revolutionaries realized that there was an imprint , " he says , " and that they could n't rewrite history . "
History intact , he returned to the job of technical manager and was quickly promoted to vice president and eventually senior vice president of engineering - " senior VP in charge of not much , " he calls it .
" They decided they did n't want me around people , so I would just come up with ideas , " laughs the man who blustered in Soul about " detonating " fellow employees and stringing them up by their toes .
By 1983 , Data General was floundering again and the computer landscape was changing radically .
Just as minicomputers had captured the market from mainframes by being smaller and easier to use , PCs and workstations were crashing the minicomputer party .
In Japan , West had designed the DGOne , the first full - screen laptop , in an attempt to push the company into the growing PC market .
But saddled with proprietary software and a slow processor , the project was ultimately canceled .
No longer the brash upstart of its heyday , DG failed to adjust its course to the prevailing market winds .
Every DG veteran , from Tom West to Ed Zander to Joel Schwartz , current head of the Data General division at EMC , recites a litany of disruptive technologies that DG developed but failed to exploit as a way of explaining why the company never became a powerhouse .
There was FHP 's ahead - of - its - time network - computing architecture .
There was a laser printer developed in the late ' 70s .
There was the DGOne .
There was a thin Web server developed by Tom West in the mid-'90s .
The list goes on .
West blames DG 's management , and its inability to recognize or reward the company 's engineering talent , for the failures .
" They like to talk in terms of missing the different waves of technology , " says West , " but a well - managed company does n't do that .
It was a very top - down , autocratic , turn - of - the - century mill - owner kind of management mentality .
It could only grow to a certain size , because nobody trusted anybody . "
By the late '90s , Data General seemed a company that had been granted immortality but had neglected to ask for perpetual youth .
Revenue stagnated at $ 1 billion for over a decade , while profits sank and the stock plummeted from a high of 81 in 1983 to single digits by 1990 , before edging back up to 10 , where it hovered until 1999 , when the company was bought by EMC .
DG had held on , though , while the high - flying minicomputer outfits of the 1970s , with names like Wang Laboratories and Prime Computer , shuttered or sold out to outfits closer to the leading edge .
Compaq , underscoring the PC 's decimation of minicomputers , snapped up Digital in 1998 .
All the while , West endured at DG , although he often felt more like a showpiece than an innovator .
" There was still the notion that I was sort of a necessary evil , " he says .
" They needed me to sign books and go on sales calls .
They were much happier with me as a figurehead than as an action figure . "
The Soul of a New Machine and the Eagle had made him something of a tech icon .
" Whenever we announced something , Tom was always involved , " says Joel Schwartz .
" He added credibility .
We were always able to get a greater attendance from analysts when we rolled out Tom . "
West continued to fight for new ideas , and DG even mustered a mid- '90s turnaround of sorts by trimming costs , laying off thousands , and shifting focus to the successful Clariion data storage products that West conceived .
He then set to work on saving DG again , turning to the Internet in a last - ditch effort to develop a technology that would vault the company into the next high tech era .
The answer , according to West , was a thin client server , the kind of thing small businesses could use to get connected .
It was an idea ahead of its time , and again DG failed to capitalize .
After an initial market run garnered less than spectacular sales , the project was scaled back .
Today , servers like West 's are a huge and growing business .
West struggles to explain why he stuck around to watch the sunset of DG , rather than hitch his fortunes to one of the countless startups or industry leaders that tried to lure him away .
" I 'd much rather be a big fish in a little pond , " he offers at one point , " than someone like Gordon Bell , who went to Microsoft and disappeared . "
Another time , he says , " You could do new products and companies within the company , rather than shag some venture capitalist and kill yourself for five years . "
To be an entrepreneur , he says , " you have to be interested in networking , even with fools . "
Still , most of the Eagle team wonders what kept him at Data General .
Steve Wallach is sure that it was in West 's genes - his father and grandfather both spent their whole careers at AT&T .
Others suspect the Eagle project and its aftermath , in which West ended up divorced , may have drained his energy .
At the end of Soul , Kidder describes West as losing weight and sleep over the Eagle .
" He put a lot into it , " says one Eagle engineer today , " and it took a toll on his personal life . "
Others who worked on the Eagle insist that for West , staying put at DG was n't what it might have been for a more ordinary guy ; it was n't the same as being stuck .
" Just because Tom stayed at one company , that does n't put him on the spectrum of the average engineer , " argues Chuck Holland .
" He did different projects and worked in different sections of the company .
It was n't a static career at all . "
West , Alsing believes , somehow turned the tables on obsolescence .
" I think he felt that he knew how to work with the company , he knew how to get them to do what he wanted .
So I do n't think he ever felt frustrated , ever just said , ' I can't get anything accomplished here .
I have to go somewhere else . ' "
Alsing 's rosy assessment , however , did n't hold for the duration of West 's tenure .
West eventually discovered that he was , in practice , no longer an engineer .
DG had become just another job .
" I did usually prevail , " he says .
" But I began to think , ' It 's too hard .
This is n't a technology job at all .
It 's about moving around these roadblocks to try and do things that are pretty sensible .
You 're solving these same problems over and over again that are really people problems .
They have nothing to do with electrons . ' "
By the time he retired , West found that Data General was n't even listening to his advice on Internet strategies .
" I thought that was kind of silly , " he says , laughing .
" Because I 'd spent all my time and energy trying to figure out how this Internet thing could be used by an old minicomputer company , and they just did n't ... "
He trails off , then says softly , " did n't care . "
The Zen of Soul
Many looked for words to describe their true reward .
They used such phrases as " self - fulfillment , " " a feeling of accomplishment , " " self - satisfaction . "
[ Hardy Boy ] Jim Guyer struggled with those terms awhile with growing impatience .
Then he said , " Look , I do n't have to get official recognition for anything I do .
Ninety - eight percent of the thrill comes from knowing that the thing you designed works , and works almost the way you expected it would .
If that happens , part of you is in that machine . "
West does n't play much music these days - arthritis in his hands hampers his guitar playing .
But happily remarried and living in Westport , he 's plenty busy sailing , fishing for striper , and keeping tabs on the industry via the Web .
He seems mostly content to be done with the high tech game , and proclaims no desire to return to it .
Life is full .
" I 've seen a lot of burnout , " he says , " but the sadder thing I 've seen is a lot of people who reach 65 and find that there 's nothing in the world they like to do .
That 's really sad , because they 've worked their whole lives , and then the whole meaning of things goes away . "
He also sounds the Moore 's law theme .
" High tech careers today , " he points out , " require a great deal of planning .
You can be building optical switches today and be on top of the market .
But at some point , optical switches are going to be like modems - a dime a dozen - and then you 're going to have to do something else .
So you should realize that it might be more healthy to be involved in different things . "
West cultivated his own eclectic interests over the years and has remained friends with Kidder .
He grumbles that he 's been trying for months to get him down to Westport for a sailing trip .
Kidder , at 54 , is at work on his fifth book since Soul , this one based on his July story in The New Yorker story about a Harvard - educated doctor working in Haiti .
Other than keeping up with his friend West , he says he " almost made a fetish out of not following the computer industry . "
But he marvels at the pace of change since his days in the basement of building 14A / B .
" If you had told me in 1981 that Digital and Data General would n't exist today , " he says , " I would have said you were out of your mind . "
Kidder sold the movie rights for Soul to Columbia Pictures in 1982 , and the studio sent Kurt Luedtke , winner of a best screenplay Oscar for Out of Africa , to DG to research the script .
" One day he flew in to town and interviewed us all , while consuming vast quantities of scotch , " recalls Chuck Holland .
" He kept asking if anything exciting happened .
' Well , yeah , ' we said , ' remember when a board burned up ? '
It 's so silly that none of us thought to make up something juicy .
Needless to say , there was no movie . "
Even without an accompanying Hollywood blockbuster , the book has seen remarkable success .
Translated into a dozen languages , today it 's required reading in top business schools and universities as a case study in everything from effective project management to the exploited capitalist worker .
Over the years , as minicomputers landed on the scrap heap and Data General faded , Soul continued to fascinate readers who found some kernel of truth in what Kidder captures about the intensity of the working world , something that transcends high tech .
" It 's got a Zen characteristic , " says West .
" It 's not a cookbook for building computers .
It 's not a cookbook for good management strategies .
Why did this book strike a chord with such discordant people ?
I 'm not sure I know .
Tracy can't tell you .
It has something to do with work , and dreams , and why people do it . "
Every Eagle veteran recalls encountering readers , from washing - machine repairmen to teachers , who could relate to the book - and countless engineers who were inspired by it .
Data General , meanwhile , never hesitated to wring every drop of publicity from Soul 's success , despite the fact that most Eagle alumni felt thoroughly unrewarded by DG .
The company handed out copies of the book to scores of potential clients and recruits over the years , and even mentioned it in one of its annual reports .
Something in the use of Soul as a publicity tool , however , defies everything that went into the Eagle project .
The engineers , after all , never sought a record of events , nor did they promote their connection to the book over the years .
Although happy to be recognized , all of them pin the book 's success squarely on Kidder 's storytelling ability , not their own efforts to create a long - outdated computer .
For them , the goal was to finish the machine so they could sign up again , and get on with their real business - technical creation .
Back in Westborough , West was often asked to autograph copies for clients and VIPs .
It irritated him .
" It was Tracy 's book , " he laments .
Signing Soul triggered a self - denial not unfamiliar to colleagues like Alsing and Wallach who have watched him lead .
" I kept trying to point out to people that this is a book .
Tracy won the Pulitzer Prize .
I did n't win the Pulitzer Prize .
And they did n't seem to always get it . "
Joel Schwartz recounts a time when West flatly refused to sign books promised to a group of 30 visiting Korean clients and dignitaries .
" Tom had a raggedy side , " remembers Schwartz .
" He was having one of those days , and he did n't want to sign them .
I called him , I pleaded with him .
But he would n't do it . "
Perhaps it was this same obstinate focus and proclivity for privacy that not only drove West to create the Eagle but also to stay at DG for the next 20 years .
Schwartz continues : " So I said there 's only one thing to do .
I brought them over and signed them all myself : ' Best wishes , Tom West . ' "

Details of the clashes that sparked the apparent air strike remain unclear Pakistan 's Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has condemned an air strike by Afghanistan - based US forces that Islamabad says killed 11 of its troops .
The incident took place inside Pakistan , near the border with Afghanistan .
The US military confirmed it had used artillery and air strikes after coming under fire from " anti-Afghan " forces .
The incident comes as relations between the US and Pakistan militaries have been hit by mounting tensions .
The soldiers ' deaths occurred overnight at a border post in the mountainous Gora Prai region in Mohmand , one of Pakistan 's tribal areas , across the border from Afghanistan 's Kunar province .
Eight Taleban militants were also killed in the clashes , a Taleban spokesman said .
' Cowardly act '
If the 11 deaths are confirmed , it would be the worst incident of its kind since US and Nato - led forces began fighting militants in Afghanistan in 2001 .
Prime Minister Gilani condemned the deaths , telling parliament : " We will take a stand for the sake of this country 's sovereignty , for the sake of its dignity and self - respect " .
" We do not allow our territory to be used .
We completely condemn this , and will take it up through the foreign office . "
Pakistan 's military called it a " completely unprovoked and cowardly act " .
Pakistan - US relations hit a low Meeting feared Pakistani militant
The US military said in a statement that coalition troops had come under fire from " anti-Afghan forces " in a wooded area near the Pakistan border .
The statement said artillery and air strikes had been co-ordinated with Pakistan , but that the incident was being investigated .
A spokesman for a pro-Taleban militant group in Pakistan said it had launched an attack on US and Afghan army troops trying to set up a border control post .
" We launched an attack on them from several sides and caused serious harm - and then the US and Nato forces began a series of air strikes , " said the spokesman , Maulvi Umar .
Lawless border
There is increasing anger in Pakistan at US strikes on its territory which have killed more than 50 people this year , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad .
Both US forces and Nato - led coalition forces are operating in Afghanistan , with Nato focused mainly on peacekeeping and reconstruction and the US troops working more directly to combat militant activity .

Advertisement Taleban fighters have a strong presence in the border areas of the tribal districts and local administrators have little power there , although security forces keep a presence on the border .
There is rising frustration among the Afghans and foreign troops at Pakistani efforts to negotiate peace deals with pro-Taleban militants on its side of the border .
Afghan and US - led forces accuse Islamabad of not doing enough to deny Taleban militants a hiding place in Pakistan 's tribal areas and to stop them from infiltrating the border into Afghanistan .
They are worried that the Pakistan government 's recent peace talks with the militants there will only give the Taleban more room for manoeuvre .
Pakistan denies the accusations , saying it has lost about 1,000 soldiers fighting militants in the tribal border areas .

THE company that could be forced to add fluoride to Hampshire residents ' tap water has refused to tell the Daily Echo exactly where the medicated supplies would go .
Southern
Water says it is referring all requests for information on the proposed fluoridation scheme to South Central Strategic Health Authority ( SHA ) , because it does n't want to run the risk of giving out conflicting details .
As revealed in yesterday 's Daily Echo , more than 36,000 people living outside Southampton 's boundaries would also receive fluoridated water .
Click here for the complete archive of articles and reports into both sides of the fluoride debate
But when the paper contacted the company for details of the areas the request was refused .
A Southern Water spokeswoman said they could not reveal which neighbourhoods are served by the two distribution centres - Otterbourne and Rownhams - that would be used to add fluoride to water supplies .
She said : " Southern Water is required to assist a strategic health authority with their feasibility study by providing information on the water supply and dis- tribution system .
" The SHA is carrying out this public consultation and inquiries will be referred to it . "
If the SHA decides to back the scheme , supplies to two - thirds of Southampton households - some 160,000 people - would be fluoridated .
That would mean seven of the 11 priority areas in the city , where dental health is at its worst , would get topped - up fluoride in their water .
But another 36,261 people living outside the city , mainly in Eastleigh , Totton and Netley , would also receive the medicated tap water .
If the SHA does give fluoridation the green light , Southern Water would have no power to stop it .
An attempt by city health chiefs in 1993 to add fluoride to supplies was scuppered when the water company refused to implement it .
However , since then the law has been changed to avoid that situation arising again .
From a dimly lit room in a secure command center , 21 streaming video feeds from 4,775 surveillance cameras around the nation ’s capital are projected across three screens and monitored at all hours .
Every few seconds , footage from a different location pops up -- a busy road , a picnic bench , the entrance to the new baseball stadium .
Seven years after the Sept. 11 attacks , Mayor Adrian M. Fenty is trying to set up one of the most comprehensive centrally controlled visual surveillance systems in the world .
In the nerve center , which opened last month , the city ’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency can monitor video from four city agencies -- covering streets , schools , housing projects , parks and roads -- for threats and other nefarious activities .
For those who have accepted the city ’s fate as a prime terrorist target , this may be cause for relief .
But to the many civil liberties groups headquartered in Washington , the move undermines privacy , encourages abuse and represents the first step toward a surveillance system like London ’s , where a person ’s every public move can be tracked on about 10,000 government - funded cameras that have been dubbed a “ ring of steel . ”
Soon , Fenty hopes , the system will include feeds from 5,625 cameras run by eight agencies , including the Metropolitan Police Department .
But critics , including members of the District of Columbia Council , want to slow down .

“ The program was announced without any detail or planning around who would have access , for what purpose , and what would happen with any video or digital archive , ” said Councilman Phil Mendelson , who spearheaded a measure , approved June 3 , to strictly limit how the cameras are used until the council can approve standards .
The video program ’s future is somewhat blurry .
Darrell L. Darnell , director of the agency that runs the new monitoring center , told the council : “ All policies are still in draft and awaiting formal legal review . ”
At least until that review is complete , the council has ordered the consolidated system to use the standards created in 2006 for the Police Department ’s camera program .
The standards require that footage be kept only 10 days unless it is believed relevant to a criminal investigation , and that the public be alerted as cameras are installed .
Besides helping Washington fight crime , the mayor ’s office says , consolidation will cut the cost of monitoring the closed - circuit television feeds by a third .
And officials say much of the expense in bringing the system together -- an estimated $ 5.1 million for fiscal year 2009 -- will be covered by federal grants .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has praised cameras as a crucial anti-terrorism tool .
Advertisement
Still , some do n’t think the cameras are justified .
James Jay Carafano , a counter - terrorism expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said he was concerned that the Homeland Security grants were encouraging cities to set up camera networks that they might not be able to maintain :
“ The problem is , in a couple of years , when the federal money runs out , you ’re going to be stuck with that system . ”
Others are concerned about broadening access to the public schools ’ 3,500 cameras , though Washington officials say a central office can better deal with vandalism and school trespassing .
Nationally , no solid statistics are available on how many camera systems have been integrated .
Civil libertarians have complained about city governments ’ lack of transparency .
Advertisement
But Washington is not alone in expanding the use of cameras .
Chicago and New York control thousands of cameras .
Los Angeles has considered consolidating camera systems , city officials say , but logistics and financing are obstacles .
The city maintains camera networks at LAX and the port and around city buildings , and the Transportation Department has 32 traffic cameras .
The Police Department has 80 cameras , monitored from about half a dozen police divisions , mostly in Hollywood , on Skid Row and at MacArthur Park .
Washington police say cameras make the streets safer .
Last year , three homicides and an assault on a police officer were captured on video , a police study found .
And in areas within 250 feet of a camera , violent crime declined 19 % last year , the study said .
Advertisement
Critics say cameras simply move crime onto side streets , out of video range .
“ When you measure the effectiveness of these cameras against the harm they do to civil liberties , there just does n’t seem to be a question for us , ” said Johnny Barnes , executive director of the National Capital Area chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union .
Among residents , cameras are popular , said Councilwoman Muriel Bowser , who represents a relatively affluent northern area of Washington .
“ There ’s not a meeting or a community that I go into , ” she told her colleagues , “ that does n’t tell us how cameras have positively impacted public safety in their neighborhoods . ”

Times staff writer Andrew Blankstein in Los Angeles contributed to this report .
Brit Hume and FOX news pride themselves on his one hour show .
A while back --- Roger Ailes said on CSPAN that he dared anyone to dispute the fact the Hume 's show is n't the most fair and balanced cable news program on TV .
( paraphrasing )
Roger , I think you need to rethink it .
I was repeatedly emailed the alleged story of Obama 's half brother calling Obama a Muslim in the Jerusalem Post yesterday .
I googled it and found no story .
It was obviously pulled because it was n't true .
ABC did a fact check on it and guess what they found ?
It was a fraud .
It was a sloppy paraphrase that emerged as false evidence .
Malik Obama , the older half brother of Sen. Barack Obama , D - Illinois , gave a brief interview to Israeli Army Radio .
The Jerusalem Post listened to the interview , apparently , and produced a story saying " Malik Obama says his brother will be good president for the Jews .
Barack Obama 's half brother Malik said Thursday that if elected his brother will be a good president for the Jewish people , despite his Muslim background . "
Nowhere is Malik quoted .
The Jerusalem Post has since taken the story down of its website , It ended up on Fox News , with anchor Brut Hume saying on June 16 that : " Barack Obama is a practicing Christian , married in a Christian church , whose children were also baptized in that church .
His campaign has emphasized his faith in part to dispel what the campaign calls an online smear campaign which contends among other things that Obama was raised a Muslim .
There is even a statement on his official campaign website reading , quote , ' Obama has never been a Muslim , and is a committed Christian . '
But Obama 's half brother is not so sure .
Malik Obama tells
The Jerusalem Post that , 'if elected his brother will be a good president for the Jewish people , despite his Muslim background . ' "
So is it true ?
No .
Brit Hume reads the smear , repeats the smear because Conservatives pounced on it and once again pushed a false narrative into our airwaves .
I watched the next two days of Hume 's Political Grape Vine section and he did n't issue a correction .

You know what 's getting really tedious ?
All these time travelers .
It seems like two weeks do n't go by without some jerk with a time belt and a bad attitude blinking into my living room and trying to zap me into molecules , usually right in the middle of House .
Some of them are members of something called " The Chrono - Police , " some are plucky adventurers from the 30th century , and one of them was a crazy scientist / inventor from 2035 who tried to brain me with a bust of President Clinton - Bush .
It took me a while to work out the details , but apparently I 'm going to have one or more children someday , and then eventually grandchildren , and one of my grandkids grows up to make some trouble for all of humanity and a couple alien species as well .
From what I can gather , it involves a massive army of genetically modified great apes , the enslavement of a third of mankind , roving gangs of freelance executioners and four more Highlander movies .
I 've tried to get the time assassins to give me a clearer picture than that , but I have n't been able to for a couple reasons .
First off , they 're trying to shoot me .
Secondly , they keep talking about " polluting the time stream " if they tell me more .
Hello ?
You 're trying to kill me !
Does it really hurt anything if you talk to me for a couple minutes first ?
They wo n't even tell me which of my future grandkids it will be .
It seems in their time he 's just known as " Lord Killwolf the Unrepentant " and he wears an iron mask forged with the blood of his enemies .
Thanks , time guys , huge help .
Hell , I even went in to get a vasectomy , and it turns out the doctor was actually a time mercenary in disguise , ready to kill me on the operating table .
How does that even make sense ?
Do people think about these things , or do they just grab a plasma cannon and set the dial for 2007 ?
Now , you might think I 'm just being self - centered , but I 'm not alone in this .
Most of my friends are getting the same deal .
Mark says one of his grandkids blows up the moon in the late 2080s , a couple of Greg 's grandchildren form a death cult , and one of Chris ' grandkids is hired to make a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon show after Bill Watterson dies .
Calvin raps and snowboards a lot in it ; apparently that cheeses people off .
That 's why I 'm forming Eventual Grandfathers Against Temporal Travel , Tampering and Termination .
EGATTTT will be putting a number of brochures and public service videos in time - release vaults so as to educate people of the future about the human costs of going back in time and killing grandfathers .
Our first brochure will ask the question , " Why grandfathers ? "
I mean , come on , future folks , these kids have parents !
They 're the ones who raised mass murderers and despotic overlords , not us !
If you have to warp back in time and kill someone – and we 're not saying you should – why not daddy and mommy ?
Or , here 's a thought , sit down for this one , why not kill the evil kid ?
Whoa !
Right to the chase there !
God forbid you actually laser - erase the person who froze the ocean or put you to work in the ozone mines !
With any luck , by the time time travel is invented , EGATTTT will be a powerful enough force to impose penalties on people who tamper with time .
Harsh penalties .
If I have my way , people will be afraid to leave their homes for fear of being mistaken by a hovering death bot for a known time traveler and disintegrated on the spot , leaving nothing but a warm section of sidewalk and the lingering scent of terror .
Which , come to think of it , might be why my grandfather kept getting attacked by time travelers back in the '40s .

The call he will never forget came for Peter Ueberroth in the middle of the night on May 12 , 1984 , over a crackling phone line from Beijing .
It carried the news he believed would determine the fate of the Olympics , not just the Games he was working to organize in Los Angeles that summer but all the ones beyond .
At the other end of the line was Charles Lee , the man he had sent to persuade the Chinese to send their team to the Olympics for the first time .
Ueberroth , the leader of the Los Angeles organizing committee , was asking China to defy a Soviet Union - led boycott that was announced four days earlier .
The Soviets said the boycott would keep 100 countries away from the ’ 84 Games .
If the Soviets succeeded , Ueberroth said flatly , “ we were done . ”
Salvation came when Lee called and told Ueberroth , “ They ’re coming . ”
As the world prepares for the Beijing Games in August , that moment is all but lost in the history of the Olympics , when the winds shifted and carried the Games away from a political bludgeon in the cold war to the combination of athletic and commercial success they have become since .
Ueberroth , now 70 and the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee , will lead the American team into China with a deep sense of gratitude .
He believes China saved the Olympics .

Where is religion and God mentioned in the Constitution ?
The United States Government is founded on The Constitution .
That document defines and determines the nature and intent of the structure of the country 's ruling body .
Nowhere in the Constitution is " God " mentioned .
Nowhere in the Constitution is " Jesus " or " Christianity " or any specific type of religion or belief system mentioned .
Surely if the entire nation was founded on Christianity , if that were the maker 's intent , they would have mentioned it .
Instead , it 's exactly the opposite .
The founding fathers made it quite clear the government was secular .
The only reference to religion in the main body of the Constitution is in Article VI which is explicitly secular in nature :
" no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States . "
Furthermore the First Amendment to the Constitution makes another secular statement :
" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ... "
The Constitution is un-ambiguous when it comes to suggesting that no religious qualification is needed to serve in government , and government shall in no way endorse ( nor prohibit ) the establishment or exercise of religion .
What our founding fathers had to say about religion
The argument that our country is a " Christian Nation " is pretty easy to disprove .
A pretty common argument involves mention of the " In God We Trust " phrase which appears on both our paper and coin currencies .
Of course , this phrase did n't appear on the coins until the late 1800s , and not on the the bills until the 1950s .
In addition , many of our founding fathers were not Christians .
Some quotes from those clever folks :
John Adams
" God is an essence that we know nothing of .
Until this awful blasphemy is got rid of , there will never be any liberal science in the world . "
George Washington
" Religious controversies are always productive of more acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause .
Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind , those which are caused by the difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing , and ought most to be depreciated .
I was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy , which has marked the present age , would at least have reconciled Christians of every denomination so far that we should never again see the religious disputes carried to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society . " -- letter to Edward Newenham , 1792
Benjamin Franklin
" In the affairs of the world , men are saved , not by faith , but by the lack of it . "
Thomas Jefferson
" Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise . " - letter to Wm. Bradford , April 1 , 1774
" I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world , and do not find in our particular superstition ( Christianity ) one redeeming feature .
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology . "
“ Christianity is the most perverted system ever shone to man . ”
" Question with boldness even the existence of a God ; because , if there be one , he must more approve of the homage of reason , than that of blindfolded fear . "
“ Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man & his god , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , and not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , thus building a wall of separation between church and state . ”
The Treaty of Tripoli
" As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion , -- as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion or tranquility of Musselmen , -- and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mohammedan nation , it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever interrupt the harmony existing between the two countries . "
What Leading Scientists Say About The Bible
Bill Nye
" The biblical verse Genesis 1:16 reads : “ God made two great light , the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars .
The sun , the ' greater light , ' is but one of countless stars and that the ' lesser light ' is the moon , which really is not a light at all , rather a reflector of light . "
The Christian Majority
Some Christians claim that because the majority of people in America are Christian , America is a Christian Nation .
However this argument has many holes in it .
For example , does that mean that because there are a majority of women in America , America is a female Nation ?
Religion is a problem .
In accordance with the Treaty of Tripoli , and the ambitions of egalitarianism , both religiously and politically , the founders of the United States of America made quite clear the Religious equality that they sought shall never be infringed upon .
To attempt to counter - act the religious freedom constituted by the first amendment is treason to the United States of America , an act quite often committed by Christians .

WASHINGTON — Nearly three out of five middle - class retirees will probably run out of money if they maintain their pre-retirement lifestyles , a new study has concluded .
The study from Ernst & Young , to be released Monday , finds that Americans will have to drastically reduce their standard of living before retirement to live comfortably , or even avoid destitution , later in life .
Middle - income Americans entering retirement now will have to reduce their standard of living by an average of 24 percent to minimize their chances of outliving their financial assets , the study found .
Workers seven years from retirement will have to cut their spending by even more — by 37 percent .
“ People are going to have to adapt in a number of ways that they were n’t anticipating or hoping for , ” said Tom Neubig , national director of the Quantitative Economics and Statistics practice at Ernst & Young .
“ I think a lot of people are hoping to maintain roughly the same standard of living after retirement .
Our study suggests they are going to have to make some changes . ”
About 77 million baby boomers are expected to retire over the next few years .
The study warns of an impending national crisis if workers , and lawmakers , do not react now to the changing pension structures in corporate America .
Most companies have moved away from defined - benefit plans , in which they provided their retirees with a set benefit each month , to defined - contribution plans such as 401 ( k ) s , in which the employee takes most of the responsibility for saving money .
But with the U.S. savings rate abysmally low and people underestimating their life spans , economists warn that aspiring retirees will have to work longer if they do not spend less , no small feat at a time when inflation and the cost of living are rising .
Fluctuating investment returns on 401 ( k ) - style plans in this wobbly stock market are not helping matters .
“ Most people , if they look at their life expectancy and they think they will live to 90 , they are nuts to retire at 60 .
They ’re going to be living in poverty at 80 , ” said Peter Morici , an economist at the University of Maryland .
“ I think it ’s a wake - up call to baby boomers to get serious about getting their houses in order . ”
The study was commissioned by Americans for Secure Retirement , a coalition of more than 50 organizations representing women ’s , small - business , agricultural , Latino and African - American groups , among others .
It looked at married and single near - and recent retirees at three pre-retirement income levels : $ 50,000 , $ 75,000 and $ 100,000 .
Retirees would be much better prepared if they had a guaranteed source of retirement income beyond Social Security , the study concluded .
Married couples relying on income aside from Social Security and making $ 75,000 at retirement have a 31 percent chance of running out of money if they maintain their pre-retirement lifestyles , the study pointed out .
Those who rely solely on Social Security have a 90 percent chance .
Congress has taken up the matter .
One bill , for instance , would make it easier for workers to get a particular non-Social Security retirement vehicle : an annuity , which is an income - generating contract between the employee and an insurance company .
The legislation would exclude from taxation 50 percent of the income received from a lifetime annuity , up to $ 20,000 per year .
“ It ’s that paycheck every month for the rest of their lives that will allow people to have some standard of living , ” said Joe Reali , chairman of Americans for Secure Retirement , which has life insurance companies as members .
But David Armstrong , managing director of Alexandria , Va. - based Monument Wealth Management , said the best way for Americans to live well in retirement is to plan for it early .
Save your money and make sure you start your 401 ( k ) at an early age , he said .
Figure out what your nonnegotiable expenses and assets are .
If you do n’t have enough money to cover your necessities , he said , cut out any luxuries in your lifestyle .
PARIS  Sixty years after the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , governments in scores of countries still torture or mistreat their people , Amnesty International said Wednesday in a report that again urged the United States to close down the Guantánamo Bay detention camp in Cuba .
In its annual report , the London - based human rights watchdog said “ flashpoints ” in Darfur , Zimbabwe , Gaza , Iraq / and Myanmar “ demand immediate action . ”
“ World leaders are in a state of denial but their failure to act has a high cost , ” Irene Khan , the secretary general of Amnesty International , said in a statement accompanying the report .
“ As Iraq and Afghanistan show , human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses than can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us . ”
The report singled out for criticism China , the United States , and Russia and accused the European Union of complicity in the rendition of terrorism suspects .
The European Union , it said , must “ set the same bar on human rights for its own members as it does for other countries . ”
Whenever a post is removed from a blog , my first instinct is to go to an RSS reader like Google Reader or Bloglines and find the same post there , to see if it is still available .
A big mistake most bloggers and authors make is when they make mistakes they delete the post and not edit it .
For example , let 's say you get mad and you blog about what angers you , while you are angry .
Yes , that is typically the worse time to blog , when you are angry .
You hit the publish button and then go on your way .
Minutes later , your post comes up in your RSS reader and you read it .
You instantly become ashamed and want to pull the story asap .
But instead of editing the post , you click the delete button in your blog software .
What happens ?
Your story remains in most RSS readers because most readers to not support removing deleted posts .
Most readers do support post updates .
So if you simply replace your blog post with " This post was removed ... " , then the RSS reader will update with that content and your original post might not show up in your friend 's RSS reader .
A Google Groups thread discusses just that .
Google Reader Guide , Roger , explains how this works :
As a workaround , publishers such as yourself who wish to remove content from Google Reader can change the item 's content but leave the item in the feed - Google Reader 's crawler will update the item in the cache with the new content as long as the item ID remains the same .
This will at least keep the content in question from continuing to appearing in the feed .
Please keep in mind that although Google Reader will re-crawl changed items with stable IDs , not all feedreaders are obliged to do this - any content posted at any time has the potential to be cached by other services .

June 24 , 2008  --
One of the pregnant teenage girls at a Massachusetts high school denied that 17 students had entered a pact in an effort to get pregnant and called the high rate of pregnancies " unlucky " and a " coincidence . "
" There was definitely no pact , " Lindsey Oliver , 17 , who became pregnant when she was a junior , told ABC's " Good Morning America " today .
" There was a group of girls already pregnant that decided they were going to help each other to finish school and raise their kids together .
I think it was just a coincidence . "
News of the pregnancies at Gloucester High School made headlines last week after a rumor reported in Time magazine and given credence in an interview with the school 's principal that the girls promised one another to become pregnant and raise their children together .
The mayor of Gloucester also denied Monday that there was evidence of a pact and blamed the increased number of teen mothers on a lack of health education funding and the " glamorization of pregnancy " in the media .
" Beyond the statement of the principal , we have no evidence there was a pact , " the mayor said .
" The principal could not remember who told him that . "
Kirk blamed the media's " glamorization of pregnancy " and " movies that depicted teen pregnancy as something to be desired . "
She mentioned Jamie Lynn Spears , the 17 - year - old sister of pop singer Britney Spears , who delivered a baby this weekend , and alluded to the recent hit film " Juno , " a hit comedy about a teenager who becomes pregnant .
Oliver said the movies and pop culture had nothing to do with the pregnancy boon .
" I do n't get why people think those movies are glamorizing it , " Oliver said , adding that the Juno character ended up having to put her baby up for adoption .
Oliver said the school should reverse a policy that bans the school 's distribution of contraception to students .
" [ Officials ] say they want to make a difference but wo n't do anything to help [ students ] , " Oliver said .
" They should be giving contraceptives out in the nurse 's office . "
Asked if distributing condoms and birth control would further encourage underage sex , Oliver said , " The kids are obviously having it anyway ; there are 17 pregnant girls . "
Mayor Kirk said that district policy did not permit the distribution of contraceptives but that the policy was under review .
Oliver and her boyfriend , Andrew Psalidas , 20 , a community college student , said the pregnancy was unplanned and that Oliver was on the pill .
The identities of the other girls and their babies ' fathers have not been made public .
According to the principal quoted in the Time article , one girl had sex with a 24 - year - old homeless man .
Kirk would not comment on the fathers of the unborn children , saying only that under Massachusetts law , school officials would be required to report suspicions of statutory rape .
Gloucester , a socially conservative fishing town about 30 miles north of Boston , has struggled with teen pregnancy for years , though on average only four girls a year typically become pregnant at the 1,200 - student high school .
In May , two officials at the high school health center resigned to protest the local hospital 's refusal to distribute contraceptives through the school without parental consent .
A review of environmental skepticism literature from the past 30 years has found that the vast majority of skeptics , often identified as independent , are directly linked to politically oriented , conservative think tanks .
The study , published in this month 's issue of Environmental Politics , analyzed books written between 1972 and 2005 that deny the urgency of environmental protection .
The researchers found that more than 92 percent of the skeptical authors were in some way affiliated to conservative think tanks - non-profit research and advocacy organizations that promote core conservative ideals .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
While many environmental skeptics are known to work for these think tanks , the study is the first to provide a quantitative analysis of the relationship .
The popular media often regard environmental skeptics as independent experts , despite their connection to industry - funded campaigns that seek to de-legitimize sound environmental science reports , especially on climate change , says lead author Peter Jacques , an environmental politics professor at the University of Central Florida .
" A lot of skeptics might say they are independent voices , but it 's clear there is an organization behind the skeptical discourse , " Jacques said .
" If not for conservative think tanks , we would n't be having this same discussion ; we would n't be hung up on whether climate change is real . "
The review analyzed 141 books , which the authors consider the largest compilation of the environmental skepticism genre and the majority of all English - language skepticism books .
An author was " affiliated " to a think tank if the organization published the book or if the author ever - before or after the book was published - held a position with the organization , wrote for an organization 's publications , or delivered lectures sponsored by the organization .
The U.S. conservative movement has lead opposition to international environmental regulation since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro .
In the years since , the movement has succeeded in undermining the credibility of many environmental issues , said Riley Dunlap , a sociology professor at Oklahoma State University , who co-authored the study .
" From the [ political ] right , there 's no longer a sense of neutral , objective science - only liberal or conservative - and that 's an unfortunate trend , " Dunlap said .
Many skeptics say that they form their opinion despite their affiliation to think tanks or industry .
For instance , Ronald Bailey , a correspondent for the ExxonMobil - funded Reason Foundation and former fellow for the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute , recently reversed his stance as a climate change denier .
His original skepticism was the result of inconsistent temperature datasets .
He was not " passing along misinformation supplied to me during expensive lunches , " he wrote in the article Confessions of an Alleged ExxonMobil Whore .
The authors say skeptics like Bailey have every right to voice their opinion .
But the statements of a few think tank - supported experts should not be regarded as equal to scientific findings that have been vetted through an intense peer - review process , they say .
" We want to allow a cacophony of voices in public policy , " Jacques said .
" Where we get into problems is where we fail to evaluate the voices ; we fail to evaluate the merit of the claim . "

Five conservation groups have filed suit in a federal court to stop the US Department of the Interior from feeding elk in Wyoming 's National Elk Refuge .
The groups say that the artificial feeding , which began a century ago , is creating a breeding ground for diseases that are harmful to wildlife and livestock .
The suit , was filed Tuesday by Earthjustice , a nonprofit environmental law firm , on behalf of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition , Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance , Defenders of Wildlife , Wyoming Outdoor Council , and the National Wildlife Refuge Association .
An Earthjustice press release alleges that the feedings are destroying the ecosystem :
Winter feedings on the National Elk Refuge have altered the plant and animal communities so dramatically that it is no longer a healthy , properly functioning environment .
This practice violates the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act , a directive from Congress to provide healthy habitat .
The agency 's current plan acknowledges the potent disease risk that accompanies high concentrations of animals like those found on the Elk Refuge in winter , and that the best way to reduce the threat and promote healthy populations of bison and elk is to phase out the annual winter feeding .
Yet the plan takes no action to address the threats to the refuge and the elk that live there .
" Elk feeding was established as a means to help the elk , but now we know that crowded feedlines threaten a wildlife disease epidemic that could kill hundreds of these magnificent animals , " said Tim Preso of Earthjustice who is representing the coalition .
" It 's time to adapt our elk management to deal with this disease threat before elk start dying on the National Elk Refuge . "
" Basically we 've got way too many animals on too small an area for too long a time , " said Barry Reiswig , a retired National Elk Refuge manager .
" They 're way over the Elk Refuge 's carrying capacity . "
The environmental groups contend that the feedings create an ideal environment for the transmission of chronic wasting disease , considered fatal to elk , moose , and deer , as well as brucellosis , a bacterial infection believed to cause spontaneous abortion in cattle .
On Tuesday , the Monitor reported that 4,700 bison have been slaughtered in the past six months in a controversial plan to prevent them from infecting beef cattle with brucellosis .
The Associated Press notes that the practice of feeding the elk began a century ago , when homesteaders sought to keep elk from starving after cattle herds had eaten much of the grass .
Last winter , some 8,300 elk and 920 bison ate more than 8.4 million pounds of alfalfa pellets – the equivalent of 175 semitrailer loads of feed .
The New York Times says that there 's a lot of money at stake in keeping the elk from starving :
Wyoming ’s economy would be affected by ending the feeding of elk at the refuge , which has become a tourist attraction .
Last winter more than 25,000 people paid $ 16 each to ride on sleighs pulled by horses among herds of elk on snow - covered landscapes .
In addition , ranchers do not want hungry wild elk competing with their cattle for food , and hunting outfitters want assurances that plenty of animals will be available for their clients to stalk .
According to the AP story , hunting groups have been pressuring the Interior Department to continue the feedings :
Bob Wharff , executive director of Wyoming Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife , said an abrupt end to feeding could have negative consequences .
" There comes a point where you do n't feed them and they get to a weakened state .
They'd get far more susceptible [ to disease ] , " he said .
Wharff said a study done for his organization several years ago indicated elk populations would decline by 60 to 80 percent if feeding stopped .
" I do n't think anybody is going to sit back and let them all starve to death , " he added .

Update :
Be sure to read the first comment from Sophie Osborn , a wildlife biologist for the Wyoming Outdoor Council , one of the plaintiffs in the suit .
She correctly points out that the plaintiffs are not calling for a sudden halt to the feedings , but rather a five - year phase out .

Canoeist is arrested , held for two hours and has his DNA taken - all for the ' crime ' of paddling down a river
As he paddled along one of Britain 's most beautiful stretches of river , Nigel Conway pondered the stand he'd just taken .
The keen sportsman had refused to pay £ 3 to a rafting company for the right to take his canoe on the waterway .
Mr Conway mused that such defiance might stir up debate , perhaps even a bit of a row with the firm – and he was happy to argue the point .
But unfortunately , he was heading for much rougher water .
Making waves : Nigel Conway in his canoe
The company contacted North Wales police officers , who arrested Mr Conway and took him to a police station and questioned him for more than two hours .
His fingerprints and a mugshot were taken , as was his DNA .
' I was totally shocked , ' said Mr Conway , 32 , from Shrewsbury , Shropshire .
' I could n't believe they had come to arrest me .
' I refused to pay to paddle the river – it is a matter of principle – everyone should have the right to access water free of charge .
' But because I politely declined they took me to a police station and I had my fingerprints , a photograph and my DNA taken .
That was the most annoying thing because that will be kept on permanent record .
' It was such a joke , even the officers at the station were laughing about why I 'd been arrested . '
Mr Conway 's ordeal is the latest controversy for North Wales police , whose chief constable Richard Brunstrom , has a habit of making headlines .
North Wales Police Chief Constable Richard Brunstrom :
He has earned the nickname ' the Mad Mullah of the Traffic Taliban '
Nicknamed ' the Mad Mullah of the Traffic Taliban ' for his zeal on road safety issues , he has called for the number of speed cameras to be trebled , the legalisation of hard drugs and been forced to apologise for handing out pictures of a decapitated motorcyclist without the permission of the victim 's family .
Mr Brunstrom also defied Crown Prosecution Service advice by investigating claims that Tony Blair shouted 'f****** Welsh ' after Labour 's poor performance in the 1999 Welsh Assembly election .
Arthur Roberts , spokesman for campaigners People for Proper Policing , said : ' This beggars belief .
It is another example of North Wales police going too far and criminalising innocent members of the public trying to go about their daily lives .
' Not content with making the lives of motorists a misery , it seems North Wales police are going for canoeists as well .
This is a total waste of taxpayers ' money . '
Mr Conway was arrested last Thursday , a week after he refused to pay to paddle along the River Dee , in Llangollen , North Wales .
James Jayes , an Olympic canoeing coach who owns JJ Canoeing and Rafting and leases land on either side of the river from a local landowner , claims he owns the rights to the riverbed .
He charges the public between £ 3 and £ 5 to paddle a 830 - yard stretch of water near his premises .
Mr Conway , a married father of one who owns a canoe shop , ' politely declined ' to pay the fee when approached by a member of staff on the riverbank .
He was arrested under Section 11 of the Fraud Act 2006 for ' obtaining services dishonestly ' before being released on police bail .
He is due to find out next month whether he will be charged .
There is no specific law governing rights of access on rivers in England and Wales .
Landowners who have bought land along a stretch of riverbank argue they own that stretch of river , therefore they have a right to charge people to use it .
However , boating and canoeing organisations disagree .
Mr Conway is a member of Shrewsbury Canoe Club .
If his case goes to court it could be an important test case for river access rights , a spokesman for the club said .
A spokesman for JJ Canoeing and Rafting refused to comment .
A North Wales Police spokeswoman said : ' A man has been arrested on suspicion of obtaining services dishonestly and has been released on police bail pending further inquiries . '
キーサインパーティーの実施と効率的な身分証明書確認について考えてみた。
キーサインもらっ た
先日、 日本Ruby 会 議2008 の懇親会 でPGP公開鍵に卜部さんのキーサインをもらった。キーににサインしてもらうのはこれが初めてで、今まで何のために公開鍵使ってたんだという話はある。「信頼の輪」に入ってなかったわけだからね。
PGP とか信頼の輪とかの話は OpenPGP作法 ( PDF ) を参照。
ちなみに、私の公開鍵 は pgp.nic.ad.jp に登録してあって、yugui.jpのメールアドレスで検索すると出てくる。fingerprintは" 438 F 411C FC0E 9589 A0E3 CC88 397C C7E4 92 DB FC05 " 。新しいバージョンの名刺にはfingerprintを入れたから、比較的最近名刺を交換した人は見てもらうと裏に書いてある筈。
Rubyコミッタの認証には一応PGP公開鍵を使っていて、いざというときのオンラインの本人認証には「信頼の輪」が活躍するわけだ。だから、「コミッタは名刺にfingerpintを入れろ」と CommitterHowto に書いてある。ま、普段 はRubyistはもっとやることがルーズだけど、それでも厳密なセキュリティが必要な場面というのはあるわけだ。
キーサインパーティーしたい!
で、Rubyの人たちの間でもっとPGP署名を活用するために、今度の「日本Rubyの忘年会」か日本Ruby会議2009のときにでも、「日本Rubyのキーサインパーティー」をやりたいと思っている。前回の忘年会でも今回のRubyKaigiでも提案しようと思って忘れていたので、次回こそは!
ここで、どうやって効率的に本人確認をするか、という問題がある。公開鍵にキーサインをするというのは、「その公開鍵に対応する秘密鍵の持ち主がその人本人であることを、私が確認したことを保証する」って意味なわけだ。Debianみたいな開発者が世界中に散った開発プロジェクトの成果物をそれなりに信頼できるのは、こうして確認された「信頼の輪」によるものだ。各パッケージの開発者が全員「Debianコアメンバーの顔見知りの誰々の顔見知りである誰々」という風に実在の、トレースできる誰かであることが保証されているからだ。いい加減な確認でサインしてしまうとそこで「信頼の輪」が崩れるとか、自分が「いい加減なサインをする奴」ということで信頼を失うとかしかねない。
というわけで、キーサインするに当たってはその鍵を持っている人を、「国家もしくはそれに準じる組織による身分証明書」によって確認することになっている。私は自動車運転免許証を卜部さんにみせたし、卜部さんはパスポートを持ってきていた。なるほど、国際カンファレンスではパスポートのほうが確認してもらいやすくて良いんだろうな。慣れてるね。
本題
Debianの過去ログ を見ると、身分証明書確認のやり方が書いてある。「2列になって」と書いてあるのは、つまり二人ペアになって確認し、確認したら1つずつずれて、端の人は反対の列に移って、これで一周したら全員の身分証明書を確認しした、ということなのだろう。
Sassaman方式というらしい。O(n)だから、全員がごっちゃになってfingerprintを渡して確認してを個別にやる場合のO(n2)よりは効率がよい。
でも、n人のパーティーで確認するにはn回ずれる必要がある。もっと効率よくできないのか。そこでどうすれば良いのか3分くらい考えてみた。
仮定
そこで、m人組を作って相互確認し、それから組を攪拌した後にこれを繰り返す、ということを考える。
小さな素数pをとる。簡単のため、今パーティー参加者はp 2 人とする。
人とする。 p人組をp個作る。これらを第0 組 .. 第( p-1)組とする。また各人には組内で一意な0 .. ( p-1) の番号を与える。
各組で相互確認を行 う
その後、番号がjで、現在第i組にいる人は第( i+j ) mod p組へ移動する 繰り返 す
これをp-1回行うと、全員が全員を確認したことになる。pは小さいのだからそれこそ列を作れば組み分けは容易だし、移動回数が少ない分だけ速いんじゃないかと思った。
が、が、実際にはどうだろう。
素数の2乗に足りない部分は欠落させておいても大丈夫そう
だが、p人組内の確認は本当に速いのか? これをほぽO(1)と見なせば良いんだが、実際にはO( p)だったりしないか?
だとすると、結局O(n ) = O( p 2 ) じゃないか 。
操作が複雑な分だけ混乱を起こしそう そこに不正な動きをする余地がある?
互いに最初は信頼していなくても信頼の輪を広げられる、というのが趣旨だから不正を許すようでは意味がない?
仮定が成立する 「 十分小さいp」は精々が7じゃないかな?
だとすると、7×7=49で、オーダーを気にして複雑な操作をする意味があるか?
難しいね。と、3分ぐらい考えたことを書いてみた次第。このアイディア、絶対に既出で「捨てられた」ことがあると思う。公開鍵暗号を扱う人たちが巡回群を考えないわけないもん。
山なし落ちなし意味なし。

Revealed after 50 years :
The secret of the greatest - ever student prank
It was probably the most ingenious student prank of all time .
In June 1958 , Cambridge awoke to see a car perched at the apex of an inaccessible rooftop , looking as if it were driving across the skyline .
The spectacle made headlines around the world and left police , firefighters and civil defence units battling for nearly a week to hoist the vehicle back down before giving in and taking it to pieces with blowtorches .
Anywhere for a parking space :
The students perched the Austin Seven on the top of the Senate House roof
The shadowy group of engineering students who executed the stunt were never identified and the mystery of how they did it has baffled successive undergraduates and provided fodder for countless tourist guides .
Now , 50 years on , the group have reunited to disclose their identities and reveal how they winched an Austin Seven to the top of the university 's 70 ft - high Senate House .
At an anniversary dinner this month , ringleader Peter Davey revealed he had hatched the plan while staying in rooms at Gonville and Caius College overlooking the Senate House roof .
He felt the expanse of roof ' cried out ' to be made more interesting and decided a car would do the trick , recruiting 11 others to help realise his plan .
The group chose the May Bumps week , when any passers - by were likely to be drunken rowers celebrating after their races .
After finding a clapped - out Austin Seven , the group had to tow it through Cambridge to a parking space near Senate House but hit on the idea of sticking signs on it advertising a May ball to explain its presence .
Mr Davey , now 72 , said a ground party manoeuvred the car into position while a lifting party on the Senate House roof hoisted it up using an A - shaped crane constructed from scaffolding poles and steel rope .
A third group , the bridge party , passed a plank across the notorious Senate House Leap - an 8ft gap between the roof and a turret window at Caius - and helped the lifters ferry across lifting gear comprising three types of rope , hooks and pulleys .
Policemen who heard a commotion as the equipment passed above them questioned some of the ground party but were distracted by careless drivers nearby and left them alone .
Vertical lift :
The mechanics of the prank baffled onlookers
Three carousing rowers spotted the car swinging about 40ft up , despite the efforts of two girls on the ground team who had been recruited to hitch up their skirts a couple of inches to distract passers - by - a ploy more likely to work in 1958 than now .
The rowers were fobbed off with the explanation that it was a tethered balloon .
The stunt almost went awry when the team tried to swing the car through the apex of the A - frame , over the Senate House balustrade and on to the roof .
They had failed to erect a rope check line running from the Caius side which would have steadied the vehicle .
It crashed on to the roof from 5ft above it and , fearing they would be discovered , the lifting team hastily pushed it to the apex before grabbing their equipment and fleeing over the plank bridge .
The next day the bizarre sight enthralled crowds of onlookers as attempts by the authorities to construct a crane to hoist it back down failed .
The then Dean of Caius , the late Rev Hugh Montefiore , had an inkling who was responsible and sent a congratulatory case of champagne to their staircase , while maintaining in public he knew nothing of the culprits .
Unsurprisingly given their inventiveness , many of the group went on to enjoy illustrious careers - and Caius officials said the ' renegades ' had turned into generous benefactors of the college .
The morning after : Peter Davey celebrates the prank , and later received a case of champagne from then - Dean , Rev Hugh Montefiore
Mr Davey , from Mousehole , Cornwall , was awarded a CBE and an honorary doctorate after setting up automation and robotics companies while another , Cyril Pritchett , was a lieutenant colonel in the Army .
Two of the team of 12 live abroad and could not make the reunion dinner at Caius .
One , David Fowler , had died and was represented by his widow Denise .
The reunited pranksters said their only regret was that the car was not left in place for ever .
Most clips tend to run a few minutes or less  but not all .
In a series of videos running a total of more than five hours , an Australian veteran of the Vietnam War demonstrates in minute detail how to build a replica of a working Sherman tank at two - fifths its original scale .
Plenty of entrepreneurs and financiers are hoping that the wave Mr. Kedersha has begun to ride is a long way from cresting .
In the last two years , investors have put tens of millions of dollars into start - up companies with names like WonderHowTo.com , VideoJug , Howcast , ExpertVillage and Graspr , which are all hoping to become the YouTube of how - to video clips .
Of course , a good share of these videos are on YouTube itself .
And traditional media companies like Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and Scripps Network are putting much of their own how - to content online .
These start - ups have attracted former television executives and veterans of Internet giants like Google , Yahoo and MySpace .
Most of them readily admit that , as with many Internet fads , profits remain elusive for now .
Scores of independent video producers , experts and self - styled experts are , meanwhile , vying to make a name for themselves in hopes of sharing in the expected profits .
Plenty of others are making how - to clips just for fun or for a few minutes of Internet fame .
For Meghan Carter , 23 , how - to videos offer the chance to turn her love of home decorating into a career .
Early last year , she began driving around the country to conduct on - camera interviews with experts on subjects ranging from concrete countertops to green homes .
Gradually , she grew more comfortable in front of the camera and began taking on the role of expert herself .
In April , she began posting her “ girl next door meets Martha Stewart ” videos on YouTube under the name AskTheDecorator , and the clicks started coming .
Her 87 tutorials include how to make a bow ( 81,000 views ) and how to fold towels so they look just so ( 43,000 views ) .

One video is a how - to on recycling soda bottles .
“ That one really surprised me , ” Ms. Carter said of the towel folding video .
“ We were playing with new cameras and did it for fun .
Out of nowhere , it skyrocketed in popularity . ”
A hybrid blimp rotorcraft or " helicraft " is not a new concept at all , and , in fact , there have been many dead - end endeavors , like the Piasecki Heli - Stat in the 1980s .
The timing might be just right , though , for the JHL - 40 , considering rising fuel costs and numerous eco-friendly initiatives .
Boeing , in charge of development and building , and SkyHook , in charge of maintenance , operations and servicing , anticipate having the airship commercially ready by 2012 .
There ’s a great deal of debate going on this morning about whether Apple will be able to sell 10 million iPhone units in 2008 .
The New York Times has grossly speculative article that says that it wo n’t , and Macworld has a grossly speculative article that says it will … both of these articles seem to be missing the point of what Jobs said at the 2007 Macworld Keynote that introduced us to the iPhone .
Before we even get into whether Apple will or will not ship 10 million iPhones in 2008 , I think its important to clarify exactly what 10 million units is supposed to mean …and if Apple even intends to sell 10 million units in 2008 .
It means 1 % of the global cell phone market .
Jobs made that clear in his keynote , and it was reiterated by Apple on their last quarter conference call .
Apple also clarified that they mean in the 2008 calendar year .
For those of you keeping score , thus far , in the first 3 months of 2008 Apple has sold 1.7 million iPhones .
That number , as the New York Times article points out , is pretty darn low for Apple to hope to hit 10 million units by the end of the year .
That article claims that iPhone sales have “ settled down ” – which , according to the Macworld article is completely untrue .
This “ settled down ” claim is where the NYT articles kind of falls apart , due mainly to the fact that it projects an overly negative view of iPhone sales , never acknowledging that the first few month of the year are traditionally the lowest sales wise – and completely ignoring the sales of the iPhone for the previous quarter .
The Macworld article falls apart when they try to claim that iPhone sales are going to have an 18 % up swing in the second three months of 2008 .
That ’s overly optimistic , especially with all the buzz about a new iPhone coming so soon .
It ’s possible , I suppose , but you ’re not going to prove a point by giving a company an almost 20 % sales boost with no reasoning behind it other than that you ’re “ being conservative ” .
If there is a reason behind it , tell the whole class , so we can all understand your line of thinking .
Beyond article criticizing , though , there is a bigger issue here .
Everyone is looking at what Jobs said incorrectly .
Let ’s talk about what Steve Jobs actually said at the Macworld 2007 keynote , and what Apple ’s actual number are thus far .
At Macworld 2007 , Steve Jobs stated “ 1 % market share equals 10 million units .
This is a giant market .
If you have just 1 % market share , you ’re gonna sell 10 million phones , and this is exact what we ’re going to try to do in 2008 .
Our first full year in the market .
Is grab 1 % market share and go from there . ” ( source )
Let me translate : Apple ’s goal is to have 1 % market share by the end of their first full year in the market .
That translates to 10 million units sold … and they ’re over half way there .
Now you can argue that “ Jobs said 10 million units in 2008 ” if you want .
I ’m sure many people will – but read his direct quote – watch the video if you need to .
It ’s very clear , the man is saying 1 % market share after their first full year in the market .
In January 2008 , at Macworld , Steve Jobs announced that they had sold 4 Million iPhones . ( source ) .
When you add 4 million to the iPhone sales for the first three months of 2008 , you ’re looking at 5.7 million units sold .
That puts Apple over half way to their goal , with 9 months left to sell the remaining 4.3 million units .
Without doctoring numbers , or making wild speculation I think its safe to say that Apple is well on their way to the goal of 1 % market share by the end of 2008 , and with the addition of so many new countries , and the 3G technology which will certainly boost sales over seas , it seems inevitable that Steve Jobs will hit the Macworld stage in 2009 , reporting that Apple has met its initial goals with the iPhone … most likely exceeded them .
HOW come John McCain is having a fund - raiser at billionaire Ron Perelman ‘s Creeks estate in East Hampton on July 19 , even though Perelman backs Barack Obama ?
Turns out Perelman is lending the Republican presidential nominee his home to fulfill the wishes of the Revlon mogul ’s closest business ad viser and friend of 40 years , McCain backer Howard Gittis , who died last September .
Gittis promised McCain he would hold an event in the Hamptons for the Arizona senator if he won the GOP nomination , but did n’t live to honor the commitment .
Perelman ’s name is not even on the fund - raising invitation .
The event is co-hosted by Barry Schwartz , a vice chairman of Perelman ’s holding company MacAndrews & Forbes , and real estate mogul William Mack .
Perelman earlier supported Hillary Clinton and held a fund - raiser for her last summer .
“ Ronald remains a strong Democrat , ” Perelman ’s rep , Christine Taylor , told The Post ’s Carl Campanile .
“ He ’s supporting Senator Obama .
If Senator Obama would like us to hold a fund - raiser , we ’d be more than happy to . ”
IBM researchers have achieved a breakthrough in photovoltaics technology that could significantly reduce the cost of harnessing the Sun 's power for electricity .
IBM today announced a research breakthrough in photovoltaics technology that could significantly reduce the cost of harnessing the Sun 's power for electricity .
By mimicking the antics of a child using a magnifying glass to burn a leaf or a camper to start a fire , IBM scientists are using a large lens to concentrate the Sun ’s power , capturing a record 230 watts onto a centimeter square solar cell , in a technology known as concentrator photovoltaics , or CPV .
That energy is then converted into 70 watts of usable electrical power , about five times the electrical power density generated by typical cells using CPV technology in solar farms .
If it can overcome additional challenges to move this project from the lab to the fab , IBM believes it can significantly reduce the cost of a typical CPV based system .
By using a much lower number of photovoltaic cells in a solar farm and concentrating more light onto each cell using larger lenses , IBM ’s system enables a significant cost advantage in terms of a lesser number of total components .
For instance , by moving from a 200 sun system ( " one sun " is a measurement equal to the solar power incident at noon on a clear summer day ) , where about 20 watts per square centimeter of power is concentrated onto the cell , to the IBM Lab results of a 2300 sun system , where approximately 230 watts per square centimeter are concentrated onto the cell system , the IBM system cuts the number of photovoltaic cells and other components by a factor of 10 .
“ We believe IBM can bring unique skills from our vast experience in semiconductors and nanotechnology to the important field of alternative energy research , ” said Dr. Supratik Guha , the scientist leading photovoltaics activities at IBM Research .
“ This is one of many exploratory research projects incubating in our labs where we can drive big change for an entire industry while advancing the basic underlying science of solar cell technology . "
The trick lies in IBM ’s ability to cool the tiny solar cell .
Concentrating the equivalent of 2000 suns on such a small area generates enough heat to melt stainless steel , something the researchers experienced first hand in their experiments .
But by borrowing innovations from its own R&D in cooling computer chips , the team was able to cool the solar cell from greater than 1600 degrees Celsius to just 85 degrees Celsius .
The initial results of this project will be presented at the 33rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists conference today , where the IBM researchers will detail how their liquid metal cooling interface is able to transfer heat from the solar cell to a copper cooling plate much more efficiently than anything else available today .
The IBM research team developed a system that achieved breakthrough results by coupling a commercial solar cell to an advanced IBM liquid metal thermal cooling system using methods developed for the microprocessor industry .
Specifically , the IBM team used a very thin layer of a liquid metal made of a gallium and indium compound that they applied between the chip and a cooling block .
Such layers , called thermal interface layers , transfer the heat from the chip to the cooling block so that the chip temperature can be kept low .
The IBM liquid metal solution offers the best thermal performance available today , at low costs , and the technology was successfully developed by IBM to cool high power computer chips earlier .
While concentrator - based photovoltaics technologies have been around since the 1970s , they have received renewed interest in recent times .
With very high concentrations , they have the potential to offer the lowest - cost solar electricity for large - scale power generation , provided the temperature of the cells can be kept low , and cheap and efficient optics can be developed for concentrating the light to very high levels .
IBM is exploring four main areas of photovoltaic research : using current technologies to develop cheaper and more efficient silicon solar cells , developing new solution processed thin film photovoltaic devices , concentrator photovoltaics , and future generation photovoltaic architectures based upon nanostructures such as semiconductor quantum dots and nanowires .
The goal of the projects is to develop efficient photovoltaic structures that would reduce the cost , minimize the complexity , and improve the flexibility of producing solar electric power .
In addition to the photovoltaic research announced today , IBM is focused on several areas related to energy and the environment , including energy efficient technology and services , carbon management , advanced water management , intelligent utility networks and intelligent transportation systems .
With decades of leadership in environmental stewardship , proven ability to solve complex challenges and unparalleled global reach , IBM is uniquely positioned to increase the efficiency of today ’s systems and enable our clients ’ “ green ” strategies .

Every now and again our learned scholars in the liberal university come up with a study , financed by taxpayers ' money , that concludes what every liberal already knows .
Conservatives are rigid and not very intelligent .
In fact , as
one study
by two Berkeley professors claimed , the the " whiny , insecure kid in nursery school " probably grew up to be a conservative .
Of course two can play at that game , and so conservative Peter Schweizer took a look at the University of Chicago 's General Social Survey and a few other generally available opinion surveys and came to the opposite conclusion in his book Makers and Takers .
He found that conservatives are the good guys and liberals are the whiners .
Maybe he got different results because the General Social Survey covers the whole United States while the Berkeley professors only studied a single school in Berkeley , California .
Either way , Schweizer 's findings make sense .
Liberals are more materialistic than conservatives , he finds .
Of course they are .
Believing in equality , differences in material things are very important to them .
Not surprisingly , when they discover material differences in society , liberals are offended .
There is a word for this feeling of offence : Envy .
And so it is that liberals are more envious than conservatives .
Liberals celebrate anger .
No , we are not just talking about Bush Derangement Syndrome .
" Since the sixties , modern liberals have embraced anger as a sign of genuine commitment to the cause , " writes Schweizer and their political rage leaks into their personal lives .
The General Social Survey shows that liberals are more angry than conservatives and " three times more likely ( 17 percent to 6 percent ) to have actually done something to get back at someone who had hurt or offended them in the past month . "
Liberals are stingy with their money .
Again , this is hardly surprising .
Liberal political philosophy says : People Have Needs , and the government should provide .
Thus liberals , when they actually spend money on anyone other than themselves , give money to the activist organizations that advocate for bigger government .
Conservatives , on the other hand , give money to organizations that actually help people .
Schweizer shows us that the headline liberals of recent memory - the Clintons , Gores , Kerrys , and Obamas - do n't give much .
But headline conservatives like Bush , Cheney , and Limbaugh do give , and give generously .
But then they would .
Conservatives believe that people should help people , and governments should stick to the stuff that governments do best , defending society against enemies , foreign and domestic .
Liberals are less honest than conservatives .
Peter Schweizer compares liberals and conservatives using the World Values Survey and the National Cultural Values Survey .
Liberals admit that they do n't value honesty as much as conservatives .
They are more willing to sell " Aunt Betty a car with a bum transmission " than conservatives , and " twice as likely as conservatives to say it is okay to get welfare benefits they were not entitled to . "
Schweizer 's poster boy for welfare cheat is billionaire George Soros , who once " tried to get a Jewish charity to give him money while also receiving public assistance . "
Did you know that liberals are not just angrier but whinier than conservatives ?
Peter Schweizer samples liberal Whine Country using the Clintons , Bill and Hillary , as representative varietals .
But at least liberals are smarter than conservatives .
Everyone knows that Calvin Coolidge was " weaned on a pickle , " that Ike fumbled his syntax , that Reagan was an amiable dunce , and that President Bush is too dumb to be president .
But navy veteran Sam Sewell found one liberal dumber than President Bush .
Browsing presidential candidate John Kerry 's website he happened upon the results of " an IQ - like qualifying test Kerry had taken in 1966 . "
It showed that Kerry belonged in the 91st percentile on intelligence , a bit lower than President Bush in the 95th percentile .
Conservatives also rank better on political knowledge , according to Schweizer .
Here 's the result of a political knowledge test conducted in 2000 .
A high score is good .
Strong Republican 18.7
Independent - Republican 15.7
Strong Democrat 15.4
Independent - Democrat 14.2
Weak Republican 14.1
Weak Democrat 13.3
Independent 9.5
All this may be true , you will say .
But how mean - spirited must Peter Schweizer be to drone on for 200 pages about " why conservatives work harder , feel happier , have closer families , take fewer drugs , give more generously , value honesty more , are less materialistic and envious , whine less ... and even hug their children more than liberals ? "
Conservatives had better hug their children more .
They have more children to to hug than liberals .
Forty - one percent more , to be exact .
US bank losses intensify recession fears
By Patrick Martin
15 January 2008
Two more major banks reported heavy mortgage and consumer - loan losses Monday for the fourth quarter of 2007 , reinforcing fears that that US financial crisis will likely trigger a recession , not only in America , but worldwide .
M&T Bank , based in Buffalo , New York , reported a 70 percent decline in earnings for the fourth quarter , largely due to losses on Collateralized Debt Obligations , the financial instrument widely used to transform home mortgages into tradeable securities .
Sovereign Bancorp of Philadelphia said it would take a $ 1.6 billion write - off for the fourth quarter , much of it related to mortgage lending .
However , $ 600 million of the loss was due to defaults on consumer loans , an indication that the financial crisis is spreading .
Sovereign said it had stopped issuing auto loans in seven of the 15 states in which it does business —
Nevada , Utah , Arizona , Florida , Georgia and North and South Carolina .
Also on Monday , CNBC reported that the biggest US bank , Citigroup , will announce a colossal write - off of as much as $ 24 billion and the elimination of as many as 24,000 jobs .
The bank is to report its fourth - quarter earnings Tuesday , and is also expected to announce a cut in its dividend .
Citigroup has been scouring the Middle East and Asia for investors in a position to take multi-billion - dollar stakes .
Among those said to be involved is Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia .
The bank is seeking to raise as much as $ 15 billion in new capital .
On Monday , the state - owned China Development bank decided not to go ahead with a proposed investment of $ 2 billion in the company , forcing Citigroup to seek other benefactors .
The Financial Times reported Monday that Merrill Lynch , the largest US stockbroker , is seeking to raise an additional $ 4 billion in new capital , with the Kuwait Investment Authority as the leading candidate .
Merrill Lynch is expected to write off as much as $ 14 billion in losses and lay off up to 1,000 workers .
The spectacle of giant US financial institutions going hat in hand to the oil sheiks and the government investment agencies of China , Taiwan and Singapore is one indicator of the deteriorating world position of American capitalism .
Another is the continued fall in the dollar , both against the currencies of rival capitalist powers , and against gold and other precious metals .
Gold topped the $ 900 an ounce mark Monday in London trading , at one point hitting $ 914 , an all time record .
Platinum set a new record of $ 1,587 an ounce , while silver hit $ 16.58 an ounce , the highest figure in 27 years .
The dollar dropped to a record low of 1.0912 Swiss francs , while also hitting seven - week lows against the euro and the yen .
At $ 1.4890 to the euro , the dollar is near to breaking the 1.50 barrier .
That is widely regarded as a psychological milestone which could produce a much wider sell - off of dollars as countries currently accumulating dollars — especially the oil states and Asian exporters — seek to shift their surpluses to euros , yen or a basket of currencies more likely to retain their value .
The latest dollar plunge was said to be in response to comments last week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke , in which he pledged “ substantive additional action ” to prop up the US economy , a statement widely viewed as a pledge to continue cutting US interest rates by at least a half percentage point this month .
Further cuts in US interest rates , carried out at the behest of Wall Street to stave off a collapse of confidence in the financial system , ultimately make the crisis even worse , since reducing the rate of return impels foreign investors to dump their dollar - denominated assets and shift their holdings into other , more lucrative , investments .
Exerting continuous pressure on the value of the dollar is the gargantuan US trade deficit , which hit its highest monthly total in 14 months last November , according to figures released by the US Commerce Department January 11 .
The trade deficit shot up 9.3 percent to $ 63.1 billion , much more than expected , driven by a 16.3 percent rise in the cost of imported oil .
Oil imports hit $ 34.4 billion , accounting for more than half the net deficit .
Retail sales figures from December , to be announced publicly on Tuesday , are expected to show the combined impact on consumer spending of higher gasoline and home heating costs and plunging home values .
An actual decline in retail sales in December , compared to the same month the year before , would be the first such negative reading since June .
Sales reports from individual retailers already suggest the dimensions of the downturn in consumer spending , with Macy ’s reporting a 7.9 percent decline in same - store sales in December 2007 , compared to December 2006 .
Kohl ’s reported an 11 percent drop and Nordstrom a 4 percent drop .
The broad decline is an indication that upscale as well as middle - income consumers are cutting back .
Other figures detailed the expanding dimensions of the home mortgage crisis , which is becoming a more generalized crisis of consumer credit :
* A Mortgage Bankers Association survey found that a record 18.81 percent of the nearly 3 million sub - prime adjustable - rate loans issued by its members were already past due .
* Freddie Mac , the big mortgage finance company , found that homeowners refinancing their mortgages were able to extract $ 20 billion less in the third quarter than the second .
The $ 60 billion in home equity extracted was the lowest since the first quarter of 2005 , and indicates that far less such cash will be available for consumer spending .
* The American Bankers Association found that delinquency rates for home equity lines of credit had climbed to their highest level in 10 years at the end of September .
* The Federal Reserve Board reported last week that total outstanding credit card debt rose at an 11.3 percent annual rate in November 2007 .
For the year , credit card debt is up 7.4 percent to $ 937.5 billion , compared to increases of from 2 to 4 percent between 2003 and 2005 .
The growing indebtedness of consumers , combined with the falloff of spending , demonstrates that millions of households , working class and middle class , are going further into debt just to finance their day - to - day expenses .
Any new expenses can lead to major financial difficulties .
In the face of these figures , the sudden flurry of proposals by the political representatives of big business — the Bush administration , Congress , and the Democratic and Republican candidates — resemble nothing so much as the reorganization of the deck chairs on the Titanic .
White House officials told the press last week that Bush would propose a stimulus package for the US economy in his State of the Union speech scheduled for January 28 , although no details had been worked out yet .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said January 11 that the US economy had slowed “ rather materially ” and that “ time is of the essence ” in initiating any stimulus package .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , the two leading congressional Democrats , sent a joint letter to Bush Friday saying , “ We want to work with you . ”
The letter received a favorable White House response , and Pelosi met with Fed chief Bernanke Monday to discuss what concrete actions could be taken .
Some combination of tax cuts for business , tax rebates for the working poor and a limited extension of unemployment benefits or home heating assistance is the likely outcome of such discussions , with a total amount estimated at $ 50 to $ 100 billion .
Even these proposals are problematic , however , since congressional Republicans could block such measures , particularly those targeted to lower - income families .
The presidential candidates have chimed in , with the Republican candidates proposing more tax cuts for business and the wealthy — which would do nothing to alleviate the spreading economic distress among working people — and the Democrats offering stimulus packages that would amount to little more than band - aids .
Hillary Clinton ’s plan , released Friday , calls for $ 70 billion in stimulus , including relief for homeowners facing foreclosure and an extension of unemployment benefits .
Barack Obama slightly outbid her , offering a $ 75 billion plan , but with more targeted to business interests in the form of tax incentives .
None of these plans amount to more than a drop in the bucket compared to the vast dimensions of the social and economic crisis in the United States .
By one estimate , the $ 30 - a - barrel increase in oil prices over the past five months has by itself cost US consumers $ 150 billion — double the amount of “ stimulus ” proposed by the Clinton and Obama plans .
It goes without saying that no big business politician is proposing that the oil companies disgorge any of their massive profits .
On the contrary , the energy bill adopted by the Democratic Congress last month retains $ 12 billion in federal subsidies to the oil giants .
More fundamentally , a minor boost to consumer spending will do nothing to offset the spreading financial contagion or restabilize debt markets .
The bursting of the housing bubble is only the initial stage of a financial crisis of unprecedented dimensions , one that will call into question the viability of the capitalist system worldwide .
Martial Arts and Autism ( and not autism )
If you enjoy this post , make sure you subscribe to Be A Good Dad to receive new posts in your email or feed reader
We are considering signing the kids up for a martial arts class .
A local place came to Geetle ’s school ’s Family Night one time and taught a little one night class which the kids loved .
They also have a try us free for a month before actually signing up offer that we are doing right now .
Thursday was the first class .
Pookie had a lot of trouble .
The class has about 25 people from ages about 4 to 50 .
Besides being in a new environment , the noise and all of the activity clearly made it hard for Pookie to participate .
He was constantly wandering around the mat and very infrequently actually doing what he was supposed to be doing .
Geetle on the other hand was standing on her dot and attempting everything very well .
No matter what we end up deciding for Pookie ( more on that in a second ) , I think there is a good chance we will sign Geetle up .
It is a good work out , it teaches listening to directions , it develops a need for practicing in order to learn the skills so you can advance to the next belt .
Plus , it never hurts for people to know some basic self defense .
And more importantly , she had a blast .
Back to Pookie .
The teachers do a very good job of keeping parents off the mat .
Everybody in the class knows that you listen to Master Kim and only Master Kim or the assistants that help with the class .
This is extremely important for a physical class with kids .
I ’ve never been to a kids class or sport where the parents actually just sat there and watched instead of constantly telling their kids to pay attention to the teacher or stop wandering off over there .
All of that is a good environment for Pookie .
Unfortunately , it is also a place that very quickly overloads Pookie ’s senses .
Plus , he does n’t know what he is supposed to be doing .
And then there is the issue of actually teaching his body how to do the movements .
Remember Wii bowling ?
We had to actually teach him by physically forcing his body through the motions .
I think that if we could spend a few weeks actually physically forcing his body through the motions during the class there is a very good chance he would pick up the concepts and have a much greater chance of being able to not become overwhelmed during the class which would help him be able to remember to stay in his spot .
The instructors do n’t seem to understand that Pookie is not a typical 5 year old boy that likes to wander .
Even though we have explained the autism and sensory stuff , I do n’t think they understand that just asking him to get back on his spot and then verbally explaining the moves will not be enough .
But they have really only seen him one time .
I ’m going to ask them if they are able to provide that kind of interaction for a while while Pookie learns or if I can join Pookie on the mat to help him along .
Up until yesterday , I was pretty much planning on not signing Pookie up for anything long term just because I did n’t think he would be able to figure it out before he got frustrated and gave up .
After all , he could n’t even handle Wii bowling .
Yesterday , however , I watched him bowl an entire game of Wii bowling entirely by himself .
There are still moments where we have to remind him to stand on his spot , etc .
But we no longer have to touch his hand or elbow or even be near him at all .
I think that if we can provide the same sort of assistance in his martial arts class , he can get to the same level of competence .
And I know that if we can get to that he will have learned the main things that we are hoping to get out of the classes .
Being able to stay in one spot .
Being able to follow a teacher ’s directions .
We got a nice helping of slides dropped on our virtual doorstep this evening , fleshing out Dell 's upcoming netbook -- which they seem to be calling the " Dell E . "
Um , Eeenteresting name choice , but that does n't seem set in stone , and there 's plenty else going on here to ponder over .
Dell 's breaking the Dell E into two device types , a 8.9 - inch model clearly meant to take on the Eee 900 , and the 12.1 - inch " E Slim " which actually looks positioned to take on the MacBook Air and X300 , at a mere 0.8 - inches thick , though perhaps in a lower - end capacity .
Even the 8.9 - inch model will have some distinctions , with E Classic model for super low - end use , and E Video and E Video + for more RAM , larger flash storage , webcams and Bluetooth in the + model .
Rollout looks to be slated for August for the E , August / September -ish for the E Slim , and a followup for both of those in October of WWAN , with WiMAX after that .
Dell even has a second version of both devices slated for Q2 2009 , but that 's all we know about those so far .
Perhaps most interesting is that all of these run Linux and Windows XP , and while it 's not clear if there 's a full - featured Linux OS onboard , there does seem to be an instant - on , Foleo -esque Linux included on all of them called BlackTop .
We 're not sure if there 's any relation to Splashtop , but the janky - ass interface and email / calendar / contacts apps seem to be telling us no .
BlackTop will support WWAN and WiFi , and Dell plans to move the 2.0 version to the Latitude and Vostro lines in a year or two .
Peep the slides below for all the gory details .
Oh , and the price ?
Dell E starts at $ 299 .

The UK government has announced a set of guidelines to be applied to the Computer Misuse Act ( part of the Police and Justice Act 2006 ) which will , if enforced , make it illegal to possess or distribute “ hacking tools .
” The ban comes along with an increase in the maximum prison sentence available for computer - related offences to ten years and also a re-wording which makes denial of service attacks clearly illegal .
Many in the IT industry are grumbling about the ban , which would cover network tools such as Nmap and Wireshark if misused .
The government has so far failed to allay these fears , stating only that the authors of such tools will only be chased if “ ” - no mention of what happens if a dual - use security tool isused in such a way .
The guidelines , published by the Crown Prosecution Service , do contain a get - out clause for commercial software : prosecutors are asked to take into account whether the software is “ ” , which sadly leaves open - source and freeware tools out in the cold .
It 's security researchers who have the most to fear from this draconian modification to an already pretty tough law , as many of the tools used in such research would be covered under the ban .
Penetration testing – hacking into a company network with permission in order to detect security holes – is a growing business , and it's the practitioners of this lucrative art who stand to lose the most should distribution of useful network utilities be stopped .
The amendments to the Computer Misuse Act are expected to come into force some time around April of this year .
Any sysadmins out there livid at the thought of losing their network toolkit in a single hit , or are you all breathing a sigh of relief at your friendly government doing its bit to protect you ?

Two weeks ago , an NBC / WSJ poll found an interesting trend in American public opinion : after hearing about Jeremiah Wright ’s controversial sermons in a constant loop for months , voters were more concerned with John McCain ’s association with Bush than Obama ’s association with his former pastor .
( Specifically , 43 % of respondents were worried about McCain and Bush ; 32 % about Obama and Wright . )
Today , a new Gallup poll points to a similar public sentiment .
George W. Bush may do as much damage to John McCain ’s chances of being elected as Jeremiah Wright does to Barack Obama ’s , according to results of a recent USA Today / Gallup poll .
The May 1 - 3 poll finds 38 % of likely voters saying McCain ’s association with Bush makes them less likely to vote for McCain , while 33 % say Obama ’s association with Wright diminishes their likelihood of voting for Obama .
A strong majority of Americans ( 64 % ) , including a near majority of Republicans ( 47 % ) said the Wright issue will not have any effect on their vote .
I ’m a little torn as to whether this is good news for the likely Democratic nominee or not .
On the one hand , I ’m delighted Americans are more concerned about McCain and Bush than Obama and Wright .
That ’s how it should be .
On the other hand , should n’t the margin be considerably more dramatic than 38%-33 % ?
On the prior , Bush has become a political pariah .
I ’m occasionally attempted to describe him as “ divisive , ” but that ’s clearly wrong — “ divisive ” would imply that critics and supporters are relatively even in numbers .
They ’re not ; Americans have made up their minds about Bush and they really do n’t like him .
In this sense , it ’s hardly surprising that voters are concerned about McCain ’s ties to a wildly unpopular president .
But on the prior , Wright should n’t be anywhere near as controversial .
That Wright is even close suggests the media ’s efforts to make him a scandalous national personality and key campaign figure have been largely successful .
For what it ’s worth , I ’m inclined to look at the glass as half - full on this one .
After several weeks of bombardment about Wright , during which time very little attention was paid to McCain ’s connection to Bush , I would n’t have been surprised if the public had gone the other way and expressed more concern with Obama for his ties to his former pastor .
We now have two recent national polls showing this is n’t the case .
The Wright issue , as far as I can tell , is the most serious weight on Obama ’s shoulders , but it ’s likely to fade a bit as the campaign shifts into general election mode , in part because the story has run its course .
There ’s just not much more to say — we ’ve seen the clips , we ’ve heard the sermons , and we know Obama ’s response .
In contrast , Americans have barely heard a word about the similarities and connections between McCain and Bush , which leads me to think 38 % is just a starting point , whereas 33 % is the ceiling for the Wright number .
Girl - next - door Jessica Simpson drops a blonde bombshell with her ' porn - star dress '
To some of her fans , she is a fashion icon and style personified .
But we suspect even her most ardent followers wo n't be copying Jessica Simpson 's porn star look .
Jessica Simpson or Jaymes ?
The singer arrived at a Lake Tahoe concert showcasing a curious choice of dress
Stepping out for a concert in Lake Tahoe , the 28 - year - old seemed to have left her fashion sense in the Hollywood Hills .
Wearing a cleavage revealing coral - pink , leather - studded dress , it would be fair to say she made a definite sartorial faux pas .
To make matters worse , her toenails were painted in clashing silver .
And perhaps the singer realised her mistake once she was in public .
Down in the mouth :
The usually sunny singer appeared forlorn as she walked with boyfriend Tony Romo
Usually sunny and smiling , she looked distinctly forlorn as she walked alongside boyfriend Tony Romo .
However , poor Jessica has been working hard recently and could be forgiven for her style error considering her packed schedule .
On June 26 she wrote in her blog : ' These past few days I 've been in 4 states , on 8 flights , and in 4 time zones promoting my single " Come On Over " , and I 've had such a great time . '
Perhaps all the graft is taking its toll and affecting her judgement .

Another month of mumbling about comprehensive immigration reform and how “ pristine ” ANWR is , and who knows ?
He might make it down to single digits .
The data ’s not all bad .
His small lead from two months ago is gone but that ’s mostly due to Hillary Democrats coming home .
He does amazingly well with independents throughout , beating Obama among that group on Iraq , terrorism , the economy ( ! ) , and illegal immigration ( !! ) .
He trails only on health care , and only there by four points .
Which is to say , he ’ll hold his own in the center ; his problem is that as of right now only 10 % of Dems are McCainocrats while 11 % of Repubs are Obamicans ( in a two - man race ) , and that includes 17 % of Hillary supporters who still say they ’re voting for McCain even though most of them probably wo n’t .
He needs to improve on that , as he already leads by eight among indies ( again , in a two - man race ) which surely must be near his ceiling .
The fine , fine line for Maverick is thus the same here as it ’s been all along :
How does he hold the GOP base while pandering just enough to the left to pull some of those centrist Democrats over ?
Maybe by talking about … comprehensive immigration reform and how “ pristine ” ANWR is ?
Big advantages among independents here , too , and I ’m guessing they ’re related :
It ’s hard to imagine those numbers tilting much further in his favor but easy to imagine them tilting back towards equilibrium , especially with St. Barack ready to burn a few hundred mil on ads like that one today .
One more piece of data for you , this time from Rasmussen .
Exit question :
How likely is it really that Obama ’s going to pile up the popular vote but lose a squeaker in the electoral college ?
Read this piece from TNR before you answer , as it argues that the circumstances of that scenario — racking up huge blue state wins and just enough narrow red state losses — are very hard to imagine if the “ nationalization ” of voter preferences from the 2004 election holds true this time .
I ’m not so sure they will given Obama ’s ability to draw out certain southern demographics this time in greater numbers than Kerry could ( namely , blacks and evangelicals ) coupled with McCain ’s inability to draw out the southern base .

Blair is expected on Thursday to join U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc < JPM.N > as a senior adviser , according to a person familiar with the situation .
REUTERS / Chip East
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former British prime minister Tony Blair is expected on Thursday to join U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc as a senior adviser , according to a person familiar with the situation .
JPMorgan declined to comment .
The Financial Times in London first reported the move on its Web site , saying it would be the first of a series positions Blair expects to take in the private sector .
Blair , a key ally of U.S. President George W. Bush , was replaced last year by Gordon Brown as prime minister amid growing discontent over Great Britain ’s policy in Iraq .
Details of Blair ’s duties with JPMorgan , the third largest U.S. bank , were not immediately available .
Blair ’s predecessor , John Major , joined a U.S. finance company after leaving 10 Downing Street .
After leaving office , Major joined U.S. private equity firm The Carlyle Group in 1998 amid that company ’s big push into the European market .

Today at the Apostolic Church of God , Barack Obama spoke about fatherhood .
“ But if we are honest with ourselves , we ’ll admit that what too many fathers also are is missing – missing from too many lives and too many homes .
They have abandoned their responsibilities , acting like boys instead of men .
And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it , ” Obama said .
Obama continued , “ Yes , we need more cops on the street .
Yes , we need fewer guns in the hands of people who should n’t have them .
Yes , we need more money for our schools , and more outstanding teachers in the classroom , and more afterschool programs for our children .
Yes , we need more jobs and more job training and more opportunity in our communities .
But we also need families to raise our children .
We need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception .
We need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child – it ’s the courage to raise one . ”
He talked about himself as a father , “ I say this knowing that I have been an imperfect father – knowing that I have made mistakes and will continue to make more ; wishing that I could be home for my girls and my wife more than I am right now .
I say this knowing all of these things because even as we are imperfect , even as we face difficult circumstances , there are still certain lessons we must strive to live and learn as fathers – whether we are black or white ; rich or poor ; from the South Side or the wealthiest suburb . ”

The first lesson he talked about was setting an example of excellence , “ It ’s great if you have a job ; it ’s even better if you have a college degree .
It ’s a wonderful thing if you are married and living in a home with your children , but do n’t just sit in the house and watch “ SportsCenter ” all weekend long …
As fathers and parents , we ’ve got to spend more time with them , and help them with their homework , and replace the video game or the remote control with a book once in awhile .
That ’s how we build that foundation . ”
The second lesson was passing along the value of empathy , “ Not sympathy , but empathy – the ability to stand in somebody else ’s shoes ; to look at the world through their eyes .
Sometimes it ’s so easy to get caught up in “ us , ” that we forget about our obligations to one another …
We need to show our kids that you ’re not strong by putting other people down – you ’re strong by lifting them up .
That ’s our responsibility as fathers . ”
The third lesson was hope .
I ’m not talking about an idle hope that ’s little more than blind optimism or willful ignorance of the problems we face .
I ’m talking about hope as that spirit inside us that insists , despite all evidence to the contrary , that something better is waiting for us if we ’re willing to work for it and fight for it .
If we are willing to believe . ”
All politicians talk about families and values , but there is an authenticity in Barack Obama that makes him different from the rest .
Hillary Clinton could n’t match it , and John McCain does n’t even come close .
I could never see McCain giving a speech like this one .
The one thing that his opponents have not been able solve this year when it comes to Obama is that there is a quality of realness to him .
While the change campaign is a tried and true tactic as old as the hills , the difference is that Obama seems to really believe in it .
When Obama spoke about fatherhood , I got the sense that this was n’t just another politician preaching to us , but instead , here was a man trying to tell us what he thinks it takes to be a good Dad .
This is why Obama is special , and why he will probably be the next president of the United States .
You can read Obama ’s full speech right here .
Machine to clean up greenhouse gas is breakthrough in war on global warming , say scientists
Scientists say they have invented a machine that can suck carbon dioxide out of the air – potentially creating a vital weapon in the war against global warming .
The blueprint for the CO2 ' scrubber ' raises the prospect of a generation of machines which would help reduce the billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere by the use of fossil fuels .
The team of US scientists now plans to build a prototype which would capture one tonne of CO2 from the air every day .
Holy grail ?
How one of the CO2 - scrubbing machines would look
Though the idea is considered a holy grail in the battle against climate change – and Sir Richard Branson has put up £ 12.6 million for anyone who makes it a reality – the machines would fall far short of a quick fix .
The prototype , being built at a laboratory in Tucson , Arizona , by a company called Global Research Technologies , will cost about £ 100,000 and take about two years to construct .
The devices – each nearly the size of a shipping container - would have to be produced in their millions to soak up human carbon emissions .
Inventor : US physicist Klaus Lackner says his machine offers more hope than attempts to cut down carbon emissions
The idea is bound to be controversial , with environmentalists seeing so - called technological solutions to global warming as undermining attempts to promote greener lifestyles and industries .
But physicist Klaus Lackner , who led the U.S. team behind the invention , said the CO2 scrubber offered more hope than current efforts to cut carbon emissions by reducing fossil fuel use .
' I 'd rather have a technology that allows us to use fossil fuels without destroying the planet , because people are going to use them anyway , ' he said .
Scientists say it is not difficult to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by absorbing it in various chemical filters .
But the problem has been how to clean those filters of CO2 so they can then be reused to carry on the job .
Professor Lackner , of New York 's Columbia University , says the solution lies in a newly discovered property of absorbent plastic sheets known as ' ion exchange membranes ' which are routinely used to purify water .
It turns out that humid air can make these membranes ' exhale ' the CO2 they have trapped – leaving them clean and ready to absorb another load .
The Lackner team says the captured carbon dioxide could then be pumped into greenhouses to boost plant growth .

One thing that would make the cultural transition to cleaner fuels easier would be gasoline that works with current engine technology .
Reporting in Chemistry & Sustainability , Energy & Materials , a group of researchers have made a breakthrough in the development of this " green gasoline " - a liquid identical to standard gasoline yet created from sustainable biomass sources like switchgrass and poplar trees .
It may be five to 10 years before green gasoline arrives at the pump or finds its way into a fighter jet but the breakthrough by George Huber of the University of Massachusetts - Amherst ( UMass ) and graduate students Torren Carlson and Tushar Vispute of the first direct conversion of plant cellulose into gasoline components is a big step .
" It is likely that the future consumer will not even know that they are putting biofuels into their car , " said Huber .
" Biofuels in the future will most likely be similar in chemical composition to gasoline and diesel fuel used today .
The challenge for chemical engineers is to efficiently produce liquid fuels from biomass while fitting into the existing infrastructure today . "
For their new approach , the UMass researchers rapidly heated cellulose in the presence of solid catalysts , materials that speed up reactions without sacrificing themselves in the process .
They then rapidly cooled the products to create a liquid that contains many of the compounds found in gasoline .
The entire process was completed in under two minutes using relatively moderate amounts of heat .
The compounds that formed in that single step , like naphthalene and toluene , make up one fourth of the suite of chemicals found in gasoline .
The liquid can be further treated to form the remaining fuel components or can be used " as is " for a high octane gasoline blend .
" Green gasoline is an attractive alternative to bioethanol since it can be used in existing engines and does not incur the 30 percent gas mileage penalty of ethanol - based flex fuel , " said John Regalbuto , who directs the Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program at NSF and supported this research .
" In theory it requires much less energy to make than ethanol , giving it a smaller carbon footprint and making it cheaper to produce , " Regalbuto said .
" Making it from cellulose sources such as switchgrass or poplar trees grown as energy crops , or forest or agricultural residues such as wood chips or corn stover , solves the lifecycle greenhouse gas problem that has recently surfaced with corn ethanol and soy biodiesel . "
Beyond academic laboratories , both small businesses and Fortune 500 petroleum refiners are pursuing green gasoline .
Companies are designing ways to hybridize their existing refineries to enable petroleum products including fuels , textiles , and plastics to be made from either crude oil or biomass and the military community has shown strong interest in making jet fuel and diesel from the same sources .
" Huber 's new process for the direct conversion of cellulose to gasoline aromatics is at the leading edge of the new ‘ Green Gasoline ' alternate energy paradigm that NSF , along with other federal agencies , is helping to promote , " states Regalbuto .
Not only is the method a compact way to treat a great deal of biomass in a short time , Regalbuto emphasized that the process , in principle , does not require any external energy .
" In fact , from the extra heat that will be released , you can generate electricity in addition to the biofuel , " he said .
" There will not be just a small carbon footprint for the process ; by recovering heat and generating electricity , there wo n't be any footprint . "
The latest pathways to produce green gasoline , green diesel and green jet fuel are found in a report sponsored by NSF , the Department of Energy and the American Chemical Society entitled " Breaking the Chemical and Engineering Barriers to Lignocellulosic Biofuels : Next Generation Hydrocarbon Biorefineries " released April 1 ( http://www.ecs.umass.edu/biofuels/).
In the report , Huber and a host of leaders from academia , industry and government present a plan for making green gasoline a practical solution for the impending fuel crisis .
" We are currently working on understanding the chemistry of this process and designing new catalysts and reactors for this single step technique .
This fundamental chemical understanding will allow us to design more efficient processes that will accelerate the commercialization of green gasoline , " Huber said .

Treadmill desks are nothing new , but while products like the Steelcase Walkstation try to trick you into doing extra work while exercising , the JW Treadmill desk is unapologetic about being purely focused on entertainment .
In fact , it goes completely over the top with a five - display setup .

Despite it 's name , the JW Treadmill desk can accommodate just about any exercise machines you have in the house .
It also features electronically controlled monitor height adjustment and a variety of optional laminates , bumper molding and frame colors to match your decor .
Unfortunately , precisely how much one of these desks will set you back is not known , but I have no doubt that it will be expensive - especially when customized .

In this paper , we identify and analyze the historical reasons for the widespread acceptance of what we call the Turing Thesis myth , which extends the Turing Thesis to imply that Turing Machines model all computers .
The paper discusses how Turing Thesis :
Whenever there is an effective method ( algorithm ) for obtaining the values of a mathematical function , the function can be computed by a TM .

From time to time you get to a point , where you want to present information in a way that makes it easy to see and understand their temporal relationship .
For these occasions , timelines are a pretty neat tool , yet how do you do something like this within a website in a way that keeps the whole thing interactive ?
Besides the usual suspects ( the 1000th Flash / Flex implementation ) , there are also some JavaScript based solutions , that get the job done quite well .
For a project that is part of my master thesis right now , we were looking for a simple timeline tool that could easily be embedded and extended to our needs and found the SIMILE Project of the MIT .
Part of this project is also a timeline implementation in JavaScript that is remarkably flexible .
Among other cool ideas is a way to have multiple bands in your timeline .
For instance you have one band that shows events happening on a day , below that you have have a narrower band showing the same events on a monthly base and so on .
Small Example
As an example let ’s just build a small timeline of the recent history of Django , including the major branches and releases .
Load the Timeline API
Therefor first get the latest source :
$ svn checkout http://simile-widgets.googlecode.com/svn/timeline/trunk timeline
Then place the new timeline folder for instance right into the folder containing a django_timeline .
html , which will be our main playground for now .
The project itself comes with tons of separated JavaScript files , but also delivers a simple AJAX - loader that we will integrate into our django_timeline .
html file like this :
< head > <!-- ... --> < script src=" timeline/src/webapp/api/timeline-api.js " type =" text / javascript " charset= " utf -8 " ></ script > <!-- ... --> </head >
Next we need to define a container for our timeline and initialize it using the onload hook ( or whatever event you want to trigger the initialization ) .
Therefor we create a simple div that we give the ID “ timeline ” .
< style type =" text / css " media= " screen " > # timeline {width : 1000 px ; height : 400 p x ; } </ style > < script type =" text / javascript " charset = " utf - 8 " > function init ( ) {} ; </ script > <!-- ... --> < body onload= " init ( ) " > < div id =" timeline " ></div > </ body >
Note that setting at least the height of the timeline is required and that you have to use fixed values here , so no 100 % for you .
If you do n’t specify the width , it will default to 100 % .
Now we just have to tell the Timeline API , how we want our timeline to be structured .
This is done by creating an Array with one or more bandInfo objects in it and pass it to an initialization function .
Let ’s say , we want 2 bands :
One representing months , the other years , then our onload - handler would look like this :
function init ( ) { var eventSource = new Timeline. DefaultEventSource(0 ) ; var bandInfos = [ Timeline.createBandInfo( { width : ' 70 % ' , intervalUnit : Timeline .DateTime .MONTH , intervalPixels : 100 , eventSource : eventSource } ) , Timeline.createBandInfo( { width : ' 30 % ' , intervalUnit : Timeline .DateTime .YEAR , intervalPixels : 400 , eventSource : eventSource } ) ] ; bandInfos [ 1].syncWith = 0 ; bandInfos [ 1 ] . highlight = true ; timeline = Timeline.create(document.getElementById(' timeline ' ) , bandInfos ) ; }
This function basically does 3 things :
It defines the two bands mentioned above with different interval units .
It synchronizes the movements between the two bands so that if you scroll in one band , the other band moves as well .
It creates a new “ Timeline ” - object using these two bands and binds it to our container div .
Loading some Data
A timeline is nice .
A timeline with some data in it is much better , though .
To load the data into our timeline , you can use 3 formats : XML , JSON and I assume they mean with “ SPARQL ” the SPARQL Query Results XML format .
For this example we will simply use JSON and put the whole Django timeline into a file named “ django.json ” within the same folder as our “ django_timeline.html ” .
The structure of such a JSON datasource is pretty simple .
Basically , Timeline looks for a top - level element named “ entries ” which is a list of events .
A small excerpt from the Django timeline would look like this :
{ ' entries ' : [ /* ... */ { ' title ' : ' UnicodeBranch ' , ' description ' : ' Unicode branch of Django ' , ' start ' : ' April 07 2007 00:15:27 GMT ' , 'end ' : ' July 04 2007 04:28:29 GMT ' , ' isDuration ' : false } , /* ... */ ] }
Since we want to have the data available right away , we have to append this to our init ( ) function :
Timeline.loadJSON(" django.json " , function ( data , url ) { eventSource.loadJSON( data , url ) ; } ) ;
The Timeline ’s own loadJSON - method will then simply eval the data and pass thet struct over to the EventSource ’s loadJSON - method , which will the build Event - objects from it .
Well , that ’s more or less all you have to do to get a timeline with some data .
You can see the current state of the timeline here .
Styling
Nice , but there is definitely some Django - flair missing here .
SIMILE
Timeline also has something to offer to those of you , how want everything flashy and colorful .
It comes with a small theming system that basically consists of a class holding all the style information used for rendering the timeline .
You can find this class definition in the timeline / src / webapp / api/scripts / themes.js file .
When you have your own theme class , just set it as the new default theme by using Timeline ’s setDefault Theme ( ) method .
Sadly , for now the implementation there seems to be quite incomplete .
The version I ’m working with here ( r1416 ) has still quite a lot of code commented out – not only in the Classic Theme class , but also in the painters that should use these settings .
For example the event.tape.impreciseColor setting is passed to the Timeline .
OriginalEventPainter._paintEventTape function , but never applied to the tape itself there .
So if you do n’t want to start hacking the JavaScript files themselves , I guess your best option for now is to use CSS .
For example to add some Django - green to the duration - bars , add following CSS definition :
.timeline-event-tape {background :#275132;}
For more general styling , scan the timeline using for instance Firebug , which will reveal classes for basically every component of the timeline .
If you want to apply a special style to a certain event you can do so by adding “ textColor ” , “ classname ” or “ color ” to the actual event :
{ ' entries ' : [ { ' title ' : ' UnicodeBranch ' , ' description ' : ' Unicode branch of Django ' , ' start ' : ' April 07 2007 00:15:27 GMT ' , 'end ' : ' July 04 2007 04:28:29 GMT ' , ' isDuration ' : false , ' classname ' : ' w00t ' } ] }
The sad thing again is that currently this only affects the labels of these events , but since the whole project appears to be quite active , I guess , it is only a matter of time until you can see this class on every event - related element .
If you can live with this ( in my opinion minor ) problems and / or do n’t mind extending the JS files yourself , SIMILE Timeline is in my opinion really a great tool for generating timelines .

Yesterday , in the Viacom v. Google litigation , the federal court for the Southern District of New York ordered Google to produce to Viacom ( over Google 's objections ) :
all data from the Logging database concerning each time a YouTube video has been viewed on the YouTube website or through embedding on a third - party website
The court ’s order grants Viacom 's request and erroneously ignores the protections of the federal Video Privacy Protection Act ( VPPA ) , and threatens to expose deeply private information about what videos are watched by YouTube users .
The VPPA passed after a newspaper disclosed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork 's video rental records .
As Congress recognized , your selection of videos to watch is deeply personal and deserves the strongest protection .
The Logging database contains :
for each instance a video is watched , the unique “ login ID ” of the user who watched it , the time when the user started to watch the video , the internet protocol address other devices connected to the internet use to identify the user ’s computer ( “ IP address ” ) , and the identifier for the video .
Google correctly argued that “ the data should not be disclosed because of the users ’ privacy concerns , ” citing the VPPA , 18 U.S.C. § 2710 .
However , the Court dismissed this argument with no analysis , stating “ defendants cite no authority barring them from disclosing such information in civil discovery proceedings , and their privacy concerns are speculative . ”
In a footnote , the Court references the VPPA , noting that the federal law “ prohibits video tape service providers from disclosing information on the specific video materials subscribers request or obtain . ”
It is possible that the reference to " video tapes " in the VPPA was confusing .
However , the Act is not limited to the technology available at the time of its enactment .
To the contrary , the act refers to “ prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual materials . ”
A YouTube video may not be a videotape , but certainly qualifies as audio visual material .
Thus , YouTube is a “ video tape service provider ” under the act , because it is “ engaged in the business [ of ] delivery of … audio visual materials . ”
The VPPA protects “ personally identifiable information , ” which is defined to include “ information which identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials or services . ”
This is exactly what is in the Logging database .
Accordingly , pursuant to this federal law , the Court may not order the production of “ personally identifiable information ” :
in a civil proceeding [ except ] upon a showing of compelling need for the information that cannot be accommodated by any other means , if — ( i ) the consumer is given reasonable notice , by the person seeking the disclosure , of the court proceeding relevant to the issuance of the court order ; and
( ii ) the consumer is afforded the opportunity to appear and contest the claim of the person seeking the disclosure .
Today ’s court order made no finding that Viacom could not be accommodated by any other means , nor were the YouTube users provided with notice and an opportunity to contest the claim .
Instead , the Court focused on some statements made by Google on its blog :
We . . . are strong supporters of the idea that data protection laws should apply to any data that could identify you .
The reality is though that in most cases , an IP address without additional information cannot .
The Court also stated that Google did “ not refute that the ‘ login ID is an anonymous pseudonym that users create for themselves when they sign up with YouTube ’ which without more ‘ cannot identify specific individuals . ’ ”
As an initial matter , this is factually insufficient .
If any single one of the YouTube users in the Logging database picked a Login ID that does identify that user ( i.e. if my YouTube login was kurtopsahl ) , then the Logging database ' information about viewing habits is protected by the VPPA , even if others pick anonymous pseudonyms .
Furthermore , even Google ’s IP address statement only asserts that “ in most cases ” the IP address is not identifiable , certainly not in all cases .
Putting aside whether a Google Public Policy blog 's statement on an unrelated topic can waive the privacy rights of YouTube users , the statement means that at least some YouTube users are identifiable , and must be protected by the VPPA .
In any event , the court ordered production of not just IP addresses , but also all the associated information in the Logging database .
Whatever might be said about 'an IP address without additional information , ' the the AOL search history leak fiasco shows that the material viewed by a user alone can be sufficient to identify the user , even with neither a login nor an IP address .
The Court 's erroneous ruling is a set - back to privacy rights , and will allow Viacom to see what you are watching on YouTube .
We urge Viacom to back off this overbroad request and Google to take all steps necessary to challenge this order and protect the rights of its users .
Last Friday , Crimanimal
Mass took their second bicycle ride on the freeway during drive - home rush hour ( see a video of their first ride here ) .
Whizzing by gridlocked cars , the demonstration , albeit illegal , raises questions .
Good questions .
One of the group 's organizers , Morgan Strauss , 29 , was quoted in the Santa Monica Daily Press ( . pdf ) this weekend saying that he " just wanted to raise questions about the transportation infrastructure .
In a city ruled by cars , why is it that you can get places faster on bikes ? "
Many photos were taken of the ride , which included nearly 30 bicyclists , but also three rollerbladers :
American “ political analysis ” has become obsessed with demographics .
For example , pundits and pollsters held that the Democratic contests in Ohio and Pennsylvania between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama turned on the vote of “ white working - class men , ” a constituency seemingly in thrall to Clinton .
Those primaries supposedly showed Obama ’s problem for the general election .
I suggest to you that this kind of analysis , though it comes in the form of numbers , is both fundamentally non-empirical and fundamentally non-explanatory .
Take an election , for example , that finishes 54 % to 46 % in Clinton ’s favor .
Now say that white working - class men constitute 12 % of the vote , and 10 of every 12 of them ( 10 % of the overall vote ) go for Clinton .
Obviously , white working - class men were the pivot on which the election turned .
If Obama could have broken off half the vote that went to Clinton , he would have won :
He would have increased his vote by 5 % and reduced hers by 5 % , and won 51 % to 49 % .
Advertisement
But notice that the vote of any like - sized segment is equally explanatory .
If most “ soccer moms ” or most “ people ages 35 to 44 " or most people “ with annual incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000 " or most “ people in the southeast corner of the state ” voted for Clinton , we can say that had they voted for Obama , he would have won .
So the assertion , for example , that the result turned on the votes of white working - class men is completely unsupported by the demographics .
It no more turned on that group than on any other substantial group that supported Clinton .
Now , one reason for the claim that the white male working - class vote was decisive is that it coincides with the margin of victory in this instance .
But notice , if the white working - class men had been split , that would have been decisive for Obama .
That is , no matter how the votes of white working - class men are distributed , once you have picked them to study and focused your analysis of the outcome on how they voted , they are decisive .
Their importance is not something the data show .
That is an a priori conceptual result of the methods , structure and use of the analysis .

The way that polling and demographics slice up the population is , ultimately , a matter of preference ; it does not derive from , but is a presupposition of , the “ science . ”
Searching for segments of the electorate that vote as a bloc , demographers split the population up into groups they decide are important or salient .
And their decisions do n’t necessarily reflect empirical results -- they are more an index of their own social attitudes , presumptions and prejudices .
It would be nearly as scientific to rig up any segment of the population and regard it as decisive : blue - collar women , black and white , under 35 ; black men plus Latino women ; left - handed divorcees .
The results might be striking ; the voting habits of such groups might be as , or more , strongly correlated than race , income and gender grouped in the conventional ways .
But even if the results were not striking , even if the groups were evenly split , they would be decisive by the standards of this sort of demographic analysis .
When you bring a set of racial or gender - based categories to the data , the divisions these attitudes represent will always be confirmed as the most important divisions in our society .
That just reinforces the problematic divisions that infested the attitudes of the pollsters in the first place .
And then , at the end of each election , our divisions of race , gender and class are , in our imaginations , stronger .

The right response to the notion that “ scientific polling ” shows that the election outcome turns on white men or black women or soccer moms is a shrug of the shoulders and the arch of an eyebrow .
Says Attack Will Come After the General Election Nov. 4 and Before Bush and Cheney Leave Office in January
Jon Ponder Byon 6/26/2008 , 10:16 am PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
In an interview posted on the website of the London Telegraph , John Bolton , one of the most belligerent of the neocon war hawks , predicted that Israel will attack Iran sometime after the U.S. presidential elections on November 4 and before January 21 , the day George Bush and Dick Cheney leave office .
Attacking Iran has long been a neocon objective .
Last February , New Yorker reporter Seymour Hersh revealed that Dick Cheney had secret plans for creating an " open confrontation " with Iran , and that he had the Pentagon ready to start bombing with 24 hours of a signal from the White House .
At the same time , the Times of London reported that top U.S. military brass had let it be known they would resign if Cheney launched the attack .
Public outcry generated by the Hersh article and other reports quickly dampened the fervor for attacking Tehran .
Two months after the report , however , John McCain ramped up the bellicose rhetoric when , during a campaign stop in South Carolina in April 2007 , he made a joke about bombing Iran by singing " Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran " to the tune of the Beach Boys song , " Barbara Ann . "
John Bolton now believes Bush and Cheney have succumbed to political reality and will not pursue the attack using U.S. forces .
According to the Telegraph , Bolton said , " It 's clear that the administration has essentially given up that possibility ...
I do n't think it 's serious any more .
If you had asked me a year ago I would have said I thought it was a real possibility .
I just do n't think it 's in the cards . "
About his suggested timeframe for the attack of November to January , Bolton said , " The Israelis have one eye on the calendar because of the pace at which the Iranians are proceeding both to develop their nuclear weapons capability and to do things like increase their defenses by buying new Russian anti-aircraft systems and further harden the nuclear installations .
" They 're also obviously looking at the American election calendar .
My judgment is they would not want to do anything before our election because there 's no telling what impact it could have on the election . "
Bolton suggests that Israel will attack Iran on Bush 's watch because the Israelis fear that if Barack Obama is elected , he would stand in the way of such of an attack , because he has signaled he would seek negotiations with Iran before attacking .
" An Obama victory would rule out military action by the Israelis because they would fear the consequences given the approach Obama has taken to foreign policy , " Bolton said in the interview .
About the approach of John McCain , Bolton , a McCain supporter , said , " With McCain they might still be looking at a delay .
Given that time is on Iran 's side , I think the argument for military action is sooner rather than later absent some other development . "
Bush named Bolton as his UN ambassador as a recess appointment in 2005 , but he only served a year because Democrats in the Senate refused to confirm him .
Though there are still primaries left , the Democratic Party may be headed for an August dilemma .
Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama is likely to enter the convention with a clinching majority of committed delegates chosen by voters in primaries and caucuses , but Obama is almost guaranteed to have more of them .
So , barring a huge late turnaround , the deciding votes will come from the approximately 800 “ superdelegates , ” automatically seated ex officio and free to vote as they please .
Who are these powerful insiders ?
Why are they there ?
The story goes back 40 years , to when the party , battered by the bloody debacle of the 1968 convention and subsequent loss to Richard Nixon , revised its method of selection to bring in more delegates who were outside the official circles of power , particularly women and people of color .
But in 1972 George McGovern lost 49 states .
In 1976 Jimmy Carter squeezed out a close win over Gerald Ford , who was still floundering in the blowback from Watergate , and in 1980 Carter was buried under a Reagan landslide .
In 1982 , looking at this record of three losses in four tries , the party leaders decided to reform their earlier reform and bring back seasoned veterans familiar with the unlovely sausage - making machinery of actually choosing a candidate who can win .
The list now includes all Democratic members of Congress and of the Democratic National Committee , all sitting Democratic governors , all living former Democratic presidents and vice presidents and all past Democratic majority or minority leaders in both houses of Congress .
They make up about 20 percent of all the delegates — but 40 percent of the 2,025 needed to nominate .
If the Clinton team can persuade these men and women by summer that Obama is unable to win the general election and they choose her despite primary vote numbers in his favor , there is sure to be a loud and anguished protest about the violation of the democratic process .
Delegates who have sweated their way through grueling primaries to win votes for their favorite do n’t want to feel that they simply took part in a nonbinding beauty contest .
But the “ supers ” ( a term the Democratic Party officially dislikes ) could bristle equally at the idea of simply rubber - stamping the decision of delegates swept into the convention hall on a possibly short - lived wave of enthusiasm for a charismatic candidate .
Either way , when the winner ’s hand is raised on the platform amid the bands and the balloons , it ’s going to be a wounded Democratic Party that finally gets down to contesting John McCain .
And there ’s a possibility that disgruntled stay - home supporters of the loser could hand the election to the Republicans .
The party ’s in a pickle for which reformers and counter - reformers prepared the vat and the spices .
The problem did n’t arise sooner because in all the Democratic nomination contests from 1984 on , the winners had the victory sewed up before the opening gavel fell .
The new formula yielded only two wins in six elections .
Actually , three , for Al Gore would have clearly won in Florida but for the questionable denial of ballots to large numbers of African - Americans and the confusion of many elderly Democratic voters by a “ butterfly ballot ” that made it hard to pick out Gore ’s line .
The Supreme Court ’s fiat , however , confirmed the theft .
In all it appears that the post - 1968 reforms as modified by the post - 1980 reforms have not been lucky for the Democrats .
The law of unintended consequences that often dogs reformers may be at work .
Open primaries , first introduced at the start of the last century , were a wonderful democratizing idea .
But no one could foresee how , a century later , the primaries themselves would suffer the debasements of the general election — too much money required simply to enter the race , let alone win ; too much media attention to personalities and too little to policies , principles and programs .
Certainly it was heartening after 1968 to see faces on the Democratic convention floor more representative of the variety of American voters .
And most people do not yearn for the era of nominations made at 2 a .m. by the old ( and white ) boys in the smoke - filled rooms .
Yet look at what the old system produced , contrasted with the new .
In the 10 elections ending in 1968 the Democrats nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt four times , Harry Truman , Adlai Stevenson twice , John F. Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey .
In the nine since then , McGovern , Carter twice , Walter Mondale , Bill Clinton twice , Gore and John Kerry .
Whatever their individual virtues , it would be hard to argue that they represent a major improvement on those seven predecessors .
It does seem as if the arranged marriage between a system of popularly chosen committed delegates and a small but potentially decisive cadre of unpledged and unelected but highly experienced delegates has struck a snag .
Whatever happens this November , thoughtful Democrats of all persuasions need to take another look , perhaps another stab , at reconciling the two — or expediting a divorce .
NSW Premier Morris Iemma today refused to deny that he knew of three statutory declarations about the Iguanas Waterfront incident , dubbed Iguanagate , that John Della Bosca 's office withheld last week .
Mr Iemma 's failure today to deny knowledge of the withheld statutory declarations puts him and his office at the heart of the scandal .
The Premier was repeatedly asked this morning at a press conference whether he or his office knew of the statutory declarations written by Federal Labor MP Belinda Neal 's staff and supporters to try to back up her version of events .
I wondered a while ago where the " Iron " names came from .
According to a NxtGenUG interview with Michael Foord , John Lam says that IRON can be reverse - engineered to stand for " It Runs On . Net " , which is cool , but I finally found the real story in an interview on the " Port 25 : The Open Source Community at Microsoft " site , in which IronPython creator Jim Hugunin says :
I 'll give you the story , but I 'll give you the short version ' cause it 's not very good .
At the time , I had a consulting company called " Want of a Nail Software " .
" Want of a Nail " is based on a children 's poem .
It 's about the importance of small things .
I 've always kind of believed in the importance of small things .
Part of the story of IronPython 's actual performance is it was n't one big thing - Everybody wants to know " What was the one big thing ? "
There were some big things , but most of it was all the small things - paying attention to performance in every place .
So , that was the consulting company and " Iron " seemed to match .
There were some obvious names : Python .
Net , Python# , n Python -
All of those were taken .
All of the URLs for those were registered .
I did n't want to reuse any of those names , so " Iron " was just kind of a name that appealed to me at a visceral level - I like the feeling of " IronPython " .
There 's a little bit of " Iron Chef " in it , although I 'm always reluctant to admit that .
About the " Python " part : According to the Wikipedia article on Python :
An important goal of the Python developers is making Python fun to use .
This is reflected in the origin of the name ( based on the television series Monty Python 's Flying Circus ) , in the common practice of using Monty Python references in example code , and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials .
For example , the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are " spam " and " eggs " , instead of the traditional " foo " and " bar " .
... and Wikipedia says this about the name " Ruby " :
" Ruby " was named as a gemstone because of a joke within Matsumoto 's circle of friends alluding to the name of the Perl programming language .
... which led me to the Perl article , where I discovered that it was originally named " Pearl " .
I think I 'll stop now before I digress into a rant about how " C# " is a cool name but J# and X# were doomed to failure not for technical reasons , but for musical ones ( unless Microsoft has a much larger piano keyboard than I do ) .
Abdul Monem Mahmud , 28 , is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , an Islamic group that is officially banned in Egypt but tolerated .
He works as a journalist for al - Dustour and writes the blog Ana Ikhwan ( I'm a part of the Muslim Brotherhood ) .
" The people are rebelling .
People who are hungry and demand that someone take interest in them .
The parties and unions are involved in the demonstrations , but they are not controlling them .
It 's not a political movement .
I talk with a lot of people , especially at the market .
They tell me that they 're not against Mubarak .
They 're not demanding democracy ; but just to eat .
Most people do n't have more than 150 Egyptian pounds a month ( 18 euros ) to keep their families alive .
That 's not enough .
People are hungry , so they 're rebelling .
And it's this kind of revolt that can turn into a revolution .
We at the Muslim Brotherhood do n't trust the elections organised by those in power .
And the people do n't either .
We tried to get our candidates into the local elections , but the government disqualified almost all of them .
They only validated 21 , when there are 50,000 seats to be filled in the election .
The ruling party controls everything .
Citizens vote , but it's the chief of police who puts the ballot slips in the box . "
Stuck with an impossible - to - sell SUV ?
Getting killed at the pump ?
Here ’s how to green that machine .
There ’s a whole lot of information online about which hybrid is the best .
But there ’s not a lot of help for the one in eight Americans who have purchased an SUV and may be stuck with it .
What ’s needed is a practical guide for the rest of us .
And by us , I really mean us – I own an SUV myself .
( Shhh ! )
Yes , trading in the SUV for that eco-friendly hybrid would be great .
But many of us are not in this position for a variety of reasons : budget , credit , a lease we ca n’t get out of , work , or lifestyle commitments .
Stanch the Bleeding
The obvious first step is to cut down on fuel consumption .
Aside from being good for the planet , this can help save you a lot of money , which is probably why you most want to “ green ” your beast in the first place .
With gas prices closing in on $ 5 per gallon in some parts of the country , driving an SUV these days is painful .
Tips to save on fuel :
1. Drive a little less .
Part of a couple ?
According to Planet Green , if one of you can take public transport ( or even carpool with a coworker ) while the other still uses the SUV , you will save up to $ 6,200 a year .
If you ’re thinking , “ So why not keep the second car and sell the SUV ? ” skip down a few paragraphs to learn why that may not be a wise decision .
More tips : if you can walk or bike to errands , do so .
If you can telecommute one day a week , even better .
2. Road rules .
Driving aggressively sucks up a lot of gas .
If you can drive at an even speed and brake and accelerate slowly , you ’ll save between 31 - 37 % of the gas in your tank !
Do n’t drive competitively , constantly switching lanes and trying to get the space ahead .
3. Geriatric style .
Driving slower will save you 12 - 14 % on gas .
I used to be an impatient speed demon until I narrowly missed a horrific multi-car accident one night in Santa Monica .
I decided right then that driving like my grandma was n’t such a bad idea .
Sure , sometimes people get annoyed with me , but in addition to saving on gas I just feel a lot calmer and safer on the road .
It ’s their loss .
4. Fueling debate .
Hey , low rider : keep your tires properly inflated to save 3 % on gas .
Well , maybe – studies differ .
As for the buzz about filling your tires with nitrogen , it ’s probably not worth the extra cost , but it does n’t hurt to try .
And you ’ll have to decide if turning off the A/C to save gas is a myth .
5 . The devil ’s time .
Idling really is bad for fuel efficiency .
5 minutes a day of idling means a gallon lost a month , so look for ways to reduce idling time .
Make the Most of It
Should you trade it in ?
Kelley Blue
Book does n’t think so and neither do most guides ; SUV prices have dropped nearly 10 % since the end of 2007 .
It will only get worse until winter , when prices are expected to creep back up to break - even .
If you ’ve still got a substantial amount on the loan to pay back , you could be facing a significant financial loss if you try to sell or trade in .
Make the most of your Toyotasaurus Rex instead .
1 . Think long - term .
First , realize that as much as the sign at the gas station stings , the loss you ’ll take on getting rid of your SUV is going to sting more than what you ’re shelling out for gas over the life of your loan .
On average , it ’s actually cheaper to keep your SUV than to get a newer fuel - efficient car .
2 . My treehugger friends are going to cringe , but I say enjoy your SUV while you ’ve got it .
I ’m not talking about gas guzzling road trips , but just the fact that you own this car .
You chose it , right ?
Americans originally fell for SUVs because they feel powerful and sexy to drive .
So enjoy these reptilian instincts until you “ evolve ” .
Nothing is more draining than fruitless , wishy - washy mental limbo .
You bought it , it ’s yours .
Own it .
3 . The lesser of two evils .
Lend out your SUV to your kids ’ school , your church , or to anyone in the community who is moving , working on a big project , or making a big purchase .
While your Suburban may get lousy gas mileage on your daily commute , it may not be as bad as the crusty bus or fuming delivery truck .
4 . Make your trips efficient .
Simply thinking about the various stops you ’ll have to make , and planning out your route ahead of time , will save you a lot of gas and reduce your SUV ’s impact substantially .
If you can , group your errands into weekly or biweekly batches , too .
5 . Take good care of it .
Eventually you will be able to sell , either because you luck out with the right buyer or you pay down the loan enough to get right - side - up .
Keep your brute in optimal condition inside and out to get the most return on your investment and cut down on fuel loss and repairs .
Damage Control
To help reduce your car ’s carbon tireprint , look to other areas of your life where you can painlessly green up .
( I admit it ’s a little personal , but it really grills me when I see people get self - righteous with SUV owners .
Maybe they have a unique situation ; maybe they happen to be so green on balance that they ’re doing better than a lot of hybrid drivers .
You never know . )
1 . Your house : use a compost , replace burned out bulbs with CFLs , buy a timed thermostat , switch off the lights , plant trees around your house , adjust your thermostat setting by 2 degrees , and buy vintage or eco-friendly decor and furnishings .

Nearly everything you use can go in a recycling bin or the compost .
It also helps to use the real things and avoid disposables like paper plates , paper towels and paper napkins .
When it comes to travel , take one less trip a year , and avoid flying .
( Purchase carbon offsets for the flights you do make . )
5 . Your chores : use a push - powered lawnmower , use eco-friendly or home - made cleaning products , use a wind - powered gadget charger , and carry your sundries and groceries in a stylish reusable sack .

What tips did I leave out ?
Just a click away : Online ' killers ' boast a professional service Mexican police are investigating a number of classified ads on the internet which purport to be from hitmen offering the services .
The ads can be found alongside ones for private tuition or domestic help .
In one of them , a person describing himself as an ex-military killer offers " discreet , professional services " for $ 6,000 ( £ 3,000 ) .
Hired killers are a problem across a country which has seen at least 1,400 killings this year .
Most of the killings are related to drug cartels battling for control of the illegal drugs trade to the US .
Reports say the cartels have camps to train killers .
The dead include dealers and gunmen as well as more than 400 police officers and other public officials , this year .
Some 25,000 troops are now deployed around Mexico to try to break the cartels .
But correspondents say an ineffective justice system means many killers are never caught .
Help needed
That may be why they are prepared to publically look for work .
In the online adverts on one classified site , one advert reads : " Assassin ex-military professional and discreet .
Work guaranteed in 10 days or less .
Have worked in Spain . $ 6,000 .
Serious requests only " and gives a hotmail address as a contact .
Another offering " hitman for hire " asks : " Problems with a certain person ?
Do you want me to solve it ?
Write to me .
100 % professional , we do n't take money in advance . "
The classified ads site also appears to be a place where those needing the services of a killer might go .
One advert in the Wanted section reads : " I need to contact a killer for a probable contract in the DF ( Federal District of Mexico ) must be reliable .
it is a simple job . "
Police spokesman Miguel Amelio said the problem of hitmen is one that " the whole country is facing : people who offer their service and charge for killing someone " .
He told the Reforma newspaper that police had not ruled out the fact that the ads were fake , but all were being investigated .

A new study on long - term cannabis use suggests the drug can cause significant brain abnormalities , affecting the memory and emotional processing .
The study by researchers at the Universities of Melbourne and Wollongong says the effects can be equivalent to those experienced by people with a mild traumatic brain injury .
They say the study also documents for the first time , that long term marijuana use affects all users , not just high risk categories such as the young and those susceptible to mental illness .
The chief executive of Melbourne 's Odyssey House , Stefan Gruenert , says he is not surprised by the findings .
" If you 're using cannabis daily , heavily and over a long period of time , the people in this study had been using for about ten years , then you are likely to have changes in the brain that are likely to lead to or mimic some of the symptoms of things like paranoia , memory loss , confusion , " he said .
Mr Gruenert says the findings should serve as a warning about all long - term drug use .
" Anything used in heavy dose inappropriately for a long term can lead to damage , " he said .
" I think this is another piece of information for us as a society to make us stop and think about whether legalising any of our current illicit drugs is a wise idea . "
Yep , you read that right .

John J. Castellani , president of the Business Roundtable , which represents the nation ’s major chief executives , is counseling a wait - and - see attitude .
Big business faces big trouble in '09
The economic outlook for business is surely grim .
But when you figure in political forecasts , the future seems even more precarious to some industry leaders .
Corporate bosses from across the spectrum are pressing Congress and the White House for action on a host of problems , ranging from soaring gasoline prices to health care reform .

But with Democrats poised to gain greater majorities in the House and Senate and possibly recapture the White House , the solutions unveiled next year may not be the market - based antidotes envisioned in boardrooms .
In addition , some corporate lobbyists are warning their clients that hard - fought victories won during the Bush years , such as limits on some jury awards , may be eroded or lost if Democrats take the White House .
And they predict labor leaders , who largely stayed in the shadows in order to give Democrats more maneuvering room in their first majority turn in a decade , will be more emboldened come January .
That could mean passage of such corporate heresies as the proposal to ease union organizing rules .
“ The unions ’ agenda really turns the clock back 40 or 50 years , ” said R. Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
“ And if you were one of the companies that played in those political spaces on tort reform , you ’ve got to be concerned as hell . ”
Of course , labor leaders disagree .
And they note that their members represent the consumers who are suffering most from stagnant wages , lost jobs , falling home values , higher food costs and all the other ills plaguing the market .
A new report from the progressive Center for American Progress concluded that the estimated total cost of a Fourth of July barbecue for 20 family members driving 30 miles round - trip rose to $ 262.34 this year , up 8.7 percent since last year and 47 percent since 2000 .
Others challenge Josten ’s prediction on tort reform , arguing that the final negotiated legislation drew significant bipartisan support .
The one forecast that does draw consensus : Change is coming .
“ There ’s no time like the present for business to start preparing for that and thinking about where their own vulnerabilities might be and what their priorities will be , ” said Jeffrey Peck , a lobbyist with Johnson , Madigan , Peck , Boland & Stewart .
“ If people put their heads in the sand and pretend change is not in the air , they will probably be very unhappy with the result , ” he said .
“ If they do n’t , and realize it is manageable and does n’t have to be as bad as they think , they can be in good shape next year . ”
John J. Castellani , president of the Business Roundtable , which represents the nation ’s major chief executives , is counseling a wait - and - see attitude .
“ What we ’re looking at is still a challenging economic environment , ” he explained .
“ The real question is : What inning are we in , in this economy ?
Are we in the third inning of a difficult economy , or the seventh ?
I do n’t think anybody knows . ”
The issues bedeviling the economy have now become driving themes in the presidential campaign , and that ’s likely to intensify .
What ’s still unclear , said Castellani , is how either Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain would prioritize their market cures once in the White House .
The answer to that will help define which sectors need to go on defense .
“ If you want to stimulate the economy , you will be hard - pressed to do that if you raise taxes substantially on businesses and wealthy individuals , ” Castellani said .
“ If you want to solve the health care problem or some of the housing problems , you may have to raise revenues , and that will have an adverse impact on the economy , ” he added .
Jay Timmons is the executive vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers , an industry sector that has been hit particularly hard by the economic slump .
To him , the market messiness has caused a clarifying moment for the nation and the presidential candidates , which is just fine .
“ There have been a lot of different goals in Washington .
Sometimes it was environmental , sometimes it was economics and sometimes it was education .
All of those things are very important , ” Timmons said .
“ But right now , all policymakers seem to have a laser focus , brought about by the voters , on the economy and jobs .
That ’s a good thing . ”
He acknowledges , though , that politicians will disagree on how to resolve the weaknesses in the economy .
But he believes that the instability has become so great that there could be a rare opportunity for compromises to achieve the greater goal of righting the economy .
“ Everybody is focused on the same goal , and that should be healthy for the country , ” Timmons said .
“ I do n’t think anybody is looking at one piece of the legislative pie .
I think they realize that everything is very interrelated , whether it ’s energy , taxes or tort law . ”
Brian Darling , director of Senate relations for the Heritage Foundation , foresees a very different political environment , one still defined by partisan bickering .
And from that perspective , he sees stalemate and inaction in a McCain administration .
Tougher times — and higher taxes — could be ahead for the business community under an Obama administration , said Darling .
The oil sector , in particular , could take any number of hits , including a windfall profits tax if prices at the pump do n’t decline .
“ Hold on to your wallets , ” was his advice to Big Oil .

DJ Ball , Tosh Suo and other members of WeAreChange Vancouver were at an event featuring Colin Powell .
As soon as they questioned Powell on DU ( Delepted Uranium ) and war crimes they were escorted out of the venue .
As they were escorted out of the venue , they saw their camera man Michael Varcellona , who they hired to document the entire protest in handcuffs outside of the venue .
This camera man was not in the venue and was the only one out of the 50 protestors arrested .
All he was doing was filming the whole protest .
The police stated that he will be facing potential trespassing violations .
This is ludicrous because he was filming on a public sidewalk and did nothing illegal .
The Canadian police will not talk to us and we have n’t been informed of the charges that Varcellona will be facing .
Also , he has yet to receive his one phone call .

Recycled work wear
Narwhal Co. recycles vintage neckties into wallets , wrist cuffs , and iPod / iPhone covers , which ’ll look fab with Dad ’s recycled - bottle suit .

During the last few months , I ’ve tried in vain to understand why the Democrats will not support an impeachment resolution against Bush or Cheney .
I read hours and hours of news and facts , but it took a comment from a BuzzFlash reader to open my eyes , and what I saw almost left me speechless !

New House leadership may breathe life into Jewish domestic concerns
by matthew e. berger
Washington | New faces in the congressional leadership may mean new opportunities for American Jewish groups seeking legislative solutions to many of its own concerns and those of the broader community .
. .
Still , Jewish lobbyists in Washington expressed some optimism that they would be able to advance issues as diverse as raising the minimum wage , reforming immigration policy and finding a solution to the crisis in Darfur .
They also expressed confidence in the relations they have established with many of the incoming House Democratic leaders , especially the likely next speaker of the House , :-) Rep. NANCY PELOSI :-) ( D - San Francisco ) .
Jewish groups have also established strong ties with :-) Rep. Steny Hoyer :-) :-) ( D - Md. ) , the frontrunner for majority leader , and Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , a Jewish lawmaker who led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and is now considered a shoo - in for a leadership position .
Hoyer is close to Howard Friedman , the Baltimore - based president of the :-) American Israel Public Affairs Committee :-) :-) and is considered one of Israel ’s BEST and MOST INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS on Capitol Hill .
Hoyer makes it a point to educate freshmen lawmakers about Israel issues and he has led delegations to the Jewish state multiple times .
He prides himself on making Israel a bipartisan issue , vetting proposed legislation with his GOP counterpart , Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri .
There are , however , some likely incoming committee chairmen who spark concern on certain issues , primarily because of their opposition to Israel ’s settlement policy .
At the same time , these lawmakers often see eye - to - eye with the Jewish communal agenda on domestic issues .
These include Rep. :-)
John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) :-) :-) , the likely new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , and Rep. David Obey , the likely incoming chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee .
In general , said Richard Foltin , legislative director of the American Jewish Committee , “ Among the new leaders , there will be people we have a longstanding relationship with and others we will have to build it with . ”
William Daroff , vice president for public policy at United Jewish Communities , the umbrella of the North American federation system , said of Conyers : “ He ’s always had an open ear to the concerns of the Jewish community , particularly as it relates to its domestic agenda . ”
In just the last few weeks , The San Diego Union - Tribune eliminated more than 100 jobs , one - tenth of its work force .
The Chicago Sun -Times began a major round of newsroom layoffs , then put itself up for sale , and publishers in Minneapolis and Philadelphia warned that tough economics could force cuts there .
Not long ago , news like that would have drawn much commentary and hand - wringing in the newspaper business , but in the last few months , reductions have become so routine that they barely make a ripple outside each paper ’s hometown .
Since mid-2007 , major downsizing  often coupled with grim financial reports  has been imposed at The San Francisco Chronicle , The Seattle Times , The San Jose Mercury News , USA Today and many others .
The talk of newspapers ’ demise is older than some of the reporters who write about it , but what is happening now is something new , something more serious than anyone has experienced in generations .
Last year started badly and ended worse , with shrinking profits and tumbling stock prices , and 2008 is shaping up as more of the same , prompting louder talk about a dark turning point .
“ I ’m an optimist , but it is very hard to be positive about what ’s going on , ” said Brian P. Tierney , publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News .
“ The next few years are transitional , and I think some papers are n’t going to make it . ”
The Community with the Most US Veterans Per Capita Is Finally Getting Its Own Memorial
The Riverside National Cemetery in California is the first to recognize Native American veterans .
Yesterday , in response to an essay arguing for impeachment , I got the following comment :
" If anything , the start of impeachment proceedings might force Bush to start the war against Iran early or cause him to bring about the false flag attack you mention .
What better way to show the country how the Democrats engage in devisive partisan politics than to have them impeach him while the country is at war .
Bush could also use the threat of impeachment as a pretext for declaring martial law and sweeping aside all opposition .
It 's better to just let Bush leave office quietly than to risk the horrors that he could unleash on us before then . "
Congress is terrified that -- if Bush or Cheney are impeached -- they might bomb Iran , declare martial law and suspend the 2008 elections
Lobbyist fees Hit New Records in New Hampshire
Democrats have been in charge of all branches of New Hampshire state government for just over a year now , and it has n’t taken them long to show the state why they have n’t been entrusted with this type of majority in over 100 years .
The latest fiasco is this story about the growing influences of lobbyists in the state .
Fees paid to lobbyists in New Hampshire soared to an all - time high last year , according to an analysis by The Telegraph of Nashua .
The $ 9.6 million paid to lobbyists in 2007 was a 78 percent increase over the previous record of $ 5.4 million set in 2005 .
Just a modest little jump , eh? 78 % ?
Spending has risen across the board in New Hampshire in the last year .
This is not a coincidence , and senate Republican leader Ted Gastas does n’t think so either .
Senate Republican Leader Ted Gatsas , of Manchester , attributes the spike in lobbying fees to the fact that Democrats took control of the entire Legislature in 2006 .
“ When Democrats took over , you saw a lot of corporations worried about where this would take them , ” he said .
From this Nashua Telegraph article , here are the highest paid lobbyists and their best paying customers :
Sheehan , Phinney Capital Group $ 1,011,470 Cigna , Verizon , pharmaceuticals
Dupont Group $ 857,291
Loudon speedway , insurance , energy
Demers Group $ 844,451
Credit cards , gaming ; trial lawyers
Devine , Millimet , et al $ 676,355
Telcom , gaming , energy
Rath , Young , Pignatelli $ 631,281 PSNH ,
Anthem , health care
Bianco law firm $ 524,747
Payday loans , health care , real estate
Gallagher , Callahan , Gartrell $ 524,139 NH
Bankers , insurance , energy
Maura Weston $ 385,774
Cingular , health care , cable TV
Bouley Associates $ 364,225
Gaming , billboards , Teamsters
Orr and Reno $ 342,989 Domestic insurers , NH Fire Chiefs
Big government , nanny state , tax and spend , liberals coupled with special interest groups now emboldened to spend even more money ( 78 % more in one year ) is a recipe for the fiscal disaster that looms over New Hampshire .
But have no fear , there is legislation in the senate to reform the lobbyists laws in New Hampshire ( which is ranked 48th in the nation for it ’s lobbyist laws ) , there is only one problem :
The only changes lawmakers are considering to lobbying laws would weaken them .
The state Senate is considering a House - passed bill that reduces reporting to four times a year and eliminates the requirement that lobbyists disclose campaign contributions .

A Federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a man who was barred from the New London police force because he scored too high on an intelligence test .
In a ruling made public on Tuesday , Judge Peter C. Dorsey of the United States District Court in New Haven agreed that the plaintiff , Robert Jordan , was denied an opportunity to interview for a police job because of his high test scores .
But he said that that did not mean Mr. Jordan was a victim of discrimination .
Judge Dorsey ruled that Mr. Jordan was not denied equal protection because the city of New London applied the same standard to everyone : anyone who scored too high was rejected .
Mr. Jordan , 48 , who has a bachelor 's degree in literature and is an officer with the State Department of Corrections , said he was considering an appeal .
'' I was eliminated on the basis of my intellectual makeup , '' he said .
'' It 's the same as discrimination on the basis of gender or religion or race . ''

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - A British company developing a non -stick chewing gum that can be easily removed from pavements and shoes has raised 10 million pounds ( $ 20 million ) to help bring its product to market .
The new financing comes from institutional and private investors , with IP Group -- an early backer -- chipping in an additional 800,000 pounds , the firm said on Wednesday .
Revolymer ’s new Clean Gum is the result of polymer research at the University of Bristol , where the company was created as a research spin - out in 2005 .
Today ’s chewing gums are made from synthetic latex , which is resistant to the weather and is strongly adhesive .

Peruvian Model Lacey Zamudio's Nude Photos Spark Controversy
Peruvian model Lacey Zamudio , also known as Leysi Suárez , is facing a criminal investigation for posing nude while straddling a horse , using Peru 's red and white national flag as a saddle .
The photo , which appeared on the cover of DFarandula magazine , has caused a political uproar as Peru prepares to celebrate it 's independence from Spain on Monday .
Defense Minster Antero Flores filed a complaint against Zamudio on Thusday .
" These are patriotic symbols that demand total respect , and using them improperly requires punishment , " Flores old reporters .
" This is an offense . "
Zamudio , who 's main job is a dancer for the band Alma Bella , or Beautiful Soul , says she has committed no crime .
" I love Peru and show it with my body and soul . "
If convicted , the patriotic model could face up to four years in prison .

June 15 , 2008  --
The startling reaction between Diet Coke and Mentos sweets , made famous in thousands of YouTube videos , finally has a scientific explanation .
A study in the US has identified the prime factors that drive the fizzy plumes from Coke bottles : the roughness of the sweet and how fast it plummets to the bottle 's base .
" If you drop a pack of Mentos into a bottle of Diet Coke , you get this huge fountain of spray and Diet Coke foam coming out , " says Tonya Coffey , a physicist at Appalachian State University in Boone , North Carolina .
" This was a good project for my students to study because there was still some mystery to it . "
When mint or fruit Mentos are dropped into a fresh bottle of Diet Coke , a jet of Coke whooshes out of the bottle 's mouth and can reach a height of 10 metres .
Theories abound as to why this happens , with some bloggers speculating that it is an acid - base reaction because Coke is acidic .
Experiments in a 2006 edition of the Discovery Channel programme Mythbusters suggested the chemicals responsible for the reaction are gum arabic and gelatine in the sweets , and caffeine , potassium benzoate and aspartame in the Coke .
But there have been no rigorous scientific studies of the reaction until now .
Fizzy liquids
To find out more , Coffey and a team of students tested the reactions between Diet Coke and fruit Mentos , mint Mentos , and various ingredients such as other mints , dish - washing detergent , table salt and sand .
They also compared reactions using other fizzy liquids such as caffeine - free and sugary colas , as well as soda water and tonic water .
All the reactions took place in a bottle angled at 10° off vertical and the fountain trajectories were recorded on video .
The team also investigated the total mass lost in the fountain and the influence of the sweet 's surface roughness .
The results showed that Diet Coke created the most spectacular explosions with either fruit or mint Mentos , the fountains travelling a horizontal distance of up to 7 metres .
But caffeine - free Diet Coke did just as well , suggesting that caffeine does not accelerate the reaction , at least at the normal levels in the drink .
Measurements of the pH of the Coke before and after the experiments showed that its acidity did not change , ruling out the idea that a simple acid - base reaction drives the fountains .
Instead , the vigour of the jets depends on various factors that affect the growth rate of carbon dioxide bubbles .
The rough , dimply surfaces of Mentos encourage bubble growth because they efficiently disrupt the polar attractions between water molecules , creating bubble growth sites .
Rough candy
" Water molecules like to be next to other water molecules , so basically anything that you drop into the soda that disrupts the network of water molecules can act as a growth site for bubbles , " Coffey told New Scientist .
" And if you have rough candy with a high ratio of surface area to volume , then there 's more places for the bubbles to go . "
Low surface tension also helps bubbles grow quickly .
Measurements showed that the surface tension in water containing the sweetener aspartame is lower than in sugary water , explaining why Diet Coke creates more dramatic fountains than sugary Coke .
Another factor is that the coatings of Mentos contain gum arabic , a surfactant that further reduces surface tension in the liquid .
Rough - surfaced mints without the surfactant did not create such large fountains .
Mentos are also fairly dense and sink rapidly , quickly creating bubbles that seed further bubbles as they rise .
Crushed Mentos that fell more slowly created puny fountains that only travelled about 30 centimetres .
" Middle - school teachers are getting their students out onto the baseball field next to their school and doing this reaction , and their students love it , " says Coffey .
" It 's a great way to get students excited about science and learn something new . "
Clinton , who bashed guns eight years ago , will have a very different message for same group on Tuesday .
' Annie Oakley ' changes her tune
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , who has cast herself in the past few days as a champion of gun owners , had a very different message when she spoke eight years ago to the Newspaper Association of America .
“ CLINTON TAKES AIM AT GUNS , ” said the all - caps headline on the group ’s Web site after she told members in May 2000 , during her Senate campaign , that “ there is n’t a more important task ” than passing gun-safety laws .

On Tuesday , she 'll speak to a luncheon meeting of the same group — with a very different message .
Over the weekend , Clinton sought to capitalize on remarks Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) made about gun owners by casting herself as a Second American champion and reminiscing about how “ my dad …. taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl . ”
Shooting , she said Saturday , is “ part of the culture … part of a way of life ” in some rural areas of Pennsylvania , which hold its primary a week from Tuesday .
Clinton was so enthusiastic about her remarks that Obama mocked them on Sunday by saying : “ She 's running around talking about how this is an insult to sportsmen , how she VALUES the Second Amendment — she 's talkin ' like she 's Annie Oakley , ” the frontier markswoman .
But when she spoke to the newspaper association in 2000 , she said that “ one of the reasons I am running for the Senate ” is that “ we need a comprehensive plan to stop gun violence . ”
Clinton was running for senator from New York at the time , and her message did not directly contradict what she ’s saying now .
In the speech , Clinton was talking about handguns , not hunting weapons like shotguns .
But the contrast in emphasis provides a jarring reminder of how times , messages and circumstances change during campaigns .
A Clinton aide asserted that the Obama campaign is trying to turn the debate over his controversial San Francisco remarks into one about gun policy , when she contends the issue is elitism .
“ This is not a contest about who can be a more avid aficionado of guns and ammo , ” the aide said .
“ This is about what Obama said about people living in small towns .
“ Hillary is not a hunter – she does n’t purport to be .
She has gone hunting but frankly it ’s somewhat beside the points .
It ’s about whether you respect people who live in these small towns and rural communities . ”
The Clinton campaign was not ready to preview the content of Tuesday ’s remarks .
But one source said : “ It ’s not a gun-control speech . ”
Kathy
Marks cocks her head , listening for the din of a thousand bicycle bells .
For the Toronto grandmother , it ’s a cue to hop on her three - speed bicycle and join a riding protest for more bike lanes in Canada ’s largest city .
But after several years of participating in this annual demonstration , she ’s considering joining a new group of rabble - rousers to show her dissatisfaction with cycling conditions here : the Toronto Cyclists Union .
“ I ’ve been riding my bike for nearly 40 years in the city , and it ’s high time we have something like a union , ” Ms. Marks explained last weekend .
“ I do n’t fly around like the youngsters .
But if we were able to have better bike lanes and benefits like a union , you ’d see more people out here who are my age . ”
Believed to be a global first , the union already has enrolled hundreds of card - carrying members since it formed in May .
Modeled on auto programs like AAA , the union plans to offer members insurance , roadside assistance , and advocacy on their behalf – all for a $ 24 annual fee .
“ Our primary goal is give a voice to urban cyclists who use their bikes in their daily lives as a mode of transportation , ” explains David Meslin , founder of the Toronto Cyclists Union .
“ Cyclists do n’t feel safe on the streets , and if they know there is a group fighting for safer conditions , I believe a lot more will join . ”
With 130 miles of dedicated bike lanes , Toronto is out in front of other major Canadian cities such as Montreal ( 110 miles ) and Vancouver ( 64 miles ) .
But its bike lanes are less connected than in Vancouver , which many of Toronto ’s 400,000 utilitarian cyclists – those who cycle to work , school , or on their errands each day – say has made better progress .
“ Toronto was way ahead 10 to 15 years ago and it fell way behind Vancouver , ” says bike - union coordinator Rick Conroy .
“ Vancouver has put a lot more thought , care , and money into their bike lanes in recent years . ”
To get up to speed , one of the union ’s first tasks will be to lobby the City of Toronto to implement a “ visionary ” plan for cyclists commissioned in 2001 but never fully implemented .
Still , with 30 miles of new bikeways planned for Toronto this year , Mr. Meslin says he ’s optimistic that there is more political will to accommodate bicycling as a critical form of urban transportation .
“ The pace is quickening , ” he says .
“ We ’re not doing that badly when you compare us to cities like New York , ” agrees former mayor John Sewell , who was seen as eccentric back in the 1970s when he eschewed a limousine for a bicycle .
“ But I believe that the city could do a lot more .
Some of the main streets are throwing cyclists right in the road of traffic . ”
As the front - runner in politics on the bicycling issue , Mr. Sewell hopes current city politicians will break out of the pack to support the bicycle union ’s agenda .
In the coming months , the bike union hopes to build momentum by reaching out to newcomers , including immigrants .
Eventually , it even hopes to offer an online dating service for urban road warriors .
“ That ’s one service I would definitely use , ” says Marks , before pedaling off with her fellow protesters .

From : Nerve.com Experiment : To evaluate the effect of five different drugs on my sexual performance .
Hypothesis : State your hypothesis in the form of a prediction that can be verified by the results of the experiment .
I 've never really had sex on drugs , but they 've always been linked in my mind .
Maybe that 's because the guys who did drugs in high school were also getting sucked off by girls .
Even today , I 'm convinced that a boring , homely acquaintance of mine can truthfully claim an Elle cover model is his girlfriend only because he has an endless supply of Bolivian marching powder on hand .
But this experiment is about sex on drugs , not sex for drugs .
Therefore , I plan to conduct the sexual act in its purest , most apolitical form  while being totally off my head .
My goal is to find a dependable accessory to sex .
In other words , I want to find my drug .
It 's like when you 're sixteen , and you rummage around in your parents ' liquor cabinet trying to determine which drink will be your drink .
( Embarrassingly , mine 's still Malibu and Coke . )
The question I intend to answer : is sex on drugs even better than the real thing , or  like the inclusion of ' Hotter Than Hell ( Demo Version ) ' on the reissue of Motley Crue 's Shout at the Devil  just an unnecessary augmentation of the sublime ?
Requirements : Please list all the materials required for this experiment ( including , if applicable , how they were obtained ) .
Viagra ( 1 , 50mg ) Ecstasy ( 1 , type : ' Ninja Star ' ) Mushrooms ( ' Shrooms ) Cocaine ( $ 40 bag ) Marijuana ( 1 nugget , strain : ' Juicy Fruit ' ) Girlfriend ( 1 ) Method :
In this portion of your report , you must describe , step - by - step , what you did in your lab .
It should be specific enough that someone who has not seen the lab can follow the directions and recreate the same lab .
I was an impressionable kid , and I was made leery of drugs at a young age .
My fourth - grade teacher was an unkempt hippie who wore shirts with yellow pit stains and stored bits of lunch in his formidable beard .
Once he told our class how two of his friends tried some magic mushrooms and keeled over right there , in some English meadow .
Now , imagine your teacher telling you that when you 're nine years old .
It was some cold shit , I assure you .
I was scared straight before my time .
( Note of context : I saw Dark Crystal that same year and soiled my pants right in the theater . )
Adolescence brought me neither sex nor drugs .
Since then , I 've taken full advantage of everything I missed out on during a little period I like to call ' the 1990's , ' but a move to New York only compounded my drug - based anxiety .
Namely , I started to equate an old girlfriend 's casual cocaine use with infidelity .
I resented the way she 'd disappear into a tiny scuzz - bar bathroom with her shady hook - up guy , then return to my side with a sly grin and sparkly eyes .
Who knows what they were doing in there ?
Why was some other dude being drafted to make her feel good ?
My current girlfriend went through what she calls her ' drug phase ' a long time ago .
Let me put it this way : if drugs were crayons , Erica started with the sixty - four pack .
By the age of twenty - one , she 'd done ketamine , meth , opium , whippets  a maelstrom of substances that 'd render her dangerous to cremate .
When I requested her assistance with this experiment , she launched into an excruciating monologue about the finer details of being in a K - hole .
It left us both slightly nauseated .
Reluctantly , she agreed to participate , but only if she could stay clean and serve as a witness .
My editor decreed that the study would involve five substances .
Crank , crack , gas - huffing and the big H were ruled out at an early stage .
We settled on ecstasy , cocaine , marijuana , mushrooms and Viagra .
Each would be evaluated by six criteria : immediate physical effect , tactile response , duration of sex , mental images produced , lab assistant 's reaction , and comparison to usage outside the sexual realm .
Getting the drugs was n't a problem .
I had a pretty good idea which friends and co-workers could hook me up with what .
I put out the call , and during the next week , nondescript envelopes appeared in discreet areas of my desk like four visits from the drug fairy .
Only Bob Dole 's little blue friend proved elusive .
Online Viagra vendors were too expensive , and borrowing from someone 's prescription was n't an option : because my co-workers are women in the 25 - 30 age bracket , they are n't exactly in the prime demographic for erectile dysfunction .
I finally turned to Craigslist , an infamous online bulletin board where one can obtain ' a slippery hand job , no questions asked , ' from a bored stay - at - home mom as easily as one can acquire a used Thighmaster .
Sure enough , some guy had posted a ' Viagra Available ' ad .
He had a few pills left at $ 30 a pop .
After a quick email volley , I met ' Mac , ' a buff Latino dude , outside his gym in an upscale Brooklyn neighborhood .
He invited me to ' take a little walk ' with him .
As we strolled down a tree - lined residential avenue , every apple - cheeked , stroller - toting family looked like a team of undercover narcs .
' You 've done this shit before , right ? '
Mac asked .
I nervously replied that I had not .
He assured me that I was going to have 'a real good time . '
It was then that I became acutely embarrassed : Here I was , talking to a stranger  a drug dealer of sorts  about the award - winning , four - hour erection he was going to help me achieve .
' Half of one of these will be plenty , ' Mac said , handing over a little envelope containing the goods .
' You 've got four great nights there ! '
We shook hands , and he asked if I needed anything else .
I was n't sure what he meant .
Some Preparation - H , some tough - actin ' Tinactin , perchance ?
The man was like a walking Rite - Aid .
Back in Manhattan , Erica and I were determined to get right down to business .
We wanted to keep the experiment pure , minding two very important guidelines : 1 .
Have sex while as high as possible .
2 . Cleanse the palate between drugs .
It would be scientifically irresponsible to hoof a baggie of gak while in the throes of a ' moody Tuesday ' brought on by Sunday 's ecstasy .
Of course , everything went pear - shaped .
Typically , Erica and I will get it on wherever , whenever , but for the next several weeks , whenever we were together and horny with a couple of hours to spare , the gear would be sitting in the other person 's apartment across town .
I started carrying everything with me at all times .
For a week , I walked the streets of New York like a living sampler plate of narcotic treats .
Still , we could n't get our shit together : whenever I was free , Erica had to work , and vice versa .
All told , I had two months to plan , execute and deliver the assignment .
I ended up doing all five drugs within seventy - two hours .
Observation / Results : Quantify the effects of the experiment .
ViagraAs instructed by my dealer - cum - pharmacist , I cut the dime - sized 100 mg tablet in half and knocked one back with a glass of water .
I knew that Viagra takes twenty - five to forty - five minutes to kick in , so Erica and I sat down to watch American Idol .
Immediate physical reactionAfter twenty minutes , I began to feel queasy and flushed , but I attributed this to Ruben Studdard 's blubbery warblings as much as anything else .
Glancing in the mirror , I saw that my ears and cheeks were rosy .
According to the ' literature ' I 'd downloaded from Pfizer 's website , Viagra 's intended effects are noticeable only once you get an erection .
Because I live in a state of perma-arousal , within a minute or two I had a woody so hard that a cat could n't scratch it .
A little background info : a man experiences different types of erections , from ' the barfly ' to ' the Thumper . '
Viagra had given me a pulsing , monster Thumper .
To say it plain , my dick felt like it was going to explode .
Instantly , I was in that sublime zone between being ridiculously aroused and having to think about Al ' Grandpa Munster ' Lewis on the crapper to keep from shooting my bolt .
Tactile effectOther than the , uh , physical changes , the main difference was mental .
The inherent disconnect between my genitalia and brain widened exponentially .
Penises are often referred to as tools , and that 's exactly what mine felt like  a woodlike , dildonic prosthesis that was being ridden with little emotional or physical input from me .
The experience was strangely effeminizing : for the first time , I was a passive partner during sex , able to fuck without necessarily being turned on or even having my head in the game .
Duration of sexAs expected , intercourse went on for ages .
I could have lasted all night , but at just over two - and - a- quarter hours , a chafed , tired and slightly dazed Erica called time .
I pulled out and she jerked me off over her boobs .
The orgasm was amazing and powerful .
I came a lot .
A whole lot .
Like , something reminiscent of Peter ' Two Quarts ' North .
Erica and I looked at each other aghast as a bovine volume of come showered the general vicinity .
We started cracking up before I was done .
I stopped laughing when the usual refractory period did n't follow  my erection simply would n't go away .
After twenty minutes , I became concerned .
I needed to pee .
Badly .
Ten minutes later , my erection deflated just enough to allow a painful , wildly imprecise squirt .
After that , I returned to a semi - dormant state .
Sensory / mental imagesFor ten minutes while we were screwing , every time I blinked I 'd see large blue dots , about the size of a dinner plate as viewed from three feet away .
I would 've been alarmed , but I had read about this side effect on the Pfizer website earlier .
Apparently , some men have blue - tinted vision for the better part of their experience .
On one hand , that 's alarming .
The upside , I guess , is that you can pretend you 're banging Smurfette .
Assistant 's reaction Erica did n't note major differences in my technique or presentation , other than a red complexion and a slight emotional distance .
Comparison to drug use without sexN / AMushroomsDown the hatchI 'd never actually seen ' shrooms before a small baggie of them appeared on my desk .
Everyone told me that they were ' fun ' but ' tasted like ass . '
Around two o' clock on a Wednesday afternoon , Erica sliced several into a peanut - butter - and - pickle sandwich , which I tried to eat without chewing and almost choked to death .
At her behest , we went outside to wait for things to kick in .
I was told that 's how ' shrooms are best enjoyed  other than at a Dave Matthews gig , of course .
Immediate physical reaction .
We walked down Avenue A and looked in some stores .
I began to feel queasy and in need of air , so we sat down on a bench in Tompkins Square Park .
The nausea subsided , and I began to feel super - chilled - out .
Whenever Erica said something , I thought about it hard , mulled my response carefully and delivered it several seconds afterward .
Sensory / mental imagesAside from a couple of trees in the foreground , the park looked like a piece of stage scenery .
People looked like moving Colorforms that had been stuck on .
It was like somebody turned up the color - and - silly - grin dial on the TV set in my mind .
I watched a bunch of kids run over to a big , jolly man with a shaved head and an entirely tattooed face .
They tried to climb him as if he were a stout oak tree .
His laughter and general charisma were Santa -esque .
He sat down , and his magnetic effect seemed to work on squirrels and birds .
Over his shoulder , a toothless old Latina woman let forth a bloodcurdling , wheezy laugh .
She straddled a much younger man on a bench , and they started making out and dry humping .
A slow - moving police car would idle past , and the woman would temper her movements accordingly .
Shortly thereafter , a pigeon flew into my head and flapped its wings on the side of my face .
I began to understand that weird shit happens in Tompkins Square Park on a Wednesday afternoon , whether you 're on psychedelic drugs or not .
Erica and I retrenched to my apartment .
Tactile effectWe undressed and got into bed , and Erica invited me to watch the room breathe .
I stared at the walls but could n't see it , and wondered aloud why the fuck you would want to do that anyway .
Erica and I began to kiss and writhe around , but strangely enough , sex was the furthest thing from my mind .
The mushrooms I had taken were supposed to be magic , but my penis was looking decidedly shiitake .
Duration of sexErica and I kissed and held each other for fifteen minutes , but I simply had no hydraulic action .
Bah !
Spooning followed .
Assistant 's reaction
In a phrase : shock and awe .
For the first time Erica , witnessed my completely disinterested member .
It did n't bother her too much ; she found it kind of novel to be spooned without getting the ' hot dog in the bun .
'Comparison to drug use without sexN / AMarijuanaFirst , know this : I can't smoke anything .
A mere drag on a cigarette makes me gag .
The only time I really got stoned was when I was eighteen and ingested an insane amount of Moroccan hashish via a cup of ' special hot chocolate . '
After I drank one cup and noticed no difference , the chef cooked me up a more potent brew .
I spent the next four hours alone , vomiting , shivering and firmly under the assumption that I was a piece of black paper cut into a silhouette of a person with red and yellow LEDs running around the perimeter .
Immediate physical reactionBecause of my general ineptitude with pot , I made this a big production number .
Weed : check .
Bowl : check .
Lighter : check .
Condoms : check .
I guess if smoking were more natural to me , things would have gone more smoothly , but Erica even had to coach me in how to toke .
It was embarrassing .
As she prepped the bowl and fired up a lighter , I prepared to inhale .
I tried to tell myself that I was just being a pussy all those years ago , that I could handle it now .
But even the tang of the residue on the porcelain pipe caused my mouth to water and my lower lip to droop in that special , just - about - to - barf way .
I closed my eyes and took a huge drag .
Then I started coughing and could n't stop .
Two minutes later , the hacking subsided and I took another hit .
I did this four times over an eight - minute period .
Erica rolled her eyes and said that with all the huffing and puffing she 'd just witnessed , she 'd guesstimate I was a 6 or 7 on the Harrelson scale .
I relaxed , and a tingly feeling swept over me .
I started screaming , ' I feel high , I feel high !
Quick , get undressed !' and shoved her into the bedroom .
Tactile effectBear in mind that this is only the second time I 've been stoned  EVER .
I felt heavy , like somebody had turned up Earth 's gravitational pull a few notches .
Erica 's skin felt like a soft , warm down comforter , the coziest thing you could imagine .
I wanted to wrap her around myself completely .
She held me as if I were a small child , and we started making out .
The next part is kind of hazy .
From what I can remember , as soon as I entered her and we hit a rhythm , my penis felt like a metal rod , pointed north like a compass .
Previously , whenever I 'd heard the phrase ' time lost its meaning , ' I 'd laughed at the cliché .
But that 's exactly how I 'd describe the sex we had .
Luckily , Erica prompted me to change positions whenever she got bored and / or sore ; otherwise I would have kept banging away , blissed - out and stiff as a board , until the break of dawn .
Sensory / mental imagesAbout two minutes after taking a hit , I experienced visions similar to the ones I had in Morocco , i.e. images of mid-seventies children 's furniture with Muppets ' heads stuck on them .
These appeared like a slide show in my mind , each item scrolling from right to left .
Between the images was infinite darkness .
Occasionally , I 'd see British TV personalities from my early childhood , decked out in mid-to - late - seventies fashions and hairdos .
Strangely , the size of the hair did n't seem to match the size of the wearer , as if he or she were quivering under the weight of it all .
Maybe that 's what the Seventies were like .
I can't really remember .
Duration of sexI 'll say it again : Time lost its meaning .
Erica told me she called time after ninety minutes .
My orgasm took a lot of concentration and arrived with a firework finale of obscure memories I 'd been unwittingly harboring since I was a toddler .
At one point I said to Erica , ' My mind is massive .
' Assistant 's reactionErica was already sleepy when we started .
We had crammed a lot of drugs and sex into the previous twenty - four hours .
If I had n't known better , I 'd have guessed she was stoned too .
Instead , she was taking a rare opportunity to relax  without me pulling her around , trying to induce dirty talk or folding her in half at the waist , she just chilled out while I embarked on my bizarro sex trip to the Carter Administration .
Afterward , she told me that I had seemed ' somewhere else ' during the whole thing , my eyes screwed tight , a bemused expression on my face .
Although she initially found this amusing , she said that after a while it was like being schtupped by a zombie or Tom Ridge .
Comparison to drug use without sexEven though it was much milder , the experience was similar to the last time I got stoned some seven - and - a - half years earlier .
The same mental imagery and heavy feeling were accompanied by  get this !
 a different way of understanding time .
I guess I 'm just really susceptible to pot .
I enjoyed the intensity of the experience , though .
If I could take a hit without coughing up my pelvis , I 'd do it a whole lot more often .
EcstasyI 've never felt horny when taking E. Like everyone else , I just want to hug , talk utter shit to complete strangers , tell them that I love them and then suck their faces .
This time was going to be different : I had an agenda , I was n't at a party , and I was getting paid to do it .
Around three in the afternoon , I popped a pill .
Erica and I drew a bath , climbed into the tub facing each other , and waited for me to get all touchy - feely .
Immediate physical reactionAbout twenty minutes into our soak , I started rolling really hard .
I took a huge sigh , and it felt like my first breath .
I 've never started tripping in the tub before , and part of me ardently believes that , from a health - and - safety perspective , it 's a wholly inadvisable thing to do .
( Ecstasy tends to make your body temperature fluctuate wildly , and , well , there 's the whole drowning thing to consider . )
In truth , however , it felt great .
So great , in fact , that I forgot about that whole time thing again .
I spent the next two hours being more chatty and grindy than I ever have .
The batch of E I bought must have had truth serum and a good amount of speed in it , because I spent much time spewing inner feelings Erica had not been a party to .
Unfortunately , we had tickets for a play in Midtown and had to leave for the theater by seven .
When I stopped yakking for a second and looked at the clock , I was horrified to see that we only had fifty minutes to complete the experiment .
Sensory / mental imagesAs expected , I did n't really feel much like having sex and just wanted to hug .
But being the consummate professional that I am , we dived on the bed and , with Erica watching the clock , started going at it .
Or tried to .
Even though the idea of sex on E was appealing , the simple act of putting skin on skin was more so .
Tactile effectI was having so much fun kissing Erica , I figured I 'd smooch her down below too .
While going down on her , I maneuvered her legs so they were propped over my shoulders and I could feel them running down the length of my back .
My little soldier was somewhat out of the game although a little happier than when I was on the mushrooms .
Forty minutes later , my wang was being wholly uncooperative .
Even a helping hand was n't actually . . . helping .
Assistant 's reaction ' Hurry up ; we 're going to be late .
By the way , did I tell you it 's actually a three - person musical and not really a play ? '
If you 're going to take ecstasy , please have the werewithal not to come down in an overly air - conditioned repertory theatre watching three drama kids sing songs about popcorn at cranium - splitting pitches .
It really sucks .
That said , it 's an effective antidote to feeling lovey - dovey .
I came out of there feeling as mean as cat shit .
CocaineI 'd heard conflicting reports about sex on coke .
Some of my friends who tried it ended up with wieners as stiff as a sock full of porridge .
That said , I once read about this German guy who would snort coke to maintain an erection for long periods of time .
He then decided to inject his penis with a cocaine solution that would give him an all - day erection .
Three days later , his member turned purple , then black , then had to be amputated along with his testicles and all of his fingers and toes .
Other than that , I 'd never really thought about what sex on cocaine could entail .
I mean , I know what I 'm like when I 'm on coke : chatty and teeth grinding .
I guess I 'd always thought that , in theory at least , doing a line off a girl 's ass might be hot .
Immediate physical reactionFeeling a bit James Spaderesque , I chopped out a big line on Erica 's tanned , flat stomach , rolled up a dollar bill and snorted away .
I was immediately familiar with the drug 's bitter taste and subsequent tingle .
I did another line and was pleased not to notice the wilting effect that my friends had experienced .
Tactile effectI 'd never really done anything remotely physical while on coke , aside from some light dancing and animated chatting with anyone who 'd listen .
( Incidentally , an ex once told me that she found a line or two handy while motivating herself to go to the gym . )
After a little while , I became acutely aware that my heart was pounding fiercely .
I did another line off the small of Erica 's back and got behind her .
I was stiffer than a roll of quarters , and I wanted to FUCK HARD .
My heart pounded faster .
I imagined news of my ' pulling an Entwhistle ' being delivered to my editor , and his face ... oh the horror !
Hyper - awareness turned to fear .
After a few minutes of imagining my heart exploding , I decided to let Erica get on top .
Sensory / mental imagesMy eyes were as wide open as they would go .
A mild tremor ran through my body .
I felt the need to anchor myself to Erica .
I gripped her waist as tightly as I could and dug my fingertips so far into her ass cheeks I 'm surprised I did n't leave permanent indents .
I felt kind of nasty , like some awful Wall Street archetype .
I tried to push the image of Gordon Gekko out of my mind , to no avail .
I barked orders , ground my teeth and spoke with my jaw clamped tight , sounding like Miss Hathaway from Beverly Hillbillies .
Assistant 's reactionEnvy and contempt .
This was the drug Erica had the most reservations about .
Of the potpourri of substances she 'd done in the past , coke was her favorite .
In fact , she had a little habit .
Doing gak in front of her was like handcuffing Betty Ford to a case of Crown Royal .
Duration of sexAbout twenty minutes .
With cardiac arrest imminent and Erica licking her lips ravenously , I decided to quit while I was ahead .
Comparison to drug use without sexWhen there are no strangers around to tell you how wonderful your shitty little life is , half of cocaine 's appeal goes right out the window .
Coke jibes well with me in a social setting , but shagging on it was alarming .
I felt disgusted with myself and sorry for putting Erica through it .
Summarize your findings .
Do n't forget to attempt to identify possible variables that could result in different findings for others trying to recreate your test results .
On a purely visceral level , many of the sensations I experienced on these substances were amazing  some of them even made me oblivious to the presence of my girl .
Sex on weed was really quite mind - expanding .
By far , it was the best experience and the one I 'd most like to try again .
It was infinitely more intense than anything else , which came as a surprise , because it seems less demonized by the media and therefore more benign than coke or ecstasy .
The only problem is that doing any drug has the potential to make sex a staged experience .
( This is where Erica 's ex-boyfriend had the advantage over me .
He was a career stoner , so when they got down , chances were he was already baked . )
This experiment made me wonder just what the fuck I was doing all those years , while the other kids were smoking everything but their socks and popping E like Tylenol .
At the grand age of twenty - six , I can't help feeling a bit suburban and long - in - the - tooth .
My peers are either still using drugs occasionally , or else they got over junk the same summer they got over leather jackets with an eight - ball on the back .
Point being , drugs are something almost all of us have dabbled with , used or abused at some time .
In the past , I 've done drugs just for the sake of being on something , and that 's been enough .
But using five different substances to enhance a single activity produced the same result : a heightened sense of self - awareness .
When you strip away your preconceptions of a drug is ' for ' ( i.e. weed for sex , Ecstasy for dancing ) , you realize that they way they affect our minds and bodies is , to a large extent , contextual .
Ultimately , this experiment made me think of drugs not as a ' thrill , ' a ' habit ' or an ' addiction , ' but as a condiment .
Like applesauce with pork or , say , the Captain with Tennille , sex and drugs can be ideal companions , or simply a nightmare compounded .

Earlier this week , we reported that the RIAA had decided to drop a long - standing copyright infringement case against Joan Cassin .
Now we know why : in an e-mail to Ars , the RIAA revealed that it no longer believes Joan was the person on the PC that was allegedly sharing copyrighted music , but that it was someone in her house .
As a result , Warner v. Cassin has been replaced by Warner v. Does 1 - 4 .
Why the Doe designation ?
The RIAA still does n't know who the alleged copyright infringer was , and needs the court 's help to uncover the offender .
In its new complaint ( PDF ) , the RIAA says that while Joan Cassin denies that she infringed on the record labels ' copyrights , she has failed to finger the culprit .
" We recently uncovered evidence in the course of the litigation that another member of Ms. Cassin 's household is likely the infringer , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars .
In his coverage of the new complaint , copyright attorney Ray Beckerman points out that the new lawsuit has been assigned to a different judge and that the RIAA is treating this as an all - new case .
In a letter ( PDF ) to Judge Stephen C. Robinson , Beckerman ( who is one of Joan Cassins ' attorneys ) asks him to recall his order dismissing Warner v. Cassin without prejudice .
Instead , the previous case should be dismissed with prejudice , which would mean that the RIAA would be barred from bringing this new case .
As one might expect , the views of the RIAA and the defendants ' attorneys on how the case should be treated vary widely .
The RIAA is treating this as a brand - new case and claim of copyright infringement , and the new complaint makes no mention of the previous lawsuit .
Beckerman , on the other hand , sees this as the third lawsuit filed over the same claim .
In a conversation with me on Wednesday , he explained that the RIAA 's dismissal of Warner v. Cassin should have been with prejudice , since it's the second time the RIAA has dismissed the same claim ( the first being the original Doe lawsuit the RIAA filed to learn Cassin 's identity ) .
Cassin should therefore be considered the prevailing party and entitled to an attorneys ' fee award .
Beckerman is also asking ( PDF ) the new judge , Charles Brieant , to refer the new case back to Judge Robinson , pointing out that the RIAA walked away from the last case while a motion for dismissal was pending .
His letter to Judge Brieant accuses the RIAA of " forum shopping , " trying to make an end - run around the pending motion for dismissal , and trying to begin discovery ( to learn the identity of the alleged infringer ) in spite of Judge Robinson 's stay .
How the new case plays out depends on how the judges view the assertion that all three of these cases are essentially litigation over the same copyright infringement claim .
If so , then it seems likely that Judge Robinson might consider his previous dismissal and say enough is enough .
The RIAA 's new complaint certainly appears to be closely related to the original Warner v. Cassin and is seeking the same information that it was unable to get in the last case due to the judge 's staying of discovery .
AN ESTIMATED 875 m small arms are in circulation worldwide : one for every seven people on the planet .
Nearly three - quarters of these are owned by civilians .
And about 80 % of those guns in civilian hands are found in just 30 countries , according to the Small Arms Survey , a research group .
Although America accounts for 40 % of firearms in civilian ownership , people put them to more deadly use elsewhere .
The gun murder rate in Colombia and South Africa , for example , is much higher than in America .

A drastic title change may be needed for the much - awaited , new Indiana Jones movie , which comes out next month .
Harrison Ford 's comeback as Steven Spielberg 's swashbuckling , fedora - wearing archaeologist is to be called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
Judging by the spoil - sport findings of the French government 's artistic research centre , revealed yesterday , a more appropriate title might be " Indiana Jones and the Heap of Old Junk " .
Some secrecy surrounds the plot of the fourth movie in the Indiana Jones series , which comes out in America on 22 May .
It is known , however , to be set in 1957 and has an ageing " Indy " battling Soviet agents ( including Kate Blanchett ) for the possession of an ancient Mayan or Aztec crystal skull .
This object purportedly contains secrets brought to Earth from beyond the stars .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Twelve such skulls , carved from solid crystal or quartz , are known to exist .
Three of them are in national museum collections in Britain , the United States and France .
Nine are in private hands .
They have become the subject of feverish speculation by New Age writers about their purported extra-terrestrial origins .
Held at a certain angle , in a certain light , it is suggested , the skulls become crystal balls which reveal the unmistakeable outline of a flying saucer .
According to one version of events , the 12 skulls – and a missing 13th sister skull – must be lined up or piled in a pyramid on or before the last day in the Mayan calendar , 21 December 2012 .
Otherwise the globe will fly off its axis .
Doubts about the authenticity of the skulls as Aztec or Mayan artefacts have existed for years .
The British Museum , which owns one example , concluded 11 years ago that its skull had probably been polished by a wheeled machine .
The pre-Colombian civilisations on the American continents discovered many things , but not the wheel .
( Ah well , say the New Age theorists , the Mayans may not have had the wheel .
The beings from outer space obviously did . )
The " French skull " , acquired by the French state from a bankrupt collector in 1878 , is now in the hands of the Musée Quai Branly , the excellent new museum of non-Western art beside the Eiffel Tower .
Because of the interest inspired by the Spielberg film , the French national museum service 's research and restoration centre , C2RMF , decided a few months ago to subject the crystal skull to the most advanced forms of analysis , including " particle induced X - ray emission and Raman spectroscopy " .
The centre 's official report will be published next week but the principal findings were released yesterday by the Quai Branly museum .
The " French skull " was probably made in a small village in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century .
The quartz from which it is made is of Alpine , not Central American , origin .
The pre-Colombian origin of the " French skull " , and probably several of the others , was almost certainly concocted by the French adventurer and antique merchant , Eugène Boban , who sold it to a wealthy French collector in 1875 .
" The grooves and perforations [ on the skull ] clearly show the use of jewellery drills and other modern tools , " said Yves Le Fur , the deputy head of collections at the Quai Branly .
" It is inconceivable that such precision was the work of pre-Colombian artists . "
The Musée du Quai Branly intends nonetheless to place its skull – only four inches tall – on special exhibition from 20 May to coincide with the appearance of the Indiana Jones film .
The skull will be " hidden " in the museum and visitors will be invited to follow clues to try to locate it .
French museum directors have , it seems , learnt a thing or two about spin - off tourism since the film The Da Vinci Code .
The directors of the Louvre were , initially , aghast at the absurd and wilful errors made in Dan Brown 's best - selling thriller and the subsequent film .
They later relented and arranged Da Vinci Code tours of the museum .
Doubts about the authenticity of Aztec or Mayan crystal skulls have recently been posted on archaeology.org , the website of the Archeological Institute of America .
Jane MacLaren Walsh , an anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and a leading authority on pre-Colombian art , traces the strange history of the skulls and the legends which have come to surround them .
The largest of the skulls , almost 10 inches high , larger than a human head , was sent anonymously to the Smithsonian in 1992 .
The disturbing , milky - white sculpture came with an unsigned letter .
" This Aztec crystal skull ... was purchased in Mexico in 1960 .
I am offering it to the Smithsonian without consideration , " it said .
" Crystal skulls have undergone serious scholarly scrutiny , but they also excite the popular imagination because they seem so mysterious , " Ms Walsh says .
" Some believe the skulls are the handiwork of the Maya or Aztecs , but they have also become the subject of constant discussion on occult websites .
Some insist that they originated on a sunken continent or in a far - away galaxy .
They are intensely loved today by a large coterie of ageing hippies and New Age devotees . "
Ms Walsh points the initial finger of blame at Boban .
Several allegedly Mexican crystal skulls turned up in Europe after France intervened in the Mexican civil war in 1863 to install Maximilian von Hapsburg as emperor .
Two skulls were exhibited by Boban at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867 after he served as the ill - fated Maximilian 's official archaeologist .
Boban went to Mexico as a teenager and learned Spanish and the Aztec language , Nahuatl .
He seems to have had a genuine passion for pre-Colombian history and culture but he also had to make a living .
He opened an antiquities business in Paris , which is known to have mingled genuine artefacts with the dubious and the downright fake .
He later moved his business to New York .
The celebrated Manhattan jewellers Tiffany and Co bought an " Aztec " crystal skull from Boban for $ 950 in 1881 .
The British Museum purchased it a decade later at the same price .
This skull remains in the museum 's collections in Bloomsbury but is now presented as being " probably " a fake .
Enter another generation of experts , fakers or fantasists , this time British .
In 1934 , Sidney Burney , a London art dealer , bought a crystal skull almost identical to the one in the British Museum .
In 1943 , it was sold through Sotheby 's to the British explorer and writer Frederick Arthur Mitchell - Hedges .
He later claimed to have discovered the skull at a Mayan site in Belize ( then British Guyana ) .
In his autobiography , Danger My Ally , in 1954 , he said that the skull was " at least 3,600 years old and according to legend was used by the High Priest of the Maya when performing esoteric rites .
It is said that , when he willed death with the help of the skull , death invariably followed . "
The object , sometimes called the Skull of Doom , was owned for 60 years by his daughter , Anna Mitchell - Hodges , until her death last year .
She sometimes charged a fee to look at it .
The Skull of Doom is an especial favourite with New Age theorists .
It is said to glow with a blue light and to crash any computer hard drive which comes near to it .
One of the New Age skull theories holds that the skulls are , in all probability , an very advanced form of extra-terrestrial computer .
" Although nearly all of the crystal skulls have at times been identified as Aztec , Toltec , Mixtec or occasionally Maya , they do not reflect the artistic or stylistic characteristics of any of these cultures , " Ms Walsh , the Smithsonian anthropologist , points out .
She believes that some of the earlier skulls were faked in Mexico in the 19th century .
Others probably came from Europe .
The " Skull of Doom " was probably a fake of one of these fakes .
Her findings tally almost exactly with those of the French museums ' research centre , C2RMF .
This agency , run by the Louvre , establishes the identity of disputed art works and explores old artistic techniques .
It is regarded as the most advanced organisation of its kind in the world .
The centre states " with a reasonable degree of certainty " that the " French " skull at the Quai Branly and the " British " skull in the British Museum came from the village of Idar - Oberstein in southern Germany .
The village is known to have specialised in making similar objects as bases for crucifixes in the period 1867 to 1886 .
This would explain why the " French " skull has identical - sized holes at top and bottom .
Analysis of the quartz used in the skull has identified the material as of Alpine origin .
The British Museum skull is believed to have used Brazilian quartz .
From the Alps or Brazil to Mexico by flying saucer is just a short hop , all the same .
Could extra-terrestrial makers of the skulls not have shared the same skills as 19th - century German artisans ?
We will probably never know .
Legends surrounding crystal skulls have become a staple subject of science fiction novels and video games , as well as New Age theories about the extra-terrestrial history of mankind .
A central legend , according to the Quai Branly , goes as follows .
The 12 known skulls represent the 12 " worlds " , or planets , which were once inhabited by mankind .
Of these , the planet Earth , was the youngest .
The " Itzas " , the ancient people from other planets , brought the skulls to Earth to convey their knowledge to humans .
A 13th skull was manufactured on Earth and all were kept in a great pyramid by successive civilisations in Central America , the Olmecs , the Mayas and finally the Aztecs , who foolishly lost or dispersed them .
Some aspect of this legend will provide the plot for the new movie .
It seems that Spielberg , the director , and Ford , the star , had severe doubts about mystic , crystal skulls as the story line for the new Indiana Jones story , the first to appear since 1989 .
One of the reasons for the long delay , according to Hollywood gossip , is that Spielberg and Ford hated the skulls idea , put forward by George Star Wars Lucas , who wrote the script .
But after a dozen re-writes , they were brought around .
Will the new findings of French artistic scientists send Spielberg and Ford into a fit of despair ?
Hardly .
The previous Indiana Jones movies were far from historical documentaries but they were amongst the most popular adventure films ever made .
The success of The Da Vinci Code suggests that it takes more than a few inconvenient facts to spoil a good story .
" In one sense these are enchanted objects , even if they are fakes , " said Yves Le Fur of the Musée Quai Branly .
" No doubt the Indiana Jones film will generate a whole new series of legends . "
Iran missiles were ' old equipment ' but tensions remain high
Iran 's missile tests earlier this week did n't demonstrate any new capabilities and may not have included the long - range missile Iran claims among those launched , a US official said .
The test caused widespread immediate criticism from an international community wary of the country 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , but further analysis from experts shows that Iran 's claims of long - range missiles were " old equipment , " the Associated Press reported .
" Iran frequently exaggerates the capability of its missiles , and it appears it is continuing that tradition with this week 's tests , " said David Wright , co-director of the Union 's Global Security Program .
Independent national security blog ArmsControlWonk.com analyzed the video of the missile launches posted by the Iranian government and found no evidence to suggest the missiles had the long - range the country claimed .
In a post titled " Same old Boring Shahab 3 , " the blog said the missiles were no different from knockoffs of a North Korean missile obtained by Iran in 1998 .
Israel is as close as 650 miles to Iran and the Shahab missile has a known range of 746 miles , according to the site .
Iran made a similarly false claim during a February missile launch , according to the Union of Concerned Scientists , a Washington , D.C. arms control advocacy think tank .
The missile test proved to be misleading in more ways than one .
After many prominent news organizations including The Los Angeles Times , The Chicago Tribune , The Financial Times and many Web sites used the same photo of Iran 's missile launch , Agence France Presse removed the photo from its site saying that it was " apparently digitally altered , " The New York Times reported .
The photo showed four missiles being launched , but examinations by several experts quoted in an Agence France Presse story show the fourth as a composite from two other missiles in the photograph .
US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice warned that America would defend its allies with a missile shield , a statement denounced Friday by Russia , Reuters reported .
The missile test sent oil prices to a new record of $ 147 a barrel , and gold futures surged to their highest levels since mid-March .

2. Options for the Blades
It is advisable to look for some options for your blade .
Quite a number of quality electric razors feature at least three blade options .
The more blade options you have , the closer and smoother shave you will eventually get .
Moreover , top - notch electric razors also come with a pop-out trimmer as a standard feature .
3. Battery Life
Ideally , it is highly recommended that you buy an electric razor that can both be used independently via a battery and at other times , it can be plugged into a power source .
Picking one with only one option may lead to some sort of inconvenience at one point .
An ideal battery should be able to operate for a minimum of 1 hour without a cord .
Bottom Line
All the aforementioned electric razors offer excellent service in addition to enjoying good consumer rating online .
However , not all of them will suit your needs .
Settle for one which best serves you .
What do you think of when you hear the phrase ' white working class ' ?
Tattoos ?
Dangerous dogs ?
Shellsuits ?
Scratch cards ?
Chips ?
Binge drinking ?
The BNP ?
It would be no surprise if the images conjured are negative ; in the past four decades , the image of the white working class has gone from hero to less than zero .
In these tolerant days , the one underprivileged group that it 's OK to find intolerable is the white working class .
In our multicultural society , they 're the unlucky ones deemed to be without a culture .
Last year , for example , the editor of Eastern Eye went on television to condemn Channel 4 for allowing ' illiterate chavs ' on to Celebrity Big Brother .
Eyelids remained unbatted .
Trevor Phillips was not called upon to issue a statement .
The Sky News presenter to whom this comment was made simply nodded his head in silent agreement .
But it was n't always open season on proletarian whites .
Back in the late Fifties and early Sixties , the working class was flavour of the decade .
Films such as Saturday Night , Sunday Morning found something noble , if harsh , in the condition of the indigenous poor .
The theatre was filled with angry young men with earthy accents railing against the class structure .
Pop music was transformed by cocky lads from humble backgrounds , as were photography and advertising .
A working - class hero was something to be , as the only middle - class Beatle , John Lennon , later sardonically sang .
And then , almost overnight , white and working class became a deeply unfashionable combination .
That list of cliches I suggested at the beginning nowadays regularly features in film and TV drama as shorthand for ' white trash ' .
And even in the case of original art , such as the photographer Richard Billingham 's Ray 's a Laugh series or Paul Abbott 's Shameless ( in both cases , significantly , the artists come from the background they document ) , the characters can't quite transcend the squalor of their setting .
For all their spirit and spirits , there 's something resigned , if not quite hopeless , about the Gallaghers in Shameless
There is also , of course , EastEnders , an ersatz version of a vanished east London , in which the cast are simple ciphers for politically correct issues , with some domestic histrionics thrown in for drama 's sake .
I could go on but , nah , leave it , it ai n't werf it .
Back in the Sixties , there was a nobility to the working class and also , crucially , a mobility .
It was on the way somewhere .
But that optimism has gone .
Those who could get out have left , joining an expanded middle class , and those left behind have become the underclass : ugly , obnoxious , feckless and amoral .
Not untypical in this regard is the stepfather in White Girl , a drama that forms part of next week 's BBC2 season on the white working class .
He 's a drug - dealing , wife - battering , shaven - headed , racist psycho , with a hint of paedophilia for good measure .
The only way out for his illiterate , alcoholic , racist wife and scowling stepdaughter is the benign sanctuary of that well - known religion of female liberation : Islam .
Every Muslim in the play , written by Abi Morgan , is polite , considerate and possessed of saintly forbearance .
Quick thought experiment : can you imagine the reverse scenario being presented in a TV play ?
Zen chavs and vicious , uncouth Muslims ?
The season , says the BBC , ' explores the complex mix of feelings that lead some white working - class people to say they feel under siege and as if their very sense of self is being brought into question . '
Cue Union Jacks fluttering wistfully in bleak suburban winds .
But there 's nothing complex about White Girl and it will do little to ease that sense of siege .
So determined is it to bring the white working - class sense of self into question that its answer is a conservative and sexist religion .
In this sense , the play exemplifies the changed attitude that the liberal arts community has shown towards disadvantaged whites since the Seventies .
It was around then that ethnic groups began to gain priority in artistic sympathy and poor whites became the sinners more often than the sinned against .
Perhaps you could trace the decisive moment to Enoch Powell 's infamous 1968 speech , which is revisited in the documentary Rivers of Blood .
An intelligent attempt to unpick the truth from the legend , Denys Blakeway 's film reminds us of the working - class backing for Powell , which saw dockers and meatpackers marching in his support .
On some atavistic level , immigration was perceived as a threat to identity .
There are many reasons to dismiss this fear as ignorant nonsense , but in a cultural and , indeed , artistic sense , there seems little doubt that the white working class has subsequently suffered an identity crisis .
You can see it in the content of this season - there 's nothing celebratory here - and you can see it in the bemused , uncertain faces that populate Marc Isaacs 's documentary All White in Barking and Henry Singer 's Last Orders , a film about the decline of the Wibsey Working Men 's Club near Bradford .
An atmosphere of displacement , or impending obsolescence , hangs over these communities , as if they 've lost their purpose .
There will be those who will put the whole malaise down to politics and economics - ' It 's all Thatcher 's fault ! ' - but close observation reveals something else in these films .
In All White in Barking , a white woman working in a traditional butcher 's going out of business is asked whether she 'd eat pig 's ears .
It 's obvious that she 's repelled by the thought , but she also knows that it 's wrong to express a critical opinion about another culture 's tastes , so she timidly says that she does n't eat much meat .
There 's a lot of this kind of doubt and prevarication , which may be an improvement on crass racism but does n't exactly signify self - confidence .
The exception is an ageing character named Dave , gruff , opinionated and a supporter of the BNP .
He 's as unrepentant as he is unenlightened and yet there is an admirable , even charming , candour to his manner .
At least he does n't pretend to be what he is n't .
Dave has a half - black grandson from one of his daughters and his other daughter is going out with a boy with African blood .
He obviously adores his children and grandchild , but he moves to Canvey Island to get away from non-whites and immigrants .
There , he stands on the grim Essex beach vainly trying to hold back the tide of history .
Yet in Dave 's story , we see , even if he can't , the hidden success of multicultural Britain .
Not the tolerance and respect for separatism as preached by archbishops and playwrights , but the messy , difficult and tense business of living and loving together .
It 's the children of people such as Dave who live cheek by jowl with new arrivals and adapt to rapid change .
They are the ones who really embrace people from other countries and cultures by forming relationships and raising children together .
Meanwhile , the liberal arts community , for all its eloquence in anti-racism , is far more inclined to retreat to private schools and affluent enclaves , the better to maintain a homogenous culture while pronouncing on the benefits of diversity .
It 's fitting , therefore , that it 's the BBC that 's screening this season .
For it was that progressive home of liberal arts that Greg Dyke , the former director general , so tellingly described as ' hideously white ' .

Welcome to the official homepage of HITBSecConf2008 - Malaysia .
The main aim of our conference is to enable the dissemination , discussion and sharing of deep knowledge network security information .
Presented by respected members of both the mainstream network security arena as well as the underground or black hat community , our events routinely highlight new and ground - breaking attack and defense methods that have not been seen or discussed in public before .
HITBSecConf2008 - Malaysia will be our 6th conference in Malaysia and is expected to attract over 1000 attendees from around the Asia Pacific region and from around the world .
This year ’s event will also see the introduction of a third track to our conference program called the HITB Labs .
These new hands - on sessions are designed to give attendees a closer and deeper understanding of various security issues from physical security bypass methods to the security of RFID and other wireless based technologies .
HITBSecConf2008 - Malaysia will also see our highly popular team - based hacking competition known as Capture The Flag .
First developed and presented at Defcon in the US , the idea behind a CTF competition is to allow for teams of three to hack into prepared servers running in order to retrieve marked files or flags on these target machines .
Participants will also be required to defend their systems from attack .
Teams will be judged on both their defensive as well as the offensive game play .
We believe HITBSecConf is an ideal platform for leading network security vendors to not only meet with some of the leading network security specialists but to also showcase their own technology and solutions with the public as well .

You need your own separate supercomputer to track the lies and ever - changing positions coming out of these people .
After telling us for weeks that Hillary is really ahead in the popular vote ( she ’s not ) , now the campaign is saying that popular vote does n’t matter , delegates matter .
And they ’re saying that Obama is ahead in delegates .
So , why are they still here ?
It sounds to me like Clinton ’s campaign thinks that somehow , after this coming Saturday , they ’re going to miraculously overtake Obama in delegates , so now they ’re again making the delegates argument .
But they ’re not going to overtake him in delegates .
The only way they can do that is if the superdelegates overrule the votes of millions of Democratic voters .
Fat chance of that .
Not to mention , it would be rather hilarious for Hillary to now be arguing ( and she is , and has been for a while ) that every vote counts , only to then be urging elite party leaders in Washington to overturn all of those voters she just “ fought ” for .

The team scanned a cast of Bach 's skull to build this picture
It is believed that only one portrait he sat for still exists .
However , forensic artists at the university built up a picture of his appearance using a bronze cast of his skull and documents from the time .
The face will go on display at the Bachhaus museum in Bach 's hometown of Eisenach next month .
' Accurate picture '
Dr Caroline Wilkinson , from the Centre for Forensic and Medical Art , explained how they worked out the composer 's features .
" We carried out a laser scan of the skull which allowed us to recreate the musculature and skin of the face on our computer system , " she said .
" By assessing the bone structure we can determine facial morphology and produce an accurate picture of his facial appearance . "
The team then used an existing portrait of Bach , and documents which described how his eye problems caused swollen eyelids , to start texturing the face .
Dr Wilkinson said : " This is really the most complete face that can be built from the available reliable information .
" As far as we can ascertain , this is how Bach would have looked . "
Director of the Bachhaus Eisenach , Joerg Hansen , said : " People are interested in what he looked like , they have busts of Bach on the piano .
The traditional image of Johann Sebastian Bach
" It 's always this old man with a wig type of image we have in mind when we hear the name or think of how he looked .
" I think it is interesting for fans to have something else , a real person . "
Mr Hansen told the BBC Scotland news website that some people had suggested the face looks Scottish , although he believes it has the features of those you meet in Eisenach .
" It 's very dynamic , as if he 's going to come up with something .
That is , I think , quite fitting , " he said .
" He has this furrow over the nose , which makes him look , maybe , a bit angry , or easy to anger .
" Caroline Wilkinson actually explained to me that had nothing to do with the character at all , it 's determined by the skull .
" If you have that type of skull you have to furrow over the nose .
" But I also think he looks interesting . "

Cutting open a person for surgery using a plain old scalpel seems pretty barbarian compared to this new cutting tool from Peak .
Instead of a sharp metal edge , or even an electrosurgical cutter , the Plasmablade uses pulses of plasma generated around its tip to locally cut and cauterize flesh such as skin , fat and muscle .
It has the advantages of not damaging nearby tissue since its generated heat remains short term and local , and there 's less ... uh ... smoke to worry about than with electrosurgical tools .
If you can stomach the idea , there 's a pretty graphic demo video of the blade in action .
Just do n't be eating while you watch .

Appeals court sets back White House 's secrecy efforts
A federal appeals court on Friday set back the White House 's efforts to keep the names of its visitors secret .
The Washington court threw out the government 's appeal in the case in which a watchdog group is trying to find out how often prominent religious conservatives visited the White House and Vice President Dick Cheney 's residence .
Despite the ruling against the White House , the decision does not necessarily mean that visitor logs will be subject to public disclosure .
The White House can still raise a variety of legal arguments in an attempt to keep the identities of White House visitors secret .
But appeals court Judge David Tatel said the document request from the private group is narrowly drawn and can be processed .
The document request from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington would not require the president , Cheney or their staffs to sort through mountains of files , said Tatel .
The burden " should prove minimal , " Tatel added .
The case now goes back to U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth , who ruled that White House visitor logs are public documents subject to disclosure requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
The Bush administration argued that releasing those documents would trample on the president 's right to seek private , confidential advice .
White House calendars are not normally considered public , but Lamberth said logs maintained by the Secret Service are not covered by that exemption .
I have the matching ottomans to that couch .
I covered them , but if you want them back , call me !
Also , did n't someone crack a joke about this yesterday in the Olsen twins thread ?
If one of THEM can't hide in a cushion , I doubt a full size dude can !
People should n't eat more than 100mg of glycyrrhizic acid a day
It follows the case of a 56 - year - old woman who was admitted to hospital after overdosing on liquorice .
The woman from Yorkshire went into muscle failure , a potentially fatal condition , after eating too much Pontefract cake .
Writing in the Postgraduate Medical Journal , doctors said she had been eating the liquorice sweets to relieve chronic constipation .
Dangerous condition
" She had been eating a packet of sweets a day , about 200g , " said Dr Raja Hussain of Pontefract General Infirmary .
" Her potassium levels were dangerously low and her muscles were very weak .
She also had high blood pressure , which is dangerous because it can lead to stroke . "
Liquorice is good for you in moderation
Sinead O'Hara ,
Royal Homeopathic Hospital London
" She was up and walking about within four days , " Dr Hussain told BBC News Online .
The active ingredient in liquorice , glycyrrhizic acid , is found in a variety of products , including herbal remedies .
Manufacturers claim it can relieve constipation , cold , flu and allergy symptoms and may even help people with chronic fatigue or ulcers .
It is also found in smaller quantities in confectionery , toothpaste and some herbal teas .
Cigarette and drugs manufacturers sometimes use it to improve the taste of their products .
Some brands of chewing gum can contain 24mg of glycyrrhizic acid while some herbal teas can contain up to 450 mg per litre .
A report by the European Commission published earlier this year suggested that people should not consume any more than 100mg of glycyrrhizic acid a day .
Studies have shown that it can increase blood pressure or cause muscle weakness and chronic fatigue .
Other problems include headaches or swelling .
Recent research suggested it can also lower testosterone levels in men , affecting their mood and sex drive .
" Like everything else , liquorice is good for you in moderation , " said Sinead O'Hara , principal pharmacist at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital .
" But too much of it is quite toxic . "
Haribo , one of the companies that manufacture Pontefract cake , said people should n't eat too much of it .
" Haribo advises , as with any other food , liquorice products should be eaten in moderation , " said marketing manager Christian Freund .

は雑音を下げることで本当にしたいことを明らかにする」というテーマにつながっています。
また、 「携帯電話は無実」という第４回の奥様のコメントは、第５回の
GTD が人生の深い問題点を明らかにするときも、システムそれ自体は無実だという話題に接続します。
この原稿でも紹介しきれなかったいろいろな話題が出てきて、David Allen という人は実践者であり、哲学者でもある、実にバランスのとれた人なのだと思いました。
今回のインタビューを行なうにあたっては、David と Merlin の対談シリーズ Productive Talk と、David の Google での講演 、Webworker Daily でのインタビューなど、数多くの対談を参考にして、そこでの質問はあらかじめ頭に叩き込んでから聞きに行きました。
また、せっかく日本に来ているのだから、日本的なことも聞いてみたいなと思って、それで第１回目の話題になったわけです。
英語的には厳しいツッコミを入れられず甘いインタビューになってしまいましたが、「GTD と価値観ベースの仕事術との関係」という、今までのインタビューが引き出さなかった答えを引き出せたことは自分にとって満足な成果でした。インタビュー初めてにしては上出来でしょうか？
David には今後ともメールなどでやりとりをしたいと思っていますので、日本発の
GTD の質問などお寄せいただければいろいろ聞く機会もあると思います。
From well before Biblical times , man has told amazing tales of giants .
The likelihood of seeing a true giant was so slim that they have always been a part of folklore .
But , thanks to modern record keeping and photography , we can now all see first hand , true living giants .
This is a list of the top 10 , ordered from shortest to tallest .
Now giants were upon the earth in those days .
For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men , and they brought forth children , these are the mighty men of old , men of renown .
Genesis 6:4
10 Bernard Coyne 8’2 ″
Coyne was born in 1897 in Iowa , USA .
His 1918 World War I draft card listed his height as 8 feet .
His Guinness book of records entry states that he was refused entry to the war due to his height .

He is buried in his place of birth in a specially made extra-large coffin .
9 Väinö Myllyrinne 8’3 ″
Myllyrinne was born in Finland in 1909 .
At one point he was officially the world ’s tallest man .
At the age of 21 he was 7 feet 3.5 inches tall , and weighed 31 stone .
He experienced another growth spurt after that which took him to his final height of 8 feet 3 inches .
He is considered to be the tallest soldier in history as he was in the Finnish army .
He died in 1963 .

She toured as a side - show freak until she died of tuberculosis in 1913 .
6 Al Tomaini 8 ’4.5 ″
Al Tomaini was a giant who claimed a height of 8 ’ 4 ″ ( though the Guiness Book of Records stated that he was 7 ’ 4 ″ ) .
Weighing 356 pounds ( 162 kg ) and wearing size 27 shoes , Al spent most of his life as a circus giant .
He was working with a circus at the Great Lakes Exposition in Chicago , in 1936 , when he met his future wife , Jeanie Tomaini .

He beats John Rogan to the second spot on this list by a mere 1 / 4 of an inch .
Interestingly his mother was also a giant , at 7 ’ 2 ″ .
According to his death certificate from Mendocino State Hospital , at the time of death he was 9 ’ 2 ″ – if this is true then he is the tallest recorded human – beating our number 1 spot by 3 inches .
He is buried in Montana .
1 Robert Wadlow 8 ′ 11.1 ″

He was born in 1918 , the oldest of five children .
He died at the age of 22 from an infection caused by a blister on his ankle , which he got while making a professional appearance at the National Forest Festival .
His coffin weighed half a ton and required 12 pallbearers to carry .
He was buried in a vault of solid concrete as his family had fears that his body would be interfered with by curiosity seekers .
Notable Extras : Gabriel Estêvão Monjane 8 ’1 ″ , Zeng Jinlian 8 ’1.75 ″
The global food price crisis is exposing frightening levels of vulnerability in poor nations around the world .
Yet these are countries into which the rich world , for half a century or more , has diverted hundreds of billions of dollars of humanitarian aid in pursuit of the high ideal of ending poverty .
It is a good moment to take stock and ask what went wrong .
Compare two of the most vulnerable economies , Haiti and Botswana .
In Haiti , spiralling food prices have in recent months prompted widespread rioting , claiming the lives of six people and forcing the resignation of the prime minister .
This unrest has set back the search for political stability in an archetypal " fragile state " .
No such riots have occurred in the Southern African nation of Botswana .
In a country that imports 90 per cent of its food , soaring prices have undoubtedly hurt the poor , but the state has the money and capacity to help them cope .
Why does Haiti sink while Botswana swims ?
A landlocked state with a small population and an arid landscape , Botswana has a high dependence on diamonds - the very " curse of wealth " that has destabilised many other African countries .
At independence in 1966 , it had just two secondary schools and 12 km of paved road , and relied on the UK for half of government revenues .
Botswana ought to be a basket case .
But Botswana has become Africa 's most enduring success story .
Its GDP per capita has risen a hundredfold since independence .
Over the past three decades it has been the world 's fastest - growing economy .
It negotiated hard - fought deals for its diamonds with De Beers and used the royalties well .
It has throughout remained one of sub -Saharan Africa 's few non-racial democracies , despite being bordered ( and occasionally invaded ) by racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia .
The secret of Botswana 's success lies in politics .
The country 's elite come from a single dominant ethnic group ( the Batswana ) whose governance systems , emphasising broad consultation and consensus - building , emerged largely unscathed from colonialism .
Botswana 's leading human rights activist calls it " gentle authoritarianism " .
The government broke every rule in the so - called Washington consensus , setting up state - owned companies , nationalising mineral rights and steering the economy via six - year national development plans .
" We are a free - market economy that does everything by planning , " one local academic told me , laughing .
In the second half of the 20th century , dozens of developing countries emulated Botswana 's success and achieved similar growth rates .
" Getting the politics right " was key for them all .
These countries have built effective states that guarantee the rule of law , ensure a healthy and educated population , control their national territories and create a positive environment for investment , growth and trade .
For many , the growth spurt began with the redistribution of land and other assets .
This story bears little relation to the cruder theories of development advanced by rich - country governments or , for that matter , some NGOs .
Yet , getting the politics right really can " make poverty history " .
Aid alone cannot .
In many countries the state remains a work in progress and the rosy picture is not without flaws .
Power battles and shifting alliances mean reverses are frequent .
Raw power and gangsterism prevail in states that are more master than servant to their citizens .
In his novel Nineteen Eighty - Four , written at the onset of the Cold War , George Orwell portrayed a totalitarian state built around the cult of Big Brother : " If you want a picture of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face - for ever . "
In the 20th century , some 170 million people were killed by their own governments , four times the number killed in wars between nations .
But the worse deprivation and suffering now are not Orwellian in nature .
They exist where states are weak : half of all children who die before the age of five live in states defined as " fragile " .
Fixing this is not easy , but it can be done .
Some states once branded as " failing " provide evidence .
Malaysia went within a few decades from a post - independence meltdown of ethnic rioting to an industrial powerhouse .
The economist Ha -Joon Chang points to his own country , South Korea , from where , in the 1960s , government officials were sent by the World Bank to Pakistan and the Philippines to " learn about good governance " .
The pupil swiftly outstripped the master .
If you define development merely as rising GDP per capita , then the story almost ends there - effective states create the basis for rapid growth .
But development , parti cularly tackling poverty , is about far more than that .
When the World Bank , in an unprecedented exercise , asked 64,000 poor people around the world about their lives , what emerged was a complex and human account of poverty , encompassing issues that are often ignored in the academic literature : the importance of being able to give one 's children a good start in life , the mental anguish that poverty brings .
The overall conclusion was that , " again and again , powerlessness seems to be at the core of the bad life " .
Tackling such powerlessness is not just about election campaigns and government .
Building " power within " - for example , women 's assertiveness to insist on their right not to be beaten in the home - and " power with " - in the form of collective organisation - is essential to achieving the wider empowerment that transforms politics and societies .
In 1900 , New Zealand was the only country with a government elected by all its adult citizens .
By the end of the century , despite severe reversals , including fascism and communism , and succeeding waves of military coups against elected governments , there were ostensibly 120 electoral democracies in place .
Democracies are often flawed and , as we have seen in several African countries , progress is reversible , but the overall trend remains positive .
Successful transformations
Effective states in east Asia and elsewhere have typically taken off under autocracies .
In Latin America , active social movements and political organisations have rarely been accompanied by effective states .
Does this mean active citizenship and efficient governments are mutually exclusive ?
Happily , the evidence suggests that the " Asian values " argument for benign dictatorship , once espoused by leaders in Singapore and Mal aysia , is wrong .
A recent survey by the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik found that democracies produce more predictable long - run growth rates , greater short - term stability and more equality , and are better able to handle economic shocks .
Many of the countries that have had active citizens and been run efficiently have already ceased to be poor and disappeared off the development radar .
Some of the most successful transformations in the past century , such as those of Sweden and Finland , have been triggered by social pacts within a democracy , showing what the combination of activism and good government can achieve .
Yet , though this combination is at the heart of development , it is seldom acknowledged in debates about the " development industry " , typified by international institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF .
Here , economic policy is king , and politics is often seen as an irritating process through which unworthy individuals use their power to unravel the plans of wise economists .
" Getting the prices right " requires the state to get out of economic management , freeing the stage for the true heroes of development : the entrepreneurs .
It has n't worked .
The retreat of the state in Latin America , once a faithful devotee of Washington consensus prescriptions , failed to lead to lasting progress .
Meanwhile , countries such as China and Vietnam , which maintained a central role for the state , prospered .
The importance of politics in development will only grow .
The world is entering a new age of scarcity , in which food , water and carbon are rationed , either explicitly , through regulation , or implicitly , by price .
In this environment , conflicts over access to basic resources are bound to intensify .
Politics and power will decide who gets what .
All this poses challenges to the $ 100bn global development industry .
Official donors such as the UK's Department for International Development are trying to reassess their thinking to understand better the role of politics in development .
But they face a dilemma : any outside body , especially a government institution , interferes with domestic politics in developing countries at its peril .
To get round this , there is always a temptation to turn political issues into technical ones - for example , by focusing on " governance " or " institution - building " .
But , by failing to confront issues of power , such approaches often give rise to the same frustrations as those that focus on economic policy : why wo n't these countries do what 's good for them ?
From grass roots to government
International organisations such as Oxfam have long been criticised by some developing - country partner organisations for preferring policy to politics .
But they face real limits .
Charity law , mission and bitter experience should dissuade them from becoming mere support groups for any political party in a given developing country .
Instead , they have to promote empowerment without becoming politicised .
It is a fine line to tread , but it is eminently feasible .
In Bolivia , for example , 20 years of support for the Chiquitano Indians helped them move from semi-slavery to becoming a political force , with the founding of indigenous people 's organisations , such as that led by José Bailaba , and the election of Chiquitano mayors and senators .
Following the election of South America 's first indigenous president , Evo Morales , a land reform bill gave the Chiquitanos rights to a million hectares of traditional lands .
Even though the alchemy of development takes place primarily in the crucible of effective states with active citizens , global institutions such as aid donors , the UN and transnational corporations play a significant role .
Nation states will not wither away , even if their actions are constrained by an ever - growing web of global and regional trade agreements , bilateral investment treaties and the proliferating " soft law " of international conventions and codes of conduct on everything from financial services to human rights .
Rich - country governments and their citizens need to ensure that this system of global government supports national development efforts based on the state and its people working together .
They must also deter powerful countries and corporations from doing harm , whether through paying bribes or imposing policies that hurt the poor .
The fight against poverty , inequality and environmental collapse will define the 21st century , as the fight against slavery or for universal suffrage defined earlier eras .
It is hard to imagine a more worthwhile cause .

Back in 2006 , I proposed that Google should build a network neutrality detector , a distributed toolbar that collected statistics from millions of nodes on the net to determine sneaky traffic - fiddling by sleazy ISPs who only make a best - effort attempt to give you the stuff you request if they 've been bribed to do so .
Well , now they 've done it !
Or at least , they 've announced it .
The one thing I hope is that they give you the option to submit statistics anonymously , without forcing you to be logged into Google .
Google has been very vocal on its stance for net neutrality .
Now , Richard Whitt–Senior Policy Director for Google–announces that Google will take an even more active role in the debate by arming consumers with the tools to determine first - hand if their broadband connections are being monkeyed with by their ISPs : " We 're trying to develop tools , software tools … that allow people to detect what 's happening with their broadband connections , so they can let [ ISPs ] know that they 're not happy with what they 're getting — that they think certain services are being tampered with , " Google senior policy director Richard Whitt said this morning during a panel discussion at Santa Clara University , an hour south of San Francisco .

In the strange world of Israeli academia , an Arab college lecturer is being dismissed from his job because he refused to declare his " respect for the uniform of the Israeli army . "
The bizarre demand was made of Nizar Hassan , director of several award - winning films , after he criticized a Jewish student who arrived in his film studies class at Sapir College in the Negev for wearing his uniform and carrying a gun .
The incident raises disturbing questions about the freedom of Israeli academics , sheds light on the veneration of the military in Israeli public life , and exposes the close , verging on incestuous , ties between the army and Israeli academia .
Meanwhile , for many of Israel ’s 1.2 million Palestinian citizens , who are nearly a fifth of the country ’s population , Hassan ’s treatment confirms their fears that decades of discrimination , especially in higher education , are far from over .
Hassan has faced a storm of criticism , including claims that he is anti-Semitic , since the Israeli media mistakenly reported back in November that he had thrown out of class one of his students , Eyal Cohen , over the way he was dressed .
Hassan and most of the students present say Cohen was simply warned not to attend class in future wearing his uniform .
The story soon gained a life of its own , becoming the subject of incensed talk shows and newspaper columns .
A group of rightwing college staff and students lobbied for Hassan , the only Arab lecturer in the film school , to be dismissed , and the Knesset ’s Education Committee denounced him .
Critics claim , apparently without irony , that Hassan humiliated the student , abused the concept of academic freedom and impugned the reputation of the Israeli army .
Condemnation has come from surprising quarters , including the journalist Gideon Levy , better known for his articles attacking the the army ’s treatment of the Palestinians under occupation .
But more predictable has been outrage from the right .
Last month two leaders of extremist Jewish settlers in Hebron , Baruch Marzel and Itimar Ben Gvir , announced that they had enrolled in Hassan ’s course .
" I would love for him to ask me about my army service , " said Marzel .
" I can only assure you that he will be the one walking out of the classroom . "
The army added its voice too , with senior officers , including the Chief of Staff , Gabi Ashkenazi , putting pressure on Sapir College to publicly rebuke the filmmaker and punish him .
A letter from the head of army personnel , General Elazar Stern , accused the college of failing to act with " proper determination " and urged that Hassan face " sharp , public , official condemnation . "
Stern added that Hassan must be made to apologize or be sacked , otherwise the army would end its funding of places for hundreds of soldiers who attend courses at Sapir .
Most academic institutions in Israel not only depend on such funding but receive special grants and endowments for research in security - related subjects .
The Israeli revisionist historian Ilan Pappe , who was forced out of Haifa University last year , estimates that half of lecturers in Israeli universities have ties to the security services .
In Sapir College ’s case , links to the army have been reinforced by its location in Sderot , a poor development town close to Gaza that is the target of most of the Qassam rockets fired into Israel .
Under growing pressure , the college ’s Academic Council suspended Hassan without offering him a hearing .
It also appointed for the first time in the college ’s history an academic committee to investigate the incident and report on what disciplinary action should be taken .
The committee published its report late last month , conceding that he is an " outstanding teacher " but offering only a cursory examination the events at the center of the controversy .
Instead the members harshly criticized Hassan ’s behavior and personality and recommended that he apologize to Cohen or face dismissal .
The college ’s president , Zeev Tzahor , intervened by contributing his own condition .
He wrote to Hassan telling him that in his apology " you must refer to your obligation to be respectful to the IDF uniform and the full right of every student to enter your classroom in uniform . "
Hassan refused and , according to reports last week , the college has begun proceedings to dismiss him .
" The whole reaction has been hysterical , " Hassan , who lives in Nazareth , said .
" It really surprised me , as did the lies that were told about what had happened . "
His students say the issue has been blown out proportion and that Hassan has never hidden his opposition to militarism , wherever it exists .
Enass Masri , one of two Arab students in Hassan ’s film class , said : " When he saw Cohen wearing his uniform , he explained that all military uniforms  of the Israeli army , of Fatah or of Hamas  are symbols of violence and that he does not allow them into his classroom .
" His concerns about the blurring in Israeli society of the boundaries between the civil and military are well known . "
She added that the mistaken reports about Cohen being thrown out of class may have been part of a long - standing campaign to oust Hassan from his job .
He had made himself unpopular with some staff and students by speaking his mind , she said .
" Some people at the college are not prepared to accept the kind of things he says from an Arab . "
Sapir College calls itself " a lighthouse in the Negev , " and its film school once had a reputation for encouraging dissenting social and political opinions .
In other Israeli colleges , discussion of " politics "  a euphemism for views not officially sanctioned  is rarely allowed .
For example , at Haifa University , which has the largest Arab student body in the country , all protests on campus are banned unless licensed by the vice - chancellor .
Unofficial demonstrations , however peaceful , are broken up and usually filmed by security staff .
Video evidence is used as grounds for suspending or expelling students .
Sapir ’s president , Tzahor , recently told the Haaretz newspaper that his motto is : " Politics  only as far as the classroom door . "
However , the college ’s definition of " politics " appears selective .
In another recent incident at Sapir , lecturer Shlomit Tamari told a Bedouin student to remove her head - covering , telling her it was a sign of her oppression .
No disciplinary action was taken against Tamari , who is unrepentant : " I told the college that I have academic freedom , and I can talk about that subject and I am continuing to do so . "
Enass Masri said she was also shocked that the college committee did not question the students in Hassan ’s class about what took place .
" We thought we would be able to put the record straight , but we were never invited to testify .
" Almost all of the students are on Hassan ’s side , and we wrote a letter to the college authorities in protest at his treatment . "
Instead , she says , the committee interpreted the " meaning " of what happened , according to their own view of Hassan .
" They looked at him not as a human being but as an Arab , and Arabs are not allowed to have an opinion on Israeli militarism . "
Hassan takes a slightly different view .
Describing his questioning by the committee , he said : " They wanted me to be the Palestinian in the room , and I refused to oblige .
They wanted to believe that I object to the army uniform because I am Palestinian .
But I reject the uniform because it is opposed to my universal and human values .
I acted as I did because I am a teacher and a human being .
" What shocked me was that the committee refused to believe that could be my motivation . "
Certainly the committee ’s report dismisses Hassan ’s arguments , claiming : " Nizar abused his status and his authority as a teacher to flaunt his opinions , feelings and frustrations as a member of the Arab national minority in Israel , cloaking himself in a ‘ humane ’ and ‘ universal ’ garb , whereas in fact he demonstrated a stance of brute force bearing a distinctly nationalist character . "
Haim Bresheeth , an Israeli filmmaker who was dean of Sapir ’s film school between 1996 and 2002 , until he was hounded out over his anti-Zionist views , wrote to Tzahor , the college president , arguing that he was making an " irrational and immoral demand " in expecting Hassan to respect the army ’s uniform .
Bresheeth , referring to the reserve duty that most Israeli Jewish men perform well into their forties , added : " You are a soldier first , and only then an academic I call on the historian Zeev Tzahor to refuse the orders of Major Zeev Tzahor . "
As in most other areas of Israeli life , the country ’s Palestinian minority faces systematic discrimination in higher education .
No public university is located in an Arab community or teaches in Arabic , and , though the minority is a fifth of the population , fewer than 1 per cent of lecturers are Arab .
In addition , the number of Arab students is one - third of their proportion in the population  an under - representation that is apparently intentional .
In 2003 , psychometric tests biased towards Western culture were scrapped in an effort to help " weaker sections " of society gain acceptance to university .
However , when the Committee of University Heads learnt that the number of Arabs entering university had risen sharply as a result , the tests were immediately reinstated .
Several leading Israeli academics are outspoken racists , including David Bukay and Arnon Sofer at Haifa University and Raphael Israeli at Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
The latter was called as an " expert " witness by the state at a trial in 2004 in which he stated that the Arab mentality was composed of " a sense of victimization , " " pathological anti-Semitism , " and " a tendency to live in a world of illusions . "
Ex Weapons Inspector : US Will Attack Iran
Ex Weapons Inspector Says Iran Not Pursuing Nukes , But U.S. Will Attack Before ‘09
By Jason Leopold
The Public Record
In 2002 , Scott Ritter , the former Chief United Nations Weapons Inspector
In Iraq , publicly accused the Bush administration of lying to Congress and the public about assertions that Iraq was hiding a chemical and biological weapons arsenal .
By speaking out publicly , Ritter emerged as one of the most prominent whistleblowers since Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times in the early 1970s .
Ritter ’s criticisms about the Bush administration ’s flawed prewar Iraq intelligence have been borne out by numerous investigations and reports , including one recently published by the Senate Armed Services Committee that found President George W. Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , and other senior administration officials knowingly lied about the threat Iraq posed to the United States .
Now Ritter , who was a Marine Corps intelligence officer for 12 years , is speaking out about what he sees as history repeating itself regarding U.S. policy toward Iran and the inevitability of a U.S. - led attack on the country , which he believes will happen prior to a new president being sworn into office in January 2009 .
“ We ’re going to see some military activity before the new administration is sworn in . ”
Ritter said .
But he added that “ Iran is not a threat to the United States and Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
That ’s documented . ”
Ritter teamed up with the Los Angeles - based U.S. Tour of Duty ’s Real Intelligence , a nonprofit organization that represents former intelligence officials who openly discuss domestic and foreign policy issues .
Ritter went on the road nearly a year ago to promote his recently published book , Waging Peace : The Art of War for the Antiwar Movement .
But over the past several months , issues related to Iran have dominated his discussions .
In a wide - ranging interview with The Public Record , Ritter said he has been keeping close tabs on the issue for years and continues to approach the issue as if he were still employed as an intelligence officer .
He explained why he believes the U.S. is gearing up toward launching a military strike in Iran and how the media has misrepresented a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Association ( IAEA ) regarding Iran ’s continued enrichment of uranium .
AIPAC
He said one of the reasons he believes Democratic lawmakers have been reluctant to address the issue is the powerful Israeli lobby , such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
AIPAC has been pressuring the Bush administration to be even tougher on Iran .
The lobby is largely responsible for drafting a resolution calling for stricter inspections and harsher economic sanctions against the country , which is expected to be voted on by the House next week .
Resolution 362 introduced by Congressman Gary Ackerman , a New York Democrat , has 170 Democratic and Republican co-sponsors .
The bill " demands that the president initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by , inter alia , prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
The resolution calls on President Bush to impose " stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ”
Ritter says AIPAC 's involvement in Iran policy is partially the reason Democrats have not been been willing to take a stand against the Bush administration 's hard - line tactics toward Iran .
“ Congress has linked Iran policy to Israel .
In this day and age of presidential politics no one wants to take on the Israeli lobby .
That ’s just the facts , ” Ritter said .
“ You have to find a way to address this issue that sidesteps Israel .
Some people may object to that .
On the other hand , if you couch this thing in economic terms I think you now empower Congress to address this issue in a manner that sidesteps Israel . ”
Last week , a Senate committee approved legislation to strengthen sanctions against Iran by restricting the import of Iranian carpets , caviar , and nuts to the United States .
" The strong sanctions we 've approved today will work to deter the Iranian government from producing a nuclear weapon , " said Sen .
Max Baucus , D - Montana , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
Ritter said the public would likely become more outspoken on the Bush administration ’s policies toward Iran if they understood how an attack on Iran could lead to an economic collapse here at home .
“ You have to talk about what ’s going to happen to the price of oil , the price of food .
People have to focus on that .
Iran does not pose a threat whatsoever to the average American .
We ’ve got this hyped up threat .
We need people to understand that they are being sold a bill of goods .
There is no threat .
Our welfare is going out the door right now because of this policy .
We have to find a way to get this to resonate . ”
Intelligence vs. Smoking Guns
One of the first questions Ritter says he is asked when he explains why the administration is planning an air assault against Iran is “ where ’s the smoking gun . ”
“ People will say ‘ how do you know for certain , ’ ” Ritter said .
“ You know I was in the in the intelligence business for a long time and we do n’t make a living off of smoking guns .
That ’s what politicians do .
We evaluate the totality of the available information and we make informed assessments and we do it in a systematic fashion .
And that ’s what I ’ve been doing on the issue of Iran . ”
Ritter said the increased rhetoric toward Tehran by various White House officials is a key indicator in understanding the Bush administration ’s intent .
“ I do n’t like the word intent usually because the Bush administration used that with Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction , ” he said .
“ Intent void of a factual basis is speculation .
But here we do have documentation .
We have a national security strategy .
We have repeated statements by the current players themselves that they seek regional transformation in the Middle East inclusive of regime change in Iran .
This is the policy objective of the Bush administration .
" So we have the intent .
Now with the intent we have the escalation of rhetoric .
So we not only have stated intent we now have statements that reinforce those intents and seek to activate this intent , ” Ritter added .
“ And then you have the rhetoric that ’s matched with the capabilities .
Clearly you have the capabilities deployed in the region to act on this .
We ’ve seen the nature of the strike be defined down to a limited strike to one or two strikes inside Iran affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard command .
So you have all of these facilitators taking place . "
IAEA Report
In May , the media characterized a report by the IAEA into Iran ’s uranium enrichment program as evidence that Tehran is actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
The Bush administration held up that report as evidence that Iran is a grave threat to the United States and Israel .
But Ritter said the media misrepresented the report and likely did not thoroughly review its findings .
“ We have a situation where the IAEA has published several technical reports all of which state there is no evidence Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
None .
Zero , ” Ritter said .
Ritter explained how the IAEA report was drafted .
“ Information has been provided to the IAEA by member nations , intelligence information .
Now the IAEA has to be very circumspect when it says this but we all know that it ’s basically intelligence provided to the agency by the United States of America , a nation openly hostile to Iran , a nation that has a track record of fabricating , exaggerating , and misrepresenting intelligence data .
The data that ’s been provided to the IAEA has derived from a laptop computer which even the IAEA claims is of questionable providence , ” he said .
Ritter said that because the United States has such a dominating role in the United Nations Security Council and in the Board of Governors the IAEA could n’t ignore the information it receives from the United States about Iran .
“ The IAEA ca n’t go to Iran with information that is n’t serious .
So they say it ’s serious and it needs to be investigated .
So they go to Iran and the Iranians say , correctly so , ‘ this is bullshit . ’
You ’re basically serving as a front to the CIA .
The CIA is asking intelligence based questions about issues that are not relevant to the safeguards agreement , which , by the way , is the legally binding mandate that gives the IAEA the authority to do its work in Iran .
You have to read the small print .
“ The IAEA acknowledges that what it ’s asking Iran to answer has nothing to do with its mandate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty .
It is related to Security Council resolutions calling for the suspension of uranium and an investigation into a nuclear weapons program but the bottom line is what the IAEA has said is that Iran has not been forthcoming and Iran is saying it ’s not their job to answer the CIA ’s questions .
So the IAEA reports that Iran is not being forthcoming on these issues and now it ’s unnamed diplomats , i.e. American and British diplomats , who say they are very concerned because Iran ’s refusal to cooperate only reinforces their concern that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
" This is purely CIA instigated tripe .
When we get down to the nuts and bolts of the technical question of Iran ’s uranium enrichment program and whether or not there ’s any infrastructure in Iran that supports a nuclear weapons program and the IAEA technical find says there is none , ” Ritter said .
Mohammed ElBaradei , the head of the IAEA , said in an interview last week with Al Arabiya Television that he would resign from the agency if Iran is attacked and warned that a military strike against the country would be catastrophic .
" I do n’t believe that what I see in Iran today is a current , grave and urgent danger .
If a military strike is carried out against Iran at this time … it would make me unable to continue my work , ” ElBaradei said .
" A military strike , in my opinion , would be worse than anything possible .
It would turn the region into a fireball , ” he said , emphasizing that any attack would only make the Islamic Republic more determined to obtain nuclear power . "
Israel Not Involved
Ritter said an attack on Iran would come in the form of a “ sustained aerial bombardment . ”
He added that a military strike would not involve Israel as asserted last weekend by John Bolton , the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations , who told Fox News that Israel would attack Iran after the presidential election in the fall .
Moreover , Ritter said a report in The New York Times last week that alleged Israel conducted a major aerial exercise over the eastern Mediterranean as a warning to Iran is simply untrue .
“ Only a few analysts have reflected on what I ’ve said all along : Israel cannot initiate and sustain an air strike against Iran , ” Ritter explained .
“ They ’re incapable of it because they do n’t have the military force .
They do n’t share a common border [ with Iran ] .
They have to fly over sovereign states .
The immediate international outcry would be tremendous .
When we sought to fly U2 aircraft into Iraq when I was a weapons inspector if we felt that the Iraqis delayed in their acknowledgement the United States Air Force would SORTE a support package to go in .
That included electronic warfare aircraft , refueling aircraft , etc .
Just to get one U2 to fly a mission over Iraq with a support package involved 80 aircraft .
“ For Israel to strike Iran , and remember Iran is n’t Iraq , Iran has a viable air - defense system , an Air Force , radar , and Israel would have to suppress it all and it ca n’t do it , ” Ritter added .
“ Israel just does n’t have the capability .
Israel does not have the ability to initiate and sustain major combat operations against Iran .
Israel is not going to start this fight .
It will be the United States .
All this talk about Israel getting involved I minimize that .
Israel ’s not going into Iran . ”
Ritter said Bolton ’s comments is an indicator that the “ clock is running out ” for ideologues in the Bush administration .
“ It ’s becoming increasingly clear that John McCain is not going to become the next president of the United States of America , which means the next administration has the potential of deviating in a meaningful fashion away from the policies of the current administration , ” Ritter said .
“ Clearly , the Bush administration is populated by ideologues that are very serious about what they want to accomplish .
They are n’t playing games here .
They are n’t children .
They are serious .
They believe there is a threat to the United States and that the United States has to take action .
Why I bring this up is that the clock is running out for them . ”
Congress Refuses to Act
Ritter had some tough words for Washington lawmakers for continuously failing to put any obstacles into place to block the Bush administration from even attempting to attack Iran without first consulting Congress .
“ We see not only has Congress not seeking to put any obstacles in the way of this policy but in fact Congress is actively facilitating this policy by refusing to enact legislation that would require the president to get the consent of Congress before going into Iran , ” Ritter said .
“ The fact that Congress has opted out from tying the president ’s hands reinforces , at least in the Bush administration ’s mind , that Congress is legitimizing the potential of action .
“ So when you put all of this together you start to see that there is not only a real risk of war but that those who would like to do it see that there are n’t any obstacles being put in the way of their accomplishing this , which makes the likelihood of military action even greater .
Everyday that goes by without Congressional action is another day that reinforces that there will be a military strike against Iran . ”
Ritter has been trying to pass along his intelligence analysis on Iran to Congress for some time .
He said “ given the political situation that exists I do n’t think you ’re going to find any politician on either side of the political spectrum reaching out to me or talking with me directly . ”
But he has been able , at the very least ; distribute his intelligence to middlemen who can get the information to Congress .
“ What I am saying to you is being said to the powers that be in Washington so there is no way [ Democrats and Republicans ] can say that they have n’t been made aware of this analysis , ” Ritter said .
“ Ideally , there would be hearings and I would be invited to testify .
So that not only these words would be given to the policymakers but it would be done in a way that the constituents would be cognizant of the fact that this is an analysis that was made available to policymakers who chose to act upon it or ignore it at their own risk . ”
I contacted aides in the Democratic leadership offices of both Houses over the past week and also spoke to aides in minority offices .
No one would comment on the record about the Bush administration ’s policies toward Iran or discuss whether they have been made aware of Ritter ’s intelligence analysis on the issue .
An aide to John Conyers , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , pointed to the congressman ’s May 8 letter sent to President Bush stating that Conyers would initiate impeachment proceedings if an attack on Iran was launched without first receiving approval from Congress .
" Late last year , Senator Joseph Biden stated unequivocally that ‘ the president has no authority to unilaterally attack Iran , and if he does , as Foreign Relations Committee chairman , I will move to impeach ’ the president , ” Conyers ’ letter says .
" We agree with Senator Biden , and it is our view that if you do not obtain the constitutionally required congressional authorization before launching preemptive military strikes against Iran or any other nation , impeachment proceedings should be pursued .. ”
Ritter was critical of the letter Conyers sent to Bush , saying the congressman is still avoiding the issue .
“ John Conyers is so off base on this one , ” Ritter said .
“ I appreciate his passion , but the fact is rather than Conyers say [ to President Bush ] if you attack Iran I am going to impeach you why does n’t Conyers reflect on the fact that there is no basis for impeachment because he ’s been constitutionally empowered by Congress .
If Conyers is so worried about this what Conyers needs to do is work with Congress to revoke the two existing war powers resolutions concerning Afghanistan and Iraq and then reconfigure the president ’s war powers authority in a manner which constitutionally permits ongoing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but tells the president that if you seek any expansion of your authority you have to get the consent of Congress .
Now if the president attacks Iran you can impeach him . ”
Conyers office declined to comment .
Ritter said he understood that the hotly contested presidential election makes it difficult for Democratic lawmakers to address the issue of Iran .
“ Let ’s talk about political reality here .
You cannot expect a politician , especially Democrats who want to retain control of Congress and want a Democrat to be president of the United States , to commit political suicide , ” Ritter said .

The Democratic National Committee recently ran an ad blasting John McCain for saying the country is " better off " than in 2000 .
Yet , arguably , except as regards the Iraq war , Mr. McCain 's statement is true .
In turn , Mr. McCain is blasting Barack Obama for suggesting that international tensions are not as bad as they 've been made to seem .
Yet , arguably , Mr. Obama is right .
Democratic attacks on Mr. McCain and Republican attacks on Mr. Obama both seek to punish impermissibly positive thoughts .

Japan ’s PM Yasuo Fukuda says “ countries like China and India ” are part of the international deal , ” but that they have the ” right to grow in the way that we grew . ' ”
Some might argue that considering the size of those two countries , but nevertheless , Japan will be hosting the G - 8 leaders from July 7 - 9th and Brazil , China and India have been invited to join in the discussion on climate change .
( I wish they would invite me . )
Japan ’s Fukuda said , ‘ In the … I would like to deepen common recognition ( with participants ) over the ( climate change ) issue and send a powerful message that we will work together . ”
Japan ’s former PM , Shinzo
Abe echoed , ” I strongly hope this will be agreed on and shared at the summit as a common goal of humankind . ”
This= halving global emissions by 2050 .
And Tony Blair chimed in , ” I think and hope we will this year get agreement on an essential shared vision around 2050 … .
It was n’t entirely clear at Heiligendamm that everyone was signed up for it .
I think it ’s got to be clear this year that they are . ”
A climate change meeting is scheduled for 2009 in Copenhagen and a climate change framework is expected to be agreed upon to succeed the Kyoto Protocol which will expire in 2012 .

When it comes to the research assessment exercise , quality sells itself .
Still , a touch of rune - reading and a bit of self - publicity do no harm , says Harriet Swain

The £ 700 motorised ' anti- gravity ' suitcase that feels empty and will text you when it gets lost
It sounds like a perfect solution to the misery of dragging heavy bags around airports .
With motors in each wheel and an ' anti- gravity ' system which centres the weight over its wheels , the powered suitcase promises to lighten the load on your arm so much that pulling even 30kg ( 66lb ) of baggage feels like 3 kg ( 6.6lb ) .
But it may lighten your wallet as well as your load .
For not only does the motorised bag cost £ 700 , it weighs 10.6 kg ( 23 lb ) when empty – about 3 kg more than the average suitcase , its makers say .
The luggage features motorised wheels and can reach running speed
As many airlines charge for items weighing more than about 23kg ( 50 lb ) , choosing the 94 - litre powered suitcase for your holiday wardrobe , could cost you a small fortune in excess baggage .
Virgin Atlantic , for example , may charge up to £ 42 for each kilo of excess .
But inventor Clive Hemsley , 57 , thinks the case is worth its weight , and will come in handy for those travelling on cruises – which often come without a luggage limit , he said .
' Going on holiday or on a business trip can be hell if you have to carry a heavy case .
' It 's only recently become possible to make batteries and motors strong enough and light enough to make powered cases viable . '
The PA case promises to put an end to airport struggles thanks to it's pioneering ' anti- gravity ' set - up
Powered by a rechargeable 12 - volt battery pack in the base , the case can cover a mile - and - a - half fully loaded .
Each has a laser - etched serial number , so that if lost , the finder can contact its makers , Live Luggage , who email or text the owner .
The case , which has a plug - in charger , similar to that of a mobile phone , works by providing varying power to the wheels , depending on how hard the user pulls it .
Pressure sensors built into the handle monitor how hard the case is pulled .
The wheel motors switch on the moment you tug on the handle
The engines then provide torque to compensate .
So as the user walks , it follows them as though it weighs nothing .
It also has an ' anti- gravity ' handle system , which balances the bulk of the case over the wheels , like a wheelbarrow .
Sensors on the handle increase power if the slope gets steeper or the user walks faster .
Engines switch off automatically if the case is dropped , so it will not run away from you .

MAY 27 -- In what may be the creepiest court exhibits ever , Texas officials have released photos of imprisoned polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs in intimate clinches with two underage girls .
The photos , which you 'll find on these pages , were introduced Friday at a child custody hearing stemming from last month 's raid at a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) compund .
Jeffs , the former FLDS leader , was convicted last year of rape as an accomplice for forcing a 14 - year - old girl to marry -- and have sex against her will with - - her 19 - year - old cousin .
As seen here , Jeffs is pictured with a girl named Loretta in three photos , which were snapped in January 2005 and recorded the couple 's " First Anniversary . "
Six other images show Jeffs , now 52 , in July 2006 photos with a girl named Merrianne , who was 12 at the time .
In the photos , Jeffs is passionately kissing both girls .

Requirements
In order to use the mcDropdown plug - in , you need the following :
j Query v1.2.6 ( or higher ) *
jquery.mcdropdown.js
Plug-in
jquery.bgiframe.js
Plug - in ( Optional ; for fixing overlay issues in IE6 )
* This plug - in may work with older versions of jQuery in the 1.2 family .
If you try using this with an older version of jQuery , you will need to include the jquery.dimensions.js plug - in ( as of jQuery v1.2.6 the jquery.dimensions.js plug - in is included in the jQuery core . )
Usage
The mcDropdown plug - in has two main methods of being invoked .
The first method creates a new instance of the widget on an existing element :
$ ( " #mcdropdown " ) .mcDropdown( list , [ options ] ) ;
NOTE : The initial element that you apply the plug - in to is destroyed and replaced with a new input element with the same id attribute .
While the mcDropdown ( ) method does not destroy the jQuery chain , it does effectively return a " dirty " reference ( since the original element no longer exists . )
Because of this , you 'll want to make sure that the mcDropdown ( ) method is the last call in your chain .
Also , if you plan on caching a reference to the element , you will need to create the cached instance after you initiated the widget .
Arguments
list
This argument is required and must point to an unordered list element .
The list argument can be any one of the following : A jQuery selector to an unordered list ( < ul > ) element
A jQuery object containing the unordered list
An unordered list DOM element
This should be a reference to a single list element .
options
This argument is optional and allows you to customize the settings used for each instance of the plug - in .
For a list of all available options , see the Options section .
The second method of invoking the mcDropdown ( ) plug - in is to return a reference to an existing instance of the mcDropdown ( ) widget .
So , once we have initiated an instance of the mcDropdown widget , we can do the following :
var dd = $ ( " #mcdropdown " ) .mcDropdown ( ) ;
Now that we have a reference to the widget , we can invoke any of the public methods available .
Public Methods
dd.getValue ()
Returns an array [ value , label ] containing the value stored in the hidden < input /> element and the label currently being displayed to the user . dd.setValue( value )
Sets the instance of the mcDropdown widget to a specific value .
The value passed should correspond the a valid list item ( < li > ) value .
dd.openMenu()
Programmatically opens the menu . dd.closeMenu()
Programmatically closes the menu .
( NOTE : Any click the user makes onscreen will also close the menu . ) dd.focus ()
Calls the focus ( ) event for the text input element .
dd.disable ( boolean )
This method will either enabled ( false ) or disable ( true ) the dropdown widget .
When the widget is disabled , the user can not change the value via the UI .
Options
There are a number of options available for customizing the look and feel of the mcDropdown widget .
{ minRows : 8 // specify the minimum rows before creating a new // column , maxRows : 25 // specify the maximum rows in a column , targetColumnSize : 2 // specify the default target column size ( it will // attempt to create // this many columns by default , unless the min/max // row rules are not being met ) , openFx : " slideDown " // the fx to use for showing the root menu , openSpeed : 150 // the speed of the openFx , closeFx : " slideUp " // the fx to use for hiding the root menu , closeSpeed : 150 // the speed of the closeFx , hoverOverDelay : 200 // the delay before opening a submenu , hoverOutDelay : 0 // the delay before closing a submenu , showFx : " show " // the fx to use when showing a submenu , showSpeed : 0 // the speed of the showFx , hideFx : " hide " // the fx to use when closing a submenu , hideSpeed : 0 // the speed of the hideFx , dropShadow : true // determine whether drop shadows should be shown // on the submenus , autoHeight : true // always uses the lineHeight options ( much faster // than calculating height ) , lineHeight : 19 // the base height of each list item ( li ) this is // normally calculated // automatically , but in some cases the value can // not be determined and // you will need to set it manually , screenPadding : 10 // the padding to use around the border of the // screen -- this is used to make sure items stay // on the screen , allowParentSelect : false // determines if parent items are allowed to be // selected ( by default // only end nodes can be selected ) , delim : " : " // the delimited to use when showing the display // string ( must be single character ) , showACOnEmptyFocus : false // show the autocomplete box on focus when input is // empty , valueAttr : " data - value " // the attribute that contains the value to use in // the hidden field , mouseintent : false // determines if we should use the mouse intent plugin if present , click : null // callback that occurs when the user clicks on a // menu item , select : null // callback that occurs when a value is selected , init : null // callback that occurs when the control is fully // initialized }
Keyboard Usage
Place the cursor in the text box and start typing , only characters that are exact matches will be registered
If the value you want is selected , press any of the following keys to either select the value or go to the next level of the tree : [ ENTER ] , [ TAB ] , [ RIGHT ARROW ] or [ :] ( or the character you set for the delim option . )
To delete the last typed character , press [ BACKSPACE ]
To go back to the parent node , press [ LEFT ARROW ]
Press [ UP ARROW ] or [ DOWN ARROW ] to cycle through valid options
If you do not leave the field before getting to the end node in the tree , the input element will automatically be filled in the first end node match it finds
Getting Started
The first thing we need to do is to load the required JavaScript libraries and the CSS stylesheet used by the widget :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " ./lib/jquery-1.2.6.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src="./lib/jquery.mcdropdown.js " ></script> < script type =" text / javascript " src="./lib/jquery.bgiframe.js " ></ script> <!---// load the mcDropdown CSS stylesheet //---> < link type =" text/css " href= " ./css/jquery.mcdropdown.css " data- value =" stylesheet " media= " all " />
Before you can invoke an instance of the mcDropdown widget , you must have an unordered list element which is used as your menu .
If you have ever used the " suckerfish " technique , then setting up the list element is very straight forward .
One of the key features of this widget is its ability to display hierarchical data structures that are very deep .
However , for this example we will keep the HTML simple and straightforward .
The default CSS stylesheet Giva provides expect that all unordered lists being used as menus will have a class of " mcdropdown - menu . "
If you choose to use a different class name , make sure to update the CSS file accordingly .
< ul id =" categorymenu " class= " mcdropdown - menu " > < li data - value = " 1 " >
Arts & Humanities < ul > < li data - value = " 2 " >
Photography < ul > < li data - value= " 3 " >
3D </ li > < li data - value = " 4 " >
Digital </ li > </ul > </ li > < li data - value= " 5 " >
History </ li > < li data - value = " 6 " >
Literature </li > </ul > </ li > < li data - value = " 7 " >
Business & Economy </ li > < li data - value = " 8 " >
Computers & Internet </ li > < li data - value= " 9 " >
Education </ li > < li data - value = " 11 " > Entertainment < ul > < li data - value = " 12 " > Movies </ li > < li data - value = " 13 " >
TV Shows < / li > < li data- value = " 14 " > Music </ li > < li data - value = " 15 " >
Humor </ li > </ul > </li > < li data - value = " 10 " >
Health </li > </ul >
Notice how each of the < li > elements contains the " rel " attribute ?
This is used to define the unique " value " for each item .
This allows you to display whatever text you want to the user , but store a value that corresponds to a unique identifier .
When a user selects an item from the menu , it is this value that is placed in a hidden < input /> element and therefore passed back to the server when the form is submitted .
If you wish to use a different attribute to store your value , you can use the valueAttr option to change this to any attribute you want .
Now that the list element has been created , you need to create a DOM element that will become the widget :
< input type =" text " name= " category " id =" category " value= " " />
You can invoke the mcDropdown ( ) plug - in on any block display element ( like a < div > , ) but by binding it to a text input element you will enable the keyboard entry feature .
The next step is to actually create an instance of the mcDropdown widget .
You want to make sure to initialize the widget after all the necessary DOM elements are available , which makes the document .
ready event a great place to initialize the widget .
< script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " #category " ) .
mcDropdown ( " #categorymenu " ) ; } ) ; </script >
Now let us take a look at what the code above produced .
Example
Please select a category :
NOTE : Safari / Webkit has a bug in CSS engine when using the : hover psuedo class with the adajacent sibling selector .
If you notice weird artifacts after mousing over elements , it 's related to this CSS bug .
Arts & Humanities Photography 3D Digital History Literature
Business & Economy
Computers & Internet
Education
Entertainment Movies TV Shows Music Humor
Health
Click the icon to the right of the text box in order to see the widget in action .
If you place the widget at the bottom of the viewport , you will notice that the widget automatically scrolls the page so that the entire menu appears on the screen .
This is designed to reduce user frustration by making sure the user can actually use the control .
No scrolling will take place if the widget can already display itself onscreen .
Another key usability feature the mcDropdown widget offers is keyboard entry .
If you place the cursor inside the text box you can now use the keyboard to select an item .
If an item is already selected , you will notice that placing focus on the input element causes the last child item to be automatically pre-selected .
This allows for quickly changing the selected item if an incorrect value was entered .
We designed the keyboard entry so that only options found in the unordered list element can be selected .
To accomplish this task , each keystroke is monitored and only allow valid characters are actually registered by the widget .
Also , as the user types a list of all possible matches will appear in the autocomplete list .
This list is narrowed to only include exact matches .
There 's no need for a user to type the complete item name either , once the item the user wants is selected , they can either press [ TAB ] , [ ENTER ] , [ RIGHT ARROW ] or the [ :] ( which is the defined label delimiter ) to select the list item .
The user will then either be presented with any child items or they will move to the next position in the form .
Users can also use the [ UP ARROW ] and [ DOWN ARROW ] keys to select options that appear in the autocomplete list .

Merb and DataMapper on the edge
I 've just started writing a new app with merb and datamapper , so decided to start out on the edge .
The preferred way to do it these days is with sake , a tool for running system wide rake tasks .
It 's rather neat , and should ( in theory ) have made my installation of the edge versions of merb and datamapper extremely easy .
I did hit a couple of issues running them on Ubuntu 7.10 , hence this article .
Installing sake
This should be easy , but right now it appears to be a bit of sticking point .
You need a relatively recent version of rubygems ( at least 1.1.1 ) , so I upgraded to the latest ( 1.2.0 ) :
$ sudo gem update -- system
Sadly I could n't install sake automatically as specific versions of ParseTree and ruby2ruby could n't be installed .
I did manage to work round it manually though , and it went something like this :
$ sudo gem install sake ERROR : Error installing sake : sake requires ParseTree ( = 2.1.1 , runtime ) $ gem list -r ParseTree *** REMOTE GEMS *** ParseTree ( 2.2.0 ) ParseTreeReloaded ( 0.0.1 ) $ sudo gem install ParseTree --version '= 2.1.1 '
Once ParseTree was installed I had trouble with ruby2ruby .
The only way I could get round that problem was by downloading it and installing it manually , followed closely by sake :
$ wget http://rubyforge.rubyuser.de/gems/ruby2ruby-1.1.8.gem
$ sudo gem install ruby2ruby - 1.1.8.gem $ sudo adl gem install sake
Phew .
There 's a bug report about this problem on RubyForge ; with a bit of luck it may be sorted by the time you try this .
Installing merb with sake and edgy
Edgy is a cracking bunch of scripts ( well , rake tasks actually ) for installing gems directly from their source repositories .
You run the tasks with sake .
Before you try and run the sake tasks you 'll need zip installed :
$ sudo apt - get install zip
You 'll also need a few dependencies installed from the gem world :
$ sudo gem install erubis json_pure rack mime - types
Then all you need to do is to head over to the edgy sake instructions .
The short version looks like this :
$ sake - i ' http://edgy.4ninjas.org/edgy.sake'
# Installing task `edgy : self : version ' # Installing task `edgy : self : update ' # Installing task `edgy : self : uninstall ' # Installing task `edgy : list ' # Installing task `edgy : install ' #
Installing task `edgy : update ' # Installing task `edgy : dependencies ' $ sake edgy : install packages = " merb do dm "
It 's worth scanning the output of the build process once it 's finished , as it does n't halt on errors .
If you want to run rspec from edge as well then you can set packages to " merb - stack " instead , but I 'm quite happy with rspec 1.1.4 so long as I can get away with it .
Enjoy .

A top Department of Homeland Security investigator said Thursday that his office would reopen an inquiry into the case of a Canadian engineer who was sent secretly by the U.S. to his native Syria for interrogation because of suspected ties to Al Qaeda .
Inspector General Richard L. Skinner , who spoke at a congressional hearing in Washington , said new evidence had emerged that U.S. officials may have broken laws related to torture in the case of Maher Arar .
Canadian officials have said Arar was tortured while in custody for a year in Syria , where he says he was kept for the bulk of the time in a dark solitary cell slightly larger than a grave .
The Canadian government has acknowledged that it supplied faulty information to the U.S. , which probably led to his arrest , and neither Canada nor Syria found any evidence of terrorist links .
Last year , Canada apologized to Arar , who now lives in Ottawa , and agreed to pay him almost $ 10 million in compensation .

The apparent mishandling of his case has resulted in a rare public examination of what is known as “ extraordinary rendition , ” a covert U.S. practice of sending foreign terrorism suspects to other countries for interrogation .
Congressional members called Thursday for a special prosecutor to lead the investigation so criminal charges could be filed .
“ Senior American officials ought to go to jail for this , ” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on constitution , civil rights and civil liberties , who has access to the classified version of a redacted inspector ’s general report on the government ’s actions .
“ There was a deliberate plot to abuse the procedures so they could railroad Arar to Syria , where they knew he would be tortured . ”
Immigration officials detained Arar in September 2002 at New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport while he was in transit from Zurich , Switzerland , to Montreal , based on information from the Canadian government .
Advertisement
A four - year U.S. investigation found authorities acted appropriately to deport Arar although normal procedures for deportation were not followed , with a rushed hearing without his attorneys present .
U.S. authorities secretly flew Arar in a small plane to Syria and handed him over with a list of interrogation questions after receiving only “ ambiguous ” assurances of fair treatment , the report says .
The U.S. has previously said it had independent intelligence that supported the officials ’ actions , but it refused to release the classified information .
“ I have seen the confidential information , and I can tell you it ’s nonsense , ” Nadler said .
“ There is nothing that is incriminating . ”

In his testimony , Skinner said it was unclear why the Justice Department overruled the Immigration and Naturalization Service to send Arar to Syria , because his office was not allowed to interview certain officials .
“ The INS concluded that Arar was entitled to protection from torture and that returning him to Syria would more likely than not result in his torture , ” the report says .
Arar ’s attorney , Maria LaHood , said the new evidence , received only a month ago , was an unexpected turn after the four - year inquiry had concluded that the government acted appropriately .
“ It confirms that there needs to be a completely independent investigation which has access to all the departments -- the Department of Justice , and Immigration -- and actually release the whole report , ” she said .

DENVER , Pa. -- Jesse Martin , an Old Order Mennonite farmer here , lives much like his 17th - century Dutch ancestors .
He shuns electricity and cars .
He believes in self - sufficiency , so he opposes insurance and government aid .
But nine of his 11 children suffer from serious diseases .
Desperate to save them , he has tapped into 21st - century high - tech medical care .
In the process , he is posing tough questions for the U.S. health - care system and for nonprofit hospitals , which are expected to provide charity care in exchange for tax ...
Democratic presidential candidate , Barack Obama has asked his finance team to help his former opponent Hillary Clinton pay off a debt of at least $ 10 m ( £ 6 m ) from her failed presidential campaign .
In a teleconference with his top fundraisers yesterday afternoon , Obama asked them to help the former first lady , a campaign spokesman confirmed .
Later at a star - studded fundraising gala in Los Angeles , the Illinois senator , who could become America 's first black president , appealed to those in the crowd who might have supported Clinton .
" I know I caused some heartburn and some frustration , " he said , adding that he and Clinton " were allies then and we 're allies now . "
Obama 's campaign refused to say how many millions he and the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) raised at the gala , but Democratic officials put the number at close to $ 5 m .
The presidential hopeful had already broken fundraising records by the end of May by raising an unprecedented $ 287 m .
The price of a ticket for the gala 's general reception was $ 2,300 while tickets to the VIP dinner cost $ 28,500 .
The DNC will get the latter donations and Obama will receive the $ 2,300 share .
Obama also used the event to reach out to Hollywood stars to throw their support and cash behind him .
Many celebrities attended including actors Don Cheadle and Dennis Quaid , boxer Sugar Ray Leonard , and Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am , who created two music videos for Obama during the primary campaign .

I am a minority of one , or a very small number , in thinking that the failures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are good news .
These two companies should not exist .
No private companies should have lines of credit to the U.S. Treasury , that is , U.S. taxpayers .
No private companies should be linked to a government mandate that they facilitate affordable housing by buying up mortgages .
No private companies should issue debts that investors believe may have an implicit guarantee provided by taxpayers .
The only bad thing about these failures is what the Federal government may do next to keep them alive .
The only bad thing is that the Federal government will probably make matters worse .
This is a golden opportunity to end these enterprises once and for all .
And doing that is incredibly simple !
Any Wall Street investment bank can , in short order , produce a plan to restructure these companies and charge the appropriate ( high ) fees for carrying out that plan .
The possible ways to restructure include sales of the assets , creating subsidiaries and selling them , spinning off subsidiary companies , and breaking up the company into several companies .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could also put their entire companies up for sale .
Such restructurings are Wall Street ’s bread and butter .
The equity values of these companies have already fallen considerably .
Their value in a restructuring may be quite small , but control does have a non-negligible value .
The markets are already pricing the debts of these two giants at less than face value , despite the chance of an implicit guarantee or a taxpayer bailout .
The debt - holders took a chance buying this paper .
They should bear the consequences .
Restructuring will reveal the true worth of these debt securities .
Investors in these enterprises , both debt and equity holders , should not be bailed out by the taxpayers .
These two companies made bad investments by buying mortgages that have gone bad .
These two companies also issued too much debt to finance these investments , which gave them very shaky financial structures .
The worth of their assets is less than the worth of their liabilities , which makes them insolvent .
They are not yet bankrupt .
They still have the cash to service their debts .
These debts are by no means worthless .
About 11.6 percent of money market funds are invested in agency debt .
At current prices of these debts , news of money market troubles has not surfaced .
If those prices fell by 10 percent , the money market losses would be a modest 1 percent .
Any restructuring presumes what is not in evidence , which is that the Federal government has to sever completely its relationships with housing markets and specifically with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
There ’s the rub .
Congress wo n’t do this , unless seized by some unforeseen miracle of rationality .
There are millions of Americans who may fear the dissolution of these companies .
They will wonder where they will get mortgages from .
There are hundreds of columnists who share this fear .
Some will pretend to hold their nose while supporting a government bailout .
Some will want to maintain the government ’s interference in housing markets or even expand it as a matter of public policy .
There is nothing to fear .
The amount of money on the sidelines that is available for funding mortgages is tremendous .
It can be coaxed into mortgages if the interest rates paid are high enough .
A free market in mortgages will easily provide capital to creditworthy borrowers .
But that too is the rub .
The government wants to keep mortgage rates low so as to keep the housing industry going and to satisfy the voters who take out mortgages .
The government does not want a free market in mortgages , and that is because neither voters nor the housing industry want a free market in housing .
As long as there is a government that is empowered to interfere , the pressure to interfere will overcome the free market .
Democracy just does not work , my friends !
Sooner or later , in this case 70 years later , 70 years after Fannie Mae began , the system starts to break down .
Call it what you will , democratic socialism or democratic fascism or both , democracy does not work .
It does n’t work in agriculture , in the military , in the space program , in the banking system , or in any other part of an economy .
Sooner or later , depending on various particulars , blowups occur .
Without the government in the picture , there is no way that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could ever have grown so large .
Their balance sheet assets ( and liabilities ) total about $ 1.6 trillion .
They have off - balance liabilities of another $ 3.5 trillion or so .
How big is $ 5 trillion ?
The national debt of the U.S. is $ 9.5 trillion !
It is almost unbelievable that these two companies could have run up debts that are more than half the size of the country ’s national debt .
But that is inherent in the chemistry of government + housing + debt guarantees .
The housing market is huge , especially over time as the housing stock accumulates .
By giving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an advantage in issuing debt , these companies came to dominate the housing finance market .
There is no better time than now to end this absurdity .
Freddie Mac faces huge losses , as much as $ 775,000,000 .
Its equity can easily be wiped out .
That means bankruptcy .
That is nothing to fear , either .
That means that restructuring will be forced upon the company .
The point is to let it happen and happen quickly and get the government out of the picture altogether .
Naturally , this has not been what the government has been doing .
Instead , it has done the opposite so far .
Congress has passed a bill that awaits the President ’s signature or veto .
There will be a deal .
The bill increases mortgage loan limits drastically .
Smart move , guys .
Pelosi wants them even higher , $ 730,000 instead of $ 625,000 .
Mr. Corruption himself , Chris Dodd , is the lead sponsor of the bill .
Even as the stocks of these two companies approach $ 0 , he reassures the public that the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Ben Bernanke tell him that they are not at risk of default .
This is a bald - faced lie .
Failure to face and state truths is a national addiction .
The predilection to lie in the face of bad news is so ingrained that our leaders no longer can even detect the difference between what is true and what is false .
They lie and they know they lie .
But they also believe their lies because they believe their lies to be political necessities .
Can liars even begin to think straight about what should be done that is in the long - run interest of the American public ?
If they could think straight , could they summon the courage to act ?
Democracy encourages lies , liars , and cowardice in the face of voters and payoffs .
Democracy just does not work , my friends .
Terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Sever the relations with the government and let Wall Street , or investment bankers in San Francisco or Austin or Boston or Tallahassee do what they know best , which is restructure these companies .
All the mortgages held or guaranteed by them will still be held and serviced , but by new companies and new investors .
Problem solved .

Police in central England are hunting for a badly scorched would - be copper power cable thief after finding a hacksaw embedded in an 11,000 volt power cable Saturday night .
REUTERS / File
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Police in central England are hunting for a badly scorched would - be copper power cable thief after finding a hacksaw embedded in an 11,000 volt power cable Saturday night .
The thief , who also left a lit blow torch at the scene , is expected to be badly charred , spiky haired and not exactly the brightest bulb in the socket .
“ The sheer stupidity of cutting through power cables should be glaringly obvious to everyone , ” said Phil Wilson , customer operations manager with local power company Central Networks .
“ At the very least putting the hacksaw through the cable would have created an almighty bang and the line would have burned for quite a few seconds , showering them with molten copper ...
We can only assume they left in a great hurry or they were injured and were dragged away by an accomplice . ”
But searches of local hospitals have so far not found the culprit , a spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police said Tuesday .
“ Maybe they had a lucky escape , ” she said .
“ We do n’t have any leads yet . ”
Nearly 800 customers in the village of Creswell were cut off when the wannabe copper thief sawed into their power supply on Saturday night , but Central Networks got the lights back on within a few hours .
Copper prices have more than doubled in the last four years as China has gobbled up huge quantities of it , sparking a wave of copper thefts across the globe from South Africa and the United States to Italy and Britain .
Thieves targeting power lines and electricity substations have already led to two fatalities in Britain and many serious injuries , while leaving thousands without power .
Last night I was watching a rerun of Family Guy on TBS and right before the show went to commercial , this happened :
See what they did there ?
They paused the TV show , ran a little mini-commercial for some show that no one cares about , and then returned to the last two seconds of the segment before going to commercial .
Jesus Christ .
I realize that Time Warner does n’t actually care about the people who watch their shows and that television programs are just the networks ’ way of getting people to watch advertising , but this is too much .
Do these things actually work or just piss people off in droves ?
Is there some marketing hot dog at Time Warner who thinks that Family Guy viewers want to watch the blue collar comedy stylings of Bill Engvall ?
I ’m sorry that the DVR is ruining your business model , but can you kick the bucket a little more gracefully ?

This newspaper is printed on paper made from cellulose fibers obtained from wood pulp .
The fibers are fairly large , on the order of tens of micrometers wide , and the resulting paper is fairly weak  pull on it and it tears easily .
Researchers in Sweden and Japan have developed a much stronger paper , made from much smaller fibrils of cellulose .
This “ nanopaper , ” they report in the journal Biomacromolecules , has a tensile strength greater than that of cast iron .
Marielle Henriksson of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and colleagues used enzymes and a gentle beating technique to produce fibrils on the order of tens of nanometers wide , roughly one - thousandth of the width of conventional fibers .
The nanofibrils were then mixed with water , and the suspension was vacuum filtered to make paper .
The researchers report that the papers are rather porous , yet greatly resist tearing .
They suggest that this property is a result of the high strength of individual fibrils and the way they adhere to one another .
The researchers say that if it were developed commercially , the paper might have applications in construction or as a reinforcing material .
Newborn infants are in a dream state about 70 percent of their sleep time , according to Hugo Lagercrantz , a pediatrician .
The human male releases about 66 million sperm during each … encounter .
If that act involves a woman with an egg waiting in her fallopian tubes , it 's really a crapshoot as to whether one of those sperms fertilizes her egg and fathers a child ; since it takes only one sperm to make a baby , there are 59,999,999 extras along for the ride .
And yet , many men with millions of sperm to spare are considered infertile ; a " low " sperm count is anything under 20 million .
According to the National Institutes of Health , about 1 million men who are trying to conceive are infertile , and almost half have a mass of varicose veins in the testicle that impede the usual production of sperm .
This week , researchers from the University in Bonn , Germany , announced that a minimally invasive procedure , in which tiny coils are inserted into the scrotum right next to the so - called vericocele to cut off blood supply to them , brings babies to 25 percent of the previously infertile men .
But still , testicles appear to be fragile , faulty machinery that no factory owner would tolerate .
Although we spend most of our adult life assuming that any sexual misstep results in a pregnancy , the truth is that conceiving a child is actually pretty difficult .
Without birth control , women have only a 15 percent chance of conceiving every cycle , and more than half those conceptions naturally do n't make it .
With those odds , it 's a miracle that any of us are here .
More strange , you ’d think that evolution would slam dunk reproductive organs into perfection .
After all , making babies is the very heart of passing on genes .
But no , it 's actually pretty hard to win in the game of reproductive success .
It 's difficult for evolutionary biologists to even consider this paradox because we really do n’t know much about why some people are more fertile than others .
In fact , we do n’t know all that much about what happens inside the deep dark recesses of the fallopian tubes and uterus ; if we did , problems would be more easily fixed and rates of conception by " artificial " means would presumably be higher .
Statistics about natural fertility are also unreliable because citizens in western culture have had generations of birth control to mess up any statistician 's spread sheet .
Notions about fertility are also skewed by how people report sex lives , knowledge of ovulation , use of birth control , regularity of periods , and even last missed period .
People , unfortunately , are very bad witnesses for their own bodies .
And then culture steps in and makes data gathering even harder .
We keep our sexual history secret for all sorts of reasons , delay trying to conceive for all sorts of non-reproductive reasons , and decide , for no good reason , that two is now the acceptable number of children and so stop when we could pass along lots more genes .
Meanwhile , biology keeps chugging along , trying to get sperm and egg together and plant it in the uterine wall .
The fact that humans do n’t control this process well , that there are all sorts of unwanted conceptions and all sorts of wanted but not had conceptions , only shows that although Mother Nature might not be efficient in this realm , she still has the upper hand .

Berlin- Washington Tensions US Soldiers Allegedly Mishandled Workers at German Embassy in Iraq
Germany 's top diplomat in Baghdad claims in a classified report that American soldiers mishandled three workers at the German embassy in the Iraqi capital .
The incident has created new tensions in Berlin - Washington relations .

Mumbai , July 12
Worsening energy crunch , rising fossil fuel prices and environmental concerns , and in turn their combined impact on global economic growth , have trained attention on energy options including renewables and nuclear .
While renewable energy generation is picking up rapidly , the prospects for nuclear energy remain uncertain , according to Worldwatch Institute , a Washington DC - based independent research organisation .
Global nuclear power capacity grew by less than 2,000 MW in 2007 , a figure equivalent to just one - tenth of the new wind power installed globally last year , the institute said in a new report .
Global nuclear capacity stands at 372,000 MW , but ranks as the slowest growing energy source–just 0.5 per cent in 2007 , compared to wind at 2.7 per cent .
By the end of 2007 , some 34 nuclear reactors were being built worldwide , 12 of which had been under construction for 20 years or more , the report pointed out , adding , Asia accounts for the most nuclear power plant construction with 20 new reactors currently under way .
India and China each have six reactors under construction , accounting for 8,130 MW , or more than a quarter of the nuclear capacity currently being built worldwide .
More than 124 reactors have been retired by the commercial nuclear industry since 1964 , amounting to a total of 36,800 MW of generating capacity .
Issues faced
According to the report , construction delays and cost overruns continue to plague the nuclear industry .
Engineering issues too have come to the fore .
Cost estimated for identical Westinghouse - designed nuclear plants more than doubled in 2007 to $ 12 - 18 billion , raising questions about the plant ’s economic viability and doubts as to how many electric utilities would be willing to add liabilities of that scale to their balance sheets .
The US credit rating agency Moody ’s has cautioned that many utilities are underestimating the cost of new plants and that nuclear investment could damage their credit ratings .
FRANKFURT  Austrian police arrested a 73 - year - old man who they say kept his daughter locked in a cellar for 24 years and fathered seven children with her , three of whom never emerged into daylight from their prison until now .
The woman , identified by the police as Elisabeth F. , was released by her father , Josef F. , after her eldest daughter , 19 , became ill and was taken to a hospital .
Doctors had appealed for her mother to come forward to share details of her medical history .
The authorities said she was still in serious condition .
The police referred to the family name by initial only as is standard procedure in criminal cases in Austria .
In its macabre details , the case carries echoes of the kidnapping of Natascha Kampusch , an Austrian schoolgirl who was held in a windowless basement cell for eight years before escaping in August 2006 .
This latest case , which unfolded in a nondescript , three - story apartment house in Amstetten , a town 80 miles west of Vienna , is , if possible , even harder to comprehend .
Money Can’t Buy Time
The average human being will be substantially richer in 50 years , just as the average American today has a real income three times what it was in 1955 .
But the average human being will not have much more time in 50 years than today ; and life expectancy has increased by only 10 percent in the U.S. since 1955 , so for most people time has become relatively scarce compared to money .
Not surprisingly , we feel more stressed for time than ever before — the opportunity cost of time has risen compared to the opportunity cost of goods .
In fact , people with higher incomes usually express more time stress than those with lower incomes .
It ’s not only that higher - income people typically work more hours per week ; even those who do n’t work at all express greater feelings of being rushed than do poorer people .
The reason is that it takes time to spend money and consume goods — you ca n’t inject a vacation in Provence into your bloodstream — you have to go there , lie on the beach at St. Tropez , go to the Picasso museum in Antibes , and tour the perfume factories of Grasse .
So the next time you hear a wealthy person complaining about having no time , tell him / her that there ’s a simple alternative — give away money .
Of course , a person who does that will then complain that his / her income is insufficient .
Time or money : one or the other is always relatively scarce and always generates complaints !

Secret government documents detailing the UK's policies towards fighting global terrorist funding , drugs trafficking and money laundering have been found on a London - bound train and handed to ' The Independent on Sunday ' .
The government papers , left on a train destined for Waterloo station , on Wednesday , contain criticism of countries such as Iran that are signed up to the global Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) , an inter - governmental body created to combat financial crime and the financing of terrorism .
The confidential files outline how the trade and banking systems can be manipulated to finance illicit weapons of mass destruction in Iran .
They spell out methods to fund terrorists , and address the potential fraud of commercial websites and international internet payment systems .
The files also highlight the weakness of HM Revenue & Customs ' ( HMRC ) IT systems , which track financial fraud .

The Independent on Sunday has returned the documents , and will divulge no details contained in them .
This latest security gaffe involving top - level government documents is the second breach in the past week and is hugely embarrassing to Gordon Brown .
The Government is already investigating the loss of other files by a senior intelligence officer in the Cabinet Office , who is understood to have been suspended .
This official also left documents , containing a damning assessment of Iraqi forces and a Home Office report on " al - Qa'ida vulnerabilities " , on a train .
They were handed to the BBC .
The Government has been hit by a series of security breaches in the past year .
HMRC lost two computer disks containing the personal details of 25 million people , while the details of three million driving - test candidates were mislaid .
Alistair Darling , the Chancellor , who is in Japan at the G8 meeting , has been told of the latest debacle , and his department insists steps are being taken to tighten security procedures .
Last night , a spokesman said the Treasury regretted the latest incident : " We are extremely concerned about what has happened and will be taking steps to ensure it does n't happen in the future . "
Opposition politicians reacted to the latest news with astonishment .
Baroness Neville - Jones , shadow security minister , said the Government needed to " get a grip " on the issue of protecting sensitive data , and lamented " yet another example of a lapse in discipline " .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " This latest failure is extremely damaging to the Government 's fight against terrorism as no one knows where the information may have ended up .
This is another appalling embarrassment for an accident - prone government . "

The discovery of these confidential files is all the more embarrassing as they relate to a week - long global financial crime conference , organised by the FATF , which starts in London tomorrow .
Sir James Sassoon , the Treasury 's ambassador to the City , is president of FATF , the Paris - based watchdog , which has 32 members around the world .
The revelations will come as a blow to Sir James , who is hosting this week 's gathering of 450 of the world 's leading anti-crime experts .
He was unavailable for comment but sources say he is furious about the latest security breach .
It is particularly galling as Britain has had a successful year holding the FATF presidency .
The files include briefing notes for the closed conference – to be held at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre – and draft speeches to be delivered by British officials at No 11 Downing Street on Wednesday at a reception for the most senior FATF representatives .
Officials at the reception will include the Deputy Assistant Secretary to the US Treasury , Daniel Glaser , and Antonio Gustavo Rodrigues , Brazil 's incoming FATF president .
The FATF has already expressed its concern that Iran lacks an effective system to prevent money laundering .
It wants Iran to criminalise the financing of terrorism and stop illicit money being diverted to its nuclear programme .
The watchdog says this is a significant vulnerability within the international financial system .
It is negotiating with countries such as China , Pakistan , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Burma and the Comoros on their anti-terrorism policies .
Misplaced secrets : Lost laptops , disks and dossiers
The British government has an ignoble history of misplaced sensitive files , in paper and electronic form .
The most serious loss of sensitive data came in 1990 when a laptop containing plans for the first Gulf War was stolen from the boot of a car in west London .
The computer contained detailed information about how the military planned to remove Saddam Hussein 's forces from Kuwait .
The RAF officer responsible for the laptop was court - martialled , but the secrets were never leaked .
In 2000 a laptop was stolen from the home of Armed Forces minister John Spellar , the man responsible for Britain 's nuclear secrets .
The burglar ignored two red boxes containing potentially sensitive documents .
That same year , an MI6 officer left a laptop in a taxi after a night drinking in a bar .
Another was snatched when an MI5 officer put it down while buying a ticket at a Tube station .
A Royal Navy laptop was stolen in Manchester in 2006 , and an Army laptop containing data on 500 people was stolen from a recruiting office in Edinburgh in 2005 .
In January 2008 , a laptop with details of 600,000 people interested in joining the armed forces went missing .
The theft caused concern in light of a terrorist plot in which Muslim extremists planned to kill a British serviceman .
The MoD then banned staff from taking home laptops with unencrypted data .
In April , a thief stole the laptop of an Army captain from under his chair at a McDonald 's near the MoD .
And only last week , secret files on the threat from al - Qa'ida were left on a train .

JUNE 17 -- As she was attempting to put on a Victoria 's Secret thong , a Los Angeles woman claims that a decorative metallic piece flew off the garment and struck her in the eye , causing injuries and a new product liability lawsuit against the underwear giant .
Macrida Patterson , 52 , alleges that she was hurt last May by a defective ' low - rise v-string ' from the Victoria 's Secret ' Sexy Little Thing ' line , according to a lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court .
A copy of her June 9 complaint , which does not specify monetary damages , can be found here .
Patterson 's lawyer , Jason Buccat , told TSG that a ' design problem ' caused the decorative piece to come loose and strike Patterson in the eye , causing damage to her cornea .
He added that the eye injury , which caused Patterson to miss a few days of work , will be ' affecting her the rest of her life . '
Patterson is a traffic officer with L.A. 's Department of Transportation .
Prior to the lawsuit 's filing , Victoria 's Secret officials asked to examine the garment and the decorative piece , but that request was rejected by Patterson 's counsel .
For those unfamiliar with ' v - strings , ' the undergarment is the Victoria 's Secret variant on the ' g - string , ' which has long been favored in the battle against visible panty lines .

It took me long enough with all of the work that was going on at the same time , but I would like to present you the ability to test out KDE 4.1 Beta 1 in Kubuntu Hardy right now !
It seems we have worked out a majority of the quirks , but I ca n’t promise you that you may not get an overwrite issue with dpkg just yet .
I do think we got them all covered , but you may have something nobody else does , so we did n’t catch it .
We have been testing these packages since Saturday / Sunday and I have updated them as people reported issues .
To top it off , I have also included the KDE 4 PIM packages that contain applications such as Kontact , KMail , KOrganizer , Akregator , and more !
The package name to get all of that is kdepim - kde4 .
So , to install and test these new packages , please add the following to your Kubuntu Hardy /etc/apt/sources.list :
deb http : // ppa.launchpad.net / kubuntu-members-kde4 / ubuntu hardy main
Once you have done that and you already have a previous KDE 4 version installed , type the following in Konsole :
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get dist - upgrade
Otherwise type the following :
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get install kubuntu - kde4 - desktop
Note you may need to install kdebase - runtime - data - common in order to get Application directory icons under the Kickoff menu .
To install the KDE 4 PIM packages , type the following in Konsole :
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get install kdepim - kde4
I would recommend that you backup your ~/. kde4 directory if there is anything that you might need , and then delete the ~/.kde4 directory to limit any quirks you may receive .
After you have done this , update away , reboot for good measure , select KDE 4 from KDM , and enjoy !
I ask that you join us in # kubuntu - kde4 on IRC ( Freenode ) to discuss any issues that you may have .
We can all work together to see if the issue we are seeing is a packaging / Kubuntu only / KDE 4.1 Beta 1 only issue and if not , file some reports on bugs.kde.org .
Thanks everyone for your patience !
I will continue to work on the extragear packages and roll them out within the next day or so .
Those should be fairly easy 🙂
Have fun !

Authoritas : One Student 's Harvard Admissions and the Founding of the Facebook Era
ISBN 9781606690000
Aaron Greenspan
About the Book Aaron Greenspan was just like any other recent Harvard graduate until the day he read that his invention , a web site called The Facebook , was worth billions of dollars �and someone else was taking the credit .
Trying to find the rationale behind an unbelievable tale of ingenuity , triumph and betrayal , Greenspan sat down to write his story , and emerged with a book that follows a boy and his autistic brother from public school to the hyper - competitive college admissions process to the gates of Harvard Yard and beyond .
A true story that sheds light on the American educational system , the immense challenges of coping with autism , and of course , the astronomical growth of The Facebook , Authoritas is an engrossing account of life that any student , parent , teacher or entrepreneur will relate to .
About the Author Aaron started Think Computer Corporation and Think Computer Foundation from his bedroom in Shaker Heights , Ohio while attending Shaker Heights High School .
He graduated cum laude from Harvard College in three years ( Advanced Standing ) with an A.B. in Economics in 2004 .
While at Harvard , he invented The Facebook .
What 's an Interbook ?
An Interbook is a printed book that also has a web site just like this one .
Unlike typical book web sites , Interbook sites feature links that are relevant to each and every page of a book , including primary sources .
Readers can also discuss Interbooks with authors or amongst themselves through interactive comments .
Who needs them and why ?
Good for Authors Authors making controversial or groundbreaking claims in their books no longer need to merely hope that readers will believe them .
With a scanner and a few clicks , they can lead readers directly to their primary sources .
Good for Readers Interbooks do n't need long paper bibliographies or sections for notes since they 're already on - line in greater detail , so they require less paper , driving down the retail price that readers pay at the bookstore .
Good for Publishers
Like movie trailers , Interbook sites give internet visitors who might not have otherwise known about a book a taste of what they can expect .
Since the sites can be restricted to print edition owners past a certain page , they incentivize the purchase of paper books , but with Interbook sources exclusively available on - line , less paper is needed .
This means lower printing costs and a higher number of books per carton , which can lead to higher profits .
Good for the Environment More books per carton means less paper and cardboard has to be wasted in the manufacturing process , and less fuel is necessary to transport input materials and books through the distribution channel .
Interbooks can save hundreds of thousands of pages of paper per book .
More Fun Interbooks let readers talk to one another and learn more about the topics presented in the book without having to scour the internet for information .
More Reliable
With the ability to easily cite and view actual sources on each page , you can be more certain that the non-fiction Interbook you 're reading is accurate and verifiable .
More Up - To - Date
For books that speak to current events , it 's easy for authors and publishers to add Interbook links that tie material into what 's happening in the present -- not just the past .

What we 're facing
For over 200 years , humanity has powered itself with fossil fuels like oil and coal .
We ’ve seen an enormous amount of development and progress — but at an incredible cost .
When burnt , fossil fuels all release carbon dioxide , which acts like a blanket around the earth .
As the amount of carbon dioxide increases , the planet warms up .
Sea levels rise .
Extreme weather becomes more commonplace .
A whole range of impacts — from wildfires , to flooding , to extreme heat and drought — become more likely and more severe .
If we do nothing , these impacts will worsen .
Large swaths of the world ’s population will likely migrate .
Entire island nations may disappear .
The magnitude and range of impacts means that almost every human on Earth will be affected , if they ’re not already .
Low - income communities and people of color will be hit the hardest .
But change is still possible .
Science suggests that we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change if we limit warming to under 2 ºC .
To do so , we need a much cleaner economy by mid-century or sooner .
Fossil fuel companies need to stop preventing climate action .
And leaders in the United States need to act .
You can help .
Jeddah , Abu Dhabi , Feb 25 | Updated : Feb 26 2008 , 06:02 am hrs
Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said on Monday near - record Gulf Arab inflation would fall " significantly " were the oil producers to drop their dollar pegs , in contradiction to Saudi policy .
The pegs restrict the Gulf 's ability to fight inflation by forcing them to shadow US monetary policy at a time when the Fed is cutting rates to ward off recession and Gulf economies are surging on a near five - fold jump in oil prices since 2002 .
Rifts are growing across the world 's top oil - exporting region on how to tackle inflation which hit a 27 - year peak of 7 % in Saudi Arabia in January and a 19 - year peak of 9.3 % in the United Arab Emirates in 2006 , the most recent figure .
" In the short term free floating ... will not fully dissipate inflationary pressure , although it would significantly do so , " Greenspan told an investment conference in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia 's second - largest city .
Saudi and UAE central bank chiefs spoke in favour on Monday of retaining dollar pegs , while Qatar 's prime minister advocated regional currency reform to avert possible unilateral revaluations designed to curb inflation .
" The economies of the Gulf and the United States are completely out of sync and that is exposing the shortcomings of the dollar peg , " said Simon Williams , Middle East economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Dubai .
" Against a backdrop of inflation , high oil prices and low interest rates the debate over currency reform has to take on greater urgency , " he said .
Floating the Saudi riyal would not be appropriate for an economy that relies on oil exports , Saudi Central Bank Governor Hamad Saud al - Sayyari told Arabiya Television in response to Greenspan 's suggestion .
" Floating is beneficial when the economy and exports are diverse ... as for the kingdom it remains reliant on the export of a single commodity , " Sayyari said .
Dollar pegs were helping Gulf states attract foreign investments , UAE Central Bank Governor Sultan Nasser al - Suweidi added during a speech in the UAE capital , Abu Dhabi .
" They did very well for our economies because it has led to more capital flows , " Suweidi said on Monday .
Still , " Gulf governments should consider the implication of such a move in the long term , " Greenspan said of the idea of floating their currencies .
Qatar , contending with the region 's highest inflation , is studying revaluing its riyal among options to combat inflation that hit 13.74 % in the fourth quarter , Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al - Thani told Reuters late on Saturday .

Suddenly , we had far more readers than ever before , and they were reading at a record clip .
Visits actually doubled on certain landing pages , and more than a few ho - hum stories attracted an audience worthy of a Pulitzer Prize winner .
Or so it seemed .
As it turns out , much of this traffic was driven by the new malware scanner from AVG Technologies .
Six months ago , AVG acquired Exploit Prevention Labs and its LinkScanner , a tool that automatically scans search engine results before you click on them .
If you search Google , for instance , and ten results turn up , it visits all ten links to ensure they 're malware free .
Then , in February , AVG paired LinkScanner with its anti-virus engine , which has about 70 million active users worldwide .
The company estimates that 20 million machines have upgraded to its new security suite , AVG version 8 , and this has already cooked up enough ghost clicks to skew traffic not only on The Reg but any number of other sites as well .
Adam Beale , who runs a UK - based internet consultancy , says that across his small stable of clients , traffic has spiked as much as 80 per cent on some sites .
And this is more than just an inconvenience .
After all , sites live and die by their traffic numbers .
And net resources are n't free .
" Although [ the AVG LinkScanner ] might be good for the security of users , it 's a real pain for website owners and webmasters , " Beale tells us , having blogged about this growing problem .
" It 's causing people to think their traffic is increasing , costing those who pay for bandwidth , and wasting disk space with large amounts of unnecessary lines in log files . "
One of his clients , Beale says , normally pulls in 140GB of bandwidth a month , and for June , he predicts a 5 per cent jump .
When we spoke to AVG chief of research Roger Thompson earlier this week , he was unaware of these issues .
But he defended the role of LinkScanner , which he designed while serving as CTO of Exploit Prevention Labs .
" There 's so much hacking activity going on the web .
The only way to really tell what 's there is to go and have a look , " he told us .
" I do n't want to sound flip about this , but if you want to make omelettes , you have to break some eggs . "
But what about webmasters ?
Webmasters deal with robot traffic and other rogue visits all the time .
But this is a little different .
In an effort to fool even the sneakiest malware exploits , LinkScanner does its best to imitate real user clicks - which means most webmasters are completely unaware of the problem .
At the moment , there is a way of filtering AVG traffic from log files .
But it 's unclear whether this method would bag legitimate traffic as well .
And Thompson suggests that - in the name of high security - AVG may make changes that prevent such filtering .
That could destroy web analytics as we know it .
" A situation like this where there is in effect false traffic , where something is generating what is bogus data , leads to wrong budget decisions and marketing activities , " says Barry Parshall , director of product management at WebTrends , a popular web analytics firm .
" I completely get the value proposition [ of LinkScanner ] , but it would be responsible of them to identify themselves , with agent code or whatever it might be , so legitimate businesses can serve their customers properly . "

The war in Iraq is of course a political issue , both domestically and internationally , and so it is natural that much of the discussion about the war centers on its various political ramifications .
But in these heated debates on policy , strategy , funding , etc. , there is always a danger of losing sight of the most overwhelmingly important aspect of the conflict : its effects on actual human beings , the suffering it imposes on our fellow creatures .
The reality of war is written on the bodies � and seared into the anguished psyches � of the individuals who experience it .
That is what war is , that is where it actually exists � in blood , in bone , in the synapses that carry the electric fire of human consciousness .
A new report from Fallujah � the Guernica of the Iraq War � brings this home most forcefully .
Two of the great witnesses of this war �
Dahr Jamail and his collaborator , Ali al - Fadhily � present disturbing evidence of how the use of chemical weapons against the people of Fallujah during the brutal decimation the city in 2004 continues to bear horrific fruit today :
Babies born in Fallujah are showing illnesses and deformities on a scale never seen before , doctors and residents say .
The new cases , and the number of deaths among children , have risen after " special weaponry " was used in the two massive bombing campaigns in Fallujah in 2004 .
After denying it at first , the Pentagon admitted in November 2005 that white phosphorous , a restricted incendiary weapon , was used a year earlier in Fallujah .
In addition , depleted uranium ( DU ) munitions , which contain low - level radioactive waste , were used heavily in Fallujah .
The Pentagon admits to having used 1,200 tons of DU in Iraq thus far .
Many doctors believe DU to be the cause of a severe increase in the incidence of cancer in Iraq , as well as among US veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War and through the current occupation .
" We saw all the colors of the rainbow coming out of the exploding American shells and missiles , " Ali Sarhan , a 50 - year - old teacher who lived through the two US sieges of 2004 told IPS .
" I saw bodies that turned into bones and coal right after they were exposed to bombs that we learned later to be phosphorus .
The most worrying is that many of our women have suffered loss of their babies , and some had babies born with deformations . "
" I had two children who had brain damage from birth , " 28 - year - old Hayfa ' Shukur told IPS .
" My husband has been detained by the Americans since November 2004 and so I had to take the children around by myself to hospitals and private clinics .
They died .
I spent all our savings and borrowed a considerable amount of money . "
Shukur said doctors told her that it was use of the restricted weapons that caused her children 's brain damage and subsequent deaths , " but none of them had the courage to give me a written report . "
" Many babies were born with major congenital malformations , " a pediatric doctor , speaking on condition of anonymity , told IPS .
" These infants include many with heart defects , cleft lip or palate , Down 's syndrome , and limb defects . "
� The Fallujah General Hospital administration was unwilling to give any statistics on deformed babies , but one doctor volunteered to speak on condition of anonymity -- for fear of reprisals if seen to be critical of the administration .
" Maternal exposure to toxins and radioactive material can lead to miscarriage and frequent abortions , still birth , and congenital malformation , " the doctor told IPS .
There have been many such cases , and the government " did not move to contain the damage , or present any assistance to the hospital whatsoever .
These cases need intensive international efforts that provide the highest and most recent technologies that we will not have here in a hundred years , " he added .
This is the fate of the actual human beings in Fallujah .
Behind all the debates and commentary , the think - tank wonkery , the campaign rhetoric , the academic studies and the witlessrantings of TV talking heads , this is the war : a young woman wandering through a ruined city , carrying her broken , dying children to hospitals left without medicine or gear .
The fate of Hayfa ' Shukur is a direct continuation of the 2004 assault on the city , when , as I noted in a Moscow Times column at the time :
One of the first moves in this magnificent feat of arms was the destruction and capture of medical centers .
Twenty doctors � and their patients , including women and children � were killed in an airstrike on one major clinic , the UN Information Service reports , while the city 's main hospital was seized in the early hours of the ground assault .
Why ?
Because these places of healing could be used as " propaganda centers , " the Pentagon's " information warfare " specialists told the NY Times .
Unlike the first attack on Fallujah last spring , there was to be no unseemly footage of gutted children bleeding to death on hospital beds .
This time � except for NBC 's brief , heavily - edited , quickly - buried clip of the usual lone " bad apple " shooting a wounded Iraqi prisoner � the visuals were rigorously scrubbed .
So while Americans saw stories of rugged " Marlboro Men " winning the day against Satan , they were spared shots of engineers cutting off water and electricity to the city � a flagrant war crime under the Geneva Conventions , as CounterPunch notes , but standard practice throughout the occupation .
Nor did pictures of attack helicopters gunning down civilians trying to escape across the Euphrates River � including a family of five � make the TV news , despite the eyewitness account of an AP journalist .
Nor were tender American sensibilities subjected to the sight of phosphorous shells bathing enemy fighters � and nearby civilians � with unquenchable chemical fire , literally melting their skin , as the Washington Post reports .
Nor did they see the fetus being blown out of the body of Artica Salim when her home was bombed during the " softening - up attacks " that raged relentlessly � and unnoticed � in the closing days of George W. Bush 's presidential campaign , the Scotland Sunday Herald reports .
I began that 2004 piece with a quote from Italo Calvino , which to me is one of the very best encapsulations of the horror , and hope , of our human condition :
" The inferno�is what is already here , the inferno where we live every day , that we form by being together .
There are two ways to escape suffering it .
The first is easy for many : accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it .
The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension : seek and learn to recognize who and what , in the midst of the inferno , are not inferno , then make them endure , give them space . "
Read an extract from the author ’s book Wild Law .
IT WAS THE SUDDEN RUSH of the goats ’ bodies against the side of the boma that woke him .
Picking up a spear and stick , the Kenyan farmer slipped out into the warm night and crept toward the pen .
All he could see was the spotted , sloping hindquarters of the animal trying to force itself between the poles to get at the goats — but it was enough .
He drove his spear deep into the hyena .
The elders who gathered under the meeting tree to deliberate on the matter were clearly unhappy with the farmer ’s explanation .
A man appointed by the traditional court to represent the interests of the hyena had testified that his careful examination of the body had revealed that the deceased was a female who was still suckling pups .
He argued that given the prevailing drought and the hyena ’s need to nourish her young , her behavior in attempting to scavenge food from human settlements was reasonable and that it was wrong to have killed her .
The elders then cross-examined the farmer carefully .
Did he appreciate , they asked , that such killings were contrary to customary law ?
Had he considered the hyena ’s situation and whether or not she had caused harm ?
Could he not have simply driven her away ?
Eventually the elders ordered the man ’s clan to pay compensation for the harm done by driving more than one hundred of their goats ( a fortune in that community ) into the bush , where they could be eaten by the hyenas and other wild carnivores .
The story , told to me by a Kenyan friend , illustrates African customary law ’s concern with restorative justice rather than retribution .
Wrongdoing is seen as a symptom of a breakdown in relationships within the wider community , and the elders seek to restore the damaged relationship rather than focusing on identifying and punishing the wrongdoer .
The verdict of a traditional African court regarding hyenacide may seem of mere anthropological interest to contemporary Americans .
In most of today ’s legal systems , decisions that harm ecological communities have to be challenged primarily on the basis of whether or not the correct procedures have been followed .
Yet consider how much greater the prospects of survival would be for most of life on Earth if mechanisms existed for imposing collective responsibility and liability on human communities and for restoring damaged relations with the larger natural community .
Imagine if we had elders with a deep understanding of the lore of the wild who spoke for the Earth as well as for humans .
If we did , how might they order us to compensate for , say , the anticipated destruction of the entire Arctic ecosystem because of global climate change , to restore relations with the polar bears and other people and creatures who depend on that ecosystem ?
How many polluting power plants and vehicles would it be fair to sacrifice to make amends ?
“ SO WHAT WOULD A RADICALLY DIFFERENT law - driven consciousness look like ? ”
The question was posed over three decades ago by a University of Southern California law professor as his lecture drew to a close .
“ One in which Nature had rights , ” he continued .
“ Yes , rivers , lakes , trees . . . .
How could such a posture in law affect a community ’s view of itself ? ”
Professor Christopher Stone may as well have announced that he was an alien life form .
Rivers and trees are objects , not subjects , in the eyes of the law and are by definition incapable of holding rights .
His speculations created an uproar .
Stone stepped away from that lecture a little dazed by the response from the class but determined to back up his argument .
He realized that for nature to have rights the law would have to be changed so that , first , a suit could be brought in the name of an aspect of nature , such as a river ; second , a polluter could be held liable for harming a river ; and third , judgments could be made that would benefit a river .
Stone quickly identified a pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court against a decision of the Ninth Circuit that raised these issues .
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had found that the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund was not “ aggrieved ” or “ adversely affected ” by the proposed development of the Mineral King Valley in the Sierra Nevada Mountains by Walt Disney Enterprises , Inc .
This decision meant that the Sierra Club did not have “ standing ” so the court did n’t need to consider the merits of the matter .
Clearly , if the Mineral King Valley itself had been recognized as having rights , it would have been an adversely affected party and would have had the necessary standing .
Fortuitously , Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas was writing a preface to the next edition of the Southern California Law Review .
Stone ’s seminal “ Should Trees Have Standing ?
Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects ” ( “ Trees ” ) was hurriedly squeezed into the journal and read by Justice Douglas before the Court issued its judgment .
In “ Trees , ” Stone argued that courts should grant legal standing to guardians to represent the rights of nature , in much the same way as guardians are appointed to represent the rights of infants .
In order to do so , the law would have to recognize that nature was not just a conglomeration of objects that could be owned , but was a subject that itself had legal rights and the standing to be represented in the courts to enforce those rights .
The article eventually formed the basis for a famous dissenting judgment by Justice Douglas in the 1972 case of Sierra Club v. Morton in which he expressed the opinion that “ contemporary public concern for protecting nature ’s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation . ”
Perhaps one of the most important things about “ Trees ” is that it ventured beyond the accepted boundaries of law as we know it and argued that the conceptual framework for law in the United States ( and by analogy , elsewhere ) required further evolution and expansion .
Stone began by addressing the initial reaction that such ideas are outlandish .
Throughout legal history , as he pointed out , each extension of legal rights had previously been unthinkable .
The emancipation of slaves and the extension of civil rights to African Americans , women , and children were once rejected as absurd or dangerous by authorities .
The Founding Fathers , after all , were hardly conscious of the hypocrisy inherent in proclaiming the inalienable rights of all men while simultaneously denying basic rights to children , women , and to African and Native Americans .
“ Trees ” has since become a classic for students of environmental law , but after three decades its impact on law in the United States has been limited .
After it was written , the courts made it somewhat easier for citizens to litigate on behalf of other species and the environment by expanding the powers and responsibilities of authorities to act as trustees of areas used by the public ( e.g. , navigable waters , beaches , and parks ) .
Unfortunately , these gains have been followed in more recent years by judicial attempts to restrict the legal standing of environmental groups .
Damages for harm to the environment are now recoverable in some cases and are sometimes applied for the benefit of the environment .
However , these changes fall far short of what Stone advocated for in “ Trees . ”
The courts still have not recognized that nature has directly enforceable rights .
COMMUNITIES HAVE ALWAYS USED LAWS to express the ideals to which they aspire and to regulate how power is exercised .
Law is also a social tool that is usually shaped and wielded most effectively by the powerful .
Consequently , law tends to entrench a society ’s fundamental idea of itself and of how the world works .
So , for example , even when American society began to regard slavery as morally abhorrent , it was not able to peaceably end the practice because the fundamental concept that slaves were property had been hard - wired into the legal system .
The abolition of slavery required not only that the enfranchised recognize that slaves were entitled to the same rights as other humans , but also a political effort to change the laws that denied those rights .
It took both the Civil War and the Thirteenth Amendment to outlaw slavery .
The Thirteenth Amendment , in turn , played a role in changing American society ’s idea of what was acceptable , thereby providing the bedrock for the subsequent civil rights movement .
In the eyes of American law today , most of the community of life on Earth remains mere property , natural “ resources ” to be exploited , bought , and sold just as slaves were .
This means that environmentalists are seldom seen as activists fighting to uphold fundamental rights , but rather as criminals who infringe upon the property rights of others .
It also means that actions that damage the ecosystems and the natural processes on which life depends , such as Earth ’s climate , are poorly regulated .
Climate change is an obvious and dramatic symptom of the failure of human government to regulate human behavior in a manner that takes account of the fact that human welfare is directly dependent on the health of our planet and cannot be achieved at its expense .
In the scientific world there has been more progress .
It ’s been almost forty years since James Lovelock first proposed the “ Gaia hypothesis ” : a theory that Earth regulates itself in a manner that keeps the composition of the atmosphere and average temperatures within a range conducive to life .
Derided or dismissed by most people at the time , the Gaia hypothesis is now accepted by many as scientific theory .
In 2001 , more than a thousand scientists signed a declaration that begins “ The Earth is a self - regulating system made up from all life , including humans , and from the oceans , the atmosphere and the surface rocks , ” a statement that would have been unthinkable for most scientists when “ Trees ” was written .
The acceptance of Lovelock ’s hypothesis can be understood as part of a drift in the scientific world away from a mechanistic understanding of the universe toward the realization that no aspect of nature can be understood without looking at it within the context of the systems of which it forms a part .
Unfortunately , this insight has been slow to penetrate the world of law and politics .
But what if we were to imagine a society in which our purpose was to act as good citizens of the Earth as a whole ?
What might a governance system look like if it were established to protect the rights of all members of a particular biological community , instead of only humans ?
Cicero pointed out that each of our rights and freedoms must be limited in order that others may be free .
It is far past time that we should consider limiting the rights of humans so they cannot unjustifiably prevent nonhuman members of a community from playing their part .
Any legal system designed to give effect to modern scientific understandings ( or , indeed , to many cultures ’ ancient understandings ) of how the universe functions would have to prohibit humans from driving other species to extinction or deliberately destroying the functioning of major ecosystems .
In the absence of such regulatory mechanisms , an oppressive and self - destructive regime will inevitably emerge .
As indeed it has .
In particular , we should examine the fact that , in the eyes of the law , corporations are considered people and entitled to civil rights .
We often forget that corporations are only a few centuries old and have been continually evolving since their inception .
Imagine what could be done if we changed the fiduciary responsibilities of directors to include obligations not only to profitability but also to the whole natural world , and if we imposed collective personal liability on corporate managers and stockholders to restore any damage that they cause to natural communities .
Imagine if landowners who abused and degraded land lost the right to use it .
In an Earth - centered community , all institutions through which humans act collectively would be designed to require behavior that is socially responsible from the perspective of the whole community .
A society whose concern is to maintain the integrity or wholeness of the Earth must also refine its ideas about what is “ right ” and “ wrong . ”
We may find it more useful to condone or disapprove of human conduct by considering the extent to which an action increases or decreases the health of the whole community and the quality or intimacy of the relationships between its members .
As Aldo Leopold ’s famous land ethic states , “ a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity , stability , and beauty of the biotic community .
It is wrong when it tends otherwise . ”
From this perspective , individual and collective human rights must be contextualized within , and balanced against , the rights of the other members and communities of Earth .
ON SEPTEMBER 19 , 2006 , the Tamaqua Borough of Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania , passed a sewage sludge ordinance that recognizes natural communities and ecosystems within the borough as legal persons for the purposes of enforcing civil rights .
It also strips corporations that engage in the land application of sludge of their rights to be treated as “ persons ” and consequently of their civil rights .
One of its effects is that the borough or any of its residents may file a lawsuit on behalf of an ecosystem to recover compensatory and punitive damages for any harm done by the land application of sewage sludge .
Damages recovered in this way must be paid to the borough and used to restore those ecosystems and natural communities .
According to Thomas Linzey , the lawyer from the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund who assisted Tamaqua Borough , this ordinance marks the first time in the history of municipalities in the United States that something like this has happened .
Coming after more than 150 years of judicially sanctioned expansion of the legal powers of corporations in the U.S. , this ordinance is more than extraordinary — it is revolutionary .
In a world where the corporation is king and all forms of life other than humans are objects in the eyes of the law , this is a small community ’s Boston tea party .
In Africa , nongovernmental organizations in eleven countries are also asserting local community rights in order to promote the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development .
Members of the African Biodiversity Network ( ABN ) have coined the term “ cultural biodiversity ” to emphasize that knowledge and practices that support biodiversity are embedded in cultural tradition .
The ABN works with rural communities and schools to recover and spread traditional knowledge and practices .
This is part of a wider effort to build local communities , protect the environment by encouraging those communities to value , retain , and build on traditional African cosmologies , and to govern themselves as part of a wider Earth community .
These small examples , emerging shoots of what might be termed “ Earth democracy , ” are pressing upward despite the odds .
It may well be that Earth - centered legal systems will have to grow organically out of human - scale communities , and communities of communities , that understand that they must function as integrated parts of wider natural communities .
In the face of climate change and other enormous environmental challenges , our future as a species depends on those people who are creating the legal and political spaces within which our connection to the rest of our community here on Earth is recognized .
The day will come when the failure of our laws to recognize the right of a river to flow , to prohibit acts that destabilize Earth ’s climate , or to impose a duty to respect the intrinsic value and right to exist of all life will be as reprehensible as allowing people to be bought and sold .
We will only flourish by changing these systems and claiming our identity , as well as assuming our responsibilities , as members of the Earth community .

PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Anheuser - Busch Cos Inc plans to reject InBev NV ’s unsolicited $ 46.3 billion takeover offer , saying it undervalues the company , a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday .

REUTERS / Fred Prouser
Anheuser - Busch , the brewer of Budweiser beer , and InBev , the maker of Stella Artois and Beck ’s , could not be immediately reached for comment .
In rebuffing InBev ’s offer , Anheuser - Busch plans to map out its own restructuring plan soon that would include the sale of the company ’s theme park operations , The Wall Street Journal reported .
The plan also would include layoffs , more than $ 500 million in cost - cutting efforts and the sale of Anheuser - Busch ’s packaging unit , the New York Times added .
“ It sounds dead - on .
It ’s what we were expecting .
The interesting thing is what happens next . ” said Tom Pirko , president of Bevmark , a Santa Barbara , California - based beverage industry consulting firm .
The timing of Anheuser - Busch ’s restructuring announcement was not clear , but the source said the company ’s board viewed InBev ’s $ 65 - per - share offer as too low .
The source declined to be identified by name because the source was not authorized to speak to the media .
Pirko said a rejection from Anheuser sets the stage for InBev to either raise its bid or take its bid directly to shareholders -- options he said InBev is likely to pursue .
Analysts had speculated InBev may have to raise its offer by more than $ 3 billion , to around $ 70 a share , to woo its shareholders into a deal to create the world ’s largest brewer , making a quarter of the world ’s beer .
InBev is prepared to take its bid directly to Anheuser - Busch shareholders through a tender offer , the Wall Street Journal said .
InBev has yet to decide whether to pursue such a course , however .
“ It would be surprising to think that Brito , with a bone already in his mouth , would take it out , ” said Pirko , referring to InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito .
Anheuser - Busch has few takeover defenses to thwart a hostile offer , making it feasible for an unwanted suitor to acquire the company .
InBev on Wednesday prodded Anheuser - Busch by saying it remained available to discuss the bid , but stressed that time was “ of the essence . ”
InBev said it had commitment letters for the financing for the deal and has paid $ 50 million in commitment fees to a 10 - bank lending group .
It has been two weeks since the Belgian - Brazilian brewer launched its bid for Anheuser - Busch , but the maker of Budweiser and Michelob has yet to respond .
Analysts have said that if Anheuser puts off negotiations for too long , InBev may just take its offer directly to shareholders in a hostile bid .
That could be bad for Anheuser , analysts have said , since InBev ’s bid would give shareholders a significant premium that Anheuser would have trouble matching on its own .
The $ 65 - a- share offer , which tops Anheuser ’s all - time high , is 24 percent higher than the stock ’s closing price the day before reports of merger talks surfaced , and 35 percent higher than the average share price over the preceding month .
Shares of Anheuser - Busch closed on Wednesday at $ 61.76 , up 63 cents , or 1 percent , on the New York Stock Exchange .
BAD TIMING FOR THEME PARK SALE
Any reorganization is expected to include “ scores ” of layoffs , which could anger unions and local politicians in St. Louis , who had pressured Anheuser - Busch to reject the bid in an effort to save jobs , the New York Times reported .
If Anheuser - Busch tries to sell its 10 amusement , marine and water parks -- including SeaWorld and Busch Gardens -- that drew more than 22 million customers last year , it may find it difficult to find a buyer in the weak U.S. economy , analysts have said .
Busch Entertainment Corp , Anheuser ’s theme park unit , last year accounted for almost 8 percent of the company ’s sales and net income at $ 1.27 billion and $ 162.9 million , respectively .
Lehman Brothers valued Anheuser ’s theme park business at $ 2.9 billion .
Historically , such assets have attracted bids topping 10 times cash flow , but the sputtering economy could weigh on any sale price and multiples may hover in the high single digits , analysts said .
Analysts and investors had expected the Anheuser - Busch to respond slowly as it explores a restructuring , or other options , which may include trying to buy out Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo .
Anheuser owns 50.2 percent of Corona - brewer Modelo , but has no management control
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway is Anheuser ’s second - largest shareholder , told CNBC on Wednesday that he viewed the beer battle as “ an interesting spectator sport ” but had not thrown his support behind either side .
Barclays Global Investors , the funds arm of British bank Barclays Plc , is the largest shareholder in Anheuser .

Microsoft has filed 21 lawsuits in 14 U.S. states against resellers in which it alleges they engaged in the sale of pirated software , it said Tuesday .
Some of the cases were caught thanks to Microsoft 's Windows Genuine Advantage or Office Genuine Advantage programs in which the copy of the Windows operating system or Office suite on a user 's computer is electronically authenticated online .
Microsoft began rolling out Windows Genuine Advantage in April 2006 .
Others lawsuits were sparked by calls to Microsoft 's anti-piracy hotline , the company said .
Almost all the lawsuits all concerned Windows XP and / or consumer versions of Office .
Only two suits alleged piracy of an enterprise version of the software and Windows Vista was not the subject of an allegation in any filing , according to information from Microsoft .
Among the companies against which lawsuits were filed were several that had been previously been accused by Microsoft of software piracy and had settled with the company , it said .
The lawsuits were filed in California , Georgia , Massachusetts , Ohio , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , Oregon , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Illinois and Washington .
According to a recent report published by the Business Software Alliance , an anti-piracy group funded by software makers , the U.S. had a piracy rate of 20 percent -- the lowest in the survey .
Although due to the size of the market losses from piracy in the U.S. were estimated at US $ 8 billion , which is higher than any other single country .
And if that were n’t enough , how about this spoof — it is 3 AM and McCain ca n’t read his email :

I received a lot of warm comments on my conclusion post - in the blog , on email , and on the Reddit link that immediately took place # 1 in the Programming section and held it for a day .
The most interesting feedback was , however , from Geoffrey S. Knauth .
He 's acquainted with the book authors , and when he told them about my project , they agreed to sign a book for me , which Geoffrey then shipped to Israel on his own expense .
Here 's the book and a slip of paper displaying the complex logistics behind this shipment :
And this is the opening page , with the authors ' signatures :
I 'm really happy about this , and want to thank Geoffrey again for his initiative .
( CNN ) --
An explosion in a southern Iranian mosque that killed 10 people and wounded 160 after evening prayers Saturday night was caused by negligent handling of live munitions , not a bomb as first suspected , Iranian media reported .
Shiraz , Iran , is well known for being home to many scholars , artists and poets .
The blast and subsequent fire occurred about 6 p.m. Saturday in the men's section of a mosque in the city of Shiraz , Iran 's Fars news agency reported .
Fars initially reported the explosion was caused by a home - made bomb .
Provincial Police Commander Ali Moaeyri later told Fars it " was not sabotage . "
" Some live munitions may have been left behind at that location which could have been the cause of the explosion , " Moaeyri said .
The police commander said the munitions were apparently left behind after a " Sacred Defense " exhibition was held at the mosque , which also serves as a cultural center .
Local militia groups -- known as Basij -- often use the mosques for meeting places .
Iran 's official news agency , IRNA , put the number of casualties at 10 dead and 160 wounded .
Survivors were being treated at 12 hospitals , IRNA reported .
Fars estimated 800 people , mostly young , were gathered at the mosque Saturday evening to hear a cleric 's sermon denouncing Bahai and Wahabi faiths -- both of which are considered heresies by some Shiites .
Bombings are unusual in Iran , thought the predominantly Shiite Muslim country has endured sporadic attacks in recent years .
The last major bombing occurred in February 2007 , when a car bomb blew up near a bus carrying members of Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Corps , leaving a dozen dead and injuring dozens more in southeastern Iran .
Shiraz -- a historical city of more than 1 million people -- is well known for being home to many scholars , artists , poets and local craftsmanship of rugs and metalwork .
The tourist city is about 400 miles south of Tehran , the capital .

Tyra Banks Captured in Wax TWICE by Madame Tussauds ( Photos )
has had wax work likenesses unveiled twice this month .
Her first unveiling was at Madame Tussauds Washington D.C.
Now a totally different looking wax work has been put on display at Madame Tussauds New York City .
We 're confused ?
It seems that each of the eight wax museums are working independently of each other , rather than mass producing the finished product so that each location can show the same likeness .
Interesting .
The eight locations are in Hong Kong , Shanghai , Amsterdam , New York City , Washington D.C. , Las Vegas , London and Berlin .
Check out recent unveilings of Miley Cyrus here and Amy Winehouse here .
It looks like New York City wanted to show Tyra in her glory days as a top supermodel while the D.C. museum was keeping it real with her current look .
Either way she looks great .

I think it 's incredible when someone puts a lot of thought into a minor part of an app .
It 's easy to punt on something like Preferences , but if you do it right , it rounds out the entire experience .
CoverSutra probably has one of most meticulously - designed examples of this I 've seen .
This one screen really says it all :
There are several subtle elements at play here .
For example , many would have prepended " Show " onto the title of each of the checkbox items , but instead the Show prefix is shifted to the left .
This simplifies the layout and makes it clear that both checkboxes relate to display .
The presentation is fantastic .
Instead of just using a dropdown with labels like " Style 1 " and " Style 2 " , we 're treated to a beautifully - rendered showcase that allows you to see all styles at once .
And they 're not just composited on a blank background , but rather a custom wallpaper .
In my opinion , that wallpaper raises the experience of this entire window .
There 's absolutely no reason somebody wouldto do such a thing , so when a developer does something like this , it 's clear that theycare .
This leaves the user with the impression that the software is not just functional , but actually .
This is how you convert users into fans .
Not only does CoverSutra allow you to set shortcuts for a number of common functions , but the presentation of these shortcuts in preferences is artfully done .
Many applications display the shortcut in a generic text field , but these are actually rendered as buttons , which makes it much more clear that you can click them .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the text is worded and positioned exceptionally well .
The prompt text aligns to the right , the wording is simple but clear , and the labels for the toolbar items are n't conceptual , they 're direct and functional .
Rather than " Appearance " the section is called " Album Cover " .
Of course , the overall function and look of the application is fantastic in general , but I 've almost never seen so much attention given to this part of an app .
When you create a preferences window , this is the level you should be aiming for .
Flawless .
While the Nintendo Wii is still comfortably outselling both Microsoft and Sony , the war for what could be second place has found a new home : Europe .
Yesterday Microsoft announced that it would be cutting prices of the Xbox 360 hardware across the board in Europe .
The Xbox 360 Premium is now €269.99/£ 199.99 , the Elite €369.99/£259.99 , and the Arcade €199.99 /£ 159.99 — a drop of € 80 /£ 50 , €80 / £ 40 , and € 80 / £ 20 , respectively .
" Xbox 360 is now mass market in Europe , " said Chris Lewis , the vice president of Microsoft 's Interactive Entertainment Business in Europe .
The price drop was arguably overdue , but the bigger news is that it could be a very direct threat to Sony 's business in Europe .
Based on the estimates of EA , the PS3 sold 2.8 million units in Europe in 2007 , with the Xbox 360 selling only 1.9 million .
EA sees Sony making big moves in 2008 , it estimates that Sony will move at leave 5 million units , while it only sees the Xbox 360 selling 1.5 million to 2 million systems .
Compare that to the US , where in 2007 Microsoft sold 4.62 million units to Sony 's 2.56 million .
If Microsoft consistently wins the sales race in the US , and Sony handily beats the Xbox 360 in Japan , Europe may be one of the most important battlegrounds in this console war .
Microsoft knows it .
" Europe for us is still the swing , " said Microsoft VP Jeff Bell in a recent Reuters interview .
" The biggest challenge is that Sony as a brand has had greater staying power than in other areas .
Not just PlayStation 3 , but Sony as a brand . "
With Microsoft now undercutting both Nintendo and Sony in price with its range of Xbox 360 products , can Sony fight back with its own price drop ?
The company has to be concerned , says one analyst .
" Sony will be nervous that the PS3's recent sales surge may fizzle out now that the premium Xbox 360 undercuts the PS3 by GBP 40 , and the cheapest Xbox model is almost half the price of the PS3 , " analyst David Mercer from Strategy Analytics commented .
" Sony will be scrutinizing the daily sales reports , but will probably try to hold out until later in the year before making its next price move . "
With a comfortable lead in sales , Sony does n't have to make the decision yet , but with Blu-ray lasers becoming smaller and cheaper and Sony 's willingness to introduce new hardware configurations , the possibility is always there .
Sony also has the advantage of sitting on top of the winning high - def format in Blu-ray , and the PlayStation 3 is such an able Blu-ray player that it is powerful weapon to drive sales .
Sony also has the strong - looking PlayTV waiting in the wings for Europe ; the product turns the PlayStation 3 into a DVR , and allows place - shifting of recorded content using the PlayStation Portable .
In short , Sony is uniquely placed in Europe to completely take over the living room of high - definition enthusiasts .
Should Sony be nervous about Europe ?
Sony has the sales lead , it has strong consumer electronics branding , it has the winning format in Blu-ray , and it has a suite of products like the PlayTV and the PlayStation Portable that combine into a very slick home theater system .
The Xbox 360 price drop could be interpreted as Microsoft blinking in the face of Sony 's strong position in Europe — a key territory Microsoft would love to control .
Sony has the ultimate luxury in this war in Europe : the ability to wait and see what happens .

SAN FRANCISCO  Microsoft is preparing to take its most ambitious step yet in transforming its personal computer business into one tied more closely to software running in remote data centers .
The software giant announced on Tuesday a data storage and Web software system , called Live Mesh , that is intended to blur the distinction between software running on the Windows operating system and an elaborate array of services that will be delivered to a growing collection of electronic gadgets .
Live Mesh is Microsoft ’s late entry into a rapidly growing market described as cloud computing .
The term refers to the movement of software applications and services from PCs to centralized data centers , where they are made available via the Internet .
Companies like Amazon.com , Google , Salesforce and dozens of others are building computing centers that will effectively outsource data processing and make it a commodity that companies purchase as they would electricity .
The introduction of Live Mesh is a significant strategic shift for Microsoft , whose operating system helped popularize personal computers .
Bill Gates , the company ’s co-founder , chairman and chief architect , said in an interview on CNN a year ago , “ We ’re making the PC the place where it all comes together . ”
However , a strategy document circulated to company employees on Tuesday that was written by Ray Ozzie , one of the Microsoft ’s two chief technology officers , countered that view .
In research that could give doctors a way to reassign sex in cases of unclear gender , scientists report this week that they have figured out why some children with genes that should make them boys are instead born as girls .
The study , published in Nature , explains why some embryos with X and Y chromosomes — which should be born as male — develop ovaries and eventually become girls .
The key is whether a gene called Sox9 , involved in formation of the testes , is active .
" There are a surprisingly large number of cases where this process goes wrong , " says Robin Lovell - Badge , a biologist at London 's MRC National Institute for Medical Research , who estimates that this phenomenon could effect up to 1 in every 20,000 genetic males .
" Maybe one could treat some of these sex reversal or intersex cases after birth by manipulating whether Sox9 is active or not .
This is all speculation but it 's possible . "
If Sox9 is somehow switched on in a genetic female — an embryo with two X chromosomes — it causes male gonads to form ; if it fails to turn on in males , the cells it controls will become follicle cells , which mature into ovaries .
To work out this process , Lovell - Badge and his colleagues manipulated the Sox9 gene in genetically engineered mice .
They found that what switches on Sox9 is the product of two other genes .
When either of those genes — one of which is found on the Y chromosome , only carried by males — is defective , Sox9 remains off and the embryo develops ovaries .
Richard R. Behringer , a geneticist at the University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , called the study " an important step . "
Behringer , who was not involved in the research , says scientists must now determine how Sox9 's activity actually leads to the creation of testes .
Lovell - Badge and his colleagues believe that the findings in mice will apply to humans as well , particularly in diagnosing " male " embryos that are likely to develop into girls .
That 's important , he says , because those people are at higher risk for ovarian tumors .
He adds that he 's very hopeful that with further analysis , scientists may determine ways to reassign gender later in life , " perhaps for cases of sex reversal or perhaps even for individuals who want to undergo sex changes , " although he acknowledged that " this is getting very contentious . "

The British are uniquely happy to admit being bad at maths , says a report .
Why is that and how can attitudes change ?
Imagine a famous television presenter joking that they could n't read .
It 's an unlikely scenario , such would be their embarrassment , yet no such reservations exist for mathematics , with self - confessed innumerates popping up regularly .
" I 've always been rubbish at maths " is usually accompanied by a cheeky grin .
The subtext is " I 'm no boffin . "
A report this week by think - tank Reform laments the drop in numbers of people taking maths A - level , at an estimated cost to the economy of £ 9 bn .
A generation grew up with Johnny Ball enthusing about numbers A maths A - level puts on average an extra £ 10,000 a year on a salary , says Reform , yet it is acceptable to say that you can't do maths .
Despite - for want of a better word - countless campaigns in recent years , and role models such as Johnny Ball and Carol Vorderman fighting numeracy 's corner , people still need to be persuaded about the merits of mathematics .
In Korea or China they 're really proud of being good at maths because they know the future of their economies depend on it
Marcus du Sautoy
Maths professor and broadcaster
This can 't - do attitude has even afflicted scientists , says Alan Stevens of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications , and formerly a mathematician at Rolls Royce .
" Even engineers sometimes say they 're no good at maths .
The general public I hear saying it , and particularly journalists on television tend to say it - newsreaders saying they 've always been rubbish at it - as if they 're proud of it .
" This makes it seem even more acceptable and projects the wrong image , the image that maths is indeed an ivory tower which is dull and boring and of no interest or use to intelligent people .
That 's the wrong image . "
It 's not a recent development because it was the same when he was a teenager , he says , but is more evident on TV now .
And while other subjects such as IT may have an equally geeky image at school , that indifference is not carried into adulthood .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Marcus du Sautoy , maths professor at Oxford University and presenter of BBC Four 's Mind Games , says he can't understand the pride there is in being bad at maths .
" It 's bizarre why people are prepared to admit that because it's an admission that you can't think logically .
Maths is more than just arithmetic .
Children 's television shows try to make maths fun " I would rather do business with someone who admits they 're good at maths .
" You do n't get that in the Far East .
In Korea or China they 're really proud of being good at maths because they know the future of their economies depend on it , their finances depend on it . "
He ascribes it to cultural factors and a failure of the education system and the media to put the case for valuing maths .
" But it 's changing .
There 's a cultural shift in the adult world .
There are films featuring maths , such as 21 , and Ridley Scott 's Numb3rs is doing for maths what CSI did for forensic science .
We have very active lessons , very hands - on .
No more text books , no more standing at the front
Teacher Jonathan Heeley " People say they love doing sudoku , so it 's changing but we 're fighting a climate of people who have been undersold with maths . "
Mobile phones , the internet , Playstations and Google all depend on maths , he says - if people realised that , then they would n't poke fun at it so easily .
Family influence Seven years ago John Dunford , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a former maths teacher , publicly bemoaned the fact there were Lord Mayors who proudly said they could n't do maths .
He thinks nothing has changed since then and believes the problem starts in schools where pupils wrongly believe maths is too difficult .
" I think people see maths in a different light to English language .
They see it as being hard but it's no harder than other subjects .
This attitude makes teaching maths a more difficult job .
WHY SOME CAN'T DO MATHS Some people have a genuine problem learning maths Dyscalculia afflicts between 3 % and 6 % of the population
It means people who may excel at other subjects struggle with counting and identifying maths symbols " You can teach it in a very engaging way but if parents and grandparents say how difficult they found maths , it takes a long time to turn these things around . "
But creative lessons can get results , according to maths teacher Jonathan Heeley , who has won awards for his work with 11 to 16 - year - olds at Rawthorpe High School in Huddersfield .
When he began there six years ago , the school was in trouble and there was a culture in which talented pupils preferred to fail for fear of being labelled swots .
But in the past three years , he has helped to raise the GCSE pass rate from 12 % to nearly 50 % .
" It was about making maths fun and making them learn without realising it and using different ways to engage them .
We have very active lessons , very hands - on .
No more text books , no more standing at the front .
Instead we use creative ways to get them involved . "
Eminem , an unlikely ally of maths teacher Jonathan Heeley Street culture is employed to teach , so the class raps and sings formulas , uses Eminem to demonstrate pie charts and football league tables for arithmetic .
Dice and coins help explain probability and statistics , while pieces of fruit substitute for " x " in algebra .
He says he has his pupils shouting down the corridors : " I love maths ! "
But pure passion is not going to sway everyone , so there 's another possible solution , which is to appeal to their wallets .
The UK is moving towards a maths economy in which those with numeric skills will prosper , says Elizabeth Truss , one of the authors of the Reform report .
" So much of modern banking is based on maths .
In the 1980s it was about doing a deal , now it 's about understanding risk .
The whole financial services industry is underpinned by very high - level maths . "
So if imaginative teaching does n't inspire the British to get their sums right , maybe the lure of an extra 10 grand a year will .

Mental arithmetic is not the same as maths which is a point that is often overlooked .
I am an engineer and have a maths A - level ... but I can't do mental multiplication or division .
But I am good at maths and logical thinking .
Lots of people get put off maths because they can't do times tables at primary school .
Sad really .

It 's not the lack of maths ability that they are probably coding but are instead alluding to left brain / right brain capabilities .
Rather than appear boffin - like they are trying to give the impression that they are more comfortable in the social , gregarious , verbal or language sphere .
High maths ability often equates in many peoples minds as one step away from the autism end of the spectrum
Robyn , Auckland New Zealand
I would freely admit that I am not good at maths because I have always found learning it difficult .
That does not mean , however , that I can't do it .
James , Cambridge UK
This attitude has scared me for a while .
I have heard so many big radio names say they can't do maths and they think this is ok .
It 's big celebrities telling kids that it's not " cool " to like maths , as well as parents thinking it's hard that makes this situation .
Being able to tell if your gas bill is right , if that top in the sale is really a good bargain or how much the interest is going to be on your credit card are all useful and important things .
How can we tell kids that it's ok not to know anything about maths ??
It 's just irresponsible !
Lindsey , Milton Keynes Quite apart from the usefulness of maths , it is worth studying just for the beauty and symmetry it reveals .
Someone who has never appreciated a beautiful theorem has missed as much as someone who does n't like Wordsworth or Shakespeare .
Jeff Moreland , Southampton , UK Perhaps we could all make an effort to reverse this .
Next time someone proudly says " I 'm bad at maths " respond with a cheery " Well you do n't seem that thick , perhaps you should work on that a bit . "
Either that or sell them a loan .
Steve , Cheshire I am 19 and currently doing Maths at Warwick University , I have always liked maths , but I remember that at school , being good at maths was a sever issue .
Those who made any effort towards being good at maths and science were ostracized by the rest of the year group .
I am certain that this was because of the portrayal of " nerds " and " keeners " in mainstream children s TV and film .
When every day , kids are watching hours of nerds being beaten up , hated and generally victimized - you can only expect the same to happen in schools , and hence many children will make a conscious effort NOT to be good at it .
Ross Harding , coventry
Is it perhaps that people confuse poor arithmetic skills with poor mathematical skills ?
I find that frequently we associate being able to quickly compute large numbers with being good in math .
In fact , I think more emphasis on the concepts behind math with less focus on mental computation might incite more enthusiasm .
The adventure and thrill of working through a problem using mathematical logic seems overshadowed and undervalued by over - emphasis on computation .
The nation would be far better off focusing on being good at mathematical reasoning and buying more calculators .
Kathryn , Cardiff I feel that teaching is the most important factor in encouraging kids to * like * maths .
We did say when I was in school , ' what good is maths , unless you want to be a maths teacher ? ' but our teachers were enthusiastic and we ( mostly ) enjoyed our lessons .
Plus , it 's very useful in daily life !
Last week having dinner a friend of mine worked out that you got almost 25 % more pie in a square pie than a round one at a restaurant - using pi !
Laura Mitchell , Lancaster , UK
Why are we so bad at maths , look at the average maths teacher who follows all these loony educational ideas .
Why did I fail maths , because I refused to show my working out the problem .
I got the right answer but it was still marked wrong .
Hence as a teenager I gave up on maths .
At the end of the day if the answer is correct , it did not matter how I got to it , as long as I did not cheat .
Mike , Southampton UK
What is with the British & the whole " It 's cool to admit to be ignorant " attitude ?
Elitism may be a bad thing , but this popularisation of ignorance is ridiculous , as well as dangerous .
Or is it a plot by a few to generate a populace who will be so clueless that they wo n't notice when the takeover comes ?
Sharon Pearse , Portsmouth , UK
When I was doing GCSE maths , we were learning trigonometry and someone asked the teacher when it would be useful in our lives .
She replied that it would be useful in passing our GCSE exam .
I think that 's part of the problem : that while people can see the obvious need to add / subtract / divide / multiply , most of maths seems completely abstract and largely useless to the vast majority of us .
Some of Jonathan Heeley 's methods , like showing practical applications such as leage tables , are needed to show students that what they 're learning is n't stuff that can be dumped from the mind as soon as the summer holiday rolls around .
Olly , Bournemouth Children will naturally acquire mathematical knowledge but they need to be inspired to enjoy it and appreciate the enormous life long benefits a solid grounding in this subject can bring .
That inspiration can only come from knowledgeable parents and talented teachers .
This is where effort has to be focussed .
Too many children are turned off maths for ever because of the ' ca n't do maths but who cares it 's cool ' society we live in .
Jonathan , Birmingham UK I 'm great with maths .
It was the only subject at school I was any good at thanks to a series of great maths teachers .
30 years on and I work with lots of numbers .
All my friends & family that fall into the category of ' no good at maths ' have money problems .
There 's a lesson there kids .
Listen to the maths teacher !!!

Capitalism won the Cold War !

Curacao , Netherlands Antilles Perhaps now that high - ranking members of the Church of Scientology ï¿ ½including Tom Cruiseï¿½may have been exposed to asbestos , an all - out ban on this human carcinogen in the US may come about sooner .
But it can also mean that thousands more people can potentially develop mesothelioma .
The MV Freewinds , Scientology 's cruise ship , has been sealed and docked in Caracao due to blue asbestos ( crocidolite ) that was released and spread through the ventilation system , affecting thousands of people .
The Church of Scientology 's members were attending Scientology courses , training services and functions aboard the ship .
According to the Daily Herald , a local newspaper , the blue asbestos was released from the ship 's structure during refurbishing and reparatory work .
This is not the first time the MV Freewinds has been investigated for blue asbestos .
In 2001 , a former Scientology member , architect Lawrence Woodcraft , submitted a sworn affidavit stating that he was exposed to blue asbestos while working on the Freewinds in 1987 .
As well , a statement from the ship 's captain claimed that there were previous incidents where blue asbestos was released into the ship 's ventilation system .
But the Church of Scientology denied Woodcraft 's claim and in so doing , the Church knowingly exposed its passengers and members to this most deadliest form of asbestos for the past 21 years !
Since 1970 , raw blue asbestosï¿ ½the most hazardous of asbestos -- was banned in the UK .
The fibers from blue asbestos are the narrowest of this fibrous mineral and therefore the most easily respirable .
Blue asbestos was known more than three decades ago to be the major cause of mesothlioma , which is a cancer of the pleural lining of the lung or much less commonly of the peritoneum .
Mesothelioma is incurable , and commonly leads to a great deal of pain and other suffering .
This horrific disease often has a very long latency period ( it can manifest itself 40 years or more after asbestos exposure ) .
The risk of asbestos - related diseases from asbestos that is well - contained in structures such as steel and cement are minimal .
However , the risks are extremely high when asbestos is removed , such as the case with refurbishing of the Freewinds .
Is n't it time to ban asbestos completely ?
Just as importantly , more enforcement and strict policing is needed when it comes to asbestos removal , refurbishment , maintenance and demolition work .
Anyone who has been aboard MV Freewinds should see their doctor to determine their level of exposure to blue asbestos .
And they may want to seek legal advice .

The WASP knife is more lethal than any other .
Created for hunting dangerous animals , it kills on impact by injecting a frozen ball of compressed gas into the body of the prey , exploding the organs of the animal .
Available to buy online , the British police is worried about the implications the weapon could have if it falls into the wrong hands .
As you can see in the video , which was published by its manufacturers , the WASP knife injects a frozen ball of compressed gas into the body , which , once released , swells to the size of a basketball .
The UK's West Midlands Metropolitan Police has already received instructions to prevent the circulation of the knife .
A difficult task , seeing as it can be bought online .
If anything , the announcement of these measures has probably fuelled the weapon 's popularity even more .

UPDATED : An examination of spam originating from the major free e-mail providers shows that like consumers , spammers prefer Google .
In a three - week period from mid-June to this month , e-mail filtering firm Roaring Penguin said it saw an explosion of spam originating from Gmail , while Microsoft Hotmail and Yahoo Mail remained flat .
The company attributes this meteoric rise in Gmail spam to the cracking of Google 's CAPTCHA .
A CAPTCHA ( define ) is a test , typically used in Web site registration , that is designed to tell humans apart from programs designed to hack or automate registrations .
It consists of a word displayed in such a way that it 's difficult for a computer to read , but not a human .
A user would be able to successfully enter the word into an input box to gain entry .
In Gmail 's case , the CAPTCHA was designed to prevent automated programs from signing up for thousands of e-mail accounts .
But according to David Skoll , CEO and CTO of Roaring Penguin , spammers developed an optical character recognition scanner smart enough to read the Google CAPTCHA , and programming to enter in the information to make e-mail addresses on Gmail for spamming .
Earlier this year , company spokespeople told InternetNews.com in an e-mail that the online search leader was aware of efforts to defeat its CAPTCHA and that it disables the accounts of spammers on its service .
When asked for comment on the Roaring Penguin findings , a Google spokesperson issued the following statement : " We expect spammers to use every means possible to try to send spam .
That 's why we have a robust spam - fighting effort at Google .
We disable these accounts immediately and will continue to do so . "
If Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) responds by changing its CAPTCHA , Skoll figures the spammers will simply break it again .
" Spammers have an economic incentive to keep spamming , so they have an economic incentive to keep breaking Google 's CAPTCHAs , " he told InternetNews.com .
" Even if Google came up with something extremely difficult to crack , spammers can get around that . "
During the period from June 13 to July 3 , spam from Google grew from 6.8 percent to 27 percent of all outbound e-mail detected by Roaring Penguin .
At the same time , spam from Yahoo and Microsoft rose between 2 percent to 4 percent , the company found .
Spammers are also now taking advantage of Google 's reputation .
While most spam comes from botnet - infected ( define ) computers , those sources are easier to block based on their IP addresses .
But if it comes from Gmail , an e-mail gateway 's spam filters are for more likely to let the mail through , Skoll said .
" They could block it if the same IP is making accounts , but it 's like an arms race , " he said .
" For every measure Google can take , there 's a countermeasure the spammer can take .
You can't really stop it -- you can slow it down a bit . "
Skoll added that Google needs to start getting a little tougher and looking more closely at its signup process and outgoing mail .

South Korean and U.S. soldiers take part in a Medical Evacuation ( MEDEVAC ) field training exercise in Yangju , South Korea .
Game theory suggests that in war , a soldier 's best option is to fight -- even if it means sustaining an injury .
Chung Sung - Jun / Getty Images
Imagine you 're a soldier posted on a defensive line .
Tomorrow , there will be a great battle .
There are two possible outcomes of the battle ( victory or defeat ) , and two possible outcomes for you ( surviving or dying ) .
Clearly , your preference is to survive .
If your line is breached , you will die .
However , even if the defensive line holds , you may die in battle .
It seems that your best option is to run away .
But if you do , the ones who stay behind and fight may die .
You realize that every other person on the defensive line is thinking this very same thing .
So if you decide to stay and cooperate but everyone else flees , you 'll certainly die .

This problem has plagued military strategists since the beginning of warfare .
That 's why there is generally a new condition entered into the equation -- if you flee or defect , you will be shot as a traitor .
Therefore , the best chance you have of surviving is to keep your position on the line and fight for victory .
How does this relate to game theory ?
Game theory is n't the study of how to win a game of chess or how to create a role - playing game scenario .
Often , game theory does n't even remotely relate to what you 'd commonly consider to be a game .
At its most basic level , game theory is the study of how people , companies or nations ( referred to as agents or players ) determine strategies in different situations in the face of competing strategies acted out by other agents or players .
Game theory assumes that agents make rational decisions at all times .
There 's some fault in this assumption :
What passes for irrational behavior by most of society ( a buildup of nuclear weapons , for instance ) is considered quite rational by game theory standards .
However , even when game theory analysis produces counterintuitive results , it still yields surprising insights into human nature .
For instance , do members of society only cooperate with each other for the sake of material gain , or is there more to it ?
Would you help someone in need if it hurt you in the long run ?
To learn why a rational person must behave selfishly , continue to the next section .
The Optimal Foreign Investment Allocation
How do international stocks affect your stock portfolio ?
The U.S. stock market has n’t been doing too well of late .
It ’s hovering at its lowest point of the year , although it appears to be a reflection of all the bad news we ’re seeing in the economic front recently .
High gas prices , high food prices , high prices everywhere .
Spending is up , savings and investments are down .
The only other thing down in the dumps along with the markets and the economy is our collective mood about our whole financial situation .
But it ’s times like these that you may want to review your portfolio ’s allocation .
The weightings on your portfolio may have shifted over time and now that it ’s the middle of the year , it could be a good time to revisit your investment set up .
This is also an opportunity to decide whether you ’d like to keep with the same allocation you ’ve always had .
For the record , we ’re currently between 25 % to 30 % invested in foreign stocks at the moment .
Yet my spouse is eager to do more to hedge our investments and go further into foreign holdings .
He ’s asked about possibly raising our international allocation to match the representation of foreign equities in the global market , which is around 50 % .
I ’ve also known some people who have dumped their domestic holdings completely in favor of foreign equities .
With the dollar in the dumps and everyone wanting a piece of America for cheap , I can see why folks are eager to take flight into international funds .
Not sure I ’m convinced about following suit to this same extent .
50 % in non-U.S. stocks seems very aggressive to me .
I ’m no longer single , young and carefree … and no longer as comfortable with this type of investment risk .
But to lend credence to my concerns , I researched this topic further and reevaluated our foreign allocation strategy .
Thoughts On International Diversification
It ’s worth reviewing why we buy foreign stocks .
Here are some interesting points on this issue :
International equities belong in our portfolios for the added diversification .
With added diversification , you can lower the risk of your overall portfolio .

When different economies behave similarly to each other , they are described as “ well correlated ” .
The less correlated your investment asset classes are , the more diversified your portfolio , in theory .
The less correlated your investment asset classes are , the more diversified your portfolio , in theory .
On this note , market correlations between the U.S. and other countries vary widely , a good thing !
You can see those relationships in this graph from T. Rowe Price :
a good thing !
You can see those relationships in this graph from T. Rowe Price : A correlation of 100 % means that a country ’s equity market and the U.S. market move in lockstep .
A correlation of 0 means that there ’s no relationship between a foreign market and the U.S. market .
Developing countries , emerging markets , those countries with growing local markets or those less dependent on the U.S. economy are less correlated to the U.S. market .
They may trend differently from the U.S. market .

Even with low correlations between markets , any stock exchange can still be impacted by severe financial trends in other parts of the world .
International stocks have higher average returns than U.S. stocks and come with higher volatility .
But the combination of U.S. AND international stocks in a global portfolio lowers average volatility while producing higher risk - adjusted returns ( e.g. higher returns for the associated risk ) .
Check out this chart that shows this phenomenon .
International stocks are represented by MSCI World Index excluding the USA .
The global portfolio includes international and U.S. stocks ( MSCI World Index ) .
Stats for portfolios below are for 1970 to 2005 .
Total Return Total Return Volatility Return / Volatility International Stocks 11.19 16.69 0.67 U.S. Stocks 10.72 15.36 0.70 Global Equity Portfolio 10.55 14.38 0.73 Returns are based on U.S. dollars .
Is There A “ Perfect ” Foreign Stock Allocation ?
The short answer is YES .
Apparently there is !
According to this comprehensive Vanguard report on international equities , which includes some detailed analysis of risk , return , volatility and other considerations covering investment portfolio mixes , they ’ve come up with a few recommendations :
A good starting point for any investment portfolio is an allocation of 20 % in international stocks .
Allocation is one thing while the type of foreign equity you buy is another .
Personally , I ’d buy an overseas index fund or ETF that tracks an index for the highest diversification I can achieve .
But some investors may prefer to focus on those stocks that are the least correlated to the U.S .
Consider an upper limit for your foreign stock allocation of 50 % .
This is based on the proportion of the global market that foreign stocks currently represent .
In fact , studies show that the effects of currency risk , progressively higher correlations ( e.g. diminishing diversification ) , foreign taxes and costs outweigh any benefits of higher foreign stock allocations .
Here ’s what Vanguard specifically says about this :
While adding an allocation of 20 % to 40 % has historically been beneficial , adding too much can increase portfolio risks without the commensurate benefits .
International allocations exceeding 40 % benefit a portfolio incrementally less , particularly as costs are accounted for .
The suggested allocation range for foreign stocks is between 20 % to 40 % of your stock portfolio .
Although no absolute answer exists for all investors , it should be clear that an allocation range of 20 % to 40 % is reasonable given the historical benefits of diversification .
Allocations closer to 40 % may be suitable for those investors less concerned with the potential risks and higher costs of international equities .
Allocations closer to 20 % may be viewed as offering a greater balance among the benefits of diversification , the risks of currency volatility and higher correlations , investor preferences , and costs .
But 30 % is the magic number !
Ah but wait !
If you ’re really looking for the foreign stock allocation sweet spot , finance theory points to 30 % as the magic percentage .
It ’s the perfect overseas equity allocation to achieve the best balance between diversification ( and therefore risk management and volatility reduction ) and return .
With 20 % international exposure , an investor would have captured 50 % of the maximum diversification benefit .
An investor with 30 % allocation to international stocks has captured 70 % of the max diversification benefit .
Anything above an allocation of 30 % shows that you do n’t get significant volatility reduction and can in fact increase your volatility during some time periods such as from 1992 – 1999 .
I found a few graphs that illustrate this conclusion , courtesy of ICMA - RC .
These graphs were plotted using data covering different time periods .
EAFE stands for the Europe , Australasia and Far East Index , which tracks overseas markets .
A Global Portfolio ’s Risk vs Return , November , 1971 – November 1995
When covering a different time period , something interesting happens .
The graph goes in reverse .
A Global Portfolio ’s Risk vs Return , November 1973 – November 1997
Note that standard deviation is a measure of volatility .
Funny how these two charts reflect different time periods but still produce similar results , with elliptical plots pointing to the same conclusion ( albeit in reverse ) : that a 20 % – 40 % foreign stock allocation provides the best mixes that yield optimal risk - adjusted returns .
The 70/30 split between U.S. and foreign stocks achieves the lowest risk and provides the best diversification benefit .
The main difference between these charts comes from which asset class had better returns during a given time range : in one time period , the EAFE - heavy portfolio yielded the higher returns , while in the later period , the pure U.S. stock heavy portfolio dominated .
These charts support what the Vanguard report states and also coincide with this chart from My Money Blog ( lifted from A Random Walk Down Wall Street ) , as well as the revelations in this news article .
How Much Are You Allocating To Foreign Stocks ?
A lot of folks gravitate to the 70/30 domestic vs international split , but lots more have it set up differently .
Here is a look at how others have invested in non-U.S. stocks :
How about you … what ’s your allocation ?
~ooOoo~
Now all these findings , coupled with this guide on how to incorporate foreign stocks into our long term investment strategy , has made me stick to our current allocation .
For added foreign diversification , we may look into non-U.S. bonds or CDs instead .
But that ’s something we ’re still mulling over .

While energy companies have no control over the price of oil , which is set on international futures markets , they have benefited from the rally in commodity markets .
Exxon , for example , earned over $ 163 billion from 2003 to 2007 .
Oil prices more than quadrupled during that period .
But because of how some contracts are structured , international companies must give a larger share of the oil they produce back to the host governments as prices rise .
In addition , the higher prices have sparked a wave of energy nationalizations from Russia to South America , that has left Western oil companies with a smaller footprint to operate .
The higher prices have also translated into sharp inflation in the industry , with drilling and production costs more than doubling in recent years .
As a result , oil companies have been struggling to increase their oil and gas production .
In the United States , the political attention has been increasingly focusing on the impact of high energy costs on the economy and on pocketbooks .
The Senate blocked a $ 15 billion extra tax on oil companies late last year but calls for a windfall profit tax will probably to re-emerge this year .

Fannie Mae's Golden Goose : A Lesson In Moral Hazard
In the mid 1990 ’s I spent over a year as part of a team consulting to Fannie Mae .
Given that they have been in the news a bit over the last few days , I thought it might be interesting to pass along a few observations that initially crystallized during my time there .
The World ’s Biggest Mortgage Bank
For those of you that do n’t know Fannie Mae , it is one of the largest financial institutions in the county with over $ 880 BN in assets .
It is almost exclusively focused on buying , selling , and guaranteeing single family residential mortgages .
Fannie Mae was originally a US government agency , but became a public company in the 1970s .
Despite being a public company , Fannie Mae has remained a quasi - government agency subject to federal oversight and regulation .
This government regulation , combined with a few perks such a direct credit line from the US Treasury as well as its overwhelming size and importance to the US housing market has resulted in what amounts to an implicit US government guarantee that Fannie Mae ( and its cousin brother Freddie Mac ) will never default on their debt .
There is no law or regulation to that effect , just an assumption by the market that Fannie Mae is too big , too close and too important to the government for the government to ever let Fannie Mae fail .
With the mortgage market in massive turmoil and Fannie Mae ’s stock down 85 % in the last year , that assumption is currently being heavily tested .
I do n’t know exactly what the future holds for Fannie Mae , but I think I can shed some light on how it got in this position in the first place .
The seeds of Fannie Mae ’s current crisis were actually sown in the recovery from its last crisis .
In the mid-1980s Fannie Mae almost went out of business thanks in large part to some very poor and rather unsophisticated asset and liability management practices .
What basically happened is that the aggregate cost of Fannie Mae ’s debt exceeded the income it was deriving from its ( then relatively modest ) mortgage portfolio .
This never should have happened given the instruments and strategies available to Fannie Mae ’s finance team , but they had become somewhat complacent and had failed to keep up with the state of the art in portfolio and treasury management .
Creating the Golden Goose
A new team of people took over the finance side of Fannie Mae and implemented a series a relatively sophisticated and ultimately incredibly profitable Asset and Liability Management ( ALM ) strategies .
One of the key innovations was issuing debt instruments , specifically callable debt instruments , that enabled Fannie Mae to much more closely match both the duration and pre-payment characteristics of its Assets ( primary residential mortgage securities ) with its debt ( primarily Fannie Mae corporate debt ) .
Normally , callable debt is quite expensive ( much more expensive than residential mortgage debt ) , because bond holders want to be compensated for selling the call option to the issuer , but thanks to Fannie Mae ’s quasi - government status it was able to issue this callable debt at yields that were only marginally above straight treasury yields .
This debt combined with a more sophisticated overall ALM approach , not only reduced Fannie Mae ’s borrowing costs significantly , but enabled it to very quickly adjust its portfolio in the event of rapid changes in pre-payments .
With this strategy in hand , not only could Fannie Mae buy mortgage securities for less than the cost of its debt ( and thus earn a nice spread ) , but it could almost entirely contain pre-payment risk effectively making the purchase of mortgage securities “ risk free ” except for credit risk , which itself was very low thanks to Fannie Mae ’s strong underwriting guidelines .
Fannie Mae had discovered the equivalent of a financial golden goose .
Let ’s Get This Party Started
With its golden goose in hand , Fannie Mae almost immediately began buying a lot more mortgage securities .
Who did it buy these securities from ?
Why none other than Fannie Mae itself .
You see Fannie Mae ’s original role was to buy mortgages from individual banks , package them up into securities , guarantee those securities against loss , and then sell them to other financial institutions .
However once Fannie Mae realized that the “ golden goose ” allowed them to buy those same securities for its own portfolio and lock - in “ risk free ” profits , Fannie became a major buyer of its own securities .
Fannie
Mae was thus in the rather bizarre position of guaranteeing an ever increasing portion of its own assets against default .
By the time I showed up in the mid-1990 ’s , Fannie Mae had become one of the largest buyers of its own securities .
Its stock was up over 40X from it ’s 1980s nadir and it seemed as though the single biggest problem it had was deciding on how much money it wanted to make .
This was a bigger problem than you might imagine because as a quasi - government agency , and a constant political football , Fannie Mae realized it could n’t be seen to be abusing its market position .
So rather than go crazy and buy every mortgage security in sight , Fannie Mae just settled on charting a nice predictable upward growth in earnings fueled largely by buying an ever increasing share of its own securities .
Now a normal private company could not pursue this strategy because as it issued more and more debt to fund the golden goose , the yields on the incremental debt would start to increase to the point where the strategy no longer made sense .
But Fannie Mae was different .
Because of the implicit government guarantee of its debt , Fannie could issue incremental debt with little or no regard to its existing debt load because everyone assumed the federal government would backstop the debt .
Fannie
Mae ’s only significant problem thus became that the supply of mortgage securities would prove insufficient to fund its projected earnings growth ( which was well above the projected growth in mortgage debt ) .
As a result Fannie began a series of largely successful political campaigns to increase the volume of mortgage securities available to fund their habit .
Theoretically , the easiest way to increase the supply of mortgage securities was to get the federal government to increase the size limit of mortgages that Fannie could buy and guarantee , but this was a very difficult political fight for Fannie to win because commercial and investment banks dominated the so - called “ jumbo ” mortgage market and , already smarting from Fannie ’s dominance of the so - called “ conforming ” market , they had drawn a line in the sand in the jumbo market and committed most their lobbying resources to keeping Fannie ’s size limit as low as possible .
Moral Hazard vs. Mo’ Money
While Fannie still fought to increase its size limits , it quickly found another , much more politically palatable , way to increase the pool of mortgages it could buy : it dropped underwriting standards under the guise of increasing “ home ownership ” and “ affordability ” .
Traditionally , Fannie had required the mortgages it purchased to be so - called 80/20 mortgages wherein the borrower puts at least a 20 % down payment on the mortgage .
This was a requirement because residential mortgages in the US are a “ no - recourse ” loan in which the borrow can generally “ walk away ” from the loan with no recourse to the lender other than seizing the house and reporting the default to a credit agency .
A 20 % down payment was generally thought to be enough to dramatically limit the moral hazard of borrowers “ walking away ” because housing values would have to decline 20 % + for the borrower to be underwater and even then the borrower would still face the prospect of losing their own sunk capital which makes walking away even more difficult from a psychological perspective
The problem with a 20 % down payment is for many people it was very hard to come up with that big a down payment and thus it limited the total size of the mortgage market which in turn limited the volume of mortgage securities that Fannie Mae could purchase for its golden goose .
While the obvious solution to this problem is just to lower the down payment requirement , Fannie could n’t do this unilaterally because the government unit that regulated it would see such cuts as needlessly raising Fannie Mae ’s risk profile .
Far more politically astute that that , Fannie Mae began a campaign to increase “ home ownership ” and “ affordability ” .
It created a home ownership “ foundation ” which opened offices in almost every congressional district and promptly set about mobilizing all the local advocates for “ affordable ” housing to put pressure on their elected representatives to let Fannie Mae offer “ affordable housing programs ” .
Of course , “ affordable housing problems ” was just a euphemism for allowing Fannie Mae to lower its underwriting standards so that more mortgages could be created and the golden goose could thus kick out more golden eggs .
This proved to be a highly effective political coalition for Fannie Mae .
Not only did they build a huge network of grass roots political supporters through their “ foundation ” , but politicians saw political advantages in supporting the programs because it cast them in the role of trying to help families buy a new home ( as opposed to lowering underwriting standards to help a giant corporation keep up its earnings growth by taking a free ride on the US government ’s guarantee ) .
Even commercial banks and investment banks signed on to the program because it at least resulted in higher origination fees and an expanded credit market , even if most of the assets ultimately went to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
A Victim of Its Own Success
Fast forward to the mid-2000 ’s and Fannie Mae ’s financial and political strategy was largely a resounding success .
Fannie was now offering a wide range of mortgages that required less than a 20 % down payment including even some that required no down payment at all !
These products had dramatically increased the addressable size of the mortgage market .
The increased size of the mortgage market enabled Fannie to purchase a massive amount of its own mortgage securities .
In fact by this point Fannie Mae had become the single largest purchaser of its own securities .
These newly purchased assets in turn enabled Fannie to continue to grow earnings which in turn supported a stock price that continued to trend nicely upward ( though at a much more modest rate ) .
However beneath the seeming calm , the seeds for Fannie ’s distress were now firmly planted .
Fannie ’s drive to lower underwriting standards had created a pool of mortgage debt with a much higher level of embedded moral hazard risk as well as good old fashioned credit risk .
Fannie ’s purchases of mortgage securities were so large that it was getting increasingly difficult to feed the golden goose enough food .
On top of all that , with hundreds of billions of dollars of assets and liabilities to manage , Fannie 's ALM strategies had become more and more complex and some of its bread and butter strategies started to become less profitable as the sheer weight of over half a trillion dollars of debt started to compress spreads ( it would seem that even an implicit government guarantee has its limits ) .
It is no coincidence that the current mortgage crisis started in the so - called sub - prime market as that ’s the mortgage market with the lowest credit quality and underwriting standards , however as the mortgage crisis has spread it has become increasingly clear that the traditional conventional , conforming mortgage market , long the domain of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , shares many more similarities with the sub - prime market than it would like to admit .
While credit and underwriting standards are clearly much higher in the conforming market , they are also undoubtedly much lower than they were 10 or 20 years ago .
What ’s more the two biggest insurers against loss in that market now happen to also be the biggest owners in that market thanks to 20 years of purchasing mortgages to fund their government subsidized golden gooses .
Guaranteeing oneself against risk is not insurance , its an exercise in futility .
The Goose Is Not Dead Yet
Despite all of this , I personally do n’t expect either company to go out of business .
If recent comments from a slew of politicians are any indication , they are indeed “ too big to fail ” .
What I find most ironic in all of the current commotion is that rather than trying to address the root causes of Fannie Mae ’s precarious state : dramatically lower underwriting standards and a massively levered balance sheet taking a free ride on the government ’s back , politicians are doing the exact opposite : they are dramatically increasing the size of the mortgages that Fannie and Freddie can buy and pressuring them to maintain and even further lower their already un-sustainably low underwriting standards .
I do n’t know where this ends , but reinforcing the bad behavior that led to the crisis in the first place can’t end well
UPDATE : See my latest post if you are interested in my take on the Fed / Treasury 's recently announced strategies for helping Fannie / Freddie .
I currently have no investment position , long or short , in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac .

Colbert coins new words to help McCain be 'his own man '
Stephen Colbert spoke Wednesday about John McCain 's habit of referring to Islamic extremism as a " transcendental challenge " or " transcendental threat , " suggesting that McCain is using the word " transcendental " as a method for " distinguishing himself from President Bush . "
" To prove that he's his own man , " Colbert explained , " John McCain has his own word to describe America 's ongoing conflicts . "
Unfortunately , however , " it 's not entirely clear what he 's trying to say . "
" Does he mean transcendent , which according to Webster 's means ' exceeding usual limits ' ? "
Colbert wondered .
" Because the war has certainly exceeded the time limit . "
" Or is he intentionally using the word ' transcendental , ' which is defined by Webster 's as 'of or relating to experience as determined by the mind 's makeup . '
In which case he 's saying the war on terror is all in our heads . "
" John McCain needs to come up with a new word , " Colbert suggested .
" So Senator , let me help you .
From now , keeping our troops in the Middle East is n't just necessary to win the war .
It 's downright Iraq - rosanct . "
" Holding people indefinitely at Guantanamo Bay is Divine Inter - Detention . "
" And secretly sending prisoners to other countries where torture is legal is no longer extraordinary rendition , it 's called Offshore Drilling . "
" I hope those help , " Colbert concluded , " because using language to turn failed policies into ideals that transcend debate is the best way to get people to think of you as Transcen - Presidential . "

Massachusetts lawmakers desperate for additional revenue are eyeing the endowments of deep - pocketed private colleges to bolster the state 's coffers by more than $ 1 billion a year , asserting that the schools ' rising fortunes undercut their nonprofit status .
Legislators have asked state finance officials to study a plan that would impose a 2.5 percent annual assessment on colleges with endowments over $ 1 billion , an amount now exceeded by nine Massachusetts institutions .
The proposal , which higher education specialists believe is the first of its kind across the country , drew surprising support at a debate on the State House budget last week and is attracting attention in higher education circles nationally .
The idea has prompted a range of questions , including whether it is legal to infringe upon private colleges ' tax - exempt status or single them out based on their wealth .
It also faces significant opposition from the colleges and some skeptical lawmakers .
But proponents say the colleges ' vast accumulations of wealth - Harvard University has the biggest endowment at $ 34 billion - and their often modest contributions to their host communities justify the assessment .
" When is a nonprofit not a nonprofit because of the wealth they are acquiring ? " said Representative Paul Kujawski , a Democrat from Webster and chief backer of the legislation .
" It 's mind boggling that one entity not paying taxes has $ 34 billion .
How do you justify that ? " said Kujawski , who serves on the influential House Ways and Means Committee .
" When people can't afford to live .
How do you justify not taxing them ? "
University leaders criticized the plan as a gimmick that would backfire by hurting institutions that are pivotal to the state .
" You 'd be taxing success here , " said Kevin Casey , Harvard 's associate vice president for government , community , and public affairs .
" Over time , this would put us at a real competitive disadvantage , which would drastically hurt the Commonwealth . "
Casey said it was understandable that lawmakers would search for new sources of revenue when economic times are tough .
But he said the law would hurt colleges ' fund - raising and financial aid initiatives .
The plan was introduced amid a national debate over whether elite colleges are hoarding their endowments .
Members of Congress , including Senator Charles Grassley , Republican of Iowa , have questioned why elite universities do not spend more of their vast reserves to defray the cost of tuition .
Amid the scrutiny , some top - tier colleges have sharply expanded financial aid offerings , often replacing student loans with grants and waiving tuition for a greater number of families .
At some of those schools , increases in financial aid are outpacing tuition increases .
The Massachusetts plan has also brought to the fore a more radical notion : whether certain colleges have amassed so much wealth that they no longer deserve to be tax - exempt .
Space is a very dangerous place to be , whether you ’re a human or a transistor .
Highly energetic particles may hit astronauts , causing damage to their DNA , but as computers become more and more powerful ( yet more and more sensitive ) ; the hazards to unprotected circuitry are increasing .
There are many examples of satellites and robotic space missions getting hit by energetic particles , sometimes with crippling results .
Not only are millions of dollars at stake , lives are put at risk too .
Now , using a new technique and material , Northwestern University scientists have developed a new type of transistor with a twist and it is currently being tested on the International Space Station …
Only a few days ago , the spectre of space radiation reared its ugly head .
On June 4th , NASA reported that the Mars orbiter Odyssey had been switched to “ safe mode ” after the spacecraft ’s onboard circuitry was hit by energetic particles from the Sun or from deep space .
Fortunately , to avoid system errors , the satellite switched itself into “ safe - mode ” to await an investigation by mission control to assess any damage .
It is not thought this event has caused any lasting harm to Odyssey , but it did cause delays in communications between Earth and Phoenix .
Other spacecraft have not been so lucky .
One of the earliest examples of satellite failure through space radiation was the world ’s first communications satellite , Telstar .
In 1962 , this historic satellite was launched to provide trans -Atlantic communications for the first time .
Unfortunately , it was launched too soon after a high - altitude US nuclear weapon test codenamed “ Star Fish Prime ” ( see the archival footage of the test ) which resulted in manmade energization of the Earth ’s Van Allen Belts , causing artificial aurorae in equatorial locations such as Hawaii .
Little was known at this time about the response of electrical equipment inside a high - energy environment and Telstar was soon severely damaged as its transistors succumbed to the high energy particles a few months later .
As we now have a huge armada of satellites in orbit around the Earth , and an increasing number of exploratory craft throughout the solar system , there are many vulnerabilities to energetic particles ejected by the Sun .
To address this problem , scientists from Northwestern University sent their new design of transistor to the ISS in March on board Space Shuttle Endeavour .
Since then these microscopic components have been rigorously tested and exposed to a space environment to see how the new material reacts .
Traditionally , computer transistors are manufactured from the semi-conducting material silicon dioxide .
Your home computer uses them , deep space missions such as the New Horizons Pluto mission use them ; silicon - based electronics have revolutionized the computing world .
However , silicon dioxide transistors are susceptible to radiation .
Should a high energy particle impact one of the microscopic transistors of millions that can be built in a microchip , silicon - based material captures the particle , causing a loss of charge or a build - up of charge .
Either way , this is bad for computing as it can result in calculation errors .
The new transistors developed by Northwestern use a new type of gate dielectric material called self - assembled nanodielectric ( SAND ) .
SAND has an added benefit – they can be printed and they are flexible .
This has obvious applications for flat - screen technology and condensing vastly complex circuitry into a very small space .
As this is a departure from silicon dioxide , these transistors appear to be very robust when faced with a high - radiation environment here on Earth .
The ISS experiments are expected to take a year to complete , so the space computing world will be waiting to see if this new technology can revolutionize space - based instrumentation , protecting valuable spacecraft from the ravages of energetic particles …

INDIANAPOLIS - Broadening his attack , Barack Obama said yesterday that Hillary Clinton 's support for a summertime break from the federal gasoline tax symbolizes a candidacy consisting of " phony ideas , calculated to win elections instead of actually solving problems . "
Not so , Clinton told a campaign audience as the next round of primaries approaches .
Obama is " attacking my plan to try to get you some kind of break this summer , " she said .
Locked in a Democratic presidential race for the ages , Clinton and Obama campaigned across Indiana and North Carolina at the same time they competed in Guam 's caucuses and added to their convention delegate totals in several states .
With Obama winning the Guam contests , the Associated Press total showed Obama with 1,742.5 delegates to Clinton 's 1,606.5 .
It takes 2,025 to win the nomination .
Obama campaigned with his wife , Michelle , and their two daughters , Sasha , 6 , and Malia , 9 .
Both candidates are airing ads on the the gasoline issue , and Obama said in his speech that Clinton " had to send a surrogate to speak out on behalf of this plan and all she could find - get this , a lobbyist from Shell Oil to explain how this was going to be good for consumers . "
Phil Singer , a spokesman for Clinton , responded : " Considering that Senator Obama voted to suspend the gas tax three times when gas cost less than $ 2 a gallon and has an energy lobbyist chairing his Indiana campaign , it 's hard to take his latest criticisms very seriously . "
Clinton and Senator John McCain , the expected Republican nominee , have both proposed suspending the levy from Memorial Day to Labor Day as a way of providing relief from record gasoline prices .
Obama opposes the plan , saying it would save a mere 30 cents a day and cost thousands of construction jobs .
Money from the tax goes into a federal fund that pays for highway projects .
Beyond the arguments for and against the tax , the issue has assumed a far larger significance in recent days , Clinton using it to buttress her argument that her rival is out of touch with the needs of working - class Americans , Obama citing it as an example of his opponent 's embrace of what he calls old - style politics .

Maine GOP fends off challenge to McCain slate
Maine 's Republican Party regulars fended off platform challenges partly fueled by a libertarian bloc led by Ron Paul supporters at the GOP state convention yesterday .
They elected a full 12 - member slate of at - large delegates endorsed by John McCain 's campaign to the September national convention .
Julie O'Brien , executive director of the State Republican Party , said it appeared that one of 18 elected national delegates - three were chosen from each of the state 's two congressional districts - would be a Paul supporter .
The at - large slate was led by Republican establishment figures including US Senator Olympia J. Snowe and her husband , former governor John McKernan , as well as the two highest ranking Republican legislators , state Senate minority leader Carol Weston of Montville and House minority leader Josh Tardy of Newport .
Also winning election as a national delegate was Charles Summers , one of the two candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Maine 's open First Congressional District seat .
Summers is the former regional director of the Small Business Administration .
Summers is a former legislator and congressional candidate who has been on active duty in Iraq as a US Navy reservist .

You 'd like to learn perl a bit better , but missing a cool and useful idea ?
Or just want to gather a bit of fame in the Perl community ?
Here are a few project ideas that I 'd would like to see implemented , and that seem interesting enough for me to implement them .
When I have time , which is the caveat - I wo n't get around to them in the near future .
Enough teasing , here 's the list
They are all related to the perl +CPAN infrastructure , and need perl 's facility as a glue language .
Popularity Contest
So you wrote a CPAN module , and after a few weeks you 're a bit disappointed - all smokes are green , you 've got one or two ratings , but still you have no idea how many people actually use your module .
Or at least have it installed .
Debian has a ( partial ) solution for this , named " Popularity Contest " , short popcon .
They offer a package which runs a cron job once a week , and reports ( anonymously ) via email which packages are installed , and ( if this information is available ) if they were used .
I 'd like to see something similar for CPAN distributions .
I would n't send emails ( because not everybody has a mail server installed ) but rather report via HTTP POST requests .
I could argue about usefulllness , for example for perl distributors who want to decide what to deliver by default .
But mostly I 'm just curious about the results .
Offline Command Line Search for CPAN
I 'm one of these unfortunate people who are offline rather often , and of course my best ideas come when I can't search CPAN to find out if somebody did the hard 90 % of the work already .
Also I just do n't like to be forced to use a browser for any task .
Plain CPAN and CPANPLUS can only search in module and distribution names .
That 's why I 'd like to have a command line utility that searches the POD documentation , for example using the excellent KinoSearch module .
Let 's assume there 's already a CPAN :: Mini mirror available ...
Which tests matter ?
The other day a fellow Perlmonger told me about a problem of his :
Some of his modules have quite extensive test suites that need to be maintained .
Over time they assemble some duplicated tests , and removing them would ease the maintenance burden .
There are two nice ideas how to find out which tests matter , both of them involving Devel : : Cover .
The first is to run each test separately with Devel : : Cover , identify which statements and branches are covered , and then search for test files which do n't test anything that is also tested elsewhere .
The second sounds less efficient , but more fun : nuke each test file in turn ( and restore the previously nuked ) , run Devel : : Cover and see if the coverage has changed .
You can use some evolutionary algorithms to optimize removal of multiple test files .
Binary CPAN Mirror
I love CPAN , but I use Linux with a package management system and CPAN ignores that .
It installs to /usr / local / so it 's not that bad , but I 'd like it better if I could install all CPAN packages with my package management system ( in this case apt ) .
I can build Debian packages from CPAN packages with dh - make - perl , but it always takes some time , and I have to check ( and follow ) the dependencies manually .
So what I 'd like to have ( or build ) is a CPAN mirror that automatically builds binary packages from CPAN tar balls .
This is a non-trivial taks because non-perl dependencies are n't encoded in a cross- platform and machine readable format in CPAN packages , but a partial solution for pure - perl only modules would still be formidable .
Mourning 60 gigabytes of loss
They might have been $ 600 at launch , but nowadays there are plenty of gamers who are glad that they sprang for the original 60 GB model of Sony 's PlayStation 3 .
The system features built - in WiFi , every memory card slot you could want , a roomy hard drive , and , most importantly , full , hardware - based backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 2 .
These 60 GB models are prized , hoarded , and , if you do n't have one , hunted .
Why ?
Because not only did Sony discontinue the 60 GB PS3 , but later versions of the console have actually lost features .
In this article , we 'll take a look at what has happened to Sony 's flagship console SKU , and we 'll recount our experience of trying to get one of these precious 60 GB models replaced under warranty .
If you 've got a 60 GB PS3 , you 'll want to read this in case yours ever croaks .
And , if you do n't have one , read it anyway and wonder what Sony is thinking by discontinuing their best unit .
The glory days
Though the PlayStation 3 has been steadily gaining steam , buying one of Sony 's consoles can be a slightly confusing process .
Prior to the latest generation of consoles , gamers have typically enjoyed one standard SKU for the entirety of a console 's life cycle ; in the past most updates were internal and mostly unnoticeable to the end user .
But with the latest generation of consoles from both Sony and Microsoft , different versions of each console differ significantly , to the point where key features are lost and gained across SKUs .
When the PlayStation 3 launched in North America back in November 2006 , two SKU options were available : the 20 GB model and the 60 GB model .
The 20GB PS3 sported a small hard drive , no internal WiFi , no flash card readers , and four USB ports .
The 60GB had the bigger hard drive , integrated WiFi , a bevy of flash card readers , and four USB ports .
Both included the PS2's original Emotion Engine chip , which offered full backwards compatibility with the older console .
By April 2007 , the 20 GB unit had been discontinued , leaving only the 60 GB SKU for consumers .
Though PS3 sales were slow for the first half of 2007 , the 60 GB remained the unit of choice .
Hundreds of thousands of gamers got on board with the 60 GB , unaware that their purchase could become an issue down the road .
In July , the 80GB SKU was announced alongside a $ 100 60 GB price cut .
The 80 GB units hit retail in August .
Aside from the inclusion of MotorStorm and the slightly bigger hard drive , the unit was almost identical to the 60GB .
However , a key hardware revision had taken place : the Emotion Engine chipset had been removed .
This change meant that the console 's PS2 backwards compatibility had gone from full - blown , faultless hardware emulation to mostly - compatible software emulation .
The 60GB , 20GB , 80GB , and 40 GB PlayStation 3 configurations
In spite of the new SKUs , the 60 GB became the preferred unit for many , but it quickly became apparent that its future was n't so bright .
Talk of the discontinuation of the line began as word of yet another SKU surfaced .
These rumblings were ultimately confirmed when the 40 GB SKU landed in November , with the new unit sporting integrated WiFi and two USB slots .
However , the 40 GB no longer included even software emulation for PS2 titles .
In the wake of the 40 GB model 's launch , Sony effectively killed the 20GB and 60 GB units , leaving only the 40GB and 80 GB SKUs to carry the torch .
While the 20 GB unit was never all that popular , stock of the 60 GB continued to dwindle despite the new SKUs .
And why not ?
The 60 GB unit was easily the top - of - the - line PS3 , boasting all the features of its predecessors and successors alike .
Whether it was for purposes of cost - cutting or a desire to keep the sales of the PS2 strong , Sony effectively killed the best PS3 SKU when it quietly discontinued the 60GB .
Those wanting full , integrated backwards compatibility for their PlayStation 3 in lieu of picking up a PlayStation 2 on the side were out of luck .
It 's a confusing situation , to be sure , but the takeaway here is that the discontinued 60 GB unit is effectively the top - of - the - line PS3 SKU , ahead of the two units that are still in production .
This is perhaps the first time that a relatively popular console SKU has been completely eliminated from production during the ongoing life - cycle of the product without an equivalent replacement .
He 's dead , Jim
Given the situation , it 's easy to understand the worry that many 60 GB owners may be feeling in the wake of reports of irreplaceable broken 60 GB units .
My own 60 GB died after almost a year of use ; the unit stopped reading discs during a long session of Grand Theft Auto IV .
The unit was manufactured in February 2007 and purchased in September 2007 .
Though the unit itself is still functional , the laser diode has worn out , hindering the system 's ability to read discs .
This is one of the very few PS3s anyone on the Opposable Thumbs team has heard of breaking down .
With admittedly heavy use and lots of transport , the PS3 seems to be an incredibly hardy piece of equipment .
Nevertheless , mine was dead .
And though I was disappointed , it was time to see how easily we'd be able to get a 60 GB unit replaced or fixed in North America .
Losing backwards compatibility simply was n't acceptable .
I had purchased an extended warranty at a local GameStop outlet ( still called Electronics Boutique in Canada ) in the event that the unit should break .
However , having heard about the issues with returning the now - discontinued unit around the 'net , I knew that the process was n't going to be as painless as one would hope .
Turns out I was right .
Incredible pictures of one of Earth 's last uncontacted tribes firing bows and arrows
Skin painted bright red , heads partially shaved , arrows drawn back in the longbows and aimed square at the aircraft buzzing overhead .
The gesture is unmistakable : Stay Away .
Behind the two men stands another figure , possibly a woman , her stance also seemingly defiant .
Her skin painted dark , nearly black .
The apparent aggression shown by these people is quite understandable .
For they are members of one of Earth 's last uncontacted tribes , who live in the Envira region in the thick rainforest along the Brazilian - Peruvian frontier .
Thought never to have had any contact with the outside world , everything about these people is , and hopefully will remain , a mystery .

Painted :
In a thick rainforest along the Brazilian - Peruvian border , these tribespeople are thought never to have had any contact with the outside world
Their extraordinary body paint , precisely what they eat ( the anthropologists saw evidence of gardens from the air ) , how they construct their tent - like camp , their language , how their society operates - the life of these Amerindians remains a mystery .
' We did the overflight to show their houses , to show they are there , to show they exist , ' said Brazilian uncontacted tribes expert José Carlos dos Reis Meirelles Junior .
' This is very important because there are some who doubt their existence . '
Meirelles , who despite once being shot in the shoulder by an arrow fired by another tribe campaigns to protect these peoples , believes this group 's numbers are increasing , and pointed out how strong and healthy the people seemed .
But other uncontacted groups in the region , whose homes have been photographed from the air , are in severe danger from illegal logging in Peru and populations are being decimated .

Mystery :
The tribespeople are likely to think the plane that took this photograph is a spirit or large bird
Logging is driving uncontacted tribes over the border and could lead to conflict with the estimated five hundred uncontacted Indians already living on the Brazilian side .
' What is happening in this region [ of Peru ] is a monumental crime against the natural world , the tribes , the fauna and is further testimony to the complete irrationality with which we , the ' civilised ' ones , treat the world , ' said Meirelles .
It is extraordinary to think that , in 2008 , there remain about a hundred groups of people , scattered over the Earth , who know nothing of our world and we nothing of theirs , save a handful of brief encounters .
The uncontacted tribes , which are located in the jungles of South America , New Guinea and a remote and the beautiful and remote North Sentinel island in the Indian Ocean ( the inhabitants of which have also responded to attempts at contact with extreme aggression ) all have one thing in common - they want to be left alone .
And for good reason .
The history of contact , between indigenous tribes and the outside world , has always been an unhappy one .

Human nature :
One man points at the plane .
Others ready their weapons
In our overcrowded world their very future hangs in the balance .
Almost all of these tribes are threatened by powerful outsiders who want their land .
These outsiders - loggers , miners , cattle ranchers - are often willing to kill the tribespeople to get what they want .
Even where there is no violence , the tribes can be wiped out by diseases like the common cold to which they have no resistance .
According to Miriam Ross of Survival International , which campaigns to protect the world 's remaining indigenous peoples , ' These tribes represent the incredible diversity of humankind .
Unless we want to condemn yet more of the earth 's peoples to extinction , we must respect their choice .
Any contact they have with outsiders must happen in their own time and on their own terms . '
As to who these people are , how they live their lives , what language they speak - we know nothing .
' Normally you can tell who tribes are by their language , how they wear their hair , how they adorn their bodies and so on , but in this case the photos do n't allow us to get close enough to see , ' says Ms Ross .

Hidden homes :
The tribe 's tent - shaped dwellings deep in the rainforest
When anthropologists first overflew the area , they saw women and children in the open and no one appeared to be painted .
It was only when the plane returned a few hours later that they saw these individuals covered head - to - toe in red .
' Tribes in the Amazon paint themselves for all kinds of different reasons - one of which includes when they feel threatened or are aggressive , ' Ms Ross says .
' And they are almost certain to feel threatened by or aggressive towards a plane , which was where the photos were taken from .
They are almost certain not to understand what the plane is - perhaps a spirit or a large bird .
' The jungle is fundamental to their lives and survival .
It 's their home , their source of food , the source of their culture etc .
Without it , they could not exist as a people . '
Contact is usually a disaster for these remote tribespeople , who live a life probably unchanged for more than 10,000 years .
Even if the loggers do not shoot them ( which they often do ) or force them off their land , diseases against which these isolated humans have no resistance typically wipe out half an uncontacted tribe 's numbers in a year or two .
Stay away :
The anthropologists saw evidence of gardens , but exactly what they eat , how they build their huts and why they paint their bodies remains unknown
Ms Ross added : ' These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist .
The world needs to wake up to this , and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law .
Otherwise , they will soon be made extinct . '

You are here : Home / Photography / Airbus A380 airline Emirates
The Airbus A380 is a double - deck , wide - body , four - engine airliner manufactured by the European corporation Airbus , a subsidiary of EADS .
The largest passenger airliner in the world , the A380 made its maiden flight on 27 April 2005 from Toulouse , France , and made its first commercial flight on 25 October 2007 from Singapore to Sydney with Singapore Airlines .
The aircraft was known as the Airbus A3XX during much of its development phase , but the nickname Superjumbo has since become associated with it .
The A380 ’s upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage , and its width is equivalent to that of a widebody aircraft .
This allows for a cabin with 50 % more floor space than the next - largest airliner , the Boeing 747-400 , and provides seating for 525 people in a typical three - class configuration or up to 853 people in all - economy class configurations .
The postponed freighter version , the A380 - 800 F , is offered as one of the largest freight aircraft , with a payload capacity exceeded only by the Antonov An-225 .
The A380 - 800 has a design range of 15,200Â km ( 8,200Â nmi ) , sufficient to fly from New York to Hong Kong for example , and a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 ( about 900Â km /h or 560Â mph at cruising altitude ) .
In the summer of 1988 , a group of Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began working in secret on the development of a ultra - high - capacity airliner ( UHCA ) , both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747 .
McDonnell Douglas unsuccessfully offered its smaller , double - deck MD - 12 concept for sale .
Roeder was given approval for further evaluations of the UHCA after a formal presentation to the President and CEO in June 1990 .
The project was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Air Show , with the stated goal of 15 % lower operating costs than the 747-400 .
Airbus organized four teams of designers , one from each of its EADS partners ( AÃ©rospatiale , DaimlerChrysler Aerospace , British Aerospace , EADS CASA ) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs .
The designs would be presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs would be used
In January 1993 , Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of an aircraft known as the Very Large Commercial Transport ( VLCT ) , aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market .
This study was abandoned two years later , Boeing ’s interest having decreased .
In June 1994 , Airbus began developing its own very large airliner , designated the A3XX .
Airbus considered several designs , including an odd side - by - side combination of two fuselages from the A340 , which was Airbusâ€ ™s largest jet at the time .
The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeingâ€™s own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747 .
From 1997 to 2000 , as the East Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook , Airbus refined its design , targeting a 15 to 20 percent reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747-400 .
The A3XX design converged on a double - decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single - deck design
On 19 December 2000 , the supervisory board of newly restructured Airbus voted to launch a â‚ ¬8.8 - billion programme to build the A3XX , re-christened as the A380 , with 50 firm orders from six launch customers .
The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families , which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340 .
It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double - deck cross section , and is a lucky number in some Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed .
The aircraftâ€™s configuration was finalised in early 2001 , and manufacturing of the first A380 wing box component started on 23 January 2002 .
The development cost of the A380 had grown to â‚¬11 billion when the first aircraft was completed .
Major structural sections of the A380 are built in France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom .
Due to their size , they are brought to the assembly hall in Toulouse in France by surface transportation , though some parts are moved by the A300 - 600ST Beluga aircraft used in the construction of other Airbus models .
Components of the A380 are provided by suppliers from around the world ; the five largest contributors , by value , are Rolls - Royce , SAFRAN , United Technologies , General Electric , and Goodrich .
The front and rear sections of the fuselage are loaded on an Airbus Roll - on / roll - off ( RORO ) ship , Ville de Bordeaux , in Hamburg in northern Germany , from where they are shipped to the United Kingdom .
The wings , which are manufactured at Filton in Bristol and Broughton in North Wales , are transported by barge to Mostyn docks , where the ship adds them to its cargo .
In Saint - Nazaire in western France , the ship trades the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger , assembled sections , some of which include the nose .
The ship unloads in Bordeaux .
Afterwards , the ship picks up the belly and tail sections by Construcciones AeronÃ¡uticas SA in CÃ¡diz in southern Spain , and delivers them to Bordeaux .
From there , the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon , and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse .
Roads and canals were widened and replaced ; and new barges were developed to deliver the A380 parts .
After assembly , the aircraft are flown to Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport ( XFW ) to be furnished and painted .
It takes 3,600Â l ( 950Â US gal ) of paint to cover the 3,100Â m2 ( 33,000Â sqÂ ft ) exterior of an A380 .
Airbus sized the production facilities and supply chain for a production rate of four A380s per month .
Five A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes .
The first A380 , serial number MSN001 and registration F - WWOW , was unveiled at a ceremony in Toulouse on 18 January 2005 .
Its maiden flight took place at 8:29 UTC ( 10:29 a.m. local time ) 27 April 2005 .
This plane , equipped with Trent 900 engines , flew from Toulouse Blagnac International Airport with a flight crew of six headed by chief test pilot Jacques Rosay .
After successfully landing three hours and 54 minutes later , Rosay said flying the A380 had been â€ œlike handling a bicycleâ€ 
On 1 December 2005 , the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach 0.96 ( versus normal cruising speed of Mach 0.85 ) , in a shallow dive , completing the opening of the flight envelope .
On 10 January 2006 , the A380 made its first transatlantic flight to MedellÃ­n in Colombia , to test engine performance at a high altitude airport .
It arrived in North America on 6 February , landing in Iqaluit , Nunavut in Canada for cold - weather testing
On 14 February 2006 , during the destructive wing strength certification test on MSN5000 , the test wing of the A380 failed at 145 % of the limit load , short of the required 150 % to meet the certification .
Airbus announced modifications adding 30 Â kg to the wing to provide the required strength .
On 26 March 2006 , the A380 underwent evacuation certification in Hamburg , Germany .
With 8 of the 16 exits blocked , 853 passengers and 20 crew left the aircraft in 78 seconds , less than the 90 seconds required by certification standards .
Three days later , the A380 received European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) and United States Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) approval to carry up to 853 passengers .
The maiden flight of the first A380 using GP7200 enginesâ€ ” serial number MSN009 and registration F - WWEAâ € ” took place on 25 August 2006 .
On 4 September 2006 , the first full passenger - carrying flight test took place .
The aircraft flew from Toulouse with 474 Airbus employees on board , in the first of a series of flights to test passenger facilities and comfort .
In November 2006 , a further series of route proving flights took place to demonstrate the aircraft ’s performance for 150 flight hours under typical airline operating conditions
Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530Â km ( 330Â mi ) of wiring in each aircraft .
Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring ( 100,000 wires and 40,300 connectors ) , its concurrent design and production , the high degree of customization for each airline , and failures of configuration management and change control .
Specifically , it would appear that German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4 , while British and French sites migrated to version 5 .
This caused overall configuration management problems , at least in part because wiring harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non-standard dimensions and bend radii ; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software
Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months .
This reduced the number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90â €“ 100 .
On 13 June 2006 , Airbus announced a second delay , with the delivery schedule undergoing an additional shift of six to seven months .
Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006 , deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft , and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70â € “ 80 aircraft .
The announcement caused a 26 % drop in the share price of Airbus ’s parent , EADS , and led to the departure of EADS CEO NoÃ«l Forgeard , Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert , and A380 programme manager Charles Champion .
On 3 October 2006 , upon completion of a review of the A380 program , the CEO of Airbus , Christian Streiff , announced a third delay , pushing the first delivery to October 2007 , to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008 , 25 in 2009 , and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010 .
The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to â‚ ¬4.8 billion .
As Airbus prioritized the work on the A380 - 800 over the A380 - 800 F , freighter orders were cancelled by FedEx and UPS , or converted to A380 - 800 by Emirates and ILFC .
Airbus suspended work on the freighter version , but said it remained on offer , albeit without a service entry date .
For the passenger version Airbus negotiated a revised delivery schedule and compensation with the 13 customers , all of which retained their orders with some placing subsequent orders , including Emirates , Singapore Airlines , Qantas , Air France , Qatar , and Korean Air .
The first A380 with redesigned wiring harnesses achieved power - on in April 2008 , with a 3 Â ½ month delay .
On 13 May 2008 Airbus announced reduced deliveries for the years 2008 ( 12 ) and 2009 ( 21 ) .
After further manufacturing and market setbacks , Airbus now plans to deliver 14 A380s in 2009 , down from the previous target of 18 .
The first aircraft delivered ( MSN003 , registered 9V - SKA ) was handed over to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered into service on 25 October 2007 with an inaugural flight between Singapore and Sydney ( flight number SQ380 ) .
Passengers bought seats in a charity online auction paying between $ 560 and $ 100,380 .
Two months later , Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng said that the A380 was performing better than both the airline and Airbus had anticipated , burning 20 % less fuel per passenger than the airline ’s existing 747-400 fleet .
Emirates was the second airline to take delivery of the A380 on 28 July 2008 and started flights between Dubai and New York on 1 August 2008 .
Qantas followed on 19 September 2008 , starting flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles on 20 October 2008 .
By the end of 2008 , 890,000 passengers had flown on 2,200 A380 flights totaling 21,000 hours

AUSA offers $ 5000 for citizen 's arrest of Rice

AUSA offers $ 5000 for citizen 's arrest of Rice
Auckland students seek the arrest of a high - level United States official visiting Auckland this weekend .
New Zealand 's largest students ' association has offered any Auckland University student a $ 5000 reward if they are able to make a successful citizen 's arrest of United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit to Auckland over the weekend , for her role in overseeing the illegal invasion and continued occupation of Iraq .
" It is hard enough living as a student in Auckland these days without having a war criminal coming to town , so we thought we'd give our students a chance to make a dent in their student loans and work for global justice at the same time " , says AUSA President David Do .
The invasion and occupation of Iraq was overseen by Condoleeza Rice and other US officials in her role as National Security Advisor and later Secretary of State ( equivalent to Minister of Foreign Affairs ) .
“ Generally when US officials visit overseas they are heavily shielded from the general public , and unfortunately its not hard to see why , ” adds David Do .
" Rice is the public spokesperson for an illegal and immoral occupation that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the continued oppression of the people of Iraq .
We believe Rice should be arrested and detained in accordance with the law and tried fairly at the International Criminal Court for her role in these war crimes , " said AUSA International Affairs Officer Omar Hamed , who moved the motion for the reward at Monday ’s AUSA Executive meeting .
Citizen ’s arrests of high ranking government officials have been attempted recently :
-John Bolton , the former US ambassador to the United Nations , escaped an attempted citizen 's arrest by author and activist George Monbiot at the British Hay Arts Festival in late May 2008 .
-Peace activist Peter McGregor attempted a citizen ’s arrest of Australia ’s then Attorney - General Philip Ruddock as a war criminal at the University of New South Wales in July 2007
-Campaigner Peter Tatchell has twice attempted to make a citizen 's arrest on Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe .

Human identity , the idea that defines each and every one of us , could be facing an unprecedented crisis .
It is a crisis that would threaten long - held notions of who we are , what we do and how we behave .
It goes right to the heart - or the head - of us all .
This crisis could reshape how we interact with each other , alter what makes us happy , and modify our capacity for reaching our full potential as individuals .
And it 's caused by one simple fact : the human brain , that most sensitive of organs , is under threat from the modern world .
PROFESSOR SUSAN GREENFIELD
Unless we wake up to the damage that the gadget - filled , pharmaceutically - enhanced 21st century is doing to our brains , we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro - chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines , and between our bodies and the outside world .
It would be a world where such devices could enhance our muscle power , or our senses , beyond the norm , and where we all take a daily cocktail of drugs to control our moods and performance .
Already , an electronic chip is being developed that could allow a paralysed patient to move a robotic limb just by thinking about it .
As for drug manipulated moods , they 're already with us - although so far only to a medically prescribed extent .
Increasing numbers of people already take Prozac for depression , Paxil as an antidote for shyness , and give Ritalin to children to improve their concentration .
But what if there were still more pills to enhance or " correct " a range of other specific mental functions ?
What would such aspirations to be " perfect " or " better " do to our notions of identity , and what would it do to those who could not get their hands on the pills ?
Would some finally have become more equal than others , as George Orwell always feared ?
Of course , there are benefits from technical progress - but there are great dangers as well , and I believe that we are seeing some of those today .
I 'm a neuroscientist and my day - to - day research at Oxford University strives for an ever greater understanding - and therefore maybe , one day , a cure - for Alzheimer 's disease .
But one vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine .
It not only goes on developing , changing and , in some tragic cases , eventually deteriorating with age , it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life .
When I say " shaped " , I 'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically ; I 'm talking literally .
At a microcellular level , the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli .
The brain , in other words , is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood , and , in certain instances , beyond .
The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind .
Of course , there 's nothing new about that : human brains have been changing , adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries .
What prompted me to write my book is that the pace of change in the outside environment and in the development of new technologies has increased dramatically .
This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined .
Our brains are under the influence of an ever - expanding world of new technology : multichannel television , video games , MP3 players , the internet , wireless networks , Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on .

But our modern brains are also having to adapt to other 21st century intrusions , some of which , such as prescribed drugs like Ritalin and Prozac , are supposed to be of benefit , and some of which , such as widelyavailable illegal drugs like cannabis and heroin , are not .
Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains .
And that , in turn , affects our personality , our behaviour and our characteristics .
In short , the modern world could well be altering our human identity .
Three hundred years ago , our notions of human identity were vastly simpler : we were defined by the family we were born into and our position within that family .
Social advancement was nigh on impossible and the concept of " individuality " took a back seat .
That only arrived with the Industrial Revolution , which for the first time offered rewards for initiative , ingenuity and ambition .
Suddenly , people had their own life stories - ones which could be shaped by their own thoughts and actions .
For the first time , individuals had a real sense of self .
But with our brains now under such widespread attack from the modern world , there 's a danger that that cherished sense of self could be diminished or even lost .
Anyone who doubts the malleability of the adult brain should consider a startling piece of research conducted at Harvard Medical School .
There , a group of adult volunteers , none of whom could previously play the piano , were split into three groups .
The first group were taken into a room with a piano and given intensive piano practise for five days .
The second group were taken into an identical room with an identical piano - but had nothing to do with the instrument at all .
And the third group were taken into an identical room with an identical piano and were then told that for the next five days they had to just imagine they were practising piano exercises .
The resultant brain scans were extraordinary .
Not surprisingly , the brains of those who simply sat in the same room as the piano had n't changed at all .
Equally unsurprising was the fact that those who had performed the piano exercises saw marked structural changes in the area of the brain associated with finger movement .
But what was truly astonishing was that the group who had merely imagined doing the piano exercises saw changes in brain structure that were almost as pronounced as those that had actually had lessons .
" The power of imagination " is not a metaphor , it seems ; it 's real , and has a physical basis in your brain .
Alas , no neuroscientist can explain how the sort of changes that the Harvard experimenters reported at the micro-cellular level translate into changes in character , personality or behaviour .
But we do n't need to know that to realise that changes in brain structure and our higher thoughts and feelings are incontrovertibly linked .
What worries me is that if something as innocuous as imagining a piano lesson can bring about a visible physical change in brain structure , and therefore some presumably minor change in the way the aspiring player performs , what changes might long stints playing violent computer games bring about ?
That eternal teenage protest of 'it 's only a game , Mum ' certainly begins to ring alarmingly hollow .
Already , it 's pretty clear that the screen - based , two dimensional world that so many teenagers - and a growing number of adults - choose to inhabit is producing changes in behaviour .
Attention spans are shorter , personal communication skills are reduced and there 's a marked reduction in the ability to think abstractly .
This games - driven generation interpret the world through screen - shaped eyes .
It 's almost as if something has n't really happened until it 's been posted on Facebook , Bebo or YouTube .
Add that to the huge amount of personal information now stored on the internet - births , marriages , telephone numbers , credit ratings , holiday pictures - and it's sometimes difficult to know where the boundaries of our individuality actually lie .
Only one thing is certain : those boundaries are weakening .
And they could weaken further still if , and when , neurochip technology becomes more widely available .
These tiny devices will take advantage of the discovery that nerve cells and silicon chips can happily co-exist , allowing an interface between the electronic world and the human body .
One of my colleagues recently suggested that someone could be fitted with a cochlear implant ( devices that convert sound waves into electronic impulses and enable the deaf to hear ) and a skull - mounted micro- chip that converts brain waves into words ( a prototype is under research ) .
Then , if both devices were connected to a wireless network , we really would have arrived at the point which science fiction writers have been getting excited about for years .
Mind reading !
He was joking , but for how long the gag remains funny is far from clear .
Today 's technology is already producing a marked shift in the way we think and behave , particularly among the young .
I must n't , however , be too censorious , because what I 'm talking about is pleasure .
For some , pleasure means wine , women and song ; for others , more recently , sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll ; and for millions today , endless hours at the computer console .
But whatever your particular variety of pleasure ( and energetic sport needs to be added to the list ) , it 's long been accepted that ' pure ' pleasure - that is to say , activity during which you truly " let yourself go " - was part of the diverse portfolio of normal human life .
Until now , that is .
Now , coinciding with the moment when technology and pharmaceutical companies are finding ever more ways to have a direct influence on the human brain , pleasure is becoming the sole be - all and end - all of many lives , especially among the young .
We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer - generated moment , and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world .
This is a trend that worries me profoundly .
For as any alcoholic or drug addict will tell you , nobody can be trapped in the moment of pleasure forever .
Sooner or later , you have to come down .
I 'm certainly not saying all video games are addictive ( as yet , there is not enough research to back that up ) , and I genuinely welcome the new generation of " brain - training " computer games aimed at keeping the little grey cells active for longer .
As my Alzheimer 's research has shown me , when it comes to higher brain function , it 's clear that there is some truth in the adage " use it or lose it " .
However , playing certain games can mimic addiction , and that the heaviest users of these games might soon begin to do a pretty good impersonation of an addict .
Throw in circumstantial evidence that links a sharp rise in diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and the associated three - fold increase in Ritalin prescriptions over the past ten years with the boom in computer games and you have an immensely worrying scenario .
But we must n't be too pessimistic about the future .
It may sound frighteningly Orwellian , but there may be some potential advantages to be gained from our growing understanding of the human brain 's tremendous plasticity .
What if we could create an environment that would allow the brain to develop in a way that was seen to be of universal benefit ?
I 'm not convinced that scientists will ever find a way of manipulating the brain to make us all much cleverer ( it would probably be cheaper and far more effective to manipulate the education system ) .
And nor do I believe that we can somehow be made much happier - not , at least , without somehow anaesthetising ourselves against the sadness and misery that is part and parcel of the human condition .
When someone I love dies , I still want to be able to cry .
But I do , paradoxically , see potential in one particular direction .
I think it possible that we might one day be able to harness outside stimuli in such a way that creativity - surely the ultimate expression of individuality - is actually boosted rather than diminished .
I am optimistic and excited by what future research will reveal into the workings of the human brain , and the extraordinary process by which it is translated into a uniquely individual mind .
But I 'm also concerned that we seem to be so oblivious to the dangers that are already upon us .
Well , that debate must start now .
Identity , the very essence of what it is to be human , is open to change - both good and bad .
Our children , and certainly our grandchildren , will not thank us if we put off discussion much longer .
