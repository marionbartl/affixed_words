South Korea 's media is reporting that the North and South Korean navies have clashed in the Yellow Sea .
The exchange of fire is said to have happened along the disputed sea border between the two Koreas .
A South Korean defence official quoted by the Yonhap news agency in Seoul said a South Korean navy ship fired warning shots after a North Korean patrol vessel crossed the sea border .
The official says the North Koreans then fired back and continued on their course .
Yonhap says more shots were fired and the North Korean ship was badly damaged in the exchange .
The disputed border in the Yellow Sea was the scene of deadly clashes between the two Koreas in 1999 and 2002 .
The communist North last month accused South Korea of sending warships across the border to stir tensions .
The Brazilian Grand Prix looks like being a straight fight between Rubens Barrichello and Mark Webber .
The chaotic qualifying session at the Brazilian Grand Prix , and the subsequent mixed - up grid , makes drawing definitive conclusions from the fuel - adjusted lap times difficult .
The drivers in the top 10 shoot - out are not allowed to refuel between qualifying and the race , so their pace is dictated by how much fuel they have on board .
And once the weight of fuel in the cars in the final session is taken into account , Red Bull 's Webber emerges as the fastest man in the field , with pole - man Barrichello second , albeit by a margin of only 0.056 seconds .
Qualifying was held in the wet , and forecasts for the race are mixed .
But it is still possible to draw a sense of who might be in best shape for the race .
TOKYO — Filmmaker Michael Moore urged President Barack Obama on Monday not to expand the war in Afghanistan , as Washington prepares to announce a surge of US troops in the conflict - torn nation .
Moore , visiting Japan this week to promote his latest documentary “ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” told reporters that he had sent Obama a message from his father , a World War II veteran .

“ I passed on to him a personal request from my father and his Japanese friend : ‘ Mr. Obama , you do not know war .
We both know war and want it no more ’ , ” he told reporters .
The activist director , whose latest movie targets corporate greed , held his first press conference in Japan at the Tokyo Stock Exchange , where he passionately discussed freedom and protection for the socially weak , and dished out harsh criticism against former US president George W. Bush .
Moore repeatedly praised the traditional values of Japan , but he criticised Tokyo for supporting Bush ’s policies , including by sending non-combat troops to Iraq and adopting pro-market economic policies .
Asked to offer a message to the Japanese public , Moore urged them to return to a “ society of peace and respect . ”
“ As much as I like America , quit being like us .
Be Japan , ” he said .

Moore , visiting Japan for the first time , came to the press conference in a casual coat over a black sweat shirt and sweat pants , looking decidedly casual .
“ The airline lost my luggage , ” he said , adding that one of his first stops in Tokyo was a clothing store popular with sumo wrestlers .
“ Where are they going to find a store in Japan with clothes that fit me ?
I am partly in my pyjamas and partly in sumo attire , ” he said .

I just moved from san francisco , after 11 long , dark years .
I was disabled in a car accident just a few months after moving there .
The driver of the truck that made an illegal left turn in front of me on a green light was driving without a license .
After my car slammed into his ( at 35 m ph ) , he jumped out of the truck , ran up the street , got his wife , dragged her back to the scene & insisted she tell the cops she had been driving .
There were over 30 witnesses .
Not a SINGLE PERSON came over to my sedan and helped me out of my car .
The horn was blaring and the smoke from the airbag was choking me .
I was totally in shock , disbelief , and scared the car was gonna blow up with me trapped in it .
I had to climb over to the passenger side of the car and force the door open .
I crawled out and walked to the sidewalk , asking what had happened .
One person came up to me to tell me they had seen the guy run up the street .
The ambulance came & strapped me to a board ( wow , I still remeber how awful the pain of the board was - weird ) .
They put me in the ambulance , and as I lay there , the man and his wife got in the ambulance & sat down .
A cop came in and asked me what happened .
At that time I did n't know much more than seeing the white toyota truck suddenly appearing before me , me saying " oh my god ! "
About three times before impact , and the collision .
The man continued to deny he'd been the driver , and he looked sullen , his wife totally scared next to him .
I went to the emergency room , got an xray and was sent home .
For the next ten years , my life was a complete misery .
I did not know / understand until last year that my strange behavior following the accident was the result of traumatic brain injury .
I knew I had PTSD , and anxiety , and eventually found a psychiatrist who helped me immensely , though the drugs I am taking are toxic to my body .
I had fibromyalgia ( unknown & undiagnosed ) most of my life .
The accident multiplied its effects about 1000 % .
My life has never been the same .
Doctors ignored me as I tried to find answers or help - offering me sleeping pills and advising me to exercise , when I could n't even climb three steps without being so tired I needed to rest for 1/2 hour .
And so forth .
My family ( wealthy successful leaders in the democratic party , btw ) had no idea what to do with or about me as I spiralled downhill , bedridden for two of the last ten years - possibly due to the effects of anaesthesia following a couple medical procedures , and DEFINITELY due to the side effects of Celexa , an SSRI - type ' antidepressant ' that , in my opinion , is of the ' devil " to coin a phrase .
My sainted husband , who was himself diagnosed with MS two years into our marriage , has been my caretaker this whole time .
He has learned how to take incredibly good care of himself and until the last six months , his symptoms were so minimal , due to the incredibly inexpensive allopathic drug , nutritional choices , and medical marijuana , that his bosses : world - reknowned & respected researchers in the field of MS MEDICATIONS !
have forbidden him from participating in any more clinical trials - BECAUSE HE SKEWS THE RESULTS .
To say I am a little down on western medicine does n't come anywhere close to expressing my fury .
I KNOW the drug companies formulate medications that are deathly .
Perhaps it 's true that 45,000 people die each year from lack of health coverage , but far more than 100,000 die from bad TREATMENTS and drug interactions and bad prescriptions , etc .
Our health ' care ' system is BROKEN .
Doctors who attempt to promote simple , sensible solutions to costly , complex , life - threatening diseases like cancer & diabetes are run out of town on a rail , dismissed from the insurance company rosters , removed from hospital privileges , and the like .
It 's as if the Mafia is running this business - facilitating addiction and dependence on costly drugs at the expense of EVERYONE'S wellbeing .
Nancy Pelosi is just one monster in an army of monsters who are running our country with a determined focus on undermining our wellbeing on EVERY front - foreclosures , pension destruction , eviscerating the schools , the towns , the cities , the public service infrastructure .
It 's just mindboggling what 's going on around us .
I am , ironically , finally applying for SSDI , as I have come to the sad conclusion that I cannot work any more , and we do n't have the money to pay for treatments I believe might help me to recover from the significant pain I suffer daily , weekly , monthly , pretty much 24/7 , 365 .
I do have some good days , and I treasure them .
But my husband , who has been such a trooper , is so exhausted after our recent move that two months after we ' downsized ' , he is crying at the breakfast table with fear , overwhelm , and despair .
His MS symptoms have recurred with a vengeance , and he's so debilitated that I am now worried sick about him .
My parents are helping us with the rent now , and although my father called my husband a couple of months ago to reassure him that they would n't let us go down and become homeless , he added the kicker that my husband should show me ' tough love ' even though my husband had told him & my mom about my four - day back spasm episode where I took 26 Percocets during that period , to no avail .
( I will never take another Percocet - next time I 'm in that much pain , I 'm calling 911 ! ) .
And also , during our move - leaving a fully furnished 5 br home ( we were renters & master tenants , so I had a fulltime job just filling the rooms so we could make the rent every month - we never missed one month paying the $ 3000 rent , either ) to a 1 br tiny little slice of heaven , where we pay an outrageous $ 1000 per month , , , not ONE SINGLE FRIEND in our network of ' caring , community - oriented spiritual seekers , even called to ASK US HOW THE MOVE WAS GOING , let alone offer to HELP !
Even though they KNOW we are disabled , were emotionally distraught at the situation that occurred in our home the final six months that precipitated our need to move , etc. Etc. Etc .
Not even my BEST FRIEND called to check in on us .
Until I sent out an email stating my need so clearly to 20 ' close ' friends , and only four even replied , with only two people showing up for a few hours , with never another call to see how we 're doing AFTER the move .
So what I see , why I 've told you just this small sliver of my atrocious decade of eye - opening experiences , is that we as a country are so shut down , so asleep , and so numbed out that it is hard for me to believe that there are enough of us who GET IT to reach and touch and awaken the many sleepers .
The whole system we live under appears calculated to keep us desperate , separate , and in isolation .
My friends , I am in action .
I am talking to people .
I am telling my story .
I 'm telling people that the dollar is dying , that money is a fiction , and that we'd better start learning to care for ourselves and eahc other .
And some of us know how .
But there are so many more who do n't and when the system completely collapses , as I believe it is in the process of doing , this desperate but mind - controlled sleepers will think of nothing but ' I 'm hungry - let 's EAT . '
I think we must prepare .
Nancy Pelosi is but a symptom .
The disease is isolation .
We must join together , talk , share , teach ourselves what we need to know to make the transition .
Health care will be the least of our worries ...
Commercial real estate is dealing with the neutron bomb effect .
The buildings still stand but the inside is gutted as if vultures had devoured a carcass .
What we are seeing , like in many other sectors of our economy , is a distinction between reality based economics and the inflated prices of Wall Street .
If we look at the stock market , you would n’t know that people are lining up at Wal - Mart at midnight at the end of the month waiting for paychecks or government assistance to clear simply to buy food .
You also would n’t know that 27 million people are either unemployed or underemployed .
The irony of this is banks do know how bad the economy really is including the disaster that is commercial real estate .
Banks are building up reserves to brace for what is going to be a long and hard road ahead .
To understand commercial real estate , we first have to see the actual damage .
In 2007 , commercial real estate values came in at approximately $ 6.5 trillion backed by $ 3.5 trillion in loans .
Today , the $ 3.5 trillion in loans are still on the books , but the values have fallen to about $ 3.575 trillion .
This is how it looks :
We should spend some time examining the chart above because $ 3 trillion in supposed equity has vanished .
As we now know , banks had questionable valuations on properties during the peak bubble years .
Most realize that if they had to mark to market the properties , they would yield 40 to 50 percent less if they are lucky .
Banks would like to play this game that all is fine but if all is fine , why do n’t they liquidate the properties ?
They wo n’t because they would have to realize the loss .
So instead , the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are monetizing this excessive debt and are going to destroy the U.S. dollar .
This is the bet .
They think , that at some point values will once again reach those peak valuations .
How will that happen ?
Ideally through controlled inflation .
But this is n’t a guarantee .
If we face true demographic shifts in our nation and the baby boomer wave is one , then we may never see those peak valuations again .
What will happen is the average American is going to see a weaker currency and wonder why their once stronger dollar is so weak .
The reason for this is the Fed and U.S. Treasury have decide to bailout the entire banking industry on the backs of the average American with no benefit to them .
Walk through the logic however .
The pretense of all the bailouts has been that financial Armageddon would hit if the banks did n’t get exactly what they wanted and no loans would be made .
The actual destruction was really just with the banks because our economy is still hurting but apparently banks are back to record profits .
Banks got their money yet loans are still hard to find for average Americans .
Banks are holding back enormous reserves because in the reality based economy , they know that commercial real estate is imploding internally on their balance sheet .
Take a look at the excess reserves at banks :
Banks are now holding roughly $ 1 trillion in excess reserves .
This is up from $ 724 billion in March since the “ recovery ” has started .
Do banks know something we do n’t ?
Of course .
They know that many of the commercial real estate borrowers are now insolvent .
In many cases , banks are simply rolling over loans and giving six month extensions playing kick the can down the road .
Why ?
Because banks can still claim high valuations even though the current borrower is basically a non-payer .
This is the kind of game we are currently in .
Commercial real estate is imploding on the balance sheet of banks .
Banks and Wall Street have completely disconnected from economic reality that even SNL is cracking jokes about this .
In a recent Deutsche Bank presentation , the delinquency rate on commercial loans is at 4 percent .
Deutsche Bank expects 70 percent of CRE loans to not qualify for refinancing .
That comes out to about $ 2 trillion in commercial real estate that will mature from now until 2013 .
The Fed through TALF has tried to take some of this debt out of the system but now their books are over burdened .
Also , many of the commercial real estate loans are junior and do n’t even qualify for TALF and these are the real problems .
Either way , the reality of the situation is many of these commercial loans are now imploding and many banks are failing on Friday ’s like flies running into the light .
Unlike the residential real estate bubble , most commercial real estate loans are backed by shorter term financing that is based on 5 to 7 year terms .
If prices have fallen by 40 to 45 percent , refinancing becomes impossible :
If we look at the above , some of the more distressed properties are down by a stunning 56 percent .
In other words , banks are insolvent .
Unlike the average American , they have Wall Street and the proxy of Wall Street , the U.S. government as their life line .
While most Americans deal with the realities of a crashing economy via unemployment or disappearing wages , these banks are playing games with their balance sheet and claiming to put out wicked profits quarter after quarter .
Where are these profits coming from ?
Well if you can claim that you have $ 6.5 trillion in CRE values when in reality , it is closer to $ 3.5 trillion then you are embellishing the books by $ 3 trillion .
To be more concise , the banking sector is largely insolvent if it had to reflect reality .
Instead , it is preparing for clandestine bailouts that will be shouldered by the American public .
The commercial real estate disaster reflects a deeper problem in our economy .
The strip mall and perma - growth world .
People started believing that we could basically cut each other ’s hair and flip houses to one another and this was somehow a good diversified economy .
As it turns out , we do need to make things .
If you look at the recent CPI , rents have fallen by over 1 percent but food and other necessities have gone up .
Imported items have also increased .
Expect this to happen over and over .
The Fed is vigorously fighting any audit because we are going to see empty strip malls and failed condo projects on their books .
Lender of last resort was probably not designed to bailout late night infomercial tanned gurus that bombed out on their dream of everyone owning a Florida condo .
Is this really what our central bank has become ?
And to highlight how good the economy is , foreclosures keep growing :
“ ( Yahoo ! )
About 4 million homeowners were either in foreclosure or at least three months behind on their mortgage payments as of September , according to the mortgage bankers group .
Even if a quarter of those borrowers are able to stay in their homes , “ there ’s a lot of potential inventory coming into the market next year , ” said Jay Brinkmann , chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association . ”
Homeowners that can’t even pay their mortgage or find work are not going to be spending money .
Condos , hotels , and reality based businesses are already seeing this play out but do n’t look to Wall Street for what is really happening in our economy .
That $ 3 trillion in CRE values is long gone like smoke in the wind .

I returned to New Hampshire this week to find that the leaves have started to turn .
After such a wet spring , there is every prospect the colours of fall will be spectacular .
But another event very close to home started me thinking about next year 's general election in Britain .
On 22 September Dartmouth College , where I work , inaugurated its 17th president , the Harvard - trained physician and anthropologist Jim Yong Kim .
Everyone is excited about having an ambitious and articulate young president - damn , he is younger than me - with a family .
It will be the first time for years that little kids have lived in the president 's house ; the college is making it childproof at some expense .
Heard that before ?
He is the first Asian American to lead an Ivy League university .
I 'm a big fan .
Digging a deeper hole
I am particularly struck by what Kim has not said .
He has decided to wait before making new policy .
He is trying to work out how bad the finances are - we depend a good deal on our endowment and it has shrunk in this downturn .
It 's the same story across the Ivy League .
So it is time to work out what we can afford - to wait , look , listen and learn .
Good plan .
This made me think about the changing of the guard that looks likely in the UK .
And the contrast .
The next general election , like the US presidential election last year , seems to be the opposition 's to lose .
A ham sandwich could win this one .
Maybe or maybe not ?
Plan A for the Tories was to say they were against Labour , to talk in platitudes and to promise to make everyone happy .
Unfortunately , they can't confine themselves to this simple message , and they have had to start putting some meat on the economic policy bone .
And there 's the rub .
Their plans are not credible .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne ( who has little or no experience in economics ) , and his leader apparently opposed the Bank of England 's policy of quantitative easing , which puts them in a deep hole straight away .
The Tories opposed the 2.5 per cent cut in VAT - though they did n't , if I recall , offer an alternative .
Plan A was working then .
Their policy for avoiding the greater recession was what ?
They were against deregulation and low taxes on the rich .
Not .
Now their big proposal is to cut public spending , namely public - sector pay and jobs - though it is n't clear where the cuts will come from , if defence and the NHS are ruled out .
MPs ' food allowances , maybe , and ministers ' salaries ?
That should save us a million or two .
The Tories would also close the Financial Services Authority and return responsibility for financial stability to the Bank of England .
And they plan to keep interest rates low .
There are many problems with their ideas .
First , it is not wise in a recession to remove the automatic stabilisers that dampen fluctuations in the economy without any explicit policy action by government .
The evidence from the Bank of England 's Trends in Lending survey published at the end of September suggests this would certainly make things worse .
Net lending to businesses is down , especially to small ones .
Apparently , lenders have yet to detect any significant increase in demand for new lending .
What is the Tory plan to get banks lending again ?
Second , unemployment is rising , especially among the young .
Young unemployed people tend to commit crime , so it is likely that property and street crime , in particular , will go up .
Where exactly are the new jobs going to come from under your great new strategy , Mr Osborne ?
Not in financial services , construction or the public sector , for sure .
I have an idea - how about security guards ?
Unemployment will explode under your " lack of a plan for jobs " , Mr Osborne !
Third , the trade unions are unlikely to sit idly by , and they will have the sympathy of voters whose kids and grandkids can't find jobs .
Unionisation rates are a lot higher in the public sector than in the private sector .
At the end of 2008 , according to the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , 57 per cent of employees in the public sector were union members , compared to 16 per cent in the private sector .
Strikes in the public sector are a certainty , if you cut hard .
How will you conduct government when large parts of the civil service are on strike ?
Mortgage mess
Fourth , in a recent speech , young Osborne said he wanted " monetary activism to keep interest rates low and stimulate the economy " .
I do n't know if he has noticed , but interest rates are already at 0.5 per cent and are likely to remain low for a long time to come .
What 's more , the governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , does n't want responsibility for financial stability ; he was never interested in it in the first place .
Fifth , what will Tories do about the growing number of households in negative equity , even across their heartland of southern England ?
If house prices fall by 30 per cent , from peak to trough , as many as three million households will be in negative equity .
In addition , there could be four million or more unemployed , as well as the self - employed whose profits will be down , and the employees whose hours have been reduced and those who have been forced to take part - time jobs because they can't find full - time positions : many of these people will not be able to pay their mortgages .
All of this would impact the banks , which would then be in an even worse mess than they are now .
And more supply - side reforms wo n't do it , sorry .
So it seems to me that the so - called Tory economic strategy is up that old creek without a paddle .
The party does n't have a plausible plan for recovery .
Dream on , George .

Ah , mandatory installations .
They 're a necessary evil most PS3 users have gotten used to , and all too common in many unoptimized multiplatform titles .
While a relatively minor gripe , it 's always nice to see a game whose developers have gone the extra mile to make everything work smoothly , and that seems to be the case for Final Fantasy XIII 's PS3 incarnation .
At least , if a supposedly leaked scan of the game 's case art is confirmed .
The game will have no mandatory ( or optional ) hard drive installation , and even its save data will take up a piddling 500 kb ( with 1.9 mb extra for Trophy data ) .
Better still , the game will support loss - less 5.1 - channel audio , and its gorgeous FMV cutscenes will be rendered at up to 1080 p .
Mmmm , juicy HD .
Nothing 's been said so far about the Xbox 360 version , seeing as Final Fantasy XIII is still a PS3 - exclusive in Japan .
Perhaps more information will be available as Square Enix 's international marketing engines rev up .
A question comes to mind though , for you dual / console 360 / PS3 owners : were FFXIII PS3 to offer these features , and the 360 version not ( perhaps due to some Blu- ray snafu ) , would it influence your choice ?

What 's the first thing that goes through your mind when someone says the word " data " ?
For many of us , the first image is line graphs , pie charts and spreadsheets with columns and rows full of numbers that leave you bleary - eyed and a bit dazed .
But what if someone were to say data can also mean what you post on Facebook and Twitter , the ratings you gave a restaurant , the photos you uploaded to Flickr or even , perhaps , what you feel .
A bit of a reach ?
Not anymore .
An emerging set of tools is making it easier than ever to track and compile all sorts of " data " and display it in a way that 's relatively easy to understand .
You can now point your mobile phone at a street and instantly get ratings for restaurants .
Or type in your address and find reports of crimes that may have occurred in your neighborhood .
It 's even possible to track emotions on a national and global scale .
" Specialists from scientists to accountants have been dealing with data for decades , " said Martin Wattenberg , a researcher at IBM's Center for Social Software .
" What 's new is that there 's a whole lot more data of relevance to consumers .
" At the same time , people are generating a whole lot of data themselves . "
There are several reasons why we 're seeing more data visualization in popular culture and why it 's becoming simpler and more innovative , experts say .
Computers and software have gotten cheaper during the past few decades , and the technology needed to build applications is now in the hands of more people .
Meanwhile , more data are becoming digital , making it easier to parse and catalog .
" You have stuff available on government sites that would have only been available on paper a decade ago , " Wattenberg said .
Finally , through the advent of social media applications like Facebook and Twitter , coupled with the rise of increasingly sophisticated mobile phones , a cultural shift is seemingly under way .
" People are sort of happily defining their own social networks for other people to see , and that has led people to become interested in exploring data in ways they were n't interested before , " Wattenberg said .
Bruce Mau , a designer and author of several books on the subject , called the confluence of the technical and cultural changes nothing short of a " social revolution . "
" We 're putting tools into the hands of millions of people , " he said .
" More importantly , we 're connecting those people . "
From Darwin to health care legislation
Ben Fry 's resume is a bit intimidating .
He received his doctoral degree from the MIT Media Laboratory and has worked on developing visualization tools for genetic data .
His Web site contains phrases like " bifurcation tool " and " microarray data . "
But the work he and his peers are doing holds the possibility of clarifying difficult data .
Take , for example , his project regarding Charles Darwin and the six editions of his famous book , " On the Origin of Species . "
Through a visualization of carefully transcribed text from the different editions , he traced how Darwin 's theory and ideas developed during his lifetime .
The visualization challenges the notion that " scientific ideas ... are fixed notions , " Fry wrote .
For example , Fry writes , " The phrase ' survival of the fittest ' -- usually considered central to the theory and often attributed to Darwin -- instead came from British philosopher Herbert Spencer , and did n't appear until the fifth edition of the text . "
The visualization project would n't have been possible if the text were n't digital .
That progression -- of historic text becoming digital via projects like Google 's scanning of books and people creating digital text every day -- is creating new possibilities .
" As we get away from the number stuff , it brings us closer to something that 's a little more human , " Fry said .
Consider the current debate about health care reform legislation , said Fernanda Viegas , also a researcher at IBM's Center for Social Software .
She and Martin Wattenberg created Many Eyes , a social media Web site that focuses on data visualization .
The U.S. House has a bill .
The Senate has several bills floating around .
Many lawmakers have plenty of ideas on what kind of policies will work and what wo n't , and there are a range of numbers and statistics associated with each .
The challenge for media and designers is to " visualize those hundreds of pages of legislation , the kinds of changes people want to make , the different amendments and the different drafts , " so that people can more easily understand the debate , Viegas said .
Referring to the launch of Web sites like data.gov and recovery.gov that are making heaps of data about the federal government available to anyone who wants to use it , Mau said data visualization could also help make government more transparent .
Read about the U.S. government 's online " app store "
Such projects are taking root .
The Dutch company Layar recently launched a smartphone application that tracks money from the nearly $ 800 billion Recovery Act that President Obama signed this year .
It combines views of the real world with contract data provided by recovery.gov .
You , your neighborhood , your city
Meanwhile , Adrian Holovaty , a pioneer in combining data with maps , is much more occupied these days with neighborhoods , city blocks and ZIP codes .
His latest project , EveryBlock.com , provides a torrent of information culled from public databases , media sites and social media like Flickr for more than a dozen cities .
It was recently acquired by MSNBC.com .
" The idea came about when I was living in Chicago and being in a very dense , thriving neighborhood and coming to the realization that there was no way of finding out everything that was happening , " he said .
" That 's what we set out to do : create an activity stream for your neighborhood . "
Users go to the site , click on a city and filter the available information by typing in an address , ZIP code or neighborhood .

Depending on the data currently available for the area , users get everything from restaurant ratings and business reviews to crime data , real estate listings and Flickr photos of nearby residents .
Such local data is becoming increasingly available on mobile phones as well .
Yelp 's Monocle feature for the iPhone 3GS shows business ratings by simply having the user hold up their phone to the street .
Citysense , developed by Sense Networks , goes one step further .
Currently available only in San Francisco , California , the mobile phone application captures signals transmitted by cell phones and and builds a " heat map " showing densities of people .
The company has partnerships with several carriers , and the information is aggregated via GPS signals and cell phone tower transmissions .
Tony Jebara , Sense Networks ' chief scientist , said the company wants to make the application more sophisticated by segmenting the heat map along social lines .
For example , in the future , college students will be able to search a city for fellow students .

Nathan
Yau , a graduate student at the University of California - Los Angeles , has an even more specific focus : the individual .
He founded a Web site , Your Flowing Data , that helps people chart their lives using Twitter .
Using a Twitter account , you send a message to Flowing Data , and over time , you can visualize your choices , habits and behaviors .
Essentially ,
Yau said , the project uses data as a personal narrative .
" You 're using visualization to show important parts of your life , " he said .
Wattenberg says the new data visualization tools can help draw connections from the private narratives to the way the world behaves .
" Personal data can be aggregated to form a global self - portrait , " he said .
For instance , Facebook unveiled a " gross national happiness " index for the United States using users ' status updates .
Using two years worth of data , Facebook rated " positive " and " negative " words among American users ' updates to come up with the measure .
The index said some of the happiest days for Americans during that period were holidays like Thanksgiving and July Fourth .
Two of the unhappiest were the days Heath Ledger and Michael Jackson died .
" There 's a nice of scaling that happens when you can zoom up from the personal level up to the level of looking at the globe as a single thing , " Wattenberg said .
" It 's very powerful . "

Copolymers can be used in microparticle or " particle - in - particle " drug delivery .
Polymers that do not dissolve in acidic solutions can be used to coat a drug to prevent it being released in the stomach ; or slowly dissolving polymers can slowly release a drug , reducing the number of times a day a person has to take medication .

Another image by Spike Walker shows plankton .
In this image he uses Rheinberg illumination , whereby coloured discs are used to provide vibrant colours , making fast - moving plankton visible against a brilliant blue background .
Plankton are small organisms , plant or animal , that drift in the sea with little or no locomotive ability .
They are split into two main categories : phytoplankton , which are plant plankton that drift close to the surface and rely on photosynthesis for energy ; and zooplankton , which are animals and include small protozoans or metazoans that normally feed on other plankton .

The object of study in this image comes from a burn that the artist , Anne Weston , received from boiling soup spilt on her hand .
The burn - damaged skin cells are shown under a scanning electron microscope .
This kind of curiosity is important in image - making as " you never know what you are going to find " , says Weston .

This scanning electron micrograph was also produced by Anne Weston .
It shows a single cell grown from a culture of lung cancer cells .
The irregular purple bulges are called blebs , a localised decoupling of the cytoskeleton from the plasma membrane caused by the cancer .
Blebbing is important in a variety of cellular processes including cell locomotion , cell division and physical or chemical stresses .

This image shows two red blood cells .
A normal red blood cell is shown as a background to a red blood cell affected by sickle - cell anaemia .
Sickle - cell anaemia is a blood disease that causes the cell to form this characteristic shape , which affects its ability to carry haemoglobin .
It is a genetic disorder caused when a person has two copies of a certain gene .
It is common in countries where malaria is prevalent , as carrying one copy of the sickle - cell gene provides resistance to malaria .

More than a million people died in Auschwitz
By Rob Broomby
BBC News
When millions would have done anything to get out , one remarkable British soldier smuggled himself into Auschwitz to witness the horror so he could tell others the truth .
Denis
Avey is a remarkable man by any measure .
A courageous and determined soldier in World War II , he was captured by the Germans and imprisoned in a camp connected to the Germans ' largest concentration camp , Auschwitz .
But his actions while in the camp - which he has never spoken about until now - are truly extraordinary .
When millions would have done anything to get out , Mr Avey repeatedly smuggled himself into the camp .

Now 91 and living in Derbyshire , he says he wanted to witness what was going on inside and find out the truth about the gas chambers , so he could tell others .
He knows he took " a hell of a chance " .
" When you think about it in today 's environment it is ludicrous , absolutely ludicrous , " he says .
" You would n't think anyone would think or do that , but that is how I was .
I had red hair and a temperament to match .
Nothing would stop me . "
He arranged to swap for one night at a time with a Jewish inmate he had come to trust .
He exchanged his uniform for the filthy , stripy garments the man had to wear .
For the Auschwitz inmate it meant valuable food and rest in the British camp , while for Denis it was a chance to gather facts on the inside .
Evil
He describes Auschwitz as " hell on earth " and says he would lie awake at night listening to the ramblings and screams of prisoners .
" It was pretty ghastly at night , you got this terrible stench , " he says .
He talked to Jewish prisoners but says they rarely spoke of their previous life .
Instead they were focused on the hell they were living and the work they were forced to do in factories outside the camp .
FIND OUT MORE ... Listen to Denis Avey 's story on the BBC News channel throughout Sunday and on Broadcasting House , BBC Radio 4 at 0900 GMT .
Or listen to it here later " There were nearly three million human beings worked to death in different factories , " says Mr Avey .
" They knew at that rate they 'd last about five months .
" They very seldom talk about their civil life .
They only talked about the situation , the punishments they were getting , the work they were made to do . "
He says he would ask where people he'd met previously had gone and he would be told they'd " gone up the chimney " .
" It was so impersonal .
Auschwitz was evil , everything about it was wrong . "
He also witnessed the brutality meted out to the prisoners , saying people were shot daily .
He was determined to help , especially when he met Jewish prisoner Ernst Lobethall .
' Bloody marvellous '
Mr Lobethall told him he had a sister Susana who had escaped to England as a child , on the eve of war .
Back in his own camp , Mr Avey contacted her via a coded letter to his mother .
He arranged for cigarettes , chocolate and a letter from Susana to be sent to him and smuggled them to his friend .
Cigarettes were more valuable than gold in the camp and he hoped he would be able to trade them for favours to ease his plight - and he was right .

Advertisement Mr Lobethall traded two packs of Players cigarettes in return for getting his shoes resoled .
It helped save his life when thousands perished or were murdered on the notorious death marches out of the camps in winter in 1945 .
Mr Avey briefly met Susana Lobethall in 1945 , when he came home from the war .
He was fresh from the camp and was traumatised by what he 'd witnessed and endured .
At the time both of them thought Ernst was dead .
He 'd actually survived , thanks - in part - to the smuggled cigarettes .
But she lost touch with Mr Avey and was never able to tell him the good news .
The BBC has now reunited the pair after tracing Susana , who is now Susana Timms and lives in the Midlands .
Mr Avey was told his friend moved to America after the war , where he had children and lived a long and happy life .
The old soldier says the news is " bloody marvellous " .
' Ginger '
Sadly , the emotional reunion came too late for Ernst - later Ernie - who died never even knowing the real name of the soldier who he says helped him survive Auschwitz .
But before he died Mr Lobethall recorded his survival story on video for the Shoah Foundation , which video the testimonies of Holocaust survivors and witnesses .
In it he spoke of his friendship with a British soldier in Auschwitz who he simply called " Ginger " .
It was Denis .
Ernest Lobethall moved to the US
He also recalled how the cigarettes , chocolate and a letter from his sister in England were smuggled to him in the midst of war .
" It was like being given the Rockefeller Centre , " he says in the video .
Mr
Avey traded places twice and slept overnight in Auschwitz .
He tried a third time but he was almost caught and the plan was aborted .
He suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder when he came back from the war and has only recently been able to speak about what he did and what he saw .
He admits some may find it hard to believe and acknowledges it was " foolhardy " .
" But that is how I was , " he simply says .

Wera , Zurich / Switzerland Stories like this touch the soul and this is why we should never forget these heroes and never allow this sort of thing to happen again .
But my fear is that we do forget and we do allow things like this to happen again and again .
e.g Bosnia .
God bless this man and the thousands like him who have gone unrecognised over the decades .
Steven Wrozwyk , Cardiff
This is an incredible story of courage , dignity - and humanity .
thank you for sharing it !
Denis
Avery is an example for all of us - an inspiration .
We have much to learn from him .
this story made me cry .
My love to all those involved in producing this story .
roberta oster sachs , richmond , VA USA
The bravery and humanity of this gentleman is staggering .
To take such risks to be a living witness and to take such risks for others is far beyond the call of duty for a soldier .
Mr Avery has my total respect and admiration .
Nicola , cambridge uk Marvelous , simply marvelous .
This man is a hero both for his willingness to endanger his life to bear witness to the atrocities in Auschwitz and his managing to get someone out alive ( even if he did n't know that was what he was doing at the time ) .
My Old Man ( used in the sense of " commanding officer " a term of endearment for my father ) spent 14 months in Stalag Luft Eins and would only say that he had seen the prison camps for the Jews on his way out of Poland .
He said he had felt sorry for himself as a POW until he saw the dead and dying there .
Then , he was simply happy to be alive .
George S. Hunt , Jr. , Casper , Wyoming , USA A heart - rending story .
I wish the media would focus more on such human interest stories that inspire belief in lost humanity .
Total strangers swapping places , a bit like Dickens ' Tale of Two Cities , and wearing the other 's shoes firsthand .
Such stories re-ignite hope in the power of humans rising above their existing condition and empathizing with fellow men .
We 're one at the end of the day , and no amount of genetics or melanin can change that .
A refreshing and uplifting read .
Sam Wanjere , Naiobi , Kenya
This gentleman gives British soldiers a fantastic ' name , ' we should all be proud of his stamina and ability to help Ernst .
Susana must be exceptionally grateful !
Laura , Lincolnshire
This story is ubelievable to put yourself through this to feel other peoples pain and suffering and to gather information truely unbelievable he is a brave brave man .
This story has to be told in a documentary if not already planned , the people of today need to hear this .
I myself served in the armed forces for 23 years and witnessed suffering and pain but nothing on this scale , this is a man we all need to hear a true hero .
Billy McMaster , Newtownabbey , Belfast
The type of heroism and self - sacrifice that is missing from modern life and that I wish I could find in myself .
What an amazing gent Mr Avey is .

Verizon's CEO and chairman , Ivan Seidenberg
Source : Verizon
Ivan Seidenberg , chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications , is n't a big fan of network neutrality .
But he is a strong proponent of broadband networks -- and of their owners taking an active hand in shaping the Net 's future .
In fact , to Seidenberg , carriers like Verizon play a major role in innovation in large part because the network is n't simply a " dumb pipe " .
The phrase is something of a loaded term for followers of the Net neutrality debate , and for Seidenberg , it and other terms used in the network neutrality debate are troubling .
During his keynote speech at the Supercomm telecom conference today , he told the audience that there are some who argue that network carriers like Verizon and content providers like Google occupy different parts of the network ecosystem .
The difference is usually explained as " dumb pipes and smart content " -- a description that does n't sit well with the Verizon ( NYSE : VZ ) chief .
" This is a mistake -- an analog idea in a digital universe .
It fundamentally misreads how innovation happens in a dynamic and collaborative industry , " Seidenberg said .
" It understates the role of sound network management practices and the smooth functioning of the Internet today and it ignores the very real benefit of smart networks for customers . "
Verizon and other major ISPs have long mandated the need for them to take an active role in regulating what takes place on their networks -- a claim that Net neutrality advocates say paves the way for anticompetitive abuse and thwarts innovation .
But Seidenberg said that from a security perspective alone , Verizon 's active role in network management enable it to intercept network breaches before they become a problem .
It also enables Verizon to prioritize high - priority traffic for emergency services .
" If we can't differentiate between packets we can't prioritize emergency communications for first responders , " Seidenberg said .
" The truth is we have never provided dumb pipes -- ever . "
Seidenberg 's appearance come at a critical time for the telecom industry , with the FCC on the verge of announcing proposed network neutrality rules this week .
According to Seidenberg , if Verizon is unable to earn a return on its network investments due to network neutrality meddling , then progress could be halted .
" If a burdensome regime of network neutrality is imposed on all parts of the Internet industry , it will inject an extraordinary amount of bureaucratic oversight into the economy 's main growth engine to the future , " Seidenberg said .
Rather than harmful restrictions , Seidenberg suggested that the FCC should focus on rules for encouraging growth , not limiting it .
" We can't create a smart economy by dumbing down our critical infrastructure , " Seidenberg said .
" We can't move forward by pitting network providers and applications developers against each other when the real promise of broadband is an expanding pie for everyone . "
The promise of broadband : Economic stimulus ?
Seidenberg told the Supercomm audience that , in his view , broadband networks are the key to productivity and the economic recovery .
As a result , continued investment in broadband networks is required to help facilitate the emergence out of the current recession .
Over the last nine years , Seidenberg noted that broadband industry has made tremendous strides .
He said that real bandwidth power for the average American is now one hundred times more than it was in the year 2000 .
" The reason why we have a big impact is our technology is inherently productive and it has a multiplier effect throughout the economy , " Seidenberg said .
TV goes " truly interactive , " courtesy of Verizon
One major impact that the proliferation and evolution of broadband is having on consumers is the new capabilities it affords for interactivity .
In particular , Seidenberg said that Americans today have as many as 30 digital devices in their home , and the distinctions between them are rapidly disappearing , thanks to the role of the network .
[ cob : Special_Report ]
" People want access to their digital media anytime , anywhere , and to do that , we 're using our technology to tie together a whole digital environment , " Seidenberg said .
For instance , Verizon is working to enhance its broadband routers , including expanded functionality to interact with the TVs of users of its FiOS service , giving them new features and helping them manage their digital lives .
Seidenberg said that to date , Verizon has had some widgets that enable users to get weather , news , Facebook and Twitter on their TV screens -- but more innovation is on the way .
In part , that will come through a new software development kit ( SDK ) that he said Verizon plans to ship for developing apps for broadband - delivered TV .
With the SDK , Verizon will begin opening the platform to third - party developers .
" The really exciting thing is we 're using this platform to realize the long - held promise of truly interactive TV , " Seidenberg said .
" We 'll be encouraging innovation around the biggest , best and most under - utilized screen in your home , the TV . "
You ’re sitting at your desk when the phone rings .
It ’s your boss and he wants to see you in his office .
You ’re not sure why – nothing in particular comes to mind that would put you in his crosshairs .
In fact , you ’ve actually been doing a great job lately .
Even your boss ’s boss mentioned that you were doing outstanding work in a staff meeting the other day , right in front of everyone , including your boss .
What could possibly be the problem ?
You walk into his office , sit down , and are immediately awash in the most inappropriate display of yelling you ’ve ever seen in the workplace .
It ’s hard to follow all of the criticisms he ’s throwing at you , but you make out “ incompetent , ” “ unresponsive ” and “ careless ” amidst a caravan of expletives .
The source of the criticism , you finally realize , is a small error you made in a report — something likely no one else even noticed .
How could that bring on all of this ?
Or …is that really the source of this reaction ?
Then you remember the look on your boss ’s face when his boss sung your praises in the staff meeting .
Suddenly this makes sense — he was threatened , and now he ’s found one thing to aggressively nail you on .
It ’s no surprise that power and aggression often move along the same track .
In particular , the threat of losing power is like striking a match near the aggression gun powder keg .
Studies have shown that the perceived need to protect one ’s power kicks ego defenses into high gear , loaded with enough aggression to regret for a lifetime .
This is , of course , personality specific .
Not everyone is going to react this way , but a generous number of people do .
According to a 2007 study of American workers , 37 % ( about 54 million people ) have been bullied at work , defined as “ sabotaged , yelled at , or belittled ” by their bosses .
We know that much of this comes from the kind of defensiveness shown by the boss in the scenario above , but what ’s really brewing below the surface of the boss ’s psyche to elicit this extreme a reaction ?
A new study in the journal Psychological Science took on this question from an intriguing angle : could it be that a lack of perceived self competence triggers aggression among the powerful ?
Power increases the degree to which people feel they must be competent , to fill the demands that come with a high position and to hold onto the position against would - be challengers .
If someone in power does n’t really think he or she is competent enough ( or fears they might not be and thinks someone may eventually see through them ) then any perceived threat could spark an aggressive reaction – or so this study wanted to test .
Researchers conducted four experiments to test the hypothesis .
In the first , they established a basic correlation between power and aggression by having 90 professionals from various fields complete an authority survey ( to determine their level of power ) ; the Fear of Negative Evaluation scale ( which measures how people think about others ’ evaluations of them ) ; and the Buss - Perry Aggression Questionaire ( which measures things like argumentativeness , likelihood of physical reaction , etc ) .
The result was that the higher the level of perceived incompetence , the higher the level of associated aggression .
Again , this was just a straight correlation – no data manipulation .
The next three experiments took the study farther .
In the second , researchers examined peoples ’ responses to a primed power role .
Assigned roles of varying authority , participants were asked to complete a survey to determine their level of perceived self competence .
They were then asked to determine how loud a sound blast should be used as a penalty for undergraduate students who answer questions incorrectly on an upcoming experiment ( a fabricated prop for the study ) .
The results : for those in high - power roles who had low perceived self competence , the sound blast level was significantly higher than for people with a high level of self competence .
More sound , more aggression .
In the third experiment , participants were first evaluated to determine their level of perceived self competence , and then were asked to complete a “ leadership aptitude test . ”
Some of the participants were given scores indicating that they have excellent leadership skills , and some were told that they had average leadership skills ( in other words , some got a self - worth boost and some did n’t ) .
They were then divided into two - partner groups and told that they ’d be competing for a $ 20 prize with their partners based on scores they earned from taking an intelligence test , with the twist that one partner would chose from a selection of easy to hard tests for their partner to take .
They were also advised that whether or not the partner won $ 20 would not affect the other person from winning $ 20 ( both could win ) .
The results : by a wide margin , participants who had low perceived self competence and did not receive a self - worth boost opted to punish their partners by selecting the hardest IQ tests , indicating a significantly higher level of aggression .
Taken together , the findings from these experiments ( including the fourth , not described here for sake of post length ) point to a strong conclusion : people in positions of power who do not perceive themselves as competent are far more likely to aggressively lash out against others .
The result is ironic , because we typically think of those who attain power as being especially competent – how else can they get so far ?
But what this study suggests is that power may enhance self critique of competence , and the more someone questions whether they really have what it takes to be in power , the more threatened they ’ll feel by any number of situations and people , and aggression too often follows .

Regulators seized Los Angeles - based California National Bank on Friday night in the country ’s fourth - largest bank failure this year .
The 68 - branch bank , a unit of FBOP Corp. , was immediately acquired by the U.S. Bank unit of Minneapolis - based U.S. Bancorp , with no losses to be incurred by depositors , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said .
The branches , mostly in Los Angeles and Orange counties , were set to reopen as usual Saturday or Monday as branches of U.S. Bank , which has been expanding rapidly in Southern California .
Eight smaller banks owned by FBOP , a privately held Oak Park , Ill. , company , were also taken over by regulators and acquired by U.S. Bank .
They include San Diego National Bank , with 28 offices , and San Francisco ’s Pacific National Bank , which has 17 .

The collapse of FBOP ’s banks , attributed to losses on securities issued by the giant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , was the latest in a rash of financial failures that began last year with government takeovers of 25 banks .
Before Friday , 106 U.S. banks had failed this year .
California National Bank , with $ 7.8 billion in assets and $ 6.2 billion in deposits , is the fourth - largest commercial bank based in Los Angeles County .
Only City National Corp. , East West Bancorp and Cathay General Bancorp are larger .
FBOP ’s owner , billionaire Michael Kelly , did n’t return a call seeking comment .
But in a letter to employees , obtained by KTLA - TV Channel 5 , Kelly said the holding company and its banks had owned $ 855 million in preferred shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which became worthless when the government placed the firms into conservatorship in September 2008 .

FBOP had hoped last fall that it could get money from the Treasury Department ’s $ 700 - billion financial bailout fund , Kelly said .
But in the end , he said , changes in the program “ meant that we were no longer eligible . ”
A Treasury spokesman could n’t be reached Friday for comment .
Kelly said FBOP had been working to obtain $ 750 million from private investors but was unable to present an acceptable proposal to the regulators when a deadline for raising capital expired Friday .
“ I am so proud of organizations that you helped grow , and I will always be grateful for the work that you have done , ” Kelly said in his letter to employees .
“ I apologize that this is the end result . ”
California National has had its share of lending problems .
As of June 30 , the last time it reported its financial results publicly , the bank had five times as much foreclosed property on its books and twice as many non-current loans as it had a year earlier .
But the bank ’s main problem was its loss on the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred shares .

U.S. Bancorp has been a major acquirer in the West , buying the remains of Downey Savings of Newport Beach and PFF Bank & Trust of Pomona when those struggling thrifts failed last fall .
It also has acquired branches in Arizona , and just this month , it bought 20 Nevada branches from BB&T ; Corp. , which had acquired them as part of a deal to buy Colonial BancGroup Inc .
At about $ 25 billion in assets , Montgomery , Ala. - based Colonial was the largest bank to fail so far this year .
The nine FBOP banks had combined loans and other assets totaling $ 19.4 billion as of Sept. 30 , the FDIC said .
U.S. Bank is acquiring most of those assets under a loss - sharing plan with the FDIC , which is to absorb 80 % of the first $ 3.5 billion in losses and 95 % of any additional losses .
Taking such losses into account , the FDIC estimated that Friday ’s nine bank failures would cost the federal deposit insurance fund $ 2.5 billion .

Customers with loans from California National and the other FBOP banks were advised to continue making payments .
The FDIC had allowed prospective buyers to make offers for individual FBOP banks as well as for the whole company .
U.S. Bancorp Vice Chairman Joseph Otting said U.S. Bank was able to work out an offer for all the banks because it already was committed to growing in Southern and Northern California and in Chicago , where FBOP owned Park National Bank .
Before the Downey and PFF deals , U.S. Bank had 79 branches in the Los Angeles - Orange County area , a spokeswoman said .
The FBOP acquisitions will bring its total in the area to 241 .
That would create “ opportunity for selective branch consolidations , ” the bank said in an online presentation on the FBOP deal .

There was no immediate word on layoffs , but U.S. Bank sought to allay fears at California National .
Otting said representatives of his bank met Friday evening with California National employees at all the branches , telling employees who work face to face with customers that they could keep their jobs and back - office workers that they would be allowed to apply for other jobs at U.S. Bank .
The bank plans meetings Sunday to further brief California National workers , he said .
California National Bank is unrelated to L.A. - based National Bank of California , which has five branches .

“ An Aloha call is starting .
This is for a fire at 2WT , ” paged a Morgan Stanley employee at 8:50 AM on September 11 , 2001 , four minutes after the first plane crashed into the World Trade Center .
It was the first pager message about the horrific attacks , according to CBS News .
Over half a million intercepted pager texts from that day are being unveiled by Wikileaks .
It ’s intended to be a virtual re-enactment of 9/11 , as they ’re being posted to the organization ’s website and Twitter feed between 3 AM Eastern Time today and 3 AM tomorrow , at the same times the pages were sent .

Minutes after Morgan Stanley ’s page , banks were in red-alert , initiating evacuation plans .
“ SITUATION LOCK DOWN ALL AT&T LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN EVACUATED , ” a pager text soon read .
Bank of America commanded the evacuation of its “ high rise buildings only , ” saying there ’s a “ nation - wide run on cash . ”
MBNA Corp closed down all offices except for its call centers .
Mastercard ordered that its New York and Delaware offices evacuate .
Another firm to evacuate was Fidelity , whose offices were just blocks away from Ground Zero .
“ Those in the area should meet at the Winter Garden .
Our plan is to meet there and ( have most employees ) work from home , ” a message read .
“ Literally within minutes of the first attack , we already had one of our security people … lining up space outside the New York area for some of our employees , ” said Anne Crowley , a Fidelity spokeswoman at the time .
Firms on the opposite end of the country took note , too .
“ JOHN , DO NOT GO INTO THE OFFICES IN CONCORD NOR SAN FRANCISCO .
LIN HAS ASKED US TO WORK FROM HOME .
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONTACT ME OR LEAVE A VOICEMAIL … RHONDA , ” said one message sent around 11 AM .

A reoccurring message from an unknown source read : “ No Surveys Today - Do not Go to the Banks today .
Stay safe !
We ’ll call you when we can get through .
Thanks - Scott . ”
It is unclear how the messages were obtained , but CBS News speculates that it was probably “ over - the - air interception . ”
While some have praised Wikileaks for unearthing potentially important information from a historic , tumultuous day , others say it ’s just wrong .

In the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson wrote , “ Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object , evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies . ”
Thomas Jefferson .
I would argue that we , like our patriot forebears , have also endured “ patient sufferance . ”
For at least a half - century , we have patiently endured the erosion and abridgment of our freedoms and liberties .
We have watched the federal government become an overbearing and meddlesome Nanny State that pokes its nose and sticks its fingers in virtually everything we do .
We cannot drive a car , buy a gun , or even flush a toilet without Big Brother ’s permission .
We are taxed , regulated , and snooped - on from the time we are born to the day we die .
And then after we are dead , we are taxed again .
In the same way that Jefferson and Company patiently suffered up until that shot was fired that was heard around the world , we who love freedom today are likewise patiently suffering “ a long train of abuses and usurpations . ”
In fact , I would even dare say that these States United have become a boiling caldron of justifiable frustration and even anger .
Accordingly , it is incumbent upon us to very seriously and thoughtfully examine those principles that we absolutely will never cede or surrender .
We have already surrendered much of the freedom that was bequeathed to us by our forefathers .
We are now to the point that we must define those principles that form our “ line in the sand ” and that we will not surrender under any circumstance .
Either that , or we must admit to ourselves that there is nothing –no principle , no freedom , no matter how sacred –that we will not surrender to Big Government .
Here , then , are those principles that , to me , must never be surrendered .
To surrender these liberties to Big Government would mean to commit idolatry .
It would be sacrilege .
It would reduce us to slavery .
It would destroy our humanity .
To surrender these freedoms would mean “ absolute Despotism ” and would provide moral justification to the proposition that such tyranny be “ thrown off . ”
The Right to Keep and Bear Arms .
Men without guns are not free men ; they are slaves .
Men without guns are not citizens ; they are subjects .
Men without guns have lost the right of self - defense .
They have lost the power to defend their families and protect their properties .
Men without guns are reduced to the animal kingdom , becoming prey to the Machiavellians among them who would kill them for sport or for their own personal pursuits .
As King Jesus plainly ordered , “ He that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . ” ( Luke 22:36 ) This we will do–at all costs .
The Right to Own Private Property
Like the right of self - defense , the private ownership of property is a God - given right that is rooted in the Sacred Text .
As God told Moses , “ Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour ’s landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it . ” ( Deut. 19:14 )
In fact , the history of Western Civilization is replete with the examples of free men who were determined ( even at the cost of their very lives ) to defend the right to own property .
Without private property rights , men are reduced to serfs and servants .
Like chattel , they feed themselves by another ’s leave .
This we will not do .
The Right to Train and Educate Our Children
Education has never been the responsibility of the State .
From time immemorial , education has been the right and responsibility of the family .
This , too , has its foundation in the Sacred Volume .
“ And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . ” ( Eph. 6:4 )
Therefore , the absolute right of homeshooling or private / parochial / Christian schooling must never be surrendered .
Homeschooling , especially , is fundamental to freedom .
It is not a coincidence that throughout history , most totalitarian governments forbade parents homeschooling their children .
Any government–federal , State , or local –that forbids , or even restricts , the right of parents to homeschool their children has taken upon itself the uniform of a tyrant .
The Freedom of Speech and Worship
Speech and worship are matters of the heart and conscience ( Luke 6:45 ; John 4:24 ) .
Only tyrants seek authority over matters of the heart .
But , of course , that is what tyrants do : they seek to control men ’s thoughts and beliefs .
Hence , the alternative media is essential to liberty : the Internet , short wave radio , as well as independent magazines and periodicals .
It is almost superfluous to say that there is no such thing as a free and independent press among the mainstream news media today .
In fact , the major media more resembles a propaganda machine than it does a free press .
The same can be said for most of the mainstream churches in America today .
They more resemble havens for politically correct , Big-Government ideology than they do bastions of Bible truth .
Therefore , home - churches and non-establishment churches are increasingly requisite to a free people .
The Right to Determine One ’s Own Healthcare
The marriage of Big Government and Big Medicine has created a healthcare monster .
Already , the dispensing of medical treatment is micromanaged by Big Brother in a way that has resulted in skyrocketing costs and inferior care ( and in some cases , even death ) .
President Obama ’s universal health care initiatives that are sure to come ( in one form or another ) will only exacerbate an already untenable situation .
Free men and women absolutely have the right to refuse vaccinations for themselves and their children .
Forced vaccinations ( of any kind ) are an assault against the very foundation of freedom .
Free men have the right to choose their own physicians , their own hospitals , their own insurance programs , etc .
They also have the right to refuse any and all of the above .
God is Creator .
He is also Healer ( Exodus 15:26 ) .
Therefore , how men choose to seek God ’s healing is a private matter between them and God.
Alternative medicine is a right .
Already , our military personnel are used as human guinea pigs to test a variety of drugs and chemicals .
Public schools also require forced vaccinations .
And now the push is on to force the general population to take the Swine Flu vaccine .
At the current pace , it wo n’t be long until all alternative medicines and treatments will be illegal and the federal government will be America ’s doctor .
This is not acceptable .
The Right to Life
2000 years of Western Civilization have perpetually reconfirmed that life is a gift of God. Both Biblical and American history repeatedly honor God as the Source and Sustainer of man ’s existence .
Therefore , evils such as abortion , infanticide , and euthanasia must be vehemently resisted .
It is bad enough that any government ( especially one such as ours ) would legalize abortion , but the concept of FORCED abortion , infanticide , or euthanasia could only be regarded as a despotic attack on life and liberty of the gravest proportion .
In fact , under Natural Law , such an attack would remove said government from the protection of Heaven and would place it in a state of war .
The Right to Live as a Free and Independent People
God separated the Nations ( Genesis 11 ) .
Therefore , it is absolutely necessary that we Americans maintain our independence and national sovereignty .
We simply cannot ( and will not ) allow ourselves to become part of any hemispheric or global union .
There they are : seven freedom - principles that are not negotiable .
As Jefferson said , we are “ disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable . ”
But cross these lines and free men must do what free men must do : “ throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security . ”

Apple uses the best technology for their [ computers ] .
Apple says to their customers : if you buy a computer from us you can be sure we have selected the best technology inside for you .
That is their promise to consumers .
Their promise to consumers is n't we 've selected the best technology for you with the exception of what Intel allows us to use .
That 's not their promise .
And that 's why Apple uses the best technology where they want whenever they want .
And that 's why I 'm all Apple !

Science and Innovation Minister Lord Drayson test drives the T.27
An electric car created by the McLaren F1 ' supercar ' road car designer Gordon Murray has been unveiled .
Three prototypes of the T.27 model will be developed over the next 16 months .
The manufacturing process , called iStream , has received £ 9 m of investment , half of which came from the government 's Technology Strategy Board .
iStream plants can be just one fifth of the size of a conventional car factory , as the cars are not made from stamped steel .
All the parts are designed by computer and welded together rather than being stamped out of metal sheets , explained David Bott , director of innovation platforms at the Technology Strategy Board .
" It 's a very radical approach to manufacturing , " he told the BBC .
" Usually you talk about high value , or low carbon , or resource efficient manufacturing - this ticks all those boxes . "
Lightweight The T.27 car is designed for city or town use .
Its predecessor , the T.25 , weighs 600 kg - half the weight of an average small family car .
" Cars do n't tend to be heavy because of safety ; they tend to be heavy because of luxury , " added Mr Bott .
" The tubular frame of the T.27 is designed to absorb energy .
It will pass all the relevant safety tests . "
Gordon Murray , F1 designer and inventor of iStream , has been refining the technology since 1999 , and has recruited former colleagues from his days at F1 .
" The thinking is similar to McLaren 's , " he said .
" It 's all about efficiency and being lightweight , but in urban vehicles . "
The most expensive part of any electric car is the battery , he added .
So in order to be energy efficient , they need to be lightweight .
The T.27 can reach 60 miles per hour and is designed to travel up to 100 miles in between recharges .
" It 's for commuting , picking the kids up , that sort of thing , " said Mr Murray , who drives a Smartcar .
" We 're not saying get rid of your station wagon but it's where car use must go - rather than having a couple of big cars in the family . "

Opponents of a plan to legalize marijuana for personal possession in California have conceded that supporters of the measure are likely to get their proposal on a statewide ballot , the New York Times revealed in a longer story about possible legalization Wednesday .
California lawmakers are taking up a bill that would legalize , tax and regulate marijuana , a first in the United States .
Officials estimate the bill could bring in an additional $ 1.4 billion a year , a huge sum of money in a state bedeviled by financial woes .

While the “ legislature is uncertain , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , has indicated he would be open to a “ robust debate ” on the issue , ” the Times wrote .
Perhaps equally important , the paper adds :
California voters are also taking up legalization .
Three separate initiatives are being circulated for signatures to appear on the ballot next year , all of which would permit adults to possess marijuana for personal use and allow local governments to tax it .
Even opponents of legalization suggest that an initiative is likely to qualify for a statewide vote .
“ All of us in the movement have had the feeling that we ’ve been running into the wind for years , ” said James P. Gray , a retired judge in Orange County who has been outspoken in support of legalization .
“ Now we sense we are running with the wind . ”
Proponents of the leading ballot initiative have collected nearly 300,000 signatures since late September , supporters say , easily on pace to qualify for the November 2010 general election .
Richard Lee , a longtime marijuana activist who is behind the measure , says he has raised nearly $ 1 million to hire professionals to assist volunteers in gathering the signatures .
“ Voters are ripping the petitions out of our hands , ” Mr. Lee said .
Despite widespread support , however , the bill would almost certainly run into thorns with federal law , which classifies marijuana as an illegal substance .
Some supporters are encouraged , though , by the Obama Administration ’s announcement that they will not prosecute those involved in the medical marijuana trade .
Lee , the organizer , says he intends to spend $ 20 million on a campaign to win passage of the measure .

Numerous states have already decriminalized personal possession of small amounts of marijuana , though none have legalized it .

Dems Rejected 11 Amendments Requiring Congress to Enroll in Gov't - Run Health PlanTuesday , November 10 , 2009By Penny Starr , Senior Staff WriterRep .
Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y. ) , chairwoman of the House Committee on Rules , which threw out more than 200 amendments proposed for HR 3962 , including 11 that required Congress and other government officials to sign on to the same government - run health plan they want for the American people .
( AP Photo ) ( CNSNews.com ) -
More than 200 amendments were rejected by the House Rules Committee ahead of Saturday 's vote on the Democrats ' health care bill , including 11 that would have required members of Congress and other government officials to be enrolled in the same federal insurance plan proposed for the American people .
Critics of the health care bill said they offered the 11 amendments - including some that would require the president , vice president , and Supreme Court justices to give up their Federal Employees Health Benefit Program ( FEHBP ) to enroll in the ' public option ' or Medicaid - to showcase the problems with the massive legislation .
"
If Congress forces our constituents into a public option plan over time , then members of Congress should be expected to do the same , " Rep. Howard McKeon ( R - Calif . ) told CNSNews.com .
The House Rules Committee attempt was the second time McKeon had tried to amend the Democrats ' health plan to include legislators in the public option .
" Democrats voted down a similar amendment , 21 - 18 , in the Ways and Means Committee during the July markup of HR 3200 , " McKeon said .
" It became apparent then that Democrats are afraid of being put on a government - run health care program , but that fear does not extend to the welfare of their own constituents .
" The public option in the House bill would be a government health insurance agency run by the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and available through the federal Health Insurance Exchange .
" This is one of those classic hypocritical moments for the Democrats , " Matt Lavoie , spokesman for Rep. Wally Herger ( R - Calif . ) , told CNSNews.com .
" They simply do n't want to put up with the public option that they are preparing to inflict on the American public .
" But Vincent Morris , communications director for the Democrat - controlled House Rules Committee , told CNSNews.com that the amendments were rejected because no one , including Congress , will be forced to sign on to government - run health care .
"
The reason we did n't support those amendments is because the public option was created precisely to give the American people a choice between private and public [ insurance ] , Morris said .
" Given that all Americans have a choice about whether to join the public option , we thought it did n't make any sense to force members of Congress to join . " Rep. Michael Burgess ( R - Texas ) said he proposed his amendment because the bill does not fix the problems with the already government - run Medicaid program .
His amendment " would make members of Congress a mandatory covered population under Title XIX of the Social Security Act ( Medicaid ) without consideration of any other asset or qualification test . " " This bill fails to address the problems with Medicaid and instead adds millions more Americans to the program , " Burgess told CNSNews.com .
" Forcing members of Congress to walk a mile in the shoes of Medicaid patients I believe is the only way Congress will get serious about making the fundamental fixes to Medicaid that the program needs .
" Morris said Burgess ' amendment was rejected because it could hurt poor people .
" Medicaid is a federal - state program that provides low - income populations with health care , " Morris told CNSNews.com .
" Democratic members strongly oppose any effort of diverting resources for the poor to themselves instead .
"
If Medicaid resources are diverted to members of Congress , it could impact low - income Americans , and that 's why Democrats did not support the amendment , " Morris said .
But J. Gresham Barrett ( R - S.C. ) told CNSNews.com that by agreeing to be a part of the same system they are offering the American people , Democrats could send a message that they are confident that their bill will benefit Americans .
"
If members of Congress and the White House administration truly believe that a government health care option will provide the same timely and quality care that private sector health insurance does , then they and their staffs should be required to enroll in this option , " Barrett said .
"
If it is good enough for American families , then it is more than good enough for Washington bureaucrats , " he said .
" Therefore , I decided to offer an amendment which would mandate all members of Congress , their staff , and administration officials to participate in the public option .
"
He said HR 3962 has the same problems as the previously proposed bill , HR 3200 .
" When H.R. 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America Act , was introduced , I was disappointed to find that many of the problems in the original bill had not been addressed or changed in any way , " Barrett said .
" While I adamantly oppose any kind of government - run health care option , I decided to offer several amendments which would address some of the most troubling provisions in this legislation , including an amendment that mandates all members of Congress , their staff , and administration officials to participate in the public option , " Barrett added .
Barrett added that the process that led up to the passage of HR 3962 was anything but bi-partisan .
" I believe my amendments were rejected because the House Rules Committee is currently under Democrat control , " he said .
" This closed - door process is not an appropriate way to make decisions , especially considering the sweeping consequences of this massive bill . "

The LHC is a 27 - kilometre - long underground ring of superconducting magnets housed in this pipe - like structure or cryostat .
The cryostat is cooled by liquid helium to keep it at an operating temperature just above absolute zero .
It will accelerate two counter - rotating beam of protons to an energy of 7 tera electron volts ( TeV ) and then bring them to collide head on .
Several detectors are being built around the LHC to detect the various particles produced by the collision .

The Large Hadron Collider is all about understanding the forces of nature , and it ’s on this understanding that our modern technological world rest .
You can trace a direct line through the history of physics , from Newton ’s gravity , Faraday and Maxwell ’s electronmagnetism , Rutherford ’s discovery of the atomic nucleus , Eddington ’s understanding of the power source of the Sun , and on to the LHC .
Everything we take for granted today , from modern medical technology to mobile phones , is possible because we understand how the forces of nature work .
The LHC has been built because our understanding of these forces has shuddered to a halt .
The problem lies in understanding the origin of mass in the Universe , which sounds esoteric , but without this understanding we cannot progress .
Our current best theory , called the Standard Model of Particle Physics , includes a mechanism for generating the masses of all the particles in the Universe called the Higgs mechanism .
This theory predicts the existence of a particle called the Higgs Boson .
If the Higgs exists then the LHC will find it , opening a door to a new and deeper understanding of the forces of nature .
What ’s happened in Geneva over the last few days has genuinely surprised me , and I suspect many of my colleagues .
The LHC is an incredibly complicated machine , and it is very challenging to wake the machine up again after last years ’ accident and begin to circulate particles around it , never mind to collide them .
I heard an engineer last year say that circulating particles around the LHC was like threading a 27 km piece of wet cotton through the eye of a needle with one hand behind your back .
Given that they only switched the machine back on last week , the results we have seen so far have been amazing .
I really would n’t have expected progress like this until after Christmas - I worked at a particle accelerator in Hamburg in the 1990s and that machine took two or three years to really start behaving itself .
So to get particles colliding after a couple of days is breath taking .
For once it ’s not hype .
Admittedly , we are right at the start of the journey .
Energy levels in the collider at the moment are about 0.5 TeV – still a huge way off the machine ’s maximum operating level of 7 TeV.
CERN are now aiming for 1.2 TeV before Christmas , which will already make LHC the world ’s most powerful collider overtaking the Tevatron at Fermilab near Chicago .
It ’s then a case of gradually increasing the energy to levels around 3.5 TeV , which is the probably the level we ’d like for ground - breaking discoveries .
I ’d expect the machine to hit that sometime in the New Year .
As all this is happening , there will be lots of interesting data for the particle physicists and engineers , allowing them to calibrate their detectors and better understand this wonderful machine .
In engineering terms , the LHC is as difficult as going to the moon .
The technology is right on the edge , which is exactly where we need to be as a civilization .
As just one example , the superconducting magnet technology being pioneered and understood in the LHC today is what you need to build nuclear fusion power stations , which may well be the key to solving our long - term energy crisis .
I would guess that it will be three years at least before the big headline discoveries , like Higgs Bosons or the nature of Dark Matter start emerging .
This is the start of a long and exciting road that will last decades .
But as JFK said when he launched America on a path to the Moon , we do these things “ not because they are easy but because they are hard " .

Bird lovers and exhibitors watched on in horror as 38 prize budgies keeled over and died during a show .
Owners and organisers rushed about getting their cages outside into the fresh air as the budgerigars began plummeting inexplicably from their perches .
Fanciers feared a gas leak caused the tragedy .

But after investigations by plumbers , gas workers , fire authorities and environmental health officers , there was no explanation for what happened at the village hall event in Gwynedd , North Wales .
Retired pet shop owner Dave Cottrell , 55 , who lost 10 birds at the show , said : " I was preparing the certificates as the birds were being put in order when a steward came over and said he had a dead one .
" Then another steward came over said he had two or three dead .
" And within seconds a third steward said he had more dead . "
Mr Cottrell , who has 200 birds and been a fancier for 35 years , thinks a boiler or oven flue could have been temporarily blocked , forcing out fumes .
Robert Hughes , 34 , - who organised the annual Gwynedd Budgerigar Society Open Show - said : " The birds were spread across the hall .
" Five minutes after the first one died eleven more had gone , one was mine .
" We made the decision to get everything out of the hall because we had 350 cages so we saved a lot of birds . "
Small birds are especially vulnerable because of their tiny , sensitive respiratory systems .
Canaries were traditionally used by miners to test whether there were dangerous levels of carbon monoxide below ground .
Mr Hughes said : " Nobody in the community has seen nor heard anything like this before .
The hall has been given the all clear .
" It 's bizarre .
It has been really difficult to get over it .
" It takes a year to organise the show and it's a lot of work - but that 's nothing compared to how you feel for some of the people who lost birds . "
A vet carried out checks on two casualties revealing they died from congestion and haemorrhaging of the lungs .
Palestinian leaders warned Israel on Sunday not to stoke tension in Jerusalem in the hope of thwarting peace talks , after clashes at a sacred site in which Palestinians and Israeli police were injured .
" At a time when ( US ) President ( Barack ) Obama is trying to bridge the divide between Palestinians and Israelis , and to get negotiations back on track , Israel is deliberately escalating tensions in Jerusalem , " chief peace negotiator Saeb Erekat said .
" We 've seen this before , and we know what the consequences are , " the Palestinian minister added , in a statement that recalled the visit of then Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the site in Jerusalem 's Old City in 2000 .
Sharon 's presence at al - Aqsa mosque , the third holiest site in Islam , triggered the second Palestinian uprising and dealt the biggest setback to peace efforts in years .
The reasons behind Sunday 's clash were disputed .
According to legislator Hathem Abdel Kader and other Palestinian sources , the clash erupted in the early morning when Palestinians inside the complex -- sacred to both Islam and Judaism -- saw a group of 15 religious Jews trying to enter .
The Jews never managed to get into the complex , because several hundred Palestinians , who were on alert for such a possibility , began a loud protest .
Israeli police responded with tear gas then stun grenades .
The clash occurred hours before the start of Yom Kippur , the solemn " Day of Atonement " which is the holiest day in the Jewish calendar .
Police were on alert for violent protests in several flashpoints where Jews and Arabs live side by side .
Palestinians :
No tourists were involved
Protesters threw stones , chairs and whatever they could lay hands on as riot police rushed to the scene .
Video showed them trying to drive police away from the doorway of the al - Aqsa mosque , but there was no sign that police entered it .
Police said 17 officers were hurt and 11 rioters arrested , and medics said 13 Palestinians were treated for injuries .
There were no reports of serious injury or death .
Israeli police said it began when religious Palestinians angered by immodestly dressed tourists grew violent .
Palestinians dismissed that account , saying no tourists were involved .
There was no further comment from Israeli authorities , who were observing the Yom Kippur silence .
" Providing a police escort for settlers who are against peace at all costs , and whose presence is deliberately designed to provoke a reaction , are not the actions of someone who is committed to peace , but of someone who will go to extraordinary lengths to scuttle all hopes of peace , " Erekat said .
He said it was " deliberately timed to coincide with the eve of the anniversary of that visit " by a government " emboldened by its ability to fend off calls for a settlement freeze " .
The complex is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram al - Sharif ( Noble Sanctuary ) .
Located above the Jewish prayer site at the Western Wall , it includes al - Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock mosque .
In Muslim tradition , the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven from the rock at the centre of what is now the Dome of the Rock shrine .
The gilded dome sits over the spot where Jews believe Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac to God before an angel stayed his hand .
Jewish visitors need permission from Israeli police to visit this part of the site .
During mass Muslim prayers , Israel also restricts access by Palestinian Muslim men under 50 .
Israel captured the site in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it with the rest of East Jerusalem , in a move not recognized internationally .
Sharon 's visit enraged Palestinians and the resulting uprising rapidly escalated , with numerous suicide bomb attacks on Israeli civilians .

A detailed picture of the seeds of structures in the universe has been unveiled by an international team co-led by a Cardiff University scientist .
The team has obtained extremely precise data about the early universe , using a telescope near the South Pole in the Antarctic .
Their measurements of the cosmic microwave background - a faintly glowing relic of the hot , dense , young universe - provide further support for the standard cosmological model of the universe .
The findings confirm the model 's prediction that dark matter and dark energy make up 95 % of everything in existence , while ordinary matter makes up just 5 % .
In a paper published in the November 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal , researchers on the QUaD telescope project have released detailed maps of the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .
The researchers focused their measurements on variations in the CMB 's temperature and polarization to learn about the distribution of matter in the early universe .
Polarization is the direction in which vibrations travel from all light rays , which is at right angles to the ray 's direction of travel .
The light from the early universe was initially unpolarized but became polarized when it struck moving matter in the very early universe .
By creating maps of this polarization , the QUaD team was able to investigate not just where the matter existed , but also how it was moving .
The results very closely match the temperature and polarization predicted by the existence of dark matter and dark energy in the standard cosmological model .
The team was jointly led by Professor Walter Gear , Head of the School of Physics and astronomy at Cardiff University and Professor Sarah Church of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology ( KIPAC ) , jointly located at the Department of Energy 's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University .
Professor Gear said : " Studying the CMB radiation has given us extremely precise pictures of the Universe at just 400,000 years old .
When we first started working on this project the polarization of the CMB had n't even been detected and we thought we might be able to find something wrong with the theory .
The fact that these superb data fit the theory so beautifully is in many ways even more amazing .
This reinforces the view that researchers are on the right track and need to learn more about the strange nature of dark energy and dark matter if we are to fully understand the workings of the universe . "
Michael Brown , of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge , lead author of the new study added : " With these new QUaD measurements , we have tested further our standard model of the Universe .
Reassuringly , the model has passed this test remarkably well . "
Professor Sarah Church , Deputy Director of KIPAC , said : " When I first started in this field , some people were adamant that they understood the contents of the universe quite well .
But that understanding was shattered when evidence for dark energy was discovered .
Now that we again feel we have a very good understanding of what makes up the universe , it 's extremely important for us to amass strong evidence using many different measurement techniques that this model is correct , so that this does n't happen again . "

The debate took place in the plenary session , with a change in speakers from the original announcement .
BP chief geologist David Jenkins argued for the motion that peak oil is " no longer a concern , " and Jeremy Leggett argued against , incorporating the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security conclusions into his case .
At the end of the debate , approximately five hundred oil - industry geologists voted .
Only about a third voted in favor of the motion " Peak oil is no longer a concern . "
The debate has been written up in November 's issue of Petroleum Review .
The aim of the Geological Society 's Peak Oil evening meeting is to further discuss and debate the timing and impact of Peak Oil & Gas .
Have we become so efficient at exploring and producing petroleum resources that we are we already there as Colin Campbell ( ASPO ) would argue ?
Or will technology solutions and a move to more unconventional deposits save the day as Mike Daly ( BP ) and Glen Cayley ( Shell ) would suggest ?
And let 's not forget gas .
Malcolm Brown ( BG Group ) sees a longer future for gas but will the progressive use of gas as a substitute for oil hasten its decline ?
Lots of questions , but do we really have the answers ?
Come along to the Geological Society . . . and join in the debate .
Our four invited speakers will present their case , to be followed by a panel discussion .
Q : Were you expecting to win this debate ?
No way !
I thought I ’d be lucky to get 10 % of the vote .
I expected it to the one of those masochistic experiences I put my hand up for , from time to time , in the possibly misguided feeling that it is better to preach to the unconverted than the converted .
And I do n’t kid myself that ten minutes of woffly rhetoric from me changed any minds , or that David ’s arguments were so poor that he converted people for me .
This was a pre-formed group opinion .
Q : What do you think the result means ?
The result seems to suggest that the rank - and - file practitioners hold a very different view of peak oil from the BP / Shell / Exxon etc. top tables .
In this , the forthcoming energy crunch seems very different from the run up to the credit crunch .
Presented with the motion that " major downside risk in derivatives is no longer a concern , ” a hall full of investment bankers would no doubt have been near unanimous in support of the motion .
I increasingly think there are worthwhile comparisons between the financial crunch and the coming oil crunch .
Before the financial crunch , only a few maverick economists and financial journalists were blowing whistles .
Ahead of the oil crunch , many people in and around the oil industry are busy sounding off .
So are some companies spanning a wide spectrum of petroleum - user industries , and so is the IEA – the equivalent of the World Bank warning of a financial crash several years ahead of the reality .
Q : If it is true that the footsoldiers do n't buy into the top tables ' analysis , why do n't they speak out more ?
If I knew the answer , I ’d be a better campaigner than I am .
Pensions ?
School fees ?
Some misplaced sense of brotherhood ?
An oil company geologist told me once that it is viewed almost as an unspoken act of treason to voice doubts about the industry ’s ability to meet projected demand .
Perhaps that explains why so many geologists wait until retirement before speaking out .
Q : When was your own realisation that peak oil might be a problem with peak oil ?
This is a shocking story , and I hold my hand up with an appropriate amount of shame and embarrassment , to help make an important point .
It was March 2004 , and Shell dropped a bombshell .
We are sorry , dear financial regulators , but we do n’t seem to have as much oil as , er , we said we have .
Our CEO and head of exploration have been telling the board , well …. lies , we fear .
The biggest scandal in British corporate history duly unfolds .
Why , I ask myself ?
I had always assumed there would be enough oil for decades to come , but maybe not : not if other companies are in anything like the mess
Shell seems to be in .
I knew that a few geologists had been saying , since the mid 1990s , that the peak of production would come all too soon .
The dean of the early peak oil camp is Colin Campbell , a geologist like me trained by legendary stratigrapher Stuart McKerrow at Oxford .
I always assumed – simply assumed , I ’m ashamed to say – that Colin was wrong .
My response , I now see , was a cultural knee - jerk .
So I checked out what was going on .
I finally did some homework .
And so my peak oil moment came , belatedly .
I think there is an important lesson here .
Cultures have all sorts of dysfunctional ways of protecting themselves : the “ social silences , ” the unspoken erection of information screens and the like .
Since joining Association for the Study of Peak Oil , of course , I have met some of the psychologists at work on this kind of thing .
None of this will be surprising to them .
Q : How do you think the peak oil drama is going to play out ?
We will find out who is right about peak oil before the decade is out – earlier , rather than later .
The discontinuities will be seismic .
My preferred scenario is this one .
Within just a couple of decades , the world will be floating on a sea of cleantech energy technologies , and enjoying a renaissance built around the many social value - adders inherent in those technologies .
Oil shocks , oil wars , and all the other dismal paraphernalia of the hydrocarbon age will seem so very ….twentieth century .
I elaborate in my books “ Half Gone ” , and “ The Solar Century . ”
Of course , there are other scenarios .
Q : You 're known as a climate - change campaigner as much as a peak - oil whistleblower .
How do you think these two issues are related ?
Peak panic will prompt a race to mobilise oil - replacement technologies .
If cleantech wins out , we win , and renaissance beckons .
If coal - to - liquids and tar sands win out , we lose , and we are on a road to hell .
We start destroying wealth faster than we create it well before the mid point of the century .
Again , I elaborate in my books , and keep the drama updated on my Triple Crunch Log website , www.jeremyleggett.net.

Bill Evans wants to make it clear he ’s not against wind turbines .
“ I ’m not anti-wind .
I ’m a consultant who people call from both sides when there ’s a concern about the impact on migrating birds , ” he said .
Evans , 50 , is an Ithaca - based ornithologist who has studied bird migration in North America for more than 25 years .
He helped start the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology ’s research into avian night flight calls in the mid-1990s and in 1998 founded the non-profit group Old Bird Inc .
The group promotes education and awareness of the nocturnal migration of birds and the use of technology to prevent bird collisions with tall , man -made structures .
Evans specializes in the use of acoustic monitoring equipment that records birds ’ night - time flight calls .
He is currently involved in a New York State Energy Research and Development Authority study at the Maple Ridge wind project .
Located in Tug Hill in Lewis County , Maple Ridge is the state ’s largest wind farm , with 199 turbines .
While at Maple Ridge , he has also researched and determined the feasibility of developing automatic collision monitors , which will be placed on the turbines and record every time there ’s a bird collision .
Up to this point , researchers have seen no major bird kills at Maple Ridge , or any of the other wind farms in this state .
However , New York ’s new emphasis on green energy is expected to result in close to 3,000 new wind turbines being constructed across the state by 2013 .
Currently , there are more than 500 .
Many birders and ornithologists , while enthusiastic about the development of energy alternatives to fossil fuels , are concerned about the lack of research concerning the environmental impact of wind turbines on wildlife .
They stress the need for much forethought in the location of these structures .
Evans talked this week about the issue :
What 's the biggest concern when it comes to migrating birds and the location of wind turbines ?
In this state , the biggest concern involves the pressure to place turbines in close proximity to the shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario .
These shorelines have a good wind resource , but the closer wind turbines are to the lakeshore , the greater the bird mortality will likely be .
Many species fly around large bodies of water , and their flights tend to become concentrated in the vicinity of the lakeshore .
Ideally , we would n't site wind projects within five miles of the Great Lakes .
Just so I 'm clear , what kind of migrating birds are we talking about ?
More than 100 species , including most of our songbirds ( warblers and sparrows , cuckoos , kinglets , larks , orioles , tanagers , thrushes , wrens , finches etc. ) , many of which make long migrations to and from Central and South America .
Also , many species of waterfowl ( ducks and geese ) , other waterbirds such as herons , rails and sandpipers , and most of our raptors ( hawks , eagles , falcons and owls ) .
What exactly are you monitoring with all your equipment .
How accurate and thorough is your data ?
I monitor the calls birds give while they are flying in nocturnal migration .
Most birds migrate at night , and many species give short call notes to keep in contact with one another and to work out their flight spacing to avoid collisions .
For example , my equipment can document how many vocal flocks of Canada geese passed over a location during the night .
A location in a flyway may detect dozens of flocks .
A location not on a flyway may not have any .
By putting out multiple acoustic monitoring stations in an array I can create a map of these varying nocturnal flight dynamics , which then can be of use for assessing potential wind farm impact .
What area would you not want to put a wind turbine ?
Besides the Great Lakes shoreline issue I mentioned , I certainly would not want to see wind projects near wildlife refuges or significant wetland areas .
Also , certain box canyon geography in hilly or mountainous terrain can funnel migratory birds into dense concentrations .
Does their height affect the potential danger to migrating birds ?
Yes , the taller they are , the more impact on birds they will likely have .
Are birds the only things that potentially are threatened by wind turbines ?
No , some species of bats are taking quite a hit .
They appear to be attracted to wind turbines and some are killed in collisions with the rotor blades .
Others succumb to what is termed " barotrauma . "
Bats have very fragile lungs and when a bat flies in close proximity to a wind turbine 's rotor blades their lungs can collapse .
Others talk about the need for thorough environmental impact studies before approving the placement of a wind turbine .
How long time - wise would you recommend such a study be and why ?
This really depends on the location of the project .
Some wind project sites may not need much pre-construction environmental study ; others may need several years .
It often depends on how many ( and to what extent ) threatened or endangered species are involved .
The state Department of Environmental Conservation has some of the best guidelines in the country for evaluating environmental impact of wind projects — but there is still a lot to be learned in how we can reduce bird and bat collision fatalities .
What 's the one thing people would be surprised to learn about the night migration of birds ?
That birds have GPS .
As they become an adult , they can navigate with incredible precision night or day .
They do this using the sun , stars , earth 's magnetic field , and in some cases an inborn genetic program .
Some species are genetically programmed to migrate thousands of miles in a certain direction .
More on the issue
Ornithologist Bill Evans is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Onondaga Audubon Society 's monthly meeting in Room 319 Marshall Hall on the SUNY ESF campus in Syracuse .
Evans , executive director of Old Bird Inc. will speak on night bird migration and conservation implications and acoustic monitoring in assessing impacts of industrial wind turbines and cell towers .

Jack Boulware might be tired .
He 's in the middle of Litquake , the annual eight - day San Francisco literary festival he co-founded , which would be enough to stress out any rational person .
But he also has his own book to promote , freshly printed , still smelly , and his collaborator Silke Tudor is in town for a brief return to her old stomping grounds , so perhaps he can be forgiven for asking if we needed anything else while he was in " full media - slut spew mode . "
He and Tudor , a former S.F. Weekly associate of Boulware 's who has given up rock criticism to help the poor , living in a soup kitchen in Lower East Side in Manhattan , are sitting in a booth in the back room of Lost Weekend Video on Valencia Street , where the pair conducted a number of the 300 interviews for their book , just around the corner from Boulware 's humble quarters , which , Tudor insists , would not be suitable for an interview - even with punk rock musicians .
Boulware and Tudor have produced " Gimme Something Better : The Profound , Progressive and Occasionally Pointless History of Bay Area Punk , From Dead Kennedys to Green Day , " published this month by Penguin Books , a sweeping oral history likely to remain the definitive tome on the topic .
The San Francisco punk scene , the authors say , not only eventually produced the most popular punk rock band in history with Green Day , but also remains one of the longest - running and still thriving punk scenes on the planet .
" There are a lot of punk books out there , " says Boulware , " and we 've read most of 'em .
They tend to gloss over San Francisco . "
Originally , they thought the book would focus on the landmark untitled Berkeley punk commune / nightclub known by its address , Gilman Street .
" Gilman is hard to get your mind around unless you talk about what was going on before , " Tudor says .
" The tendrils just kept creeping further and further back and the next thing you knew , we were further and further back . "
" And talking to people about the Tubes , " Boulware says .
The book begins at the earliest incarnations of the punk movement in North Beach that developed around the Mabuhay Gardens nightclub , and follows the scene through to the 1998 death from cancer of Tim Yohannan , cigarette - huffing disc jockey and fanzine editor of " Maximum RocknRoll . "
" He 's the most prominent character in the book , " Boulware says .
Yohannon , whose rabid , amateurish newspaper spread the punk gospel to the far corners of the world in those long - ago , pre-Internet days , would personally encourage bands he liked to move to the Bay Area .
According to Boulware and Tudor , the San Francisco punks brought some cultural ribaldry to the party that bands from other places did n't .
" Because of the environment , the political content is practically a given , " Tudor says .
" That 's been true of all the eras .
Also the element of goofiness has been more exaggerated , the pointless aspect - kitschy , fantastic costumes - intelligent goofiness . "
" Very art - for - art 's - sake people " says Boulware , " who are n't interested in making a dime . "
San Francisco , of course , was also home of homocore , punk rock by gay and lesbian bands , such as Pansy Division or Tribe 8 .
Tudor also says that women played a more important role in San Francisco punk than elsewhere .
" Punk is a very male - oriented scene , " she says , " and women were always outnumbered by men , but the women were a very formidable force . "
Tudor is a native San Franciscan who started attending punk rock shows in the early ' 80s at the Farm , which she described as " the most violent nightclub in the ' 80s . "
Boulware , who grew up in Montana , remembers seeing the Sex Pistols on the " Today " show .
Both were well - known music writers for spunky alternative newspaper S.F. Weekly .
The two are also completely conversant with the polemics of punk .
" It 's not up to us to decide what 's punk or not , " Tudor says .
" It 's up to whoever is doing it .
The most important thing with the book is we want to leave the impression that punk is still going on .
Two - thirds of the way through the book with Green Day , it would be easy to stop there with what is arguably the most famous punk band ever .
" It 's still underground and people are doing all sorts of things with a complete lack of interest fame or money , " she says .
" And with complete disrespect for the ones who are famous , " Boulware says .
It took years for Tudor and Boulware to conduct the 300 interviews for this assiduous chronicle of the city 's long - suffering punk scene , not as famous or degenerately glamorous as New York , Los Angeles or London .
Much of their advance was spent on transcripts , and they say the book would never have been finished if it were n't for more than two dozen volunteer typists who responded to pleas over the Internet .
Even if the book comes to a sentimental ending , with Yohannon passing the torch of his " Maximum RocknRoll , " Tudor says punk lives .
" The ideas that punk embodies will always be important , " she says .
" People believe in it because it empowers them to do whatever the hell they want . "
Last night we were shocked to see that The White House was using its blog to tear into car website Edmunds.com over some analysis it did of Cash - For - Clunkers .
To recap : Edmunds.com says the program was a gigantic waste with little effect .
The White House disagrees .
Anyway , Edmunds is sticking by its analysis , and it put out the following press release :
SANTA MONICA , Calif . — October 29 , 2009 — Today the Department of Transportation and White House chose to respond to an analysis Edmunds.com released Wednesday that looked at auto sales this year and what sales volumes would have been had the popular Cash for Clunkers program never existed .
At issue is one point of the analysis showing the taxpayer cost for every incremental vehicle sold was $ 24,000 .
To be clear , Edmunds.com is not disputing the government 's statements regarding total voucher applications , vehicles sold or voucher values .
The key question is how many of these sales would have occurred anyway .
Apparently , the $ 24,000 figure caught many by surprise .
It should n't have .
The truth is that consumer incentive programs are always hugely expensive when calculated by incremental sales — always in the tens of thousands of dollars .
Cash for Clunkers was no exception .
The White House claims that our analysis was based on car sales on Mars and that on Earth , the marketplace is connected .
We agree the marketplace is connected .
In fact , that is exactly the basis of our analysis .
It is also claimed we missed the possibility that Cash for Clunkers generated excitement and consumers bought vehicles even if they did n't qualify for the program -- a claim that has been widely supported by anecdote but by little analysis .
It does , after all , seem a bit odd that masses of consumers would elect to buy a vehicle because of a program for which they do n't qualify -- doubly so when you add in the fact that prices shot up during Cash for Clunkers , creating a disincentive to buy .
Finally , the White House claims that the increase in fourth - quarter production reported by the car manufacturers can be attributed to Cash for Clunkers .
But here is a better reason : the economy is recovering accompanied by improved car sales .
No manufacturer increases production -- a decision with long - term consequences -- based on the 30 - day sales blip triggered by an event like Cash for Clunkers .
With all respect to the White House , Edmunds.com thinks that instead of shooting the messenger , government officials should take heart from the core message of the analysis : the fundamentals of the auto marketplace are improving faster than the current sales numbers suggest .
Is n't this a piece of good news we can all cheer ?
We 're on Edmunds side here .
We have n't seen any evidence that the program was n't just a massively expensive way of pulling demand forward , with little long - term to show for it .
An employee of a car dealership left this comment on the last post :
As an employee of a car dealership I will tell you first hand that the whole program was VERY temporary .
Yes we broke every record we had ever set before .
Sales are now lower than before due the the Cash for Clunker program .
It was a great program and it did draw a bunch of people into the market that probably would n't have bought until this winter .
The problem is : now we wo n't have the sales we would have had this winter .
Everyone in the car business will tell you that November - February are the worst months for sales .
Probably 30 % of the sales that we made during the program would n't have happened until those bad months .
We 're eager to see if The White House responds again .
If bullying goes unaddressed , advocates say it can foster a sense of loneliness , depression , and anxiety in victims as well as instill thoughts of suicide - causing students to skip school , fall behind in class , or inflict harm upon themselves .
The harassment sometimes leads victims to lash out violently at others ; some school shootings across the nation over the last decade were at the hands of students who had been allegedly bullied .
According to Jackson , school officials did little to remedy the situation - the latest in a string of incidents in which students taunted and bullied the boy over a nearly two - year period , forcing him to change schools .
Unbeknownst to both of them , a female student videotaped some of his moves on her cellphone and later posted it on YouTube .
For the next several days , students posted comments mocking him and hurled insults at him at school .
Dancing by himself , the seventh - grader moved awkwardly , but he was having the time of his life .
“ He ’s no dance star , but he really gets into the music , ’’ said his mother , Theresa Jackson , who chaperoned the dance and asked that her son ’s name not be used .
Another case that has drawn attention concerns a 12 - year - old autistic boy from Cape Cod who went to his first dance at his school last year .
“ This is an urgent matter , ’’ said the boy ’s mother , Sirdeaner Walker , who supports the legislation .
“ There are other kids like my son Carl who are being bullied every day in school .
It happens in every kind of school - urban , suburban , and private .
. . .
Schools say they are taking care of bullying problems , but they are not . ’’
The groundswell of support follows the bullying case this year of an 11 - year - old boy , Carl Joseph Walker - Hoover , a student at a Springfield charter school whose classmates ridiculed him for how he dressed , saying he acted like a girl .
He hanged himself with an electrical cord at his home in April , leaving behind a note in which he told his family that he loved them and gave his Pokemon games and cards to a 6 - year - old brother .
The advocates are focusing their attention on a bill , sponsored by Representative John Rogers , a Democrat , that would require school districts to report bullying incidents and any discipline imposed to the state .
The bill , one of those to be taken up at a hearing Tuesday , has the support of such groups as the Massachusetts Teachers Association , Microsoft Corp. , and the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association .
Similar bills have , in the past , failed repeatedly - even as the number of states with bullying - prevention statutes has grown to 37 .
But now a broad group of supporters , led by the Anti-Defamation League , are giving the effort the momentum it may need to finally push a measure through to passage .
After years of delays , the Legislature appears poised to crack down on bullying among schoolchildren , with hearings beginning this week on nearly a dozen bills that would force local schools to respond more aggressively to instances of cruelty among students .
Nearly a quarter of Massachusetts high school students reported being victims of bullying , while 14 percent admitted to bullying or pushing someone around , according to the state ’s most recent survey of health and risk behaviors , which was released last year .
In middle school , a smaller portion of students said they were bullied .
While many schools have adopted policies to address bullying , the quality and enforcement of the policies vary greatly , advocates said .
The state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education does not have any formal guidelines on bullying policies , but recommends prevention programs upon request , said JC Considine , a spokesman .
The legislation gaining momentum at the State House would require the state to develop a model policy for local schools , which would be required to address both traditional bullying and cyberbullying - cruelty by computer .
Local schools also would have to document all cases of harassment , discrimination , intimidation , and bullying , and report on the resulting discipline .
All incidents would then be reported to state education regulators , who would compile an annual report for the Legislature and periodically review each school ’s policies and level of enforcement .
The stringent reporting requirements are raising concerns among some educators , because they say there is sometimes a fine line between bullying and innocuous teasing .
“ There is so much area for administrative confusion around the issue , ’’ said Glenn Koocher , executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees .
“ We want to make sure we can curb bullying in a way that is reasonable and effective . ’’
Often the point of teasing is to be humorous , while bullying is an ongoing problem in which the intent is to hurt or have power over someone , said Elizabeth Englander , director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center at Bridgewater State College , which trains school staff on bullying - prevention tactics .
The legislation would require annual training of school employees .
“ Most kids are good at telling the difference , but it can be difficult for an observer , ’’ Englander said .
Even Englander , however , is concerned that the reporting requirement could prompt some schools not to properly classify incidents as bullying to dodge the requirement and any negative attention it could bring .
Children , she said , could suffer the ultimate consequence : not getting the help they need .
Soon after Emily Dale started her eighth - grade year at Swampscott Middle School , a boy in her class began calling her a four - eye freak .
Emily tried ignoring the name - calling , but the boy kept it up , eventually turning to outright discrimination , making fun of her for being Jewish and lobbing derogatory sexual comments at her .
When Emily finally worked up the courage to report the incidents to school administrators , the bullying grew worse .
Although the school disciplined the boy with a one - day suspension and barred him from a field trip , his friends rushed to his defense , berating Emily at school and online .
“ I felt like I was being punished , ’’ Emily said .
“ I got messages on my Facebook page , saying I was a terrible person for telling on a boy so well liked . ’’
The situation grew so bad that Emily , who is now a 10th - grader , eventually enrolled at a private school .
Maureen Bingham , Swampscott ’s interim superintendent , said student privacy rights prevented her from commenting on the incident , which occurred well before her appointment to lead the district .
However , she said the school system has long had bullying - prevention policies , and that each school runs programs to curb bullying .
The problem , she said , is that not all students follow the rules .
“ I think the schools do a pretty good job , but it can always be better , ’’ Bingham said .
“ I think it ’s a challenge for every school district . ’’
On the Cape , Theresa Jackson said her son is doing better now as an eighth - grader at another school in the Sandwich district , where students are more respectful .
The Sandwich superintendent did n’t respond to interview requests .
Jackson ’s son has joined a committee that organizes school dances and serves as secretary of the group , she said , but he remains fearful of going to dances .
“ He has n’t had the courage to go to another one yet , ’’ Jackson said , “ but he keeps trying . ’’

An armada of giant yellow earthmovers on the prairie south of Denver is racing to dig one of Colorado ’s biggest water - supply reservoirs in decades — a hole 180 feet deep across 1,400 acres — designed to wean suburbs off waning aquifers .
But the water to fill this reservoir ?
Not yet secured .
The prospect of what critics call an empty bathtub is generating anxiety around Colorado as water managers clash over the last unclaimed mountain river flows .
Most water to fill the Rueter - Hess reservoir “ will have to be imported , ” said Frank Jaeger , manager of the Parker Water and Sanitation District , who for 25 years has led the effort to supply 450,000 suburban residents .
Importing water would require multibillion - dollar pumping and piping from rivers running down the western side of the Continental Divide , such as the Colorado , back across mountains to Front Range residents , Jaeger said .
Though huge , the costs likely would be less than for alternatives such as trapping and treating contaminated water from the South Platte or Arkansas rivers , he said .
The option Jaeger and a Colorado - Wyoming coalition of municipal suppliers favor — one of four being considered by state natural resources officials — would divert water from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in western Wyoming along Interstate 80 to Colorado .
Groundwater dropping
If water ca n’t be imported to the reservoir , an estimated 190,000 Front Range residents who currently rely on groundwater face an uncertain future , as water tables are dropping 30 feet a year .
Douglas County communities “ need to wean themselves off groundwater because it is finite .
You do n’t want to have your lifestyle depend on a resource that is finite , ” said Bob Raynolds , a Denver Museum of Nature & Science researcher who for years has monitored aquifers .
“ We know we ’re falling down the slope of diminishing returns . ”
Suburban municipal wells , drilled over the past 20 years as deep as 2,745 feet through bedrock , today produce far less than they did a few years ago .
Yet Colorado Western Slope leaders see the $ 230 million Rueter - Hess reservoir as folly — and bristle at talk of diverting more water across the mountains to fill it .
The reservoir “ is 20 times more expensive , and 10 times as big as they need .
It ’s going to be a little bit of water in a big bathtub , ” said Eric Kuhn , manager of the Colorado River Water Conservation District , based in Glenwood Springs .
The financing , based on tap fees from anticipated housing construction , “ is the water equivalent of a Ponzi scheme , ” Kuhn said .
State demographers project Colorado ’s fastest growth will be on the Western Slope , with populations in the Colorado and Yampa river basins nearly tripling by 2050 .
Water demands to meet urban and energy industry needs there are expected to double .
A “ fairy tale ”
“ There ’s a very good chance that , in the long run , there ’s not going to be any more water available on the Western Slope .
And , if they ’re having trouble now paying for Rueter - Hess , how are they going to pay for moving water from the Western Slope ?
That ’s why I say this is a fairy tale , ” Kuhn said .
The push to build the reservoir began in 1985 when Parker obtained a required federal permit for construction in Newlin Gulch .
Then other south metro suburbs signed up .
The size was quadrupled , with federal approval .
It was presented as storage for recycled water and Cherry Creek storm runoff during wet years — water that normally would be lost downriver .
Now the emerging hole is sufficient to store 72,000 acre - feet .
An acre - foot is equal to 325,851 gallons of water , or enough to supply two families of four for a year .
Rueter - Hess will be ready for water by 2012 , said Doug Voss , project superintendent for Weaver General Construction Co .
Revolt over cost
South metro residents ultimately will have to pay for the project and for water , Jaeger said .
“ There ’s no cheap way out of this situation , ” Jaeger said .
That ’s touchy .
Parker - area residents revolted this year .
A proposed 28 percent hike to cover operating costs prompted a recall campaign to oust water board members .
An election is set for Dec. 15 .
“ All the providers recognize the cost of water is going to be significantly more , ” said Rod Kuharich , director of the 13 - member South Metro Water Supply Authority .
This month , more construction vehicles are rolling into action to build up the 7,700 - foot - wide Frank Jaeger Dam at the reservoir .
Critics “ can make their claims , ” but the reservoir will be crucial to sustain population growth , Jaeger said .
Paying off the debt for the construction now underway all depends on tax revenues from future growth , he said .
“ To say , ‘ We ’ll just shut off growth ’ will only exacerbate problems , ” he said .
“ If you do n’t pay off debt , what do you do ?
What does that do to the economy of the whole state ?
We need steady , controlled growth .
All our needs for a reasonable lifestyle are tied into this . ”

With the Senate Finance Committee ’s bill ’s passage , the health care reform debate moves on to talks of reconciling that bill with the others produced by the House and Senate .
Reports have come out that in the House , a robust public option may require only 8 more votes to pass…and many speculate that a somewhat less robust public option could pass both House and Senate .
As each day passes , Democrats appear to be speaking a bit more positively about their chances for success …and each weekly poll shows an uptick in public support for some form of government - run health insurance , which no doubt contributes to the Democrats ’ optimism .
So .
What is a Republican to do ?
Launch a fruitless counter - offensive , that will be hindered by the fact that , over time , Americans are becoming more knowledgeable about the subject of health care ?
Launch their own campaign to pass an important bill in some other policy area of their choosing ?
Join in health care talks , so at least when the bill passes they can try to claim they were involved , and not simply obstructing ?
Keep quiet on policy issues , meanwhile starting their campaigns for re-election back in their home states and districts ?
No . No. No. Definitely not .
They ’ll do what they have found so effective in the past … they ’ll try to distract .
AFGHANISTAN : After a brief hiatus , former Vice President Dick Cheney has again emerged …to question President Obama ’s “ war credentials ” and to claim that we are “ less safe , ” despite all reports and studies to the contrary .
In his latest effort to both criticize and distract , Cheney accused the president of “ dithering ” and of hurting the troops while helping the enemy : “ Make no mistake .
Signals of indecision out of Washington hurt our allies and embolden our adversaries . “
Perhaps the former veep is simply unfamiliar and uncomfortable with gathering information from generals and experts , in an attempt to make good decisions based on a thorough understanding of the situation , instead of making quick decisions based only on gut feelings and prayer .
Who better to respond to Cheney ’s claims than National Security Network Senior Adviser Gen. Paul Eaton ( Ret. ) :
“ The record is clear : Dick Cheney and the Bush administration were incompetent war fighters .
They ignored Afghanistan for 7 years with a crude approach to counter - insurgency warfare best illustrated by : 1 . Deny it .
2 . Ignore it .
3 . Bomb it .
While our intelligence agencies called the region the greatest threat to America , the Bush White House under - resourced our military efforts , shifted attention to Iraq , and failed to bring to justice the masterminds of September 11 .
The only time Cheney and his cabal of foreign policy ‘ experts ’ have anything to say is when they feel compelled to protect this failed legacy .
While President Obama is tasked with cleaning up the considerable mess they left behind , they continue to defend torture or rewrite a legacy of indifference on Afghanistan .
Simply put , Mr. Cheney sees history throughout extremely myopic and partisan eyes . “
Cheney ’s statements also resulted in a rather entertaining exchange between MSNBC ’s Lawrence O’Donnell and Joe Scarborough :
THE ECONOMY : When they ’re not claiming that the stimulus has failed , while simultaneously taking credit for its successes ( latest example in a growing trend here , courtesy of Senator Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) ) , Republicans are either criticizing Obama for failing to impose strict new regulations on banks and Wall Street…or they are criticizing Obama ’s efforts to impose strict new regulations on banks and Wall Street .
Representative Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) has proposed an amendment to the House Financial Services Committee ’s new Consumer Protection bill … that would allow federal bank regulators ( who many have claimed are a bit too friendly with the Wall Street institutions ) to “ veto ” any of the protections in the bill if they thought the protections might threaten the “ safety and soundness ” of the financial institutions .
Translated into normal people - speak : Hensarling thinks that risky schemes , if they provide a bank / institution ’s a lot of money , should be allowed … customer protection be damned .
Hensarling said : “ The safety and soundness of the system , taxpayer protection , ought to trump the ability to ban financial products .
And let ’s face it , I understand the chairman said that this new CFPA would not have the ability to set goals , but if you control the product mix , if you can ban products , if you can modify their terms , of what some have estimated could be as much as 10 to 15 percent of our economy , then yes , I conclude you can adversely impact the safety and soundness of these institutions . ”
Again … this distraction is not likely to be successful : the American people are less likely to support a legislator saying we ought to protect banks ’ ability to make profit at our expense … and more likely to support a president who is about to bail out small businesses , and to restrict the salaries and compensation of bailed - out CEO’s .
IMMIGRATION :
When in doubt , the GOP loves to fall back on an old standard : xenophobia .
It ’s perhaps odd that there are some within the Republican Party ( hint : her name rhymes with Lishelle Mockman ) claiming that the U.S. Census is some insidious attempt for President Obama to gather all of your precious personal data … and there are other Republicans , like Senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) and Senator Bob Bennett ( R - UT ) , who now want the Census to ask EVEN MORE questions .
Specifically … they want to add questions regarding citizenship and legal residency status .
Opponents claim that this would dramatically reduce participation in the Census …and that THAT is perhaps the true goal of the amendment ’s proponents .
Perhaps the GOP thinks that because Obama has taken few steps to address immigration issues , that the issue is ripe for creating distraction and dissent … they are neglecting , of course , that all polls show that “ immigration ” is pretty low on a lot of Americans ’ lists of “ political priority , ” and that current studies show that the recession has resulted in fewer and fewer people even trying to come into our country .
It ’s also ironic … that the GOP would choose Hispanic Heritage Month , when the media is flooded with positive stories about America ’s Latino community and their contributions to our country , as the right time to try to play off of some people ’s bigotry towards Hispanics .
RANDOM WINGNUTTERY : Senator Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) thought it wise to insert himself into the merry little war between the White House and FOX News .
For those who ’ve not been following this story , it began with a statement from a White House advisor , insisting that FOX News contained no actual “ news ” and was instead serving as a media outlet for GOP talking points .
This was , of course , an unnecessary point to make , seeing as most people already know this to be true about FOX … and those who do n’t , will never accept it as true because they never watch anything EXCEPT FOX .
The gauntlet having been thrown , the debate has resulted in a series of back - and - forth retorts amount to little more that “ Yuh - huh ! ” and “ Nuh-uh ! “
Anyone with any political savvy or simple good sense would know not to become embroiled in such a fray …. enter Senator Alexander .
From the Senate floor , Alexander cautioned the President against forming some sort of “ enemies list ” containing the names of political opponents , and organizations like FOX News .
Of course … there is absolutely no evidence that the President has any such list , nor that he is intending to formulate such a list … which is why many , such as Nashville journalist and blogger Jeff Woods , did not take long to criticize Alexander ’s “ advice ” to the President .
Instead of rushing to FOX ’s defense , Lamar may want to do what the rest of his party is doing … distancing themselves from the network , and other rabidly conservative outlets .
Here ’s Lamar ’s speech , just for laughs :
It ’s easy to see why these tactics will prove less effective than in times past : America ’s attention right now is squarely on health care … and the GOP is partly responsible for that .
In stirring up the right to believe that the health care issue is a “ struggle to save America from communism / fascism / tyranny “ … in scaring seniors into believing that “ the government is trying to kill you “ … in telling recession - weary Americans that regulating / reforming insurance companies will spell “ financial doom ” for small businesses and families … the Republican Party has convinced the American people of something that Democrats also wished for our citizens to realize : our nation ’s health care system ’s problems are INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT .
By not listening to the American people , and not realizing that the overwhelming majority of people think health care reform is absolutely necessary and needs to happen RIGHT NOW , Republicans do n’t seem to realize that we are locked into this one , particular battle until it is concluded … and little else will draw our attention away .
When Debtors Go AWOL
When you owe people money you want to hide in a corner and hope that something happens to change your situation .
Hey that ten dollars worth of lotto tickets is going to come through this time .
A lot of people take the road of avoidance as a way to deal with past due bills in hopes their creditor may not be able to get at them .
In three years of collections I found people who would go to amazing lengths to avoid paying a bill .
The most creative people would actually move their house with out notifying us – we collected on mobile homes .
The most common ways are to move and install renters , cancel your phone(s ) , and change jobs .
When a debtor goes AWOL ( Absent Without Leave ) collection companies and creditors do n’t give up , they get down to some good old fashioned skip tracing .
Skip tracing is the art of locating the unlocateable .
Commonly used by bounty hunters as well as collectors it is as much an art of social engineering and ingenuity as it being a private investigator .
To succeed at skip tracing you have to walk a fine line between legal and illegal to determine the location of the debtor .
Most of the time the process is a lot easier than you would initially think but sometimes you really have to work at it .
People who really do n’t want to be found can make it down right impossible to get ahold of them .
Common Methods of Skip Tracing
Whitepages –
This may seem to simple but a lot of people just do n’t tell you when their numbers have changed .
The easiest way to check it out is to look them up in the phone book .
This method is a little more difficult now with so many people relying on their cellular phones as a means of communication .
The phone book can help locate people who moved as well , especially if you know the city they moved to .

Old Phone Numbers –
It seems counterproductive at first but moving backwards in time through old phone numbers you have on file will usually produce a few good leads .
People may have been living with their mother , or used their mom ’s house as contact number for a bit of time .

Employer –
While not entirely a skip tracing method it is a viable means of contact .
In some cases you can scroll back through old employers numbers in attempts to make contact .
People can jump back and forth between jobs or you may get lucky and catch someone who is still a friend and give you a good contact number .

References –
Do you remember when you filled out that loan form and they asked you for two - four references .
Those lenders did n’t ask because they wanted to call and check up on how you acted when you were a kid .
They got those contacts so they can hound them if you ever decide to go AWOL .
Once the phone book has been exhausted it is time to get on the references .
The initial numbers will be tried first , if those numbers are disconnected then it is back to the phone book to try there .
If you still ca n’t find them it is time to expand your search .

If you still ca n’t find them it is time to expand your search .
Neighbors –
When the references are all used up you can move outward towards neighbors .
You can actually pull neighborhood searches based on an initial address .
If you know where the debtor lives they pull addresses , names , and numbers for the surrounding residents .
You then begin to call each of those contacts asking for contact information for the debtor .
You ca n’t really talk about who you are or why you are looking but the inference is there .

County Tax Office –
The county tax office keeps records of the updated address for anyone paying / owing property taxes .
When renters move in the county will typically still maintain a valid address for the property owner so they can continue to collect taxes .
A skip tracer will then take that information and start back at the beginning to try to locate the debtor at the new address .

Credit Reports –
When everything else fails you can pull a credit report .
The credit report will disclose any new accounts the debtor has opened .
The report will typically include the last reported employer as well information on other debts owed including information on how to contact those creditors .
Using the newly gleaned information you can contact the debtor at work or start contacting additional creditors in hopes of sweet talking a contact number out of them .

Field Agents –
When all else fails it is time to take to the field .
Back when I was doing collections we saved the agents for the farthest past due accounts because it is expensive and takes a lot of work to get someone out there knocking on doors .
The field agents are going to visit the home , leave notes , and in some cases knock on a few neighbors doors .
The true art of skip tracing is the ability to deal with people .
When you get someone on the phone who you have no real business with you have to be able to gently persuade them to give you the information you need .
The saddest part of this whole process is 3 /4 of the time the contact is to help the debtor out of their situation not make it worse .
Just know even when you go AWOL the creditors are going to work to find you and collect their debt .
When all else fails there is always court , and in extreme situations wage garnishment .
PORT OF SPAIN ( Reuters ) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called Friday for the creation of a $ 10 billion a year fund to help developing countries battle climate change .

Brown made the proposal as Commonwealth leaders met to try to build momentum for an agreement in global climate talks in Copenhagen next month .
Under Brown ’s proposal , funds could be made available to poor countries as early as next year , well before any new climate deal takes effect .
The European Union has already looked at similar proposals for “ fast - start ” financing but has so far been unable to agree on a figure .
“ What I feel the developing countries need to know is that we are absolutely serious that we would start now ” to provide financing , Brown told a news conference on the sidelines of the summit in Trinidad and Tobago .
“ What I ’m proposing today is a Copenhagen launch fund .
It would start in 2010 .
It would be $ 10 billion per annum by 2012 , ” he said .
The 53 - nation Commonwealth brings together wealthy and developing countries .
Brown believes the fund would give the developing world greater confidence that rich countries would give them financial support and so encourage them to act to counter climate change .
The fund would run from 2010 to 2012 , increasing to $ 10 billion in the final year , under Brown ’s plan .
Brown aides could not say how big the fund would be in the first two years .
Britain is prepared to contribute 800 million pounds ( $ 1.31 billion ) -- already set aside in Britain ’s budget -- over three years to the fund , officials said .
Brown said he believed the EU and the United States would also be ready to contribute to the fund .
EU leaders said last month that developing countries will need 100 billion euros ( $ 149 billion ) a year by 2020 to battle climate change .
Brown said half of the money in his proposed launch fund should go toward helping the poorest countries adapt to climate change , by for example financing stronger sea and flood defenses .
The other half would help countries deal with deforestation and building new , cleaner energy sources .
Developing countries would have to provide part of the finance for projects to lessen the impact of climate change and payment from the fund would depend on results .
“ The more carbon you reduce , the more tons of greenhouse gas saved , the more money any developing country would get from that fund , ” Brown said .
Major delays on trains Connex has warned of major delays on all 15 lines in its network .
Trains were running express through Blackburn after the station ’s subway filled with water , a Connex spokeswoman said .
Buses have replaced trains on the Alamein line and there are delays up to one hour on the Glen Waverley line .
A train was earlier struck by lightning at Sunshine .
The shaken driver was hospitalised after the incident .
Maintenance crews are scrambling to fix the damage but commuters are warned to brace for long delays during the peak travel period .
" We ’ve been told another storm on its way so we ’re preparing ourselves , " spokeswoman Laney Harris said .
Buses earlier replaced trains between Box Hill and Ringwood after a tree fell over the track at Laburmum .
A number of boom gates were also stuck down across the network due to an automatic failsafe triggered after equipment failure .
The Connex spokeswoman warned the boom gates would have a flow - on effect on traffic .
" This has been a massive knock to the network and we ’re working hard to recover , " she said .
Trams struck by lightning
Two trams were struck by lightning in the city 's east this afternoon .
It was not known how many passengers were on board but both routes are used by students at that time of the day .
Yarra
Trams said no - one was injured in the incidents , which occurred on Wattletree and Malvern roads .
All tram routes were running late due to heavy traffic caused by the storms , Yarra Trams said .
V / Line 's 1.15 pm service to Bendigo was stopped by a fallen tree between Woodend and Sunbury .
Crews were working to clear the line , a V / Line spokesman said .
Motorists have been warned to take care with traffic lights out or flashing across the state .
Girl injured in storm Ambulance Victoria said a 17 - year - old girl had reported being struck about 3.30 pm at Rowville .
The girl was having difficulty moving her legs and was taken to the Monash Medical Centre in a stable condition , an ambulance spokeswoman said .
The State Emergency Service was inundated with calls for assistance from around the state .
At 2.45 pm , an SES spokesperson said : " We have received some 33 calls within the last half an hour , predominantly coming in from the Bendigo and Shepparton areas " .
Most calls were reporting cases of either property damage or flooding , including a tree crashing through a house roof in outer - northeastern Eltham and flooded home in eastern suburban Blackburn .
Calls were also coming in from Melbourne ’s outer eastern and western suburbs , the spokesperson said .
Greensborough Plaza shopping centre , in Melbourne ’s outer northeast , has been flooded in a downpour and Metropolitan Fire Brigade crews trying to pump out a ‘ ‘ large amount ’ ’ of water , an MFB spokeswoman said .
Fountain Gate shopping centre in Melbourne ’s south - eastern suburbs was also evacuated .
The clubrooms at Elgar Park in Mont Albert North collapsed at 3.25 pm and an Age reader reported the roof blown off the Kew Hockey Club in Box Hill .
A Melbourne Airport spokesperson said flights were grounded for about 45 minutes as the storm hit around 2 pm .
Numerous traffic lights also malfunctioned across the state .
Thousands lose power
Thousands of people were left without electricity after storms swept through the state .
In Northcote , Balwyn and North Balwyn , almost 4000 CitiPower customers lost power after lightning strikes caused disruptions to supply .
All power has been restored in Northcote but crews were still working to return supply in other affected areas , a CitiPower / Powercor spokesman said .
Powercor customers in St Albans , Kyabram and Shepparton also experienced blackouts during the storm .
Power had been restored to most of those homes , the spokesman said .
' Prepare for wild weather '
The storm hit central Melbourne about 2.30 pm after Victorians were warned to prepare for more wild weather with heavy rain , thunderstorms and strong winds across the state .
Melbourne ’s temperature hit 30 degrees before the forecast severe thunder storms and heavy rain arrived .
A weather bureau spokesman said ‘‘ temperatures will drop some seven to eight degrees during the storms , but will climb back up towards the high 20s once they have passed through ’’ .
High winds came with the heavy rain .
" Winds are currently recorded as producing gusts of 50 km/h in the central Melbourne metropolitan area , " the spokesman said .
He warned winds could escalate as high as 70 - 80 km/h during the worst of the thunderstorms , with the potential to cause significant damage .
A highly unstable weather pattern from the north is bringing fast - moving and damaging storms , the bureau said .
" Due to the very humid and tropical conditions currently being experienced across the state , heavy rain fall could develop quickly , the main worry being that localised flash flooding could occur within the CBD this afternoon , " a spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology said .
More storms ' almost certain '
Conditions were " so unstable " that thunderstorms are almost certain to develop later this afternoon , he said .
These storms are expected to produce localised rainfalls in excess of 50 millimetres across the city this afternoon .
Last night , 30 millimetres of rain fell across the north - west of the state and resulted in extensive wind damage in the Mallee town of Woomelang , south of Ouyen .
Loading
The warm , unstable and very humid conditions look to have settled in for an extended stay .
" Temperatures are n't expected to increase greatly however the muggy , tropical conditions will be in effect until the humidity levels drop on either Saturday night or early Sunday morning , " the spokesman said .

Was he a hero , a villain or just a well - meaning but misguided doctor who simply wanted the community his patients lived in to be safe and healthy ?
" ... neither the complainants nor the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta wishes to suggest that Dr. O'Connor acted improperly when he raised concerns about the incidence of cancer in Fort Chipewyan based on his observations . "
The report , which was leaked , was only supposed to be released to a select few people " ... consensus as to the content of a public statement could not be reached by the involved parties .
Accordingly , the CPSA is completing its investigation report and sharing it only with those whom it has a statutory obligation to provide this information . "
The College 's 13 page report took great pains , however , to demonstrate that Dr. O'Connor was in the wrong because he " ... failed to inform public health officials and the Alberta Cancer Board of the identities of and clinical circumstances of patients whom he 'd diagnosed with various types of cancer in a timely manner ; ... did not respond to multiple requests for information after he had made public his concerns about the incidence of cancer in the community of Fort Chipewyan ; [ and ] ... made a number of inaccurate or untruthful claims with respect to the number of patients with confirmed cancers and the ages of patients dying from cancer . "
Arial view of Fort Chipewyan , Northern Alberta .
Mark S. Elliott
But in spite of those findings , the College has chosen to not reprimand or punish Dr. O'Connor in any way , in essence rendering its findings null and void .
So what is the real story ?
This story is a classic David vs. Goliath , and members of the public may never know the full truth .
The tale pits Dr. O'Connor , the community of Fort Chipewyan and their supporters against provincial and federal governments , giant resource - based corporations and their advocates .
Dr. O'Connor served as a general physician at Fort Chipewyan from 2000 to early 2007 .
During those years , he noted a high incidence of cancer and other diseases in the small population of approximately 1,200 .
Beginning in 2003 , Dr. O'Connor started informing various health agencies of his concerns about what appeared to be a higher - than - normal rate of cancer in the community .
Dr. O'Connor was largely ignored until his continued lobbying resulted in a Dr. O'Connor Alberta Cancer Board 's report on the study of cancer rates at Fort Chipewyan got underway in 2007 .
The findings , released in February 2009 , confirmed Dr. O'Connor 's assertions that there was a higher rate of cancer at Fort Chipewyan than would be normally expected .
The " In 2006 , Dr. John O’Connor , a physician working in Fort Chipewyan , reported a high number of cases of cholangiocarcinoma , a rare form of bile duct cancer , as well as high rates of other cancers .
Local residents echoed his concerns , attributing cancers in their community to environmental contamination from a range of industrial development including the oil sands 250 kilometres upstream , uranium mining and pulp mills . "
The study found " The cancer rate overall ( 51 cancers in 47 individuals ) was higher than expected ( 39 ) .
Higher than expected numbers of cancers of the blood and lymphatic system , biliary tract cancers as a group , and soft tissue cancers were found . "
The report went on to conclude that the higher incidence of cancer might be an anomaly , stating " These findings were based on a small number of cases and could be due to chance , increased detection or increased risk in the community . "
Highlighting the need for greater study , the report states " First Nations Albertans have a significantly lower rate than non-First Nations Albertans for all cancer , leukemia and breast cancer .
The rate for cholangiocarcinoma in First Nations Albertans , however , is significantly higher than that in non-First Nations . "

In 2006 , SunCor , it should be noted , is not the only resource - based extraction operation north of Fort Chipewyan .
There are uranium mining operations as well as other oil sands companies such as Syncrude , Shell , BP Canada Chemical , Imperial Oil and other companies .
Alberta is rich with
Of course , the oil sands industry does not want to make people sick .
The industry wants to make profits .
This story , however , serves to illustrate that the health of Canadians need to be considered and protected .
To have a community downstream from several major resource extraction operations , which do release carcinogens and toxic chemicals in water should automatically compel Canadian health officials to put human interests before corporate interests .
And when a downstream community is experiencing high rates of cancer , the onus should be on the corporations to prove their operations are not causing illness instead of the people needing to prove that they are being made ill by such operations .
Whatever you want to call Dr. John O'Connor , his efforts were instrumental in getting the Province of Alberta to look at the incidence of cancer in a small remote community called Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta .
But while working to get the province to pay attention to the problems he saw at Fort Chipewyan , three doctors working for Health Canada lodged complaints against Dr. O'Connor in 2007 .
After a two - year investigation into the four complaints , the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta ( CPSA ) cleared Dr. O'Connor of the charges of wrong - doing levelled against him stating

Dr. O'Connor was largely ignored until his continued lobbying resulted in a review of cancer cases in 2006 .
That review , however , was ultimately rejected by Dr. O'Connor and the community of Fort Chipewyan .
The hastily compiled report was essentially a tally of known cancer cases in Alberta , with a comparison between communities .
The report , which was released to the public at a hearing for SunCor , concluded that the rate of cancer in Fort Chipewyan was no higher than anywhere else .
Dr. O'Connor redoubled his efforts for an investigation into Fort Chipewyan 's cancer rates , and got one ; possibly because of the extensive media attention Dr. O'Connor was generating .
Dr. O'Connor was not shy about criticizing Alberta 's initial response to the issues he was raising , but the story gained global attention after doctors from Health Canada laid their complaints with the CPSA .. Alberta Cancer Board 's report on the study of cancer rates at Fort Chipewyan got underway in 2007 .
The findings , released in February 2009 , confirmed Dr. O'Connor 's assertions that there was a higher rate of cancer at Fort Chipewyan than would be normally expected .
The province studied cancer at Fort Chipewyan from 1995 to 2006 , and Alberta 's Cancer Board attributed the study largely to Dr. O'Connor , saying
The study found
The report went on to conclude that the higher incidence of cancer might be an anomaly , stating Highlighting the need for greater study , the report states
The problem was that Dr. O'Connor had been openly critical of the environmental contamination caused by upstream resource extraction activities , theorizing that this might be the source of cancer in Fort Chipewyan .
Furthermore , Dr. O'Connor had embarrassed Alberta after his lobbying resulted in the intense media attention focused on Fort Chipewyan .
In 2006 , SunCor , an oil sand operation that is situated upstream from Fort Chipewyan , admitted publicly that the company does release processing water into the Athabasca River .
SunCor also confirmed that it releases hydrocarbon and " other chemicals " with that processing water .
Some of those chemicals , according to records filed with the Government of Canada include carcinogens such as the 19 tonnes of benzene reported released in 2007 .
SunCor also releases toxic chemicals from its Fort McMurray operations in the waste water , such as18 kilograms of arsenic released in 2007 .
These two chemicals released are only part of a list of chemical releases in 2007 .
SunCor , it should be noted , is not the only resource - based extraction operation north of Fort Chipewyan .
There are uranium mining operations as well as other oil sands companies such as Syncrude , Shell , BP Canada Chemical , Imperial Oil and other companies .

Of course , the oil sands industry does not want to make people sick .
The industry wants to make profits .
This story , however , serves to illustrate that the health of Canadians need to be considered and protected .
To have a community downstream from several major resource extraction operations , which do release carcinogens and toxic chemicals in water should automatically compel Canadian health officials to put human interests before corporate interests .
And when a downstream community is experiencing high rates of cancer , the onus should be on the corporations to prove their operations are not causing illness instead of the people needing to prove that they are being made ill by such operations .

What is amazing about those people who live in constant fear of someone taking their guns is that they are creating their own need to own a gun .

The rest of us who are slightly more realistic do n’t need such protection for what we ’re using for protection .

It ’s like making an airbag for a car ’s airbag .
In case this strip sets off any red flags for those in the government , this is obviously a joke and is advocating the opposite of violence –the ridicule of it .

MANCHESTER ( Reuters ) - Police arrested 48 men during skirmishes between a far - right group and opponents in Manchester on Saturday .
Slideshow ( 11 images )
Supporters of the English Defence League , a new group which stages street protests against what it terms “ radical Islam , ” clashed with anti-racism campaigners from Unite Against Fascism .
Around 2,000 rival protesters congregated in the Piccadilly Gardens area of the city centre .
The two groups were mainly kept apart by a line of police in riot helmets and anyone trying to break through the cordon was led away .
Most of those arrested were held on suspicion of public order offences , police said .
One person suffered minor injuries but did not require hospital treatment .
Police eventually herded the English Defence League supporters out of the area and put them on double - decker buses to take them out of the city centre .
Their rivals were forced away in the opposite direction .
“ The presence of so many protesters in the city has proved a challenge and while many have turned out to protest peacefully the police reaction has been necessary in order to prevent the few hell - bent on violent confrontation , ” Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said in a statement .
Police described many of those arrested as “ agitators and trouble - makers . ”
The English Defence League sprang up this year after a small group from a local Muslim community staged a protest in the southern town of Luton against soldiers returning from Iraq .
The far right has made political progress this year , with the British National Party winning two seats in the European parliament .
Experts on community relations fear a rise in tensions between working class whites and immigrant communities could lead to further violence in the run-up to an election due by next June .
Palestinian children drink water at a water purification station in southern Gaza on October 27 , 2009 .
Human rights group Amnesty International says in a report issued today that Palestinians are denied ' the right to access adequate water ' by Israel , and the average Israeli daily water consumption in Israel reaches 300 liters , while Palestinians get an average of 70 liters .

AMMAN , Jordan , Nov. 13 ( UPI ) -- A Jordanian academic has predicted that Israel will go to war with neighboring Lebanon and Egypt to get their water .
An Arab water expert warns that Yemen 's worsening water shortage , which is already causing civil unrest , will bolster extremist organizations that could ignite conflicts with nearby states .

These two views reflect a widely held fear in the Middle East that global warming , dwindling water resources and burgeoning populations will trigger wars over water in the not - too - distant future .
The Jordanian , political science professor Ghazi al - Rababah , was quoted by the Amman newspaper Al - Arab Al - Yawm as saying Israel would first go to war with Lebanon over the Litani River just north of the border with the Jewish state .
David Ben-Gurion , Israel 's first prime minister , advocated years before the state of Israel was proclaimed in 1948 , that the Jewish state should incorporate the Litani .
Israel diverted water from the Litani during its 1978 - 2000 occupation of south Lebanon .
Al - Rababah said Israel stole " hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water " from the river .
Although Israel is currently seeking to alleviate its worsening water shortage by constructing desalination plants , reportedly scheduled to be fully operational by 2013 , al - Rababah declared that Israel would go to war with Egypt , its southern neighbor , within seven years in a bid to control the Nile River .
Amnesty International recently reported that Israel was restricting water supplies to the Gaza Strip , a tiny coastal enclave between the Jewish state and Egypt packed with an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians .
Gaza is ruled by the fundamentalist Hamas movement , which for years has fired rockets and mortars into Israel , and refuses to recognize the Jewish state .
Israel has enforced an economic blockade of Gaza for nearly two years .
In response , the Israel Water Authority claims that Israelis have been allocated less water per capita than Arabs since 1967 , when they captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan , the Sinai peninsula and Gaza from Egypt and the Golan Heights , a plateau that is an important water source , from Syria .
Sinai was handed back to the Egyptians under a 1979 peace treaty , the first between an Arab state and Israel .
The other territories remain under Israeli control .
Israel signed another peace treaty with Jordan , its eastern neighbor , in 1994 , but its monarch , King Hussein , had earlier relinquished any claim to the West Bank , which Palestinians want for an independent state .
The other Arab figure to predict regional conflict over water was Hosny Khordagui , director of the water governance program in Arab states with the U.N. Development Program .
In an interview with The Times of London he warned that the water shortages in Yemen , one of the poorest Arab countries , would cause more crime and violence , with growing support for " fanatical organizations " that could spill over into conflict with other states in the Red Sea and Horn of Africa region .
Earlier this month Saudi Arabia , Yemen 's giant northern neighbor , launched a cross - border military offensive against Shiite tribesmen at war with the Yemen government after they allegedly killed a Saudi officer in a frontier raid .
Yemen , the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden , also has a growing problem with a resurgent al - Qaida on its territory , which has relaunched attacks on Saudi Arabia and its royal family .
" If they do not find a solution , " Khordagui said , " we 'll see people encroaching on big cities , the formation of slums , a rise in crime , violence , even fanaticism .
" Fanatics will find very fertile ground to recruit and develop their infrastructure .
We have a water shortage which reflects itself in fighting between the people . "
However , Professor Aaron Wolf , a water conflict resolution expert at Oregon State University , said water wars between Middle Eastern states are not necessarily inevitable , and even in some cases have provided reasons for collaboration and peaceful resolution of differences .
" Water has certainly been an underlying subtext in the Arab - Israeli conflict , " he said .
" It has helped define the shape of the political boundaries -- but it's also been an excuse for conversation . "
Over the years , as Simmons passed from one private equity firm to another , and as Mr. Rogers became president of the local union at the plant , he saw little difference on the plant floor .
Then , in the spring of 2008 , when the slowing economy had begun to hurt sales , Simmons laid off the night shift at the Mableton plant .
And on Sept. 18 that year , it gathered employees in the cafeteria to say that the plant was closing .
“ So many people were hurt because they thought this was a great company to work for and they planned on spending the rest of their lives here .
Their families were here .
They bought houses and cars here , ” Mr. Rogers recalled .
“ After this happened , people were really struggling . ”
Between the closings and other cuts , Simmons let go of more than a quarter of its work force last year , said its chief financial officer , William S. Creekmuir .
Mr. Rogers , who received his union - negotiated severance package of two months ’ pay , said he and other union representatives had tried to get a little more for workers , particularly those who would have been eligible for retirement .
Simmons had a long history of giving retiring employees a bonus of $ 20 for each year worked and a free mattress set , Mr. Rogers said .
“ They would n’t give us anything , ” he said .
In the months after he lost his job , Mr. Rogers nearly lost his home to foreclosure and struggled to pay his family ’s bills .
Mr. Rogers , who eventually landed a job at an air filter company and picked up part - time work doing maintenance at an apartment complex , said Simmons bore little resemblance to the company he once loved .
“ They stopped the picnics .
They stopped the Christmas parties .
They stopped the retirement parties , ” he recalled .
“ That showed you the type of people I was working for .
I just did n’t realize it until the hard times came like they did . ”
For now , the Golden Age of private equity is over , the financiers say .
In a speech to an industry gathering last spring .
Mr. Schoen said that bankers and bondholders were reluctant to lend more money to the buyout kings .
This morning I was writing at my favorite coffee shop when a cute Latin woman with big , bright eyes and rosy cheeks sat down at the table across from me .
She pulled a sketch book out of her backpack and began looking around the room .
Out of the corner of my eye , I saw her look in my direction , study my posture , smile , and begin sketching .
We sat there next to each other for nearly three hours while she sketched and I wrote .
And as I shifted back and forth , engrossed in thought , I felt a bit self - conscious .
Because I could feel her watching me as she practiced her art .
But I was n’t too worried because I had n’t planned on talking to her .
After all , she seemed completely satisfied sketching in silence , and smiling at her sketches and at all of the other people who surrounded us .
I did , however , glance up a few times just to see her smile .
Because her smile expressed a kind of passion I seldom see .
All of the World ’s Beauty
A few moments later another customer came into the coffee shop and let a gust of wind in the front door .
The wind blew a completed sketch right off of the Latin woman ’s table and onto the floor in front of me .
The sketch was rather amazing .
It perfectly depicted a man who looked a lot like me typing on a laptop computer .
I looked up at the Latin woman and smiled .
“ Who ’s that sharp - looking guy ? ”
She giggled and rolled her eyes .
“ I do n’t know , ” she replied .
“ He ’s just a fairy tale character . ”
She then handed me a few of the other sketches she ’d been working on .
One of them was of the barista behind the cash register and the others were of other customers in the coffee shop .
“ Wow ! ” I exclaimed .
She sighed , smiled , and said , “ Sometimes I wish that I could capture all of the world ’s beauty in my sketches , but I ’ve come to realize that it ’s simply impossible .
So capturing still - frames of beautiful moments is what I settle for . ”
I told her that all of the world ’s beauty actually is captured in every sketch that perceives a moment just as beautiful .
And that her sketches are truly beautiful , just like her smile … because they reveal a gift and a passion to see beauty in common places – a beauty most of us overlook .
Time Ceases
She giggled again and said , “ My mother once told me that beauty occurs when time ceases to exist .
And if she ’s right , then perhaps my sketches are beautiful .
Because , for me , time ceases when I try to bridge my perceptions with the moments unfolding around me . ”
I chuckled aloud and then turned my laptop around so that she could read the words I had written just moments before : “ Time ceases to exist when she engages in this moment , because she wants nothing more than the beauty this moment has to offer . ”
“ Who is she ? ” she asked .
“ She ’s just a fairy tale character others will read about … and metaphor for hope to me , ” I replied with a wink .
She winked back , as if to prove that she was n’t just a metaphor .
And before I could even smile , I suddenly sneezed .
She laughed and told me that for just a moment in mid-sneeze I looked like Tarzan , and asked if I could hold that pose so she could sketch me looking like Tarzan .
I told her that I did n’t mind holding a mid-sneeze pose for a few minutes .
Because as she sketched , I got a chance to see the look in her eyes .
You know the look I ’m talking about … it ’s the look when beauty is perceived , time ceases to exist , and fairy tale characters come to life .
Jamie Delano's " Rawbone " -- a recent four - issue series from Avatar that , from what we can tell , is entirely about pirates raping each other until they die -- is not very good .
In fact , it 's been referred to as " frankly , f--- ing disgusting and completely insane , " and considering that diagnosis came from Warren Ellis himself , that 's saying something .
It is , however , pretty notable for its dialogue .
Delano 's wording in the series is so ridiculously over - the - top that if it was n't for the pages upon pages of pirate rape , the book would qualify as one of the best comedies of the year .
Need some proof ?
Just have a look at this page from # 3 , which includes the worst description of sex that we have ever read :
Even putting aside the fact that referring to your lover as a " throbbing fish " is n't exactly going to spur him to new heights of passion under the best of circumstances , we were struck by how alarmingly specific to piracy the metaphors are , and wondered how it might have gone down if Billy and La Sirena had gone into other occupations .

The news that Roman Polanski has been granted bail by Switzerland ’s highest criminal court came like a bolt from the blue , but was the result of what people familiar with the decision describe as a long process .
And contrary to many news reports , it was n’t a cash deposit that cleared the way .
One individual close to the Polanski camp , who spoke to TheWrap on condition of anonymity , disputed media reports that Polanski forked over $ 4.5 million in cash .
Instead , he called it “ a really complicated thing ” and a “ no - brainer ” with no basis for appeal by the Swiss justice ministry .
“ I do n’t know where they got that number , ” the source said .
A press release issued by Switzerland ’s Federal Penal Tribunal simply noted that the $ 4.5 million Swiss francs ( $ 4.47 million ) was considered “ sufficient to avert the risk of flight . ”
Polanski ’s release is by no means guaranteed .
As we pointed out earlier this month , Swiss officials have in the past cleared for bail high - profile detainees awaiting extradition , only to have higher authorities overturn the decision .
One of the more recent cases involved Russia ’s rogue nuclear energy chief , Yevgeny Adamov , who was lured to Switzerland in 2005 and busted on an American warrant for stealing and privately investing $ 9 million in U.S. government aid .
A sympathetic Bern judge agreed with Adamov ’s lawyer ’s plea to grant bail to Adamov on humanitarian grounds because of his age .
( Adamov was then 66 – Polanski is 76 .
Today ’s Swiss press release cited Polanski’s “ advanced age ” as a factor in the granting of bail . )
The Swiss federal justice office successfully appealed Adamov ’s bail grant and Adamov went nowhere until he was abruptly shipped off to Russia , frustrating the American plans to try him in the U.S .
Ever since Friday the 13th of this month all bets have theoretically been off in Roman Polanski ’s bid to fight extradition from Switzerland to Los Angeles involving a 32 - year - old sexual assault case .
That is when a certain legal math kicked in – by that date Polanski had served a total of 90 days in jail , counting the 1978 time spent in Chino State Prison .
That magic number is the amount of time that Polanski had seemed headed toward serving back in 1978 under a plea agreement that had been floated between his lawyers and prosecutors .
Speculation has focused on one scenario in which Polanski submits to extradition and a time - served agreement with the Los Angeles District Attorney ’s office , after spending a few nights in the local slammer prior to his hearing in Superior Court .
Peter Espinoza , the judge presiding over Polanski ’s request to have his long - ago charges dropped , may well find himself also facing a plea to release the auteur on humanitarian grounds .
" His health is not good — even before the arrest it was n’t , " the Polanski confidant said .
As speed junkies , usually when it comes to cruisers we recognize the aesthetic appeal and appreciate the technology , but always seem to gravitate back towards the sportbike genre .
However , every now and then one of these heavyweight contenders crosses over to the streetfighter category and we have to take pause .
The 2010 Triumph III Roadster is a perfect example .
This bike has the distinction of being the “ world ’s largest capacity motorcycle ” featuring an updated version of Triumph ’s 2.3 - liter three - cylinder 2,294 cc engine .
Torque has been upped 15 % to a whopping 165 lb - ft .
With this bike weighing in wet at 807 pounds , this should make for a more than ample power - to - weight ratio .
The Rocket III features some new ergonomics with the footrests moved further back and dropped lower which should appeal to those moving over from a crotch rocket .
And the seat is pegged higher and further forward for easier handlebar access and a more natural leg position .
Both of these changes should make cornering this monster a much easier task .
Furthermore , the suspension system has been ungraded with 43 - millimeter upside - down forks sporting twin Kayaba shocks along with new Brembo brakes integrated into the bike ’s ABS system .
The 2010 Triumph III Roadster comes in any color you want as long as it ’s black .
But you do get to choose either a glossy or matte finish .
With all of the major components blacked out as well , this gives the motorcycle a very sinister appearance .
The Triumph III Roadster will be exiting the gates of Hell and arriving at Triumph dealerships in early 2010 .

Finite Differences of Real - Valued Functions
Δf ( x , y ) = ( f ( x ) - f(y ) ) / ( x-y )
Δ( fg ) ( x , y ) = ( f ( x ) g( x ) - f(y ) g(y ) ) / ( x-y )
= ( f ( x ) g( x ) - f( x ) g(y ) + f( x ) g(y ) - f(y ) g(y ) ) / ( x-y )
= f(x ) Δg(x , y ) + g( y ) Δf( x , y )
f( x ) = 1+x f( x )
Δf( x , y ) = x Δf(x , y ) + f (y )
Finite Differences of Types
Δf( x , y ) = ( xN - yN ) / ( x-y ) = xN - 1+xN-2y+xN-3y2+...+yN -

Conor McBride 's discovery that you can differentiate container types to get useful constructions like zippers has to be one of the most amazing things I 've seen in computer science .
But seeing the success of differentiation suggests the idea of taking a step back and looking at finite differences .
Forget about types for the moment and consider functions on a field R. Given a function f: R→R we can define Δf : R×R→R byΔ is the finite difference operator .
But does it make any kind of sense for types ?
At first it seems not because we can't define subtraction and division of types .
Can we massage this definition into a form that uses only addition and multiplication ?
First consider
Δc where c is a constant function .
Then Δc(x , y) =0 .
Now consider the identity function i( x ) =x .
Then Δi(x , y ) =1. Δ is linear in the sense that if f and g are functions , Δ ( f+g ) = Δf + Δg .
Now consider the product of two functions , f and g.So now we have a Leibniz - like rule .
We can compute finite differences of polynomials without using subtraction or division !
What 's more , we can use these formulae to difference algebraic functions defined implicitly by polynomials .
For example consider f( x ) =1 / ( 1 - x ) .
We can rewrite this implicitly , using only addition and multiplication , asDifferencing both sides we get That tells us that Δf( x , y ) = f( x ) f( y ) .
We 're now ready to apply our operator to types .
Instead of functions on the reals we work with functors on the set of types .
A good first example container is the functor F ( X ) = Xfor an integer N.
This is basically just an array of N elements of type X .
We could apply the Leibniz rule repeatedly , but we expect to get the same result as if we 'd worked over the reals .
So setting f( x ) =xwe getSo we know that on types , ΔF ( X , Y ) = X+XY +...+ YThere 's a straightforward interpretation we can give this .
Differentiating a type makes a hole in it .
Finite differencing makes a hole in it , but everything to the left of the hole is of one type and everything on the right is another .
For example , for F ( X ) =X , ΔF ( X , Y ) =X+XY +
Ycan be drawn as :
If you 've been reading the right papers then at this point it should all become familiar .
Finite differencing is none other than dissection , as described by Conor in his Jokers and Clowns paper .
I do n't know if he was aware that he was talking about finite differences - the paper itself talks about this being a type of derivative .
It 's sort of implicit when he writes the isomorphism :
With a little rearrangement this becomes the definition of finite difference .
Now that we 've recognised dissection as finite difference we can reason informally about dissection using high school algebra .
For example , we already know that lists , defined by L( X ) = 1+X L( X ) can be informally thought of as L ( X ) = 1 / ( 1 - X ) .
So using the example I gave above we see that ΔL ( X , Y ) = 1 / ( ( 1 - X ) ( 1 - Y ) ) = L( X ) L( Y ) .
So the dissection of a list is a pair of lists , one for the left elements , and one for the right elements .
Just what we 'd expect .
Another example .
Consider the trees defined by T ( X ) =X+ T ( X ) .
Informally we can interpret this as T ( X ) = ( 1+ √ ( 1 - 4X ) ) / 2 .
A little algebraic manipulation , using ( √x - √y ) ( √x+√y ) = x-y shows that In other words , a dissection of a tree is a list of trees , each of which is a tree of X or a tree of Y .
This corresponds to the fact that if you dissect a tree at some element , and then follow the path from the root to the hole left behind , then all of the left branches ( in blue ) are trees of type X and all of the right branches ( in red ) are trees of type Y.
If you 're geometrically inclined then you can think of types with holes in them as being a kind of tangent to the space of types .
Along those lines , dissections become secants .
I think this geometric analogy can be taken a lot further and that in fact a non-trivial piece of differential geometry can be made to work with types .
But that 's for another day .
Oh , I almost forgot .
Derivatives are what you get when you compute finite differences for points really close to each other .
So I hope you can see that Δf( x , x ) =df / dx giving us holes in terms of dissections .
Conor mentions this in his paper .
We should also be able to use this approach to compute finite differences in other algebraic structures that do n't have subtraction or division .
I can leave you with some exercises : 1 . What does finite differencing mean when applied to both ordinary and exponential generating functions 2 . Can you derive the " chain rule " for finite differences ?
This can be useful when you compute dissections of types defined by sets of mutually recursive definitions .
3 .
Why is , defined above , a massaged version of the definition of finite difference ?
( Hint : define d= ( ( f( x ) - f(y ) ) / ( x-y ) .
In this equation , eliminate the division by a suitable multiplication and eliminate the subtraction by a suitable addition .
And remember thatis Haskell notation for the product of types . )
I 'm only going to do a cursory review of this episode since I probably wo n't be reviewing NCIS : LA next week and I might not even watch it .
For someone who has never watched NCIS , this show is fine , but why would someone spend an extra hour when there is a much better show that airs before ?
Linda Hunt 's character
Hetty did n't really grab my attention this week , but this week I think she became my favorite character about of a pretty boring group .
There were some awful clichés , but for the most part , I was amused by her and wanted to see more of her .
The only problem is that she 's supposed to be in charge of the whole operation yet we never see her give out any orders .
The episode was all about SEALs which Agent Hanna was part of .
The whole time , I could n't get a few things out of my head .
LL Cool J as a SEAL is ludicrous , this is n't as funny as NCIS , and why this show is different from NCIS .
There seems to be more autonomy by the field agents , but other than that , the crimes are of the same nature - naval - and they get solved by a shootout and never in a courtroom .
I watch a lot of television , much more than most people , and I could continue to watch NCIS : LA if I wanted to , but there is n't much that would pull me back .
Other than the location , cool cars , and gadgets , there hardly seems to be anything dramatically different than NCIS other than that is worse at doing the same things .
When the show was first pitched , the team was going to do primarily undercover work .
So far we have seen none of that , but unless there is an arc that everyone is raving about , I do n't think I 'll do anymore reviews .
Score : 8.3/10
Chess is a thinking game .
It is a fair game in that the player is responsible for the fate of the game and there is no other thing intervention in the game either in the form of luck or in the form of chance .
One thing that can be said to be a chance or luck is nothing but the mistake of the opponent .
In general , the player needs to think , analyze , visualize , plan , decide and execute a series of moves applying tactics and strategies to say “ checkmate ” to the opponent .
If children were taught this noble game at their tender age and encouraged to play the game , they will perform better in their academic career and outshine others – this is a finding of a research study .
Many countries have introduced the game of chess as part of their school curriculum and have made it a subject or game that each child should learn and play regularly .
How the game of chess will help children perform well in mathematics ?
Read on….
One of the important subjects that a child is taught in his schooling days is the subject of mathematics .
This is a very important subject and one needs to master it to have a better score in the examinations and also to pursue higher studies .
The importance of the subject of mathematics is that it cannot be learned by memorizing it by heart .
If you are learning a subject like history or literature , then it is easy to memorize the lessons , reproduce the things memorized in the examination hall , get enough marks to promote to the next grade .
You can safely forget about that subject , because history is not going to help you lead a life unless you want to choose to become a historian or an archeologist .
But that is not case with maths .
You cannot just memorize the formulas of algebra , reproduce it in examination and get away .
The basics of mathematics such as addition , subtraction , multiplication and division needs to be understood thoroughly and will be of use during your lifetime .
Memorizing the nuances of mathematics and making use of the same at times of necessity is next to impossible .
One needs to understand the concept thoroughly and apply thinking to solve the problems of mathematics .
Thinking , concentration , problem - solving and analytical abilities are the pre-requisites for the game of chess as well .
And the good thing is that these good skills are taught in a fun way .
Children enjoy the game and as part of their play , they learn these good skills .
Understanding the concepts , applying concentration , attention and analyzing the various types of problems is what is required in mathematics .
Playing chess will not only help children perform better in mathematics , but also teach very important and invaluable lessons to the children .
According to research , it has been found that playing chess helps children to develop and enhance their :
visual memory
attention span
spatial reasoning skills
capacity to anticipate events
capacity to predict events
ability to use analytical skills to make decisions , and
ability to evaluate alternatives .

Online chess helps children learn the game in a playful way with innumerable puzzles and tutorials .
It is true that children would live to play a lot in their young age .
Involving in physical exercises , games , and sports activities make their body stronger and healthier .
If the game of chess is also taught to the children , their brain would also be exercised and the children will become a healthy one – both physically and mentally , filled with confidence .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday vacated a lower court ruling that would have required the government to release photographs showing the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The decision was three sentences long and unsigned , and it followed the enactment of a law in October allowing the secretary of defense to block the pictures ’ release .
The Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower court , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , in New York , for further consideration in light of the new law .
The case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act , which makes disclosure of information in the hands of the executive branch mandatory unless an exemption applies .
The Second Circuit ordered the photos released last year , and the Justice Department initially recommended against an appeal to the Supreme Court .
But President Obama overruled his lawyers , saying his national security advisers had persuaded him that releasing the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment abroad and endanger American troops .
Some of the pictures , according to a government brief , showed “ soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees , ” a soldier who appears to be striking a detainee with the butt of a rifle , and a soldier holding a broom “ as if sticking its end ” into a prisoner ’s rectum .
Are Macs that are allowed to tie into Windows - centric networks posing an emerging security threat ?
Yes , contends Timothy Armstrong , Global Research and Analysis Team , Kaspersky Lab .
Kaspersky has become the lastest antivirus company to begin offering an antivirus protection suite for Apple computers .
Other security products already on the market include Mac versions of Norton Antivirus , Sophos Antivirus , PC Tools iAntivirus , Avast Antivirus as well as McAfee ViruScan , Intego VirusBarrier X5 , Avast and ProtectMac AntiVirus .
In launching its Mac security suite , Kaspersky contends that there are multiple scenarios by which Web - borne infections could be transferred from a Mac to a PC in a corporate network .
Infections can spread from a Mac to a PC via tainted USB devices , such as memory sticks , iPods , FlipVideo camcorders or Blackberries , or via corrupted Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office documents shared via email .
Ã‚Â ” In this scenario a Mac user might view a file and not get infected , then forward it to a colleague using Windows who would get infected , ” says Armstrong .
Similarly , the prolific spread of bad URLs via email and social network messaging and microblogging at one level is platform agnostic .
For instance , a Mac user might be naturally inoculated against malware written for Windows OS spreading via a bad URL in social network messages .
Ã‚Â
But the Mac user , nontheless , could naively forward theÃ‚Â bad URLÃ‚Â on to his or her Windows - using co-workers , says Armstrong .
“ Further complicating this issue is the use of URL shortening services on sites such as Twitter , which mask the actual destination , ” says Armstrong .
Kaspersky has detected a malicious Firefox plug - in that works on both Mac and PC as well as any operating system that will run Firefox , he says .
“ This plug - in is a Trojan horse which downloads and installs a spam sending bot written in JavaScript . ”

It was n't my idea to start a clothing line .
It took some convincing , gentle arm - twisting from a friend who often knows me better than I know myself .
That coercion worked .
We started a business .

And I had no idea what I was getting myself into at the time .
Looking back , the timing of founding Meat Bun , our video game - themed t- shirt line , makes sense .
It started in Tokyo , following an afternoon pounding the pavement in Harajuku , a fashionable slice of Tokyo nestled between Shinjuku and Shibuya .
The area attracts the fashion conscious , from outlandish cosplayers to street fashion freaks .
Advertisement
Harajuku is also home to one of our biggest influences , Beams T , a Japanese label that somehow manages to make the stereotypically uncool — including video games , anime and manga — cool .
It was after shopping at Beams T , where I purchased an Every Extend Extra t- shirt , lamenting that we 'd missed out the label 's Dragon Quest anniversary line of tees and bemoaning the fact that shirts from The King of Games were hard to get in the U.S. that the idea of making our own clothes , video game - themed ones , started to gel .
It was just days before the Tokyo Game Show .
Wedged between the t- shirt shopping and the promise of playing dozens of unreleased video games , the whole thing seemed like a good idea .

Our goal ?
To tap into the hard to define culture of video games , a medium which we had been passionate about for decades , and create something that was better than what we were being offered .
And we were n't the only ones with that idea .
Similarly passionate video game fans , those raised on 8 - and 16 - bit games were doing the same thing , like the people behind Panic , J!NX , Attract Mode , Starmen.net and its spin - off Fangamer and many others .
So , after foolishly deciding on the name Meat Bun — inspired by a life - giving pick up from Capcom 's unpopular side - scrolling arcade beat 'em up Warriors of Fate — we set off to clothe gamers .
Advertisement
My partner in clothing is Scott Spatola , a lifelong gamer who originally introduced himself to me after learning that I 'd brought a SNES and a copy of Street Fighter II to college , against my parents wishes .
The aforementioned arm - twister , Scott has always been the motivator , a rabid fan of Spy Hunter , Ninja Warriors and Darkstalkers , and the other half of this full - time - feeling side project dubbed Meat Bun .
Advertisement
It always helps to have a friend like Scott , one who 's organized enough to undertake the business side of the business — setting up the bank accounts , applying for federal tax IDs , legally incorporating the company .
There are just shy of a million little things that crop up in the process of starting to run one 's own business , from the minor — like running out of envelopes with 200 orders waiting to be fulfilled — to scary legal threats .
What seems like a fun little lark is n't often as easy as originally planned .
" I always said that if anyone ever asked , I 'd tell them that starting your own business is F-ing hard , and do n't let anyone tell you otherwise , " says Sean " Jinx " Gailey , the creative overlord at clothier and accessory maker J!NX .
" Real blood , sweat and tears ( also real ) have gone into this business . "
Advertisement
But J!NX has turned those hard - lost fluids into a successful brand and , perhaps more importantly , a full - time gig for its founders .
" Frankly , the biggest challenge was getting over the ' hump , ' making that transition from working your day job to solely working on your own business , " Gailey says .
" Anyone who 's working on their own business can relate to that .
We did n't take a paycheck from J!NX for 5 years of business , during the ' this is our side business ' days .
That was rough . "

J!NX has been in business since 1999 , when Gailey started the company " as a three page website with six designs " running the label from his bedroom .
We met Gailey at last year 's Spike TV Video Game Awards , bending his ear about the J!NX empire , which , while different from what we had set out to do with Meat Bun , reflected a similar passion for video games and general nerdiness , coated with a cooler shell .
Advertisement
" I wanted to make clothing inspired by our lifestyle , one of video games , pen and paper gaming , geek culture , giant robots , comics and dragons , " Gailey says of the origins of J!NX .
The clothing company has grown from a bedroom doubling as headquarters to an operation employing 21 people , occupying 18,000 square feet of office and warehouse space and making merchandise for hugely popular games like World of Warcraft , Dungeons & Dragons , StarCraft , Aion and EVE Online .
And while not quite understated , for the most part , what J!NX does is offer something to the fan of , say , World of Warcraft that 's designed with more of a wink and a nod .

From the barely referential designs from Katamari Damacy and Noby Noby Boy t- shirt maker Panic to the Earthbound obsessed crew at Fangamer — borne of Starmen.net — the subtle approach appears to be a common tactic .
For our own part , ultra vague references to The House of the Dead , Ikaruga and Spy Hunter , seemed sometimes lost on the Meat Bun customer .
Reid Young of Fangamer says his company draws much of its inspiration from the Super Nintendo 's role - playing game heyday for its similarly obscure designs .
Advertisement
" EarthBound and other SNES RPG's have definitely been our main inspiration , " Young says , a fact reflected in the clothing label 's EarthBound - heavy catalog .
" 1996 was pretty much the best summer ever — Chrono Trigger , EarthBound , and Super Mario RPG from morning to midnight .
It 's fun to relive those days and , hopefully , inspire new and old fans to do the same . "
Advertisement
While the Fangamer store — " Something we hoped would bring in enough money to keep the lights on " over at Fangamer 's community - driven side — is now the " main business focus , " according to Young , employing three full - time Starmen .
net veterans , running a clothing and merchandise label exceeded the EarthBound fan 's expectations .
" I never anticipated the amount of work which goes into a single piece of merchandise , " says Young .
" It sounds easy to slap a design on a shirt , but the amount of time , money , and care that goes into the process is staggering . "
Advertisement
Fan response , Young says , makes the grind of shipping thousands of Mother 3 - inspired handbooks and t- shirts all worth it .
" Releasing a product , going to sleep , and waking up to find that everybody is as pumped about it as I am .
It brings a little tear to my eye , " he says .

That may be the most exhilarating part of trying to appeal to a gamer 's fashion sense , finding something that people will buy and wear in public , unafraid to wear their love of video games on their sleeve , sometimes literally .
Advertisement
One person who 's taking a different approach to the sometimes hazy cloud of " culture " that surrounds video games is Adam Robezzoli , founder of " video game culture shop " Attract Mode .
It 's an endeavor four years in the planning , one that includes fashion , art , print magazines and more .
Attract Mode 's online store opened earlier this year , an effort that allows Robezzoli to " curate and produce unique art / goods related to video games , but also a way to fund pet projects like the artxgame collabs and the DATA BEEZ chip music concert . "
It also sells t- shirts , giving gamers more wearable options .

The online store offers a broader set of merchandise , however , from video game inspired t- shirts to zines from writer Matt " Fort90 " Hawkins to Pac - Man oven mitts to CDs from chiptunes superstars YMCK , Anamanaguchi , Covox , et al .
Personally , when we started doing our own thing with Meat Bun , it was simply an extension of our gaming - related lives , much like what the founders of J!NX , Fangamer , Attract Mode and others have done — turned their passions into something tangible .
And , yes , it 's sometimes F-ing hard .
But you have to wear something , right ?

Foreign Policy magazine takes on some of the arguments against allowing highly skilled or educated people in poor nations to leave if they want to .
The nub of their points :
This common idea that skilled emigration amounts to " stealing " requires a cartoonish set of assumptions about developing countries .
First , it requires us to assume that developing countries possess a finite stock of skilled workers , a stock depleted by one for every departure .
In fact , people respond to the incentives created by migration : Enormous numbers of skilled workers from developing countries have been induced to acquire their skills by the opportunity of high earnings abroad … .
Second , believing that skilled emigration amounts to theft from the poor requires us to assume that skilled workers themselves are not poor .
In Zambia , a nurse has to get by on less than $ 1,500 per year — measured at U.S. prices , not Zambian ones — and a doctor must make ends meet with less than $ 5,500 per year , again at U.S. prices .
If these were your annual wages , facing U.S. price levels , you would likely consider yourself destitute .
Third , believing that a person 's choice to emigrate constitutes " stealing " requires problematic assumptions about that person 's rights .
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that all people have an unqualified right to leave any country .
Skilled migrants are not " owned " by their home countries … .
The belief that skilled emigrants must cause public losses in the amount of their training cost is based on a series of stereotypes .
First , large numbers of skilled emigrants are funded by themselves or by foreign scholarships .
A survey of African - born members of the American Medical Association conducted by one of the authors found that about half of them acquired their medical training outside their country of birth .
Second , many skilled emigrants serve the countries they come from for long periods before departure … .
Skilled migrants also tend to earn much more than unskilled migrants , and on balance this means that a university - educated migrant from a developing country sends more money home than an otherwise identical migrant with less education .
The survey of African physicians mentioned above found that they typically send home much more money than it cost to train them , especially to the poorest countries ….

La mayoría de los rituales con velas para fin de año se realizan el día 31 , se recomienda que no entren personas ajenas al hogar mientras estos se llevan a cabo , así como también es aconsejable hacer con mucha fe aquellos rituales que tienen que ver con la limpieza de energías en una casa y así asegurarse que sólo se mueven buenas energías dentro de la misma .
Lectura de Velas
Existen diversos métodos para hacer la lectura de velas , cada quien escogerá el que mejor pueda interpretar , y por medio del cual pueda visualizar las respuestas de una manera más clara .
Aunque muchos consideren que se trata de una tarea sencilla , la verdad es que hacer una lectura correcta de las velas implica un profundo trabajo de intuición , concentración y conexión con las energías favorables que trabajan a nuestro favor para que alcancemos nuestros triunfos .
Todos los elementos deben ser considerados para hacer esta labor de manera exitosa , y con un mínimo de fallos , la manera en la cual se consume la vela , la intensidad de las llamas y la forma en la que la cera corre son aspectos importantes .
Significado de las Velas al Consumirse
Los significados de las velas al consumirse pueden ser diferentes , por ejemplo una casa , la cual significa ingresos monetarios o mejoría financiera en el hogar , una persona que acude en nuestra protección , números que señalan la fecha en la que ocurrirá algún acontecimiento , entre otros .
Si hay mucha cera al final del ritual esto no es favorable , ya que anuncia dificultades para lograr lo que estamos buscando , es decir , no es el momento en el cual las cosas se materializarán .
Por el contrario , si quedan pocos restos de vela , quiere decir que el camino será mucho más fácil y libre de dificultades .
Las cosas se darán con mayor probabilidad de éxito .
Aprender a leer lo que significan los restos de vela al consumirse puede ayudarnos también a conocer aspectos de nuestra vida .
Algunos detalles a considerar mientras una vela se consume , son los siguientes :
1 - Pueden surgir formas , o dibujos , bien sea a los lados como en la superficie en la que cae .
2 - La cera también toma su curso .
Por esto podemos ver cómo cae a los lados , e incluso se corre y puede llegar a un punto lejanos de donde la hemos encendido .
3 - La mecha puede variar , ya que muchas veces puede lanzar chispas , o mantenerse larga , o pequeña .
4 - La llama , posee vida , y por tanto puede cambiar de tono y mostrarse amarilla , roja , azul , blanca , entre otros .
Podemos ver que se mueve , permanece chica , o puede apagarse en algunos casos .
Por tal motivo , a medida que observamos cómo se consume una vela , podremos determinar si se cumplirán nuestros objetivos o no .
Significado de la Llama de las Velas
Gracias a los significados de la llama de las velas podemos saber lo que dice una vela como un libro abierto , además podemos conocer qué cosas necesita nuestro ritual para cumplirse .
Por ejemplo , si es necesario tener más fe de nuestra parte , si hay dificultades o energías externas que buscan interponer obstáculos para que no cumplamos nuestros designios , entre otros .
Una llama brillante siempre nos hará sentir tranquilos al saber que todas las cosas marcharán bien .
En cambio , una vela que se apaga sola nos advierte sobre un peligro próximo , o sobre la necesidad de acudir a otros rituales en búsqueda de protección .
La llama de las velas , además de llevar luz , también nos transmite un mensaje que podemos interpretar si tenemos los conocimientos necesarios .
Hay muchos tipos llamas , por color , forma , orientación , tamaño… .
Estos son algunos tipos de llamas :
- Una llama alta indica que todo es favorable y se cumplirán nuestros deseos .
- Si la mecha no crece quiere decir que las cosas pueden ocurrir , pero lentamente .
­–En el caso de las mechas bajas se debe colocar más fuerza a la petición .
Pues , esto envía el mensaje de que la energía no es suficiente .
– Cuando la mecha es pequeña o hace chispas quiere decir que las cosas no van bien , o que se necesita más energía .
- Si la llama es azul la persona en quien estamos pensando está recibiendo todos los mensajes que le hacemos llegar .
- Cuando la llama es amarilla no hay fuerza en la petición .
O esa persona con la que deseamos conectarnos no desea recibir nuestros mensajes y los rechaza .
– La llama roja nos dice que todo ocurrirá más rápido de lo que podamos imaginar .
- Una llama blanca nos anuncia la presencia de seres superiores que nos ayudan .
Si la llama se apaga entonces se debe empezar todo y replantear nuestras peticiones .
Es importante que no hay corriente de aire en la habitación .
Por lo general , estos son algunos de los mensajes que podremos obtener de las velas .
Sin embargo , a medida que aprendas más y te conectes con los rituales que haces , podrás descubrir significados más personales que las velas te comunicarán .
No basta con encender la llama de una vela para que todo cuanto desees ocurra .
Más bien , se trata de permitir dar el paso a todas las fuerzas capaces de trabajar de nuestro lado para cumplir nuestros fines y conectarse con ellas .
El poder que tienen las velas obedece a la fuerza que de por sí ya posee el fuego , al cual se le ha reconocido desde la Antigüedad su invaluable presencia , dado que es capaz de generar claridad , transformar los objetos , purificar el alma y contribuir a que el ser humano evolucione de manera constante .
Este alcance arrollador del fuego el hombre lo sabía desde los inicios de su paso por esta tierra .
Era un secreto que llevaba impreso en su ADN .
No hay otra explicación que explique de mejor forma el empeño del hombre por producir el fuego .
De manera que , al encender la llama de una vela , abrimos una puerta mística que nos conecta con todo este poder .
A este fuego es necesario asociarlo a la potencia de los colores para que los efectos en nuestra vida sean más notorios .
Los colores , como ya sabemos , son tan poderosos que influyen en nuestra manera de sentirnos y están en cualquier lugar al cual miremos .
No en vano tomamos tiempo para escoger de qué color vestiremos el día de hoy , en qué tono queremos que luzca nuestra habitación , así como tampoco es una casualidad que los publicitas se los piensen bien antes de hacer publicidad .
Otra de las cualidades que se les ha reconocido a las velas es que estas nos simbolizan como personas .
Así , el cuerpo de la vela es asociado a nuestro propio cuerpo , la llama representa nuestra alma y la mecha los pensamientos que se encuentran en nuestra mente .

Economic uncertainty and a steep decline in employment are two of philanthropy 's most dangerous enemies .
So it should come as no surprise that a recent study by the Giving USA Foundation found that charitable giving in 2008 fell by more than $ 6 billion from the previous year .
That 's a 5.7 percent drop -- the largest percentage decrease in a half - century .
Ohio has hardly been an exception to this crisis .
Contributions to United Way of Greater Cleveland are down more than 10 percent from their levels of five years ago .
The drop in charitable donations , combined with significant cuts in government funding , have forced many worthwhile area organizations to cut staff and curtail vital services .
But a bill pending in the Ohio Senate promises to provide upwards of $ 60 million annually to those charities -- at no cost to taxpayers .
Senate Bill 157 would apply only to class - action lawsuits in Ohio -- lawsuits filed on behalf of a large number of people with a common interest in a matter .
Let 's say XYZ Widget Co. makes a defective widget that causes nonfatal injuries to an estimated 1,000 Ohioans .
A class action is filed against XYZ .
The company knows it is in the wrong and could be hit for huge damages if the case goes to trial .
So XYZ Widget -- or , more likely , its insurer -- settles the case and agrees to pay $ 1 million .
But , as is often the case , not all members of the " class " injured by the defective widget can be located or do not come forward .
So , instead of paying $ 1,000 each to all 1,000 of those injured , XYZ Widget pays the $ 1,000 to only 600 Ohioans .
Under present Ohio law , the $ 400,000 in unclaimed damages would revert to the defendant company .
But Senate Bill 157 would provide that , absent agreement to the contrary , the leftover funds would be distributed to a group of Ohio charities and nonprofits agreed to by the lawyers and the judge .
The idea here is to place into Ohio law the age - old legal doctrine of cy pres ( a shortened form of the French for " as near as possible " ) , which has been used at times by courts across the country to direct unclaimed class - action funds to charities .
Business interests , notably insurance companies , claim passage of the bill would discourage settlements of class - action lawsuits .
It would also , argued Linda Woggon of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce , establish " a very bad precedent in Ohio by punishing people who have n't [ been ] found to have done anything wrong . "
It 's true that class - action settlements rarely include an admission of wrongdoing , but totally blameless class - action defendants agree to large settlements about as often as this version of state government does something good for Greater Cleveland .
Also worth noting is that SB 157's two prime sponsors are Republican Sens.
Tim Grendell and Bill Seitz , two of the legislature 's most conservative members .
Seitz said the opposition to the bill is " very formidable for reasons that do n't make a lot of sense to me . "
Grendell said " the insurance lobby has some friends in the Senate who are spreading a lot of misinformation . "
Greater Cleveland 's large and generous philanthropic community is solidly behind this bill , as are representatives of area charities , many of whom testified in favor of it at a Nov. 10 Senate committee hearing in Columbus .
Joining them was Patrick Perotti , widely regarded as the father of Senate Bill 157 .
A native of Parma , Perotti , 53 , is a successful class - action lawyer and partner in the Cleveland area law firm of Dworken & Bernstein .
Beginning in the early 1990s , Perotti refused to settle many cases until defendants would agree that any unclaimed funds due injured parties divert to charities .
Since then , the firm has distributed more than $ 20 million to charities throughout Ohio .
Perotti told senators that making cy pres the standard in Ohio " is important because currently the vast majority of settlements fail to address this , which results in an outcome not consistent with what the court was told about the settlement . "
Despite powerful opposition to SB 157 from interests that fund legislators ' campaigns , even the critics can't explain away this little bit of logic :
If a defendant agrees that $ 1 million is fair compensation to end a lawsuit , it 's eminently fair to expect that the entire $ 1 million be paid .
Especially if a portion of that payment goes to worthy charities .

Six Man Golden State Warriors Stops Dallas Mavericks
The Golden State Warriors won against Dallas Mavericks using only six players .
The Mavericks were in a five game winning streak going into the game against the Warriors .
The final score was 111-103 .
The Warriors is plagued by injuries and sickness .
In fact , coach Don Nelson is not in the building due to pneumonia .
The historic win was credited to assistant coach Keith Smart .
The six players who played were Anthony Morrow , Vladimir Radmanovic , Mikki Moore , Monta Ellis , Stephen Curry and Anthony Randolph .
There were two other players in the bench who are injured , Chris Hunter and Corey Maggete .
All players logged a minimum 30 minutes each with Ellis , Morrow and Radmanovic playing all 48 minutes .
The Warriors were behind 98 - 89 with six minutes left in the game .
The last time a team won a game with only six players was in 1981 during the NBA finals .
Houston Rockets were led by coach Del Harris at that time .
The last time a team won a regular season game was in 1951 .
Although nothing has yet been officially announced by Meteor , a message from an administrator on the mobile operator ’s online discussion forum states claims that Meteor will be bringing an Android handset to market this November .
" I have just been speaking to our product guys and I can confirm that we will definitely be launching an Android handset on our network in November !!! , " said an administrator named Glynn on the official Meteor discussion forum .
The message was part of a discussion thread specifically on Android , Google ’s open - source operating system for smart phones .
The Meteor administrator went on to say that he could not comment on whether the Android handset in question was a HTC Hero , but an anonymous tipster told Gadgetrepublic.com that it was in fact going to be the Hero , a slim touchscreen smart phone with a 3.2 - inch TFT - LCD screen , 5 - megapixel camera and trackball navigation button .
By Marie Boran , via Gadgetrepublic.com
Pictured : The HTC hero , possibly the Android handset that Meteor will be selling in November .
In case you had n't noticed , rumors of an imminent Android launch on Verizon -- the carrier 's first -- have been at a fever pitch the past few weeks , and like clockwork , the States ' largest wireless network has gone ahead and scheduled a conference call with Google for 7 AM Pacific Time / 10 AM Eastern Time today .
To be fair , it 's not a guarantee this is Android - related , and it is interesting that Motorola is n't listed as a participant on the call considering that its Sholes / Tao / Droid had been rumored as Verizon 's first Android device -- but none other than Eric Schmidt and Verizon chief Lowell McAdam will be in attendance , so we expect it to be something big .
Stay tuned .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A cat in Iowa has tested positive for H1N1 swine flu , the first time a cat has been diagnosed with the new pandemic strain , the American Veterinary Medical Association said on Wednesday .
The 13 - year - old cat apparently caught the virus from one of the people living in the house , the group said in a statement .
It has recovered and does not appear to have infected anyone or anything else .
Pigs are the original source of the H1N1 virus and it has been found in several herds , as well as in a pet ferret .
Ferrets are especially susceptible to human influenza viruses .
“ Two of the three members of the family that owns the pet had suffered from influenza - like illness before the cat became ill , ” Iowa Department of Public Health Veterinarian Dr. Ann Garvey said in a statement .
“ This is not completely unexpected , as other strains of influenza have been found in cats in the past . ”
Both the cat and its owners have recovered from their illnesses .
The AVMA has a website on H1N1 illnesses in U.S. animals at www.avma.org/public_health/influenza/new_virus.
Dogs and horses also can catch various influenza strains , although none have so far been diagnosed with H1N1 .
“ Indoor pets that live in close proximity to someone who has been sick are at risk and it is wise to monitor their health to ensure they are n’t showing signs of illness , ” said Dr. David Schmitt , state veterinarian for Iowa .
The new H1N1 passes easily from person to person and has infected millions globally since March , killing at least 5,000 people whose infections have been documented .
Peel 's top public health officials are lobbying to ban smoking from apartments and condos in an effort to limit second - hand smoke inhalation .
If their push is successful , apartment dwellers would not be able to smoke in their own homes .
The region 's council is going to examine a report co-authored by Commissioner of Health Services Janette Smith , and Dr. David Mowat , Peel 's medical officer of health .
Their report says that Peel Public Health has received complaints from apartment tenants about smoke seeping into their homes .
" Tobacco smoke can seep from various openings in a multi- unit dwelling , including electrical outlets , plumbing , ductwork , ceiling light fixtures , cracks in wall , floors or doors and through common areas , such as hallways , " wrote Smith and Mowat in the report .
" Some units may share ventilation or heating systems , which can further spread the smoke throughout a building . "
Their findings prompted an investigation into whether the city has the authority to ban smoking inside apartments .
Under the Municipal Act of 2001 , Peel can invoke a bylaw preventing tenants from smoking , but Smith and Mowat suggest the best route would be to persuade Queen 's Park to enact a province - wide ban .
The province 's current ban on smoking applies only to enclosed public spaces , as well as elevators and hallways in apartment buildings .
But it does not stop people from smoking in their homes .
" I do n't actually think that we need to be asking the province because I think it 's already happening , " said Pippa Beck , a policy analyst for the Non- Smokers ' Rights Association .
" We have market forces on our side , landlords are recognizing the financial benefits , which are not insignificant , and there is more and more demand for smoke - free living . "
Beck noted several municipalities in Ontario , including Kitchener - Waterloo and Hamilton , are taking steps to ban smoking in residences .
This month , councillors in Kitchener - Waterloo decided , starting in April , new tenants in apartments owned by Waterloo Region would not be allowed to smoke at home .
The region had been receiving an average of five calls a month from tenants complaining about second - hand smoke seeping into their dwellings from other units and open windows .
Those calls represented about 20 per cent of all tobacco - related complaints received by the region , according to a regional report .
In Peel , individual landlords of apartments are also choosing to make their buildings smoke - free .
In July 2006 , a smoke - free 53 - unit housing complex opened on Cummer Ave. in North York .
In 2008 , the owner said one tenant had left because of the policy .
Peel 's council votes Thursday on whether to approach the province about the recommendations .

WUXI , China  President Obama wants to make the United States “ the world ’s leading exporter of renewable energy , ” but in his seven months in office , it is China that has stepped on the gas in an effort to become the dominant player in green energy  especially in solar power , and even in the United States .
Chinese companies have already played a leading role in pushing down the price of solar panels by almost half over the last year .
Shi Zhengrong , the chief executive and founder of China ’s biggest solar panel manufacturer , Suntech Power Holdings , said in an interview here that Suntech , to build market share , is selling solar panels on the American market for less than the cost of the materials , assembly and shipping .
Backed by lavish government support , the Chinese are preparing to build plants to assemble their products in the United States to bypass protectionist legislation .
As Japanese automakers did decades ago , Chinese solar companies are encouraging their United States executives to join industry trade groups to tamp down anti-Chinese sentiment before it takes root .
The Obama administration is determined to help the American industry .
The energy and Treasury departments announced this month that they would give $ 2.3 billion in tax credits to clean energy equipment manufacturers .
But even in the solar industry , many worry that Western companies may have fragile prospects when competing with Chinese companies that have cheap loans , electricity and labor , paying recent college graduates in engineering $ 7,000 a year .

The team drilled over 200m to install the strainmeter Typhoons can trigger imperceptible , slow earthquakes , researchers say .
Scientists report in the journal Nature that , in a seismically active zone in Taiwan , pressure changes caused by typhoons " unclamp " the fault .
This gentle release causes an earthquake that dissipates its energy over several hours rather than a few potentially devastating seconds .
The researchers believe this could explain why there are relatively few large earthquakes in this region .
Alan Linde from the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US and colleagues monitored movement of two colliding tectonic plates in eastern Taiwan .
They used three borehole " strainmeters " - highly sensitive instruments deep below the ground .
" These detect otherwise imperceptible movements and distortions of rock , " explained co-author Selwyn Sacks , also from the Carnegie Institution .
Gentle relief
The instruments picked up 20 " slow earthquakes " , each lasting from several hours to more than a day .
Of these , 11 co-incided exactly with typhoons .
The authors described the possibility that this coincident timing was by chance as " vanishingly small " .
For the typhoon to be a trigger , the fault must be precariously close to failure
Alan Linde
Carnegie Institution for Science
An old flame in the ring of fire " It 's rare that you see something so definitive , especially when it 's something new , " Dr Linde told BBC News .
Their findings could provide clues about why there are relatively few large earthquakes in this region .
Here , the colliding plates move so rapidly that they build mountains at a rate of almost 4 mm per year .
Dr Linde said that in geological terms that was almost like " growing mushrooms " .
" It 's surprising that this area of the globe has had no great earthquakes and relatively few large earthquakes , " Dr Linde commented .
" By comparison , the Nankai Trough in southwestern Japan has a plate convergence rate of about 4 cm per year , and this causes a magnitude 8 earthquake every 100 to 150 years .
" The activity in southern Taiwan comes from the convergence of the same two plates , and there the Philippine Sea Plate pushes against the Eurasian Plate at twice that rate .
" This fault experiences more or less constant strain and stress build - up . "
He described how the fault " dipped steeply " westward from near the east coast so that it is under the land area .
So the landward side is under constant strain to move upward .
When a typhoon passes over the land , the air pressure on the land is lowered .
That slight change in force " unclamps " the fault and allows it to move .
" But this change is quite small , " said Dr Linde .
" So for the typhoon to be a trigger , the fault must be precariously close to failure . "
The frequent , slow earthquakes this causes are " totally imperceptible " from the ground .
And Dr Linde thinks it is sensible to assume that they may reduce the frequency of larger , more damaging earthquakes .
But this is extremely hard to show because , as he puts it , " how do you prove something that does n't happen ? "

It ’s quite possible that over the last year or so you ’ve heard me muttering about a secret project that I ’ve been working on .
Well , this morning I can finally reveal what it is .
Do you ever wish that the Perl community had a centralised blogging site where anyone could set up a blog for free ?
Something , perhaps , that allows you to use modern blogging features like images in your posts or tags .
If you ’ve ever wished for something like that , then can I suggest that you take a look at blogs .
perl.org .
I think it might be just what you ’re looking for .
The site is built using Movable Type and we were lucky enough to get some people from Six Apart to build it for us .
I ’d like to particularly thank Steve Cook of their professional services division who has done a lot of the actual work .
Thanks also go to Jeremy King who designed the site and David Jacobs who is their manager and allowed them to work on the project on company time .
From the Perl community I need to thanks Aaron Crane who is hosting the site and Curtis Poe and Aristotle Pagaltzis who have both been involved in planning this project .
Many other people have given invaluable advice or have been early testers of the site .
Thanks to everyone who has been involved .
All that remains now is for you to try it out .
You should regard it as a beta test version , so some of you will find problems .
When you do , please just let me know and we ’ll fix them .
I hope you enjoy the site and find it useful .
Update :
Yes , there seems to be one quite glaring problem with it .
That ’s the web server errors that are generated occasionally when someone tries to log in ( or out ) .
Seems to be a resource allocation issue with the server .
We ’re looking into it .
Please bear with me .

WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A congressional effort to enact swift rules to protect credit card consumers during the holiday shopping season is all but dead .
Tough new rules are already slated to go into effect on Feb. 22 .
The new rules , enacted by President Obama in May , prohibit banks from hiking interest rates on existing balances of fixed - rate cards unless the cardholder is two months late in paying the bill .
After credit card companies started hiking rates over the summer , the House and Senate offered proposals to move up the effective date of the new rules or to freeze rates until the new law kicks in .
The House passed a measure , sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , to move up the start date to take effect immediately .
( Please see correction . )
But the Senate has introduced a different version and has shown no signs of taking up the House bill .
Last week , Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , tried to fast - track a bill he introduced to freeze rates , but Republicans blocked the move .
" The holiday season is upon us .
Hard - pressed Americans want go out and do what what they can to help their families and celebrate , in a very difficult time , some joy ... by taking a credit card out and making those purchases , " Dodd said from the Senate floor .
" They 're watching ... an industry continue to skyrocket these rates and fees on people . "
Dodd , who chairs the Banking Committee , has not given up on his rate freeze proposal .
" Senator Dodd is going to use every opportunity he can to pass this bill , " said Dodd spokeswoman Justine Sessions .
But Congress watchers say they do n't expect the Senate to pass the freeze now that the effective date is looming , especially as health care reform and the shaky job market dominate lawmakers ' attention .
" It 's going to be very hard to do , because you just do n't have time to move it through the chambers , " said Dan Clifton , head of policy firm Strategas Research Partners .
" There 's probably no room to do it through December or probably through January . "
In the meantime , credit card rates continue to inch higher , according to a Government Accountability Office report released last week .
" In recent months , changes in the economy and the passage of the [ new law ] have led many issuers to ' reprice ' their credit card accounts by altering the rates , fees , and other terms that apply to cardholders ' cards , " the government watchdog said .
Interest rates on consumer credit cards have been increasing steadily since the second quarter of 2008 , when rates were 11.88 % .
Since then , rates have shot up to 13.32 % in the second quarter of 2009 , according to Federal Reserve data .
The banking industry , which opposed the bills to move up the tougher rules , says its recent rate increases have more to do with accounting for the increased risk in lending to strapped consumers who can't pay their bills .
" It 's unfortunate that the economy is struggling during the holiday season , but credit card interest rates reflect the risk in the economy , " said Scott Talbott , chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable , a business group .

An earlier version of this article misreported the proposed effective date of the House bill .

Righteous indignation erupted on the Internet last week following reports that Microsoft had patented sudo , a traditional command - line tool that is widely used on Linux and some UNIX platforms for selective privilege escalation .
Some enthusiastic patent reform advocates predictably held up the patent as an example of the problems that afflict the patent system .
The inherent broadness and ambiguity of software patents is arguably a debilitating problem for the software industry and a matter that calls for evaluation of potential reforms , but we 're not so sure that the Microsoft patent in question is as egregious as the critics claim .
Granting a patent on the underlying concept of sudo to Microsoft over two decades after the tool was invented by open source developers would indeed be foolish , but that is not at all what happened .
A look beyond the short summary of the patent filing and into the body of the patent 's actual claims reveals that Microsoft's " invention " is really quite different from the sudo command - line tool .
It might , however , cover some technologies that have more recently arrived on the Linux desktop .
Microsoft's ' 530 patent , which is titled Rights Elevator , covers methods " that enable a user to elevate his or her rights . "
Specifically , it describes a user interface which displays accounts that have the necessary rights to perform an action when the user is blocked from performing an action that requires higher access privileges .
The claims of the patent all revolve around a system of recommending higher - privilege accounts for the user to choose from based on various predetermined parameters .
Although the subject of Microsoft 's patent is related to sudo in the sense that it also deals with mechanisms for performing an operation with heightened privileges , the scope is clearly different .
The two are different in , for example , the way that a train is different from a car .
Unfortunately , the hysteria surrounding the patent is creating needless uncertainty about sudo .
To clarify the matter , sudo maintainer Todd Miller posted a statement on the sudo mailing list explaining the difference .
" I 've already received a number of questions about US patent 7,617,530 that some people seem to believe might cover sudo .
I do n't think that is the case , " he wrote .
" Sudo simply does n't work this way .
When a command is run via sudo the user is actively running the command as a different user .
What is described in the patent is a mechanism whereby an application or the operating system detects that an action needs to be run with increased privileges and automatically prompts the user with a list of potential users that have the appropriate privilege level to perform the task . "
Although the patent does n't cover sudo , it 's worth noting that the specific elements that it describes are indeed found in the graphical interface of Policy Kit , a relatively modern Linux framework for privilege escalation .
PolicyKit was developed after the Microsoft patent was filed , meaning that it does n't constitute prior art .
If you attempt to change certain system settings in Ubuntu 9.04 , Policy Kit will present a dialog that lists users who have the requisite privileges for performing the configuration change .
Curiously , the dialog is different in the latest version of the distribution and does n't display the user combobox .
This change arguably makes it safe from this particular patent , assuming that the new behavior appears consistently in all cases .
Whether the patent is valid or non-obvious is a matter that is worth debating , but it 's important for that debate to focus on the patent 's true scope .
Invention is often an incremental process and there many patents that describe a new twist on something old .
When searching for prior art to challenge the validity of a patent , it 's important to look closely at the actual claims rather than just the abstract , which can be misleading .
A lot of people will actually throw out an otherwise perfectly good piece of clothing simply because the zipper stopped working properly for
whatever reason ( usually their attempts at fixing it simply consist of tugging on it really hard and cursing–hey , I ’ve done that , too ) , which is a shame because this is such an easy fix regardless of precisely how your zipper is broken : whether it ’s stuck or separated , we can show you how to fix it up very quickly and very
cheaply .
If this seems to happen to you a little too frequently , you might want to consider picking up a cheap universal zipper repair kit like this one .
Ok , I ’ve got several videos here showing you exactly what to do ( all of them are from this vintage clothing repair shop in Oregon or something ) , but they ’re both only about 2 - 3 minutes in length , so no big deal , this really is n’t a complicated procedure , I promise , it just has to be done properly and carefully ; first we ’ll deal with the most common problem , a stuck zipper , then we ’ll show you how to fix a separated one .
How to fix a stuck zipper
First , a few tips :
Do n’t force it–it wo n’t help and you ’ll break it .
You know this .
Stop .
Curse as much as you like , however .
Adding a bit of lubricant if the below technique is n’t cutting it will probably take care of it : the best choice is liquid hand soap because it will easily wash out with water and is the least likely to stain your clothing .
Needle - nosed pliers work great at grabbing hold of that bit of clothing that ’s jammed in there if you ca n’t get ahold of it with your fingers .
Ok , here ’s what to do :
How to fix a separated zipper
This is a completely different problem and will require you to do just a tiiiiiny bit of stitching –it ’s extremely simple stuff , a retarded gorilla could do this , I promise .
So you ’ll need a needle and thread , and possibly some needle - nosed pliers ( those things are so universally useful , everyone really should have a pair around ) –if you do n’t have any but you ’ve got a friend with a multi-tool like a Leatherman or something , those almost always have some needle - nosed pliers on them .
Ok , here we go :

Today is Ardipithecus day .
Eleven papers in tomorrow ’s issue of Science describe the research on one exceptional skeleton ( numbered ARA - VP -6/500 , nicknamed “ Ardi ” ) as well as more than thirty other individuals , mostly represented by isolated teeth with a few partial sets of teeth .
Image of the Ardipithecus skeleton
I have a lot of material to share about these papers and how they change things in paleoanthropology — so much that I can’t possibly fit it all into one post .
So I ’m starting out with a basic overview of the main points , organized as an FAQ .
Over the next few days I ’ll be exploring some of the most central issues in closer detail : in particular ,
How we now interpret the earliest hominins in light of Ardipithecus .
What the skeleton means for our understanding of the human - chimpanzee common ancestor .
How Ardipithecus relates to the first australopithecine , Australopithecus anamensis .
How the crushed pelvis became a 3 - d model , and whether we should believe it .
Can Ardipithecus be consistent with genetic estimates of human - chimpanzee divergence time ?
What was the locomotor adaptation of Ardipithecus really like ?
How was the “ Discovering Ardi ” documentary feature ?
I expect I ’ll be posting a new story every day for the next week or so .
This initial post will be the central location for the series , and here I ’ll try to give the most general - interest information .
I will also have a short article coming out in Seed sometime this week , I will post a link when that is up .
I will be editing this post recurrently — I ’ve been speed - writing for the last couple of days and so I have some work yet to do on adding references , fixing typos , rephrasing , etc .
This will be a stable document after the first week .
UPDATE ( 2009 - 10-03 ) : OK , it ’s been a couple of days , so I ’m closing out the post and adding a jump .
I ’ll continue to update links inside as I round out my reactions to the papers .
What 's the big deal ?
If you want a basic description of the facts , here they are .
Today ’s series of papers is basically unprecedented in paleoanthropology .
There are eleven papers in total , giving comprehensive coverage of the anatomy , paleoenvironment , and evolutionary interpretation of a new skeleton of Ardipithecus ramidus and dental remains representing more than 30 additional individuals .
They have been published simultaneously in a coordinated effort including excavation , faunal correlation , microscopy , palynology , CT - scanning , three - dimensional reconstruction , isotopic analysis , and lord knows what else .
It ’s the closest thing we ’ll ever see to a big science effort in the little field of human evolution — like Tim White was building a supercollider under everybody ’s noses .
The skeleton has been nicknamed , “ Ardi ” and it is 4.4 million years old .
The site is Aramis , Ethiopia , in the Middle Awash field research area .
The skeleton includes most of both arms , except the humeri , both hands , both feet , the right leg , the left ox coxa and part of the right ilium , a bit of sacrum , a couple of vertebrae , and a near - complete skull and dentition .
It ’s a bit more complete than Lucy , although preserving different parts .
The skull and pelvis were badly crushed , both of these were given CT - assisted reconstructions which are presented in separate papers ( Suwa et al. , 2009 ; Lovejoy et al. , 2009c ) .
Additionally , the series includes three papers on the paleoenvironment , a complete description of the dentition , and separate papers on the forelimbs and feet .
The central paper in the series , by White and colleagues 2009b , is accompanied by a summary paper by Lovejoy examining the human - chimpanzee common ancestor in light of Ardipithecus .
As one of the papers puts it ( White et al. , 2009 b ) , it represents a previously - unknown “ adaptive plateau ” for the hominins .
Considering that really only three such “ adaptive plateaux ” were known before this – roughly , australopithecines , robust australopithecines , and humans – that gives some impression of the amount of difference evident in these remains from later hominins .
As I ’ll describe , some substantial ambiguities and questions remain , which will no doubt shape the progress of paleoanthropology for many years to come .
Why did it take so long ?
White and colleagues 2009 b give a detailed overview of the state of preservation of the skeleton
The bony remains of this individual ( ARA - VP - 6/500 ) ( Fig. 3 ) ( 37 ) are off - white in color and very poorly fossilized .
Smaller elements ( hand and foot bones and teeth ) are mostly undistorted , but all larger limb bones are variably crushed .
In the field , the fossils were so soft that they would crumble when touched .
They were rescued as follows : Exposure by dental pick , bamboo , and porcupine quill probe was followed by in situ consolidation .
We dampened the encasing sediment to prevent desiccation and further disintegration of the fossils during excavation .
Each of the subspecimens required multiple coats of consolidant , followed by extraction in plaster and aluminum foil jackets , then additional consolidant before transport to Addis Ababa .
Still , it ’s possible to overstate this explanation .
Bad preservation of remains is not uncommon in archaeological contexts .
In this case extreme care was obviously warranted .
But just as important may have been the opportunity to interpret and guide the reconstruction of the fossil using CT scanning and other technological enhancements .
To me , that is the central message of today ’s announcement and papers .
The big science version of paleoanthropology is one that brings an interdisciplinary and technological approach to fossil remains right from the very start .
Coordinating such an extensive interpretive project requires time – in this case , fifteen years .
I can see a shiny nugget of goodness in that depressing span of time .
The initial publication of the distorted Sahelanthropus skull led to substantial disagreement about the anatomy of the skeleton .
Later CT reconstruction appeared to clarify some aspects of the anatomy .
Arguably , it would have been better to delay publication until the CT reconstruction could be done .
Obviously
White and his team wanted to minimize the opportunity for error in their interpretations .
They ’ve covered their bases .
But that example also shows the danger of the wait - and - see approach , in that it tends to silence skeptical inquiry .
Are there morphological details of the Ardipithecus skeleton that are obscured rather than clarified by reconstruction ?
At the moment , we do n’t know .
What was the story before today ?
Back in the Cold War , CIA analysts and other folks would read carefully through Pravda and other Soviet publications , parsing every word to look for the barest hint of the Politburo ’s intentions .
There was a word for those people : “ Kremlinologists . ”
It seems to me that somebody quoted in Ann Gibbons ’ book , The First Human said that paleoanthropologists basically do the same thing with Ardipithecus – poring through every publication or interview , looking for hints about the fossils hidden from the field for fifteen years .
I do n’t remember right now who , and I do n’t have the book in front of me ( I reviewed the book here in 2006 ) .
On the other hand , there are people who follow every Twitter about their favorite celebrity , recording the GPS coordinates of sightings , and “ running into ” them at the openings of exclusive clubs .
There ’s a word for these people , too : “ stalkers . ”
Paleoanthropologists for the last fifteen years have been a little bit of both .
It ’s hard to help it – Tim White let slip ten years ago that the skeleton ’s locomotor style was like something out of the Star Wars cantina and , well , let ’s just say that some people hear his voice and think of Weird Al Yankovic .
If you were n’t following paleoanthropology in 1994 , you may not remember Ardipithecus at all .
For a brief , shining moment , it was the earliest hominin .
Well , except for the Lothagam mandible , but nobody ever seems to remember Lothagam .
It does n’t even show up in the current series of papers .
Then , the species fell under a veil of secrecy .
The initial find was from a locality called Aramis , within the Middle Awash field concession worked by Berkeley paleoanthropologist Tim White and colleagues .
The news escaped that further fossils from Aramis had been found , including a partial skeleton .
After initial examination of the skeleton , White and colleagues ( 1995 ) </em > submitted a brief comment to Nature in which they changed the genus name of the first specimens .
Instead of Australopithecus ramidus , they would henceforth be Ardipithecus ramidus .
After that , silence .
Research at other localities in the Middle Awash uncovered earlier remains , which Haile - Selassie and colleagues 2001 ; 2004 attributed to a new species of Ardipithecus , Ar. kadabba .
These were never the earliest hominins ( predated at their initial discovery by Orrorin and later by Sahelanthropus , but at 5.5 million years old they were not far off .
In their 2004 paper , Haile - Selassie and colleagues even suggested that all of these terminal Miocene hominins actually represent variations of a single species .
An unstated implication is that the species would then be called Ardipithecus tugenensis .
Sileshi Semaw and the Gona Research Project 2005 found Ardipithecus downriver from Aramis , at a locality called As Duma .
This represented approximately the same age as the Aramis horizons , and showed that Ardipithecus ramidus at Aramis was not just a one - off .
But the remains were only a few fragments .
Based on the paleoecology of the immediate find , they suggested that the species had lived in a “ mosaic ” of environments , bringing together elements of the fauna from both woodland , wetland and grassy woodland facies .
That interpretation becomes a point of contention in the current series of research articles .
Other hints about Ardipithecus morphology have been dropped over the years .
In a key 1999 paper , Owen Lovejoy along with Martin Cohn and Tim White described the Ardipithecus pelvis .
They did n’t show it or say it was Ardipithecus , but there it was nonetheless .
The interpretations of tooth size in the other , more fragmentary Ardipithecus remains ( referred to as “ relatively small ” ) made the body size of the skeleton fairly clear , which enabled interpretation of an radius earlier found at Aramis as a relatively long forelimb .
And so on , the main conclusions have been foreshadowed elsewhere .
One thing in the new papers stood out as a surprise that had not been foreshadowed by earlier hints .
Ardipithecus had a grasping foot .
Did _Ardipithecus_ really have a grasping foot ?
Short answer : Yes .
Ardipithecus ramidus foot CT reconstruction
The paper about the foot remains , by Lovejoy and colleagues 2009a , is full of just the kind of impenetrable prose you ’d expect for a paper about foot remains .
I have a lot of affection for people who know feet , but all the “ fulcrumating ” has me fulminating .
If we hack through the verbiage , the feet send a clear message :
Several elements of the Ardipithecus ramidus foot are preserved , primarily in the ARA - VP - 6/500 partial skeleton .
The foot has a widely abducent hallux , which was not propulsive during terrestrial bipedality .
However , it lacks the highly derived tarsometatarsal laxity and inversion in extant African apes that provide maximum conformity to substrates during vertical climbing .
Instead , it exhibits primitive characters that maintain plantar rigidity from foot - flat through toe - off , reminiscent of some Miocene apes and Old World monkeys .
Moreover , the action of the fibularis longus muscle was more like its homolog in Old World monkeys than in African apes .
Phalangeal lengths were most similar to those of Gorilla .
The Ardipithecus gait pattern would thus have been unique among known primates .
The last common ancestor of hominids and chimpanzees was therefore a careful climber that retained adaptations to above - branch plantigrady .
“ Unique among primates . ” I hate it when they say that .
From the point of view of a foot specialist , this foot has many interesting aspect that can illuminate the evolution of stance and locomotor behavior in Miocene apes and the ancestors of the hominins .
From an Anthro 101 point of view , it ’s an ape foot .
Still , Lovejoy and colleagues 2009a ; 2009 b describe the anatomy of the Ardipithecus foot as clearly different from Australopithecus , but different from chimpanzees also .
The confusing thing is that it is n’t intermediate between those two forms .
In their account , chimpanzee feet are specialized for more grasping , while the Ardipithecus foot retained a more generalized form .
The confusion comes from parallelism in apes after Proconsul , which left Ardipithecus resembling monkeys more than apes in certain aspects of its foot anatomy , but more recent apes more than early apes in others .
The metatarsus of Ar. ramidus , chimpanzees , and gorillas presents a striking contrast to their metacarpus .
Like the foot phalanges , the metatarsals also appear to have been universally shortened in all hominoids subsequent to Proconsul .
The basis of this universal shortening , however , is somewhat unclear , because tarsal evolution contrasts dramatically in hominids and African apes .
The modern ape foot has obviously experienced functional reorganization into a more hand - like grasping organ .
The Ar. ramidus foot did not .
This suggests that substantial elements of a more lever - based , propulsive structure seen in taxa such as Proconsul and Old World Monkeys [ robust plantar aponeurosis ; retained quadratus plantae ; robust peroneal complex ] were preserved in the GLCA / CLCA .
These structures were sacrificed in both African ape clades to enhance pedal grasping for vertical climbing ( Lovejoy et al. , 2009 b , 102 )
That may be all I want to say about the foot for now .
You can see that this is one of the most important anatomical aspects of the specimen in terms of understanding the origins of bipedality .
Ardipithecus was not an obligate biped in any sense applied to Australopithecus .
###OK , it was n’t a biped , then .
So how do you explain the pelvis ?
The pelvis of Ardipithecus , as reconstructed by Lovejoy and colleagues 2009c , is intermediate between the chimpanzee and australopithecine morphology .
In particular , the blade of the ilium is short and relatively curved compared to the long , flat chimpanzee ilium .
But it does not approach the pelvis of Lucy or Sts 14 in those aspects , and the ischium is very chimpanzee - like in shape .
The pubic symphysis was shorter than the long chimpanzee morphology , and the auricular surfaces appear consistent with a relatively shorter sacrum than in chimpanzees .
In reconstruction , it looks like a blend of hominin - like and chimpanzee - like anatomies .
Lovejoy and colleagues further argue that the proximal femur indicates that a somewhat humanlike gluteus maximus insertion was in fact primitive for apes , with chimpanzees and gorillas having a derived non-humanlike form .
So what does this mean for locomotion ?
In their description ( Lovejoy et al. , 2009 b ) , the African ape pelvic morphology is derived as a way of stiffening the lower back , in coordination with shortening the lumbar spine .
If the African ape gluteal morphology is also derived ( are you counting parallelisms yet ? ) , then neither the ilium nor the proximal femur ( excepting the possibility of bone distribution data not observable in Ardi ) are useful markers of bipedality .
In other words , even though the Ardipithecus pelvis may look intermediate between chimpanzee and australopithecine morphologies , it ’s not indicative of bipedality .
Ardipithecus might have the locomotor morphology of the human - chimpanzee common ancestor .
To me , that seems shocking .
More on this later .
What was _ Ardipithecus_ ' environment like ?
The Middle Awash field team was able to do a very interesting thing in its paleoenvironmental reconstructions .
The layer at Aramis containing the Ardipithecus skeleton and other remains is essentially a 3 to 5 meter thick series of paleosol , alluvial silt and fossilized bone and wood of various kinds .
It is underlain by a glassy tuff and above by a basaltic tuff , which presumably represents some kind of pyroclastic event that swept through the area .
The two tuffs are statistically indistinguishable in age , and the team guesses that the time between them represents something like a thousand years , maybe an order of magnitude more or less .
So what they have is a thin sandwich of paleoenvironments , spread over the extent that the twin tuffs cover .
Now , this sandwich outcrops across roughly 9 km of linear distance ( White et al. , 2009 b ) .
So the team could sample distinct localities across this entire transect .
What they found was that the line represented a range of habitats from open and grassy at one end to closed and wooded for ( most ) of the rest .
They found Ardipithecus exclusively in associated with the wooded environment – complete with fossil wood , lots of monkeys and tragelaphines .
They found no Ardipithecus at all in the localities representing more open environments .
White and colleagues 2009a argue that this is a very strong test of habitat preference for Ardipithecus — it liked the trees .
Several aspects of Lower Aramis Member larger mammal assemblage abundance data constitute strong indicators of ancient biofacies and biotope .
The locality - specific subassemblages are remarkably consistent in their taphonomy and taxonomy across the 7 km distance from the easternmost ( SAG - VP - 7 ) to westernmost ( KUS - VP - 2 ) Ar. ramidus localities .
Contemporaneous localities between the two tuffs farther south of the modern Sagantole drainage ( SAG - VP - 1 and - 3 , at the southeastern paleotransect pole ) are relatively impoverished .
They lack this diverse and abundant mammal assemblage and contain no tragelaphines , no monkeys , no fossil wood or seeds , no birds , no micromammals , and no Ardipithecus ( table S1 ) .
Complementary structural , taphonomic , and isotopic data from localities on this pole of the paleotransect suggest a more open landscape that supported more crocodilians , turtles , and hippopotamids , presumably associated with water - marginal settings more axial in the drainage basin ( White et al. , 2009a ) .
That reconstruction makes sense with the locomotor anatomy .
It also makes sense with the isotopic data on diet .
After sampling carbon and oxygen stable isotopes in five Ardipithecus individuals , they conclude that it had a C4 plant consumption much less than later australopithecines , while higher than the very minimal value in chimpanzees , and that it habitually lived in mesic ( not too wet , not too dry ) habitat .
What does _Ardipithecus_ tell us about hominin origins ?
The paper by Owen Lovejoy , “ Reexamining human origins in light of Ardipithecus ramidus ” is possibly the most interesting in the collection .
It will take me some more reflection to figure out what I think about the whole paper , but here I can abstract out the main ideas .
Much of the paper is speculative , concerning the “ reproductive biology ” of the human - chimpanzee common ancestor .
In this paper , Lovejoy uses the acronym CLCA for “ chimpanzee last common ancestor , ” which I find totally confusing .
Since this is so close in time to the human - gorilla common ancestor , I ’ll just take advantage of the new taxonomic scheme and call these ancestors the “ stem hominines . ”
Lovejoy ’s interest in reproductive biology is longstanding , as it formed the centerpiece of his 1981 article on human origins .
In many ways , this current article is an update of that one , because they arrive at the same singular focus : the association of canine reduction with increasing bipedality .
Canines , in Lovejoy ’s description , are principally a function of mating biology , and so any indirect evidence we have about the evolution of mating systems in humans or chimpanzees becomes very relevant to the factors that caused hominin origins .
Ardipithecus clearly shows that the canine reduction came first , bipedality later .
Lovejoy integrates this fact into his earlier model , that the change in mating biology caused the change in locomotor strategy , as males substituted provisioning and food sharing as modes of mating competition in the place of aggression .
However , I think this is short - sighted .
We already know that some degree of canine reduction occurred in several Miocene ape lineages , and that mating competition is highly variable among living apes and primates generally .
What Ardipithecus shows , if we assume a connection between it and earlier candidate hominins like Sahelanthropus and Orrorin , is that the reduction of the canines preceded the evolution of effective bipedality by more than three million years .
It is very difficult to conceive of mating biology as a cause of the locomotor evolution , when it is so removed from the change in time .
It ’s as if we stubbornly insisted that bipedality was the cause of stone tool transport .
The most interesting part of this paper is what Lovejoy says about the relevance of chimpanzees .
This was also anticipated in an earlier paper , this one by Sayers and Lovejoy 2008 , which argued that a chimpanzee model is too restrictive as a way of understanding the initial biology of hominin ancestors .
Here , Lovejoy makes that view explicit in terms of the arboreality of Ardipithecus :
The primitive nature of the craniodental and postcranial anatomies of Ar. ramidus suggest that the CLCA , unlike African apes , was predominantly arboreal .
However , all of its descendants have since developed relatively sophisticated adaptations to terrestrial locomotion .
What was the CLCA 's socio - reproductive structure before these events ?
Whereas African apes ahve , in the past , almost invariably been selected as CLCA vicars [ stand - ins ] , Ar. ramidus now allows us to infer that they have undergone far too many pronounced and divergent specializations to occupy such a role ( Lovejoy , 2009 , 74e4 ) .
Lovejoy and colleagues discuss this concept in more detail in the paper outlining the Ardipithecus postcrania ( Lovejoy et al. , 2009 b ) .
I will be spending much more time on this paper , which makes several provocative assertions about developmental biology .
But the conclusion of the paper
Ar. ramidus implies that African apes are adaptive cul - de - sacs rather than stages in human emergence .
It also reveals an unanticipated and distinct locomotor bauplan for our last common ancestors with African apes , one based on careful climbing unpreserved in any extant form .... Ardipithecus has thus illuminated not only our own ancestry , but also that of our closest living relatives .
It therefore serves as further confirmation of Darwin 's prescience : that we are only one terminal twig in the tree of life , and that our own fossil record will provide revealing and unexpected insights into the evolutionary emergence not only of ourselves , but also of our closest neighbors in its crown ( Lovejoy et al. , 2009b , 105 –106 ) .
OK , I do n’t remember Darwin saying anything about the neighbors in our crown .
But you get the point – the stem hominines were n’t like chimpanzees or gorillas .
What about the skull ?
Gen Suwa headed the cranial reconstruction ( Suwa et al. , 2009 ) .
Most of Ardi ’s skull is represented on one side or the other , except for the basicranium .
The team did have the temporal bones from another specimen , ARA - VP - 1/500 ( previously described by White and colleagues , 1994 ) .
These temporal bones were too big to fit together with Ardi ’s skull , so they digitally shrank them , sort of like reducing them on a photocopier .
First of all , they did a really cool thing – they reconstructed the spatial relation of the two temporal bones by aligning the semicircular canals .
Those tiny structures of the inner ear are like a miniature three - dimensional coordinate frame .
They are part of the vestibular system that senses the position of the head .
I ’m sure they ’re not the first to do that , but it ’s pretty neat to be able to align two temporal bones with no contact points between them .
I mention that because their reconstruction of the temporals determines the position of the line between the carotid canals on the base of the skull – the bicarotid line .
This element of anatomy was very important in our consideration of Sahelanthropus ( Wolpoff et al. 2006 < / em > ) , as the measure between the bicarotid line and basion was a key indicator of the position of the foramen magnum .
Jim
Ahern found that this distance actually overlaps substantially between humans and chimpanzees , and most australopithecine crania actually fall into the chimpanzee range .
That makes the trait questionable as an indicator of habitual head posture .
Here , Suwa and colleagues found that the basion - bicarotid distance in Ardipithecus is as low as seen in the lowest known australopithecine cranium .
Suwa and colleagues advance an old hypothesis for this basicranial form .
It ’s not about upright posture , it ’s about the brain .
The _Sahelanthropus_ and _Ardipithecus_ crania securely associate a relatively short basicranium with small cranial capacity .
The hominid basicranial pattern and associated morphologies [ such as foramen magnum orientation ] are widely held to be related to bipedality and upright posture , despite a lack of empirical evidence to clearly support a functionally based correlation .
The Ar. ramidus cranium raises the alternative possibility that early hominid creanial base flexion was associated with neural reorganization that was already present in _Sahelanthropus_ / _Ardipithecus_ , as suggested for Pliocene _Australopithecus_ .
Such a hypothetical supposition is in part testable by both future fossil finds and by anticipated advances in our understanding of genomic expression patterns pertaining to brain function , structure , and morphogenesis ( Suwa et al. , 2009 , 68e6 ) .
I say , “ old ” because that was Raymond Dart ’s interpretation of the Taung endocast — it was humanlike because of a neural reorganization .
Are they right ?
I ’ll say this : if the basicranium does not reflect posture in these fossils , then there is no compelling evidence for posture at all .
If brain reorganization was underway in these ancient species , there ’s no indication of it in the size of the brain .
Ardi , like Touma , had a small brain — they estimate only 300–350 ml for its endocranial volume .
The rear of the skull – the nuchal plane of the occipital bone – was not preserved , so the most important remaining comparison with Sahelanthropus is the supraorbital region .
This is small in Ardi , and extremely large and thick in Touma .
Suwa and colleagues propose that this morphology matches the assessment of female sex for Ardi , which seems entirely reasonable .
In the context of later Australopithecus , Ardi ’s supraorbital torus might even be large for a female of its size .
The difference between Ardi and Touma in browridge size would be surprisingly large considering the relatively slight difference in size between the two skulls .
Still , with only two specimens to compare , a species with very large browridges in males might show this kind of difference on occasion .
Why do n't any of the papers have a cladogram ?
This is an interesting omission , no ?
There ’s no cladogram .
What we get is this weird phylogenetic diagram that looks like a sectioned spinal cord :
If we could find a way to repair it , Homo would regain feeling .
Setting aside the aesthetics — which I ’m sure were a lot of work — this set of scenarios is very unsatisfying .
In all three , some version of Ardipithecus is the stem for later hominins .
They have n’t shown that at all .
None of the scenarios include chimpanzees or gorillas — yet no matter what you think about genetic estimates of divergence , the stem hominines were large and diverse populations with long - term interactions .
Maybe these stopped before 6 million years ago , but none of the genetic data suggest that now at all .
Cladograms would oversimplify some aspects that should be considered complex , but maybe we could have one ?
White and colleagues 2009 b give a long table of “ derived ” characters in Ardipithecus and Australopithecus , but they are “ derived ” only with reference to their inferred state in the human - chimpanzee LCA .
But elsewhere in these papers , they argue that some of these “ derived ” characters are actually primitive morphologies for apes , for which chimpanzees are independently derived .
For many of the dental features , if we supposed a Miocene ape ancestor , the broadened mandibular body , thicker enamel and so on would look primitive , not derived .
In the table , they list upper and lower canine traits separately , and break them up into six or more for each .
That ’s a quick way of making one morphological change look like twelve or more instances of independent evolution .
Talk about atomizing traits !
So I wonder if a real cladistic analysis might not place Ardipithecus with the australopithecines .
Especially if it included a proper sampling of Miocene ape taxa .
Maybe worse , a real cladistic analysis that did place Ardi with Australopithecus would probably put the earlier Ardipithecus kadabba as an outgroup to both .
That would make Ardipithecus paraphyletic .
I would n’t typically care , because I do n’t think taxonomic rules should direct the science .
But it does seem like a delicious taxonomic dilemma .
The likely solution would be to lump Ar. kadabba with either Orrorin or Sahelanthropus , or both .
Orrorin kadabba would have priority .
But if one were feeling saucy , she could publish the cladistic analysis on the teeth , point out the dilemma , and then offer a novel genus name for the Kadabba sample .
Maybe somebody ’s already thought of that .
There are a lot of journals out there .

And the remainder of the Senate , and the vast majority of House members who do care are hanging on to the shreds of a hope that they can make this whole mess just a little bit better , even if just for a sliver of the population .
The alternative , of course , is for progressives to be just as willing as the ConservaDems to blow this thing up .
Sherrod Brown says he 's still committed to the public option , and that it will be difficult to maintain the support of progressive Senators if this gets watered down any further .
Two of his progressive colleagues agree .
" I strongly suspect that there are a number of senators , including myself , who would not support final passage without a strong public option , " he said .
Not supporting final passage , however , is different than vowing to filibuster it and prevent it from even getting to a vote on final passage , as independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut is now doing , hoping to strip the public option .
But Sen. Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) said on Saturday night that if the bill bends toward the conservatives , " You 'll lose people on the left . "
One of those could be Roland Burris ( D - Ill. ) , who said Saturday he 'd oppose any bill without a public option .
" I wo n't vote for it , " he said .
Not to mention a very large bloc of Democrats in the House , who would have a hard time holding their noses to vote for an opt - out public option , much less the latest iteration that seems to be in vogue , Carper 's triggered co-ops .
The most obvious solution is to break the bill up into two , pass the insurance reforms through regular procedure and the public option and other financial pieces through reconciliation .
Schumer was all for it as recently as September .
It 's ridiculous to take it off the table now , both because of how critical it is to do this bill right , and because if the ConservaDems get their way on this , they will hold the leadership hostage on every damned bill down the line .
That includes a potential second stimulus , a strong jobs package , any kind of meaningful financial reform .
It would also mean a Democratic party that 's no better than the Republicans when it comes to prioritizing Main Street over Wall Street , and grim prospects for 2010 and 2012 .
SPIEGEL Interview with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ' Oil and Gas Is Our Drug '
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev talks to SPIEGEL about how the fall of the Berlin Wall affected Russia , his controversial relationship to Vladmir Putin and possible sanctions against Iran .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Current oil prices are the result of financial market gyrations and do not reflect the supply - demand dynamics of the physical market , energy consultant and prize - winning author Daniel Yergin said on Monday .
Crude oil benchmarks are holding near $ 80 a barrel , having doubled from under $ 40 at the end of last year , after plunging during the financial crisis from all - time highs .
But bulging inventories are keeping gains in check .
“ Oil prices today do not reflect the world ’s supply and demand fundamentals .
Instead , prices are reflective of the weak dollar and expectations of a strong economic recovery , ” Yergin told reporters on the sidelines of a conference .
On Monday , oil clawed back some of last week ’s 1.4 percent losses to above $ 77 a barrel , driven up by a weaker dollar and improved sentiment over the economic outlook .
< O/R >
U.S. crude rose to its highest this year at $ 82 on October 21 and rebounded nearly 73 percent so far this year , also helped by rallying equity markets .
It turned positive on a rolling 12 - month basis in the middle of last month for the first time since October 2008 , raising the risk of commodity - led inflation .
“ We ’re going to see this interplay between oil as a physical commodity and oil as a financial instrument , ” said Yergin who bagged the Pulitzer Prize for “ The Prize : An Epic Quest for Oil , Money and Power , ” an 800 - page history of the global oil industry .
But further upside for oil could be limited , with U.S. data pointing to a choppy recovery , and crude inventories standing near multi-year highs in the United States , the world ’s top energy consumer .
< EIA/S >
Supply - demand fundamentals will direct the market at some point , Yergin said , a slight shift from his view in July when he said that such physical factors are beginning to reassert themselves again , after economic optimism pushed oil steadily higher in the first half of the year .
“ The only two real characters that count are supply and demand .
It might take a long time for these to make their voices heard .
But they will win at the end of the day . ”
Diesel and heating fuel in floating storages have risen this year to unprecedented levels as the global recession hammered demand , with hopes resting on a harsh winter in the West to help draw down the glut .
“ The impact on high storage levels will be felt coming out of the winter , ” Yergin said , but declined to forecast how long the glut would linger .
Ship brokers ICAP estimated that oil products now stored in floating vessels have risen to 90.3 million barrels , up nearly 15 million barrels from a previous estimate at end -October , and might rise by another 6.5 million barrels by year - end .
Nouriel Roubini , an economist noted for his early warning that the United States was headed for a housing bust and oil shock , said earlier this month that oil ’s jump to $ 80 was unjustified , and a run to $ 100 might cause economic stress the way record highs near $ 150 did last year .
Australian journalist Andrew Bolt has a succinct bit of advice to scientists about the ClimateGate scandal :
Climategate : a word of advice to the scientists
The tide is turning .
and fast .
There will soon be an accounting – and the mood and the money for it .
The reputation of science – and of many scientists – will be damaged severely .
Until now those scientists who knew the science behind global warming theory was weak or flawed largely kept their doubts to themselves , out of fear or other forms of self - interest .
I ’ve had the emails from some confessing to just that .
But self - interest should dictate they now make a stand .
They need to show , for their own sake and for the sake of science , that they were on the right side of this debate , even if belatedly .
Already I see some speaking –one even writing a book –who did not speak two years ago .
There must be more now , to halt this madness before even more harm is done .
A decade from now , when scientists and the public look back at this extraordinary scandal , this great fit of collective madness , the question will be asked : on which side were you ?
Now is the time to make sure you can answer with pride .
Speak up .
Reveal .
Undo the damage .
Bolt is right about this : there will be an accounting for this fraud .
People are very very angry , and while the skeptics whose darkest doubts have been vindicated do n’t pull the levers of organized science ( the frauds do that ) , there are some financial and political resources available to the skeptics who have been demanding integrity in science , and they understand now that this is war .
A cabal of leading scientists , politicians , and media concubines have conspired to lie about global warming .
The reasons are obvious : power and money .
The illusion of planetary crisis serves as vehicle for ’ emergency measures to save the planet ’ , which are merely measures to empower and enrich an elite few .
Al Gore , carbon - credit entrepreneur who puts his ‘ mouth where his money is ’ , had it figured out a decade ago .
The fraudulent scientists who suckle off the 7 billion dollars spent this year alone on the global warming scam ( more than the U.S. spends annually on cancer research and AIDS research ) are merely using science , rather than hedge funds , to enrich themselves .
Dr. Philip Jones , the chief of the Climate Research Unit in England who figures so prominently in the fraud revealed in the emails , has personally obtained 25 million dollars in research grants , mostly public money .
As those who are reasonably acquainted with peer review and the “ inside ” perspective of a particular discipline of science will ( privately ) attest , even scientists who abjure from outright fraud often produce work that is at best insipid , and is more often than not aimed at securing funding irrespective of genuine scientific merit .
A lot of published science , when not actually fraudulent , is more a peer - reviewed grant application than cutting edge research .
I ’m not sure that the scientific community can or will respond to this debacle in a courageous or ethical way .
The ID - Darwinism debate clearly demonstrates that venality and shameless self - interest , as well as a toxic leftist - atheist ideology , runs very deep in the scientific community .
Science surely provides much benefit to mankind , but we may need to pursue scientific truth with a different set of scientists than the ones we have now .
Surely many many scientists knew of the frauds so clearly documented in the ClimateGate scandal ; where were the august scientific organizations –the Royal Academy , the UN ’s IPCC , the National Academy of Sciences , the American Association for the Advancement of Science–while this fraud was growing and gaining power .
The obvious truth is that these citadels of organized science were part of the fraud , or at least acquiescent in it .
Several of the admitted ClimateGate fraudsters were in senior positions in these organizations .
We are on the verge of reorganizing our lives , our governments , and our economies on the basis of massive transparent scientific fraud .
We may be able to avert more damage ; I ’m not sure .
The bad guys here have all the influence and most of the money , and they are not hindered by ethics .
What can we do ?
Criminal prosecution of scientists who manipulate data would be a good start .
Scientists who fake data and manipulate peer review to advance their agenda are no different than corporate executives who manipulate stock prices or lawyers who tamper with juries .
Ultimately , perhaps massive defunding of organized science , and a new system of support for research that demands utter transparency and maximal accommodation of debate , may be the only way to defend ourselves from an utterly corrupt scientific elite .
It may well be that the public will be forced to protect itself from organized science , as we now protect ourselves from organized crime .
NEW YORK , United States —
The Baha'i International Community today announced that it has become a partner in a United Nations - sponsored program to promote " generational change " to address climate change and environmental sustainability .
The program , which is co-sponsored by the Alliance of Religions and Conservation ( ARC ) and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , seeks to promote lifestyle changes that will help slow global warming and other environmental problems during a seven - year period from 2010 to 2017 .
" We are very pleased to join with other world religions and with the United Nations in this inspiring initiative to promote lasting change in the way people interact with the environment , " said Tahirih Naylor , a representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations .
" The significance of this effort is the manner in which it capitalizes on the strengths of faith communities – such as their strong grassroots network and the transformative power of religious belief – to address environmental problems at their foundation , which is human behavior .
" One of the long - term goals of the Baha'i Faith is to promote the positive transformation of individuals and communities , and to this end we already sponsor thousands of study circles , children 's classes , devotional gatherings , and youth groups in more than 180 countries .
" We look forward to learning more about the efforts of other faith communities and are confident that we can make a useful contribution to this exciting program , " she said .
Ms. Naylor will join representatives of the world 's other religions next week at Windsor Castle when the ARC / UNDP program is formally launched .
The event , scheduled for 2 - 4 November , will feature a keynote speech by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and will be hosted by HRH The Prince Philip .
More than 200 faith and secular leaders are expected to be present , and many faith groups will announce commitments to practical initiatives , like the Baha 'i plan , to meet global environmental challenges .
Joining Ms. Naylor as a Baha 'i representative to the event will be Arthur Lyon Dahl , a former deputy assistant executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme , an author , and a well - known specialist on coral reefs and biodiversity .
Ms. Naylor noted that the BIC has been a member of ARC since its founding , and has consistently sought to support its program of interfaith conservation efforts .
" The worldwide Baha 'i community has long been involved in promoting sustainable development and in creating small - scale projects that include environmental conservation , " she said .
" And so this initiative is especially exciting because of the way it concretely addresses the underlying attitudes and values that are at the root of many of humanity 's environmental problems . "
Specifically , said Ms. Naylor , Baha 'is around the world will be encouraged to explore the relationship of humans to the environment as articulated in the Baha 'i sacred writings and to take action at the individual and community level .
" In our experience , connecting the hearts of people to sacred writings is the best way to provide the motivation for social change and action , " she said .
" As well , Baha 'is will be encouraged to engage in acts of service related to environmental sustainability . "
At the present time , Ms. Naylor said , many thousands of Baha 'is in virtually every country are engaged in a coherent framework of action that promotes the spiritual development of the individual and channels the collective energies of its members towards service to humanity .
These activities include the systematic study of the Baha 'i writings in small groups in order to build capacity for service ; devotional gatherings aimed at connecting the hearts of participants with the Creator ; neighborhood children 's classes that offer lessons aimed at laying the foundations of a noble and upright character ; and groups that strive to assist young teens to navigate a crucial stage of their lives and become empowered to direct their energies toward the advancement of civilization .
The Baha'i International Community is an international nongovernmental organization that represents the worldwide Baha 'i community , which has some five million members in 100,000 localities spread through virtually every country .
Its members come from nearly every ethnic group , culture , profession , and social or economic background .
ARC is a secular body that helps the major religions of the world to develop their own environmental programs , based on their own core teachings , beliefs and practices .
It was founded in 1995 by Prince Philip .
Its members include 11 major world religions .

Me and Belle de Jour – “ Could it be Brooke ? ”
Let ’s break out of this self - imposed link blogging format for just one post … it ’s not every day the biggest secret you ’ve ever kept gets revealed on the front pages of the national press .
I have an admission to make about Belle de Jour .
It ’s time for me to admit that I solved the puzzle of her identity almost at the very start after she ( as Belle ) sent me the link to her new blog to add to the list of Updated UK Blogs .
Sending the link to me implied somebody who knew quite a lot about how UK blogging worked at the time and I found it hard to believe that an escort that had starting blogging would use me to announce the blog to the world .
Then , after BdJ proceeded to knock the ball out of the park in the blog writing department , I started to seriously consider if it was somebody I knew .
In late 2003 I was well placed to guess Belle ’s identity .
I ’d been blogging myself for three years at that point , I had met many London bloggers and briefly read most of the UK - written blogs during 2000 and 2001 .
UK blogging was ( and still is ) full of young , smart people and anyone of them might have written Belle ’s blog .
I never believed that a professional writer could be BdJ – apparently effortless blog writing takes practice , and required an understanding of a new medium which not many people had at the time .
So I asked myself : which blogger is it ?
A couple of months went past , and after Belle de Jour won the award for Best Written Blog from the Guardian and the whole BdJ phenomenon kicked off , I had my eureka moment – I was sitting on the tube one morning and suddenly thought : ’ Could it be Brooke ? ’
Brooke at the time ran a couple of blogs – A link blog called Methylsalicylate and another science blog called Cosmas .
She also had done a few short , smart pieces of writing online – The Autopsy , What The Dead Remember and one called Malted .
Malted was about whiskey and was the bit of writing that gave it all away .
I remembered reading Malted a few months previously and realised the style and content was reminiscent of Belle ’s and was suddenly convinced I had the answer .
I then spent the first three months of 2004 “ internet stalking ” Brooke Magnanti , collecting together a whole bunch of circumstantial evidence that Brooke was indeed Belle .
I also slowly became aware of the heightened stakes , as Belle became increasingly famous and obviously wanted to maintain her pseudonymity .
For a while I believed that Brooke would get outed immediately – but it turns out the British press could not investigate anything not handed to them on a plate , and were never looking in the right place – the small clique of people who starting blogging in the UK in 2000 / 2001 .
Belle de Jour remained pseudonymous and the mystery remained intact even after two TV series based on her books .
During this time I published a googlewack hidden in my blog – the words “ Belle de Jour ” , “ Brooke Magnanti ” and “ Methylsalicylate ” were published and available in Google ’s index on a single page on the internet – my weblog .
This “ coincidental ” collection of links could in no way reveal Belle ’s identity .
But I wondered if anybody else knew the secret and felt that analysing my web traffic might confirm my strongly - held belief .
If someone googled “ Belle de Jour ” “ Brooke Magnanti ” , I would see it in the search referrers for LinkMachineGo .
I waited five years for somebody to hit that page ( I ’m patient ) .
Two weeks ago I started getting a couple of search requests a day from an IP address at Associated Newspapers ( who publish the Daily Mail ) searching for “ brooke magnanti ” and realised that Belle ’s pseudonymity might be coming to an end .
I contacted Belle via Twitter and let her know what was happening .
I did n’t expect to hear anything back .
And then early last weekend I received an email signed by Brooke that confirmed that she was outing herself in the Sunday Times because the Daily Mail had discovered her identity .
It was finally over , the secret was out .
I no longer have to worry about inadvertently revealing her identity .
If I ’m honest , solving the puzzle of the biggest literary and blogging mystery of the last six years has been fun and exciting .
I ’m just really disappointed I do n’t get to dig up a gold hare as a prize !
One last thing : Good Luck Brooke , I ’m very glad you ’ve managed to maintain some control over how and when your real identity was revealed to the public .
I think I probably owe you a bottle of your favourite whiskey .
Let me know what you like and I ’ll see what I can do .
– Darren / LMG .

Nous avons travaillé avec la Photocabine sur une série de 5 festivals de musique électronique à travers la France .
La qualité du service , la disponibilité ( et sympathie ) de l’équipe , la facilité de mise en place et l’accompagnement en temps réel sont autant de raisons pour lesquelles nous retravaillerons avec eux avec plaisir .
PALERMO , Italy —
Wine , olive oil , pasta , tomato sauce :
For such products , the Sicilian sun is itself a guarantee of quality .
But those who market such delicacies under the label Libera Terra say their products come with a bonus — the “ taste of freedom . ”
“ From lands freed from the Mafia , ” reads the light blue pack of penne rigate pasta on display among dozens of other products in a dedicated shop in Via dei Prefetti 23 , in the heart of Rome .
To understand that label , travel 250 miles as the crow flies south , to Sicily .
A short ride from Palermo a group of young people cultivate about 490 acres of land once owned by some of the most ruthless Mafia bosses .
They belong to an umbrella organization called Libera and are led by Don Luigi Ciotti , a priest who has dedicated his life to the fight against organized crime in southern Italy .
In 1995 , Libera collected 1 million signatures to prompt the Italian parliament to pass a law allowing properties confiscated from convicted mobsters to be used for “ socially useful purposes . ”
With that legal guarantee , in 2001 the 12 partners of the Cooperativa Placido Rizzotto set up their business only a few miles from the infamous town of Corleone — in the heartland of Cosa Nostra , where street signs are riddled with bullet holes .
“ When we first started , nobody from the towns nearby wanted to come and thresh our wheat , ” said the cooperative 's vice chairwoman Francesca Massimino .
“ Cultivating seized land was something unprecedented , and people did n’t want to be seen as working for us .
Eventually , military police had to look up a local contractor and literally force him to come here with his threshing machine to do the job . ”
The cooperative ’s most successful product is a wine label , “ Centopassi ” ( “ One hundred steps ” ) , named after the film about a Sicilian journalist killed by the Mafia .
But the cooperative grows a diverse group of crops , including wheat , melons and lentils .
It is one of five co-ops that sell goods under the Libera Terra ( " free land " ) label , including two others in Sicily , one in Puglia and one in Calabria .
The final products are sold nationwide through fair trade and organic food chains , cooperative supermarkets and three dedicated shops : in Rome , Naples and , since March 12 , 2009 , in Palermo .
“ In the early days , our customers would buy a pack of pasta knowing that perhaps it was n’t top quality , but they still wanted to help , ” said Francesco Galante , spokesman for the cooperative .
“ Now we have reached a stage where all the Libera Terra cooperatives market excellent products :
Our aim is to secure a faithful clientele which will stick to our products because of their quality . ”
Cooperativa Placido Rizzotto also operates an 18th - century vacation rental farmhouse that once belonged to the family of Giovanni Brusca , a ruthless Mafia boss from the nearby village of San Giuseppe Jato .
Brusca , who is now in jail , claimed responsibility for between 100 and 200 murders — he himself was not sure of the number .
Brusca , nicknamed “ the pig ” ( u verru , in Sicilian dialect ) , is best known for one of the most obnoxious crimes ever committed by the Mafia : the 1993 kidnapping and murder of a 13 - year - old child , Giuseppe di Matteo , the son of a former mobster turned state informant .
The teenager was held prisoner for 779 days before eventually being strangled .
His body was dissolved in nitric acid to hide the evidence .
That chilling event jolted Italians ' consciences and marked a turning point .
How could such a vile child - murderer call himself a “ man of honor ” ?
Organized crime in Sicily has definitely lost ground over the last 15 years .
No proper “ boss of bosses ” has yet replaced Bernardo Provenzano , who was captured in 2006 , and a series of successful police operations throughout 2008 culminated in the arrest of about a hundred mafiosi last December .
To add insult to injury , the Neapolitan Camorra has surpassed Cosa Nostra and is now by far the most powerful and feared mob organization in Italy .
Although the initial acts of retaliation against Cooperativa Placido Rizzotto — such as the theft of a tractor that used to belong to former “ boss of bosses ” Toto Riina and the arson of several crops — seem to have ended , its members cannot afford to be completely carefree and relaxed at work .
“ Denying that there is some degree of fear would not be right , ” said Galante , after a pause .
“ Our people go to work in the fields at five o’clock in the morning : they are alone , isolated , and they know all too well who used to own that land . ”
For a high - ranking mafioso , having his property confiscated is worse than being deprived of his personal freedom , Galante explained .
In fact , spending a term in jail can even be a source of prestige , something to brag about , while the seizure of property is the worst possible scenario .
And when local people begin to work on those fields and earn “ clean ” money , that is an indisputable sign that his feudal power has reached an end .
But the real revolution is in attitudes .
A new generation of Sicilians has finally decided to fight those traditions that are the Mafia ’s lifeblood , and break the code of silence , known as omerta .
About 400 businesses in Palermo have joined an organization , “ Addio Pizzo , ” set up in 2004 , whose members refuse to pay protection money .
At the inauguration in November 2008 of the “ Garden of memory , ” a visitors ’ center in and around the farm where di Matteo was held captive before being strangled , Don Luigi Ciotti said : “ I will never forget what I saw when I first came here :
There were toys and small bicycles strewn all over the place .
“ While Giuseppe di Matteo ’s life was coming to an end just a few meters away , his jailers were allowing their own children to play outside in the garden .
People should make a pilgrimage to these places to understand what mafia really stands for , and how far its thirst for power and money , and it despise for human life can reach . ”
With the Libera Terra cooperatives earning a joint turnover of $ 3 million , there is growing evidence that Italians want to avoid the mob and its ways .
Iraq was not " top of the list " of the countries causing concern about weapons of mass destruction prior to the invasion of 2003 , the official inquiry into the war was told today .
On the second day of public hearings , Foreign Office officials said they believed Saddam Hussein 's nuclear programme had been dismantled and they had no evidence he was trying to supply chemical or biological weapons to terrorists .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sir William Ehrman , who was director of international security at the Foreign Office , said ministers had been repeatedly warned that the intelligence on Iraq 's chemical and biological programmes had been " patchy " .
Despite the warnings , however , Tony Blair told the Commons Saddam did have chemical and biological weapons when he made the case for war on the eve of the invasion in March 2003 .
Subsequently , it was found Saddam did not have any weapons of mass destruction , having failed to rebuild his programmes following the first Gulf War .
Sir William listed a series of briefings to ministers which included major caveats about the strength of the intelligence .
In April 2000 the picture was described as " limited to chemical weapons " , in May 2001 the knowledge of WMD and ballistic missile programmes was " patchy " , in March 2002 the intelligence was " sporadic and patchy " .
In August 2002 a briefing noted that " we know very little " about Iraq 's chemical and biological weapons work since late 1998 , and in September 2002 the intelligence " remained limited " .
Just days before the invasion the Government had even received intelligence that Saddam may be unable to use his chemical weapons .

" We did , I think on March 10 , get a report that chemical weapons might have remained disassembled and Saddam had n't yet ordered their assembly , " he said .
" There was also a suggestion that Iraq might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents . "
However Sir William said that it had not made any difference to the case for war over Saddam 's refusal to give up his WMD and co-operate with United Nations inspectors .
" I do n't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had .
It was more about use , " he said .
" From the counter - proliferation point of view it just proved that he had been lying and that he had prohibited items . "
Tim Dowse , who was head of counter - proliferation at the Foreign Office , said that when he took up the post in 2001 Iraq was not seen as the main concern .
" It was n't top of the list , " he said .
" I would say we put Libya and Iran ahead of Iraq . "
He said that Iraq 's nuclear programme was believed to have been dismantled by UN inspectors in the 1990s while the chemical and biological weapons it was thought to possess were not regarded primarily as battlefield weapons .
He said that despite concerns in the United States , there was no evidence that Saddam was prepared to supply chemical or biological weapons to terrorists .
" There had been nothing that looked like a relationship between the Iraqis and al Qaida , " he said .
" In fact , after 9/11 we concluded that Iraq actually stepped further back .
They did not want to be associated with al Qaida .
They were n't natural allies . "
Sir William added : " We never found evidence linking him closely to al Qaida and we did n't believe that he was in any way behind the 9/11 bombings .
" We never found any evidence that chemical or biological material had been passed by the Iraqi regime to terrorists . "
Mr Dowse said that he had originally attached little importance to intelligence claiming the Iraq had weapons it could deploy within 45 minutes , which subsequently featured heavily the Government 's notorious Iraq dossier .
" Speaking personally , when I saw the 45 minutes report , I did not give it particular significance because it did n't seem out of line with what we generally assessed to be Iraq 's intentions and capabilities with regard to chemical weapons , " he said .
He said he took the 45 - minute claim to refer to a multi- barrelled rocket launcher kept ready for deployment by Iraqi forces in the event of conflict .
" It certainly took on a rather iconic status that I do n't think that those of us who saw the initial report really gave - it was n't surprising , " he added .
Sir William said that from summer 2002 - at a time when the political pressure was beginning to build - more intelligence on Iraq had started to come in .
Sir Lawrence Freedman , a member of the inquiry panel , asked : " Did it ever strike you that the extra intelligence coming through in 2002 and might not have been wholly coincidental ? "
Sir William replied : " No . "
He insisted that the Government had never claimed that Iraq represented an immediate security threat .
" We never assessed it as an immediate threat .
We said there was a clear and present threat but we never said there was an immediate threat , " he said .
El próximo 20 de noviembre arrancarán oficialmente los festejos por el centenario de la Revolución Mexicana , que se cumple en 2010 .
¿ Quién le iba a decir al General Cárdenas que serían precisamente los seguidores de Gómez Morín los que encabezarían las celebraciones conmemorativas de la gesta revolucionaria ?
¿Y quién le explica a Gómez Morín que son sus Accionistas quienes tendrán que ensalzar las virtudes de un movimiento de carácter eminentemente socialista y anticlerical ?
Mientras las autoridades federales emanadas de las filas del Partido Acción Nacional tratarán de colocar en el centro de los festejos la figura de don Francisco I. Madero , la población sigue viendo en Emiliano Zapata y Francisco Villa las figuras emblemáticas del movimiento .
¿Y los seguidores de Plutarco Elías Calles ?
Ah ! , con ellos nunca se sabe , parafraseando a ese personaje de la televisión llamado la Chimoltrufia : como dicen una cosa dicen la otra .
Quizá por eso a cien años del inicio del movimiento apenas un poco más de la cuarta parte de la población percibe que son los priistas quienes mejor representan y defienden el ideario revolucionario ¿ Cuántos en las filas del Revolucionario Institucional se atreverían hoy a declararse partidarios de lo colectivo por encima del interés particular , de las organizaciones sociales por encima del individualismo ciudadano ?
Seamos sinceros , a juzgar por los hechos , deben ser pocos los priístas del siglo XXI que realmente profesan la ideología plasmada en los estatutos de su partido .
Pero al margen de partidos políticos e ideologías , siete de cada diez personas consideran que sí hay materia para festejar los logros conseguidos tras la Revolución Mexicana .
Cuando inició el siglo XX éramos una sociedad de analfabetos en la que la inmensa mayoría carecía de lo mínimo , por lo que la esperanza de vida apenas rebasaba los treinta años .
Éramos un país donde las libertades de expresión y asociación no existían ; donde el sufragio efectivo era un sueño ; una nación condenada al autoritarismo y a la injusticia producto de la reelección interminable de autoridades carentes de toda legitimidad .
Cien años después los mexicanos seguimos luchando por conseguir que realmente se cumplan todos los preceptos plasmados en la Constitución de 1917 , pero sin duda tenemos mucho que festejar .
El 2010 se aproxima y las predicciones apocalípticas empiezan a escucharse con mayor frecuencia .
Los problemas económicos , políticos y sociales que estamos viviendo en México parecen apuntar a que el ciclo de - diez - a - diez se puede repetir .
No son pocos - 29 % - quienes están convencidos que en el próximo año habrá un gran movimiento social en nuestro país .
A ellos se suma otro 34 % que opina que hay cierta probabilidad de que eso ocurra , aunque no mucha .
De ninguna manera soy partidaria del destino irreductible , pero no dejo de pensar que debían ser muy pocos los mexicanos que en 1909 sospechaban que , apenas pasaran los festejos por el centenario de la Independencia , México sería el escenario de la primera gran revolución social del siglo XX .
No hace mucho paseando por la Feria del Libro de Madrid cayó en mis manos un ejemplar de " El México de Porfirio Díaz .
Estudio sobre el desenvolvimiento general de la República mexicana " , edición que formó parte de la colección " A través de América " de F. Sempere y Compañía , Editores , con fecha de publicación : octubre de 1910 .
En este libro , en el que el español Julio Sesto estampara como dedicatoria " Pueblos anárquicos : miraos en este espejo " , el autor describe las condiciones , según su muy particular apreciación , de la prensa , el arte , el trabajo , los negocios , la agricultura y las ciencias en el México porfiriano , trabajo que al decir de los editores fue de tal éxito , que la primera edición se agotó a los pocos meses de haber salido .
En el capítulo final de tan solicitada obra y que lleva por título " Algo sobre el general Díaz y el mañana de México " , Sesto afirma , dos meses antes de que estallara la Revolución , que : " ... hoy que se ha dado en preguntar en México hacia dónde vamos , asumiéndose una actividad pesimista que no tiene por qué posesionarse de ella los mexicanos en tan sumo grado ...
No hay , pues , ninguna amenaza para el mañana de México .
La estabilidad económica y la estabilidad de la actitud pasiva del pueblo garantizan la paz en aquella tierra ...
Habrá sencillamente mutaciones de regímenes políticos puramente internos y de fórmula , los que , si se llevan a cabo con prudencia , no comprometerán el orden ...
Hay una gran fuerza de sabiduría comprimida por un grupo de mexicanos ilustres que , cuando sea aplicada , hará marchar al país quizá mejor todavía que hoy . "
Perdone señor Madero / no fui a la Revolución / pa volverme hacendado / y convertirme en patrón Y si acaso no cumplimos / lo que ya se prometió / se irá otra vez a las armas / de nuevo a la rebelión .
Corrido de la entrevista de Zapata y Madero , José Muñoz Cota

The Kingdom of Zeus is different however .
Zeus does n't want your love and worship .
He does n't want your money .
He does n't particularly care about you .
He would rather see the health of the planet restored and , since you caused the problem , he wants or rather , commands , your help in fixing it .
This summer he will be making his presence and his displeasure known to you on a regular basis .

LASHKAR GAH , Afghanistan ( Reuters ) - Angry Afghan villagers protested on Thursday against what they said was the killing of 11 civilians by foreign troops , but local authorities said only fighters were killed .
The NATO - led force said it had fired a rocket from the ground at a group it believed to be planting a roadside bomb in Babaji in Helmand province .
It said it was not aware of any civilians in the area and was investigating the incident .
Civilian casualties caused by Western forces have stoked anger toward foreign troops , which the NATO commander , U.S. army General Stanley McChrystal , says undermines the Western mission .
Some 300 protesters paraded dead bodies of the strike victims on streets of Lashkar Gah , capital of restive southern Helmand province , where 10,000 U.S. Marines and 9,000 British troops have fought the war ’s heaviest battles .
A spokesman for Helmand ’s governor said an air strike had taken place and had killed eight Taliban insurgents .
A press officer for NATO troops said there was no air strike , only a surface - to - surface missile strike .
Demonstrators chanted slogans against the government and the United States .
A Reuters reporter in Lashkar Gah said the dead bodies shown at the demonstration included young male teenagers .
“ Are they Taliban or civilians ? ” asked one demonstrator in tears .
Protesters said the victims were killed in the raid late on Wednesday while working in a wheat field outside the city .
Some women were among the demonstrators , a rarity in conservative southern Afghanistan .
“ Death to the governor , down with the government and the United States , ” said Khan Mohammad , leader of the protesters , who said he had lost four of his nephews in the bombing .
Civilian casualties have been a main source of friction between President Hamid Karzai and the foreign troops led by NATO and the U.S. military in recent years .
McChrystal has issued new orders designed to reduce civilian deaths by placing limits on the use of air power .
Foreign troops often rely on air power for hunting the Taliban , toppled from power by U.S. and Afghan forces in 2001 .
The United Nations says 1,500 civilians were killed in the first seven months of this year .
More than two - thirds were killed by Taliban fighters , and 23 percent were killed by Western and pro-government forces , it says .
The rest could not be attributed .
Coral reef species are facing an escalating danger of extinction as a result of rising temperatures .
Up to one - third of the small animals could be wiped out in the coming years due to warmer ocean waters , increasing acidity in the sea , and the compounding impacts of fishing and pollution , scientists predict .
To help save 83 imperiled coral species in U.S. waters , the Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service to protect them under the federal Endangered Species Act .
" Coral reefs are the world 's most endangered ecosystems and provide an early warning of impacts to come from our thirst for fossil fuels , " Miyoko Sakashita , oceans director for the organization , said in a statement announcing the petition .
" Within a few decades , global warming and ocean acidification threaten to completely unravel magnificent coral reefs that took millions of years to build . "
Up to one - fifth of the world 's coral reefs already have been lost and the threatened species in U.S. waters could be gone by midcentury if steps are not taken , the petition said .
Warmer waters have led to fatal bleaching of coral reefs , while ocean acidification , which occurs from the sea 's absorption of carbon dioxide , prevents reefs from developing protective skeletons .
Elkhorn and staghorn corals in Florida became the first coral species to be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2006 .
Expanding the ESA listings could mean further controls on fishing , dumping , dredging and offshore oil development that could threaten reefs .

" To act means to choose one mode of action out of all possible alternatives . "
Economics is a little - understood branch of knowledge , and despite its ongoing relevance to our everyday lives , it is still regarded as a subject that must be left to specialists .
Modern man could scarcely make a greater error .
The present bust of our most recent worldwide business cycle provides us with a great exposition of the dangers of leaving out analysis according to simple economic laws , in favor of analysis according to highly abstracted models .
Indeed the great delight one may find , and this is a feeling I hope I am able to convey , is that economics should really tell you what you " already know . "
Phillip Wicksteed , a great economist in his own right , named his 1910 book The Common Sense of Political Economy .
I feel it is worth mentioning how I gained any of this knowledge in the first place .
I am not a student of economics .
Indeed , the discipline which I am studying at the University of Birmingham is theoretical physics .
I had an interest in economics at a younger age , mostly because I wondered why my country of birth and early childhood , India , was still underdeveloped after so many decades of independence from British rule .
My search for explanations led me far and wide to come up with some , in retrospect , rather ridiculous assertions .
For a period of time , I even thought that our loss of wealth had something to do with the Queen taking our jewels for her crown !
It was not until I read India Unbound by Gurcharan Das one week when I was about 17 , that I truly gained an appreciation of the impact free markets could have on developing countries .
The experience was life changing , and India Unbound remains today one of only a few books that I can say had a significant impact on my worldview and direction in life .
During the decades following independence , many businessmen , small and big , made the dark joke that once we were free from the British Raj , our country was captured by the new " Licence Raj , " that strangulated investment , development , and private enterprise in India .
When we complain about corruption , we must realise that it is simply a result of the perverse incentives created by draconian laws imposed on entrepreneurs and already - existing businesses .
Indeed , it may sound strange for the reader to hear this , but as long as these laws exist , we should actually hope for more dishonesty and competition in corruption between public servants , not less !
This competition between bureaucrats could lower the price of bribes , improve the quality of service provided in navigating restrictions , and allow for the smoother functioning of business in the midst of India 's strong regulatory atmosphere .
However , my views today actually differ from Mr. Das's , although I greatly respect him as a writer and intellectual .
His book was a stepping stone to my current position .
To cut a long story short , I was following the US presidential campaign in late 2007 , when I came across an obscure Republican politician by the name of Ron Paul .
Watching the Republican debates , I was dumbfounded .
It was the first time I had heard a politician , of all people , make perfect sense .
After viewing and searching for several more clips of Dr. Paul , I came across what is known as the Austrian School of economics .
Within this school I found there were various significant historical figures , like Ludwig von Mises and his Nobel Prize–winning follower , F. A. Hayek .
I also found some great resources , especially Mises.org .
I then had the honour of studying this subject in the summer of 2009 with some of the world 's leading scholars in the field .
The experience I had with my week in the " Mises University " program this year was by far the most stimulating of my life .
So how did I myself join the ranks of these " Austrian " economists ?
The path I took is not a straight - forward one , and it involved a long period of wrestling and trying to reconcile the statements and theorems of a certain book .
That book was Human Action .
It greatly offended and challenged my philosophical presuppositions , and it was a long time before I finally came into agreement , now wholeheartedly , with its author : Ludwig von Mises .
Before reading Mises , I must confess that I was pretty much a run -of - the - mill positivist , though at the time I did not appreciate the full meaning of the term , nor recognise that I was one .
From my state of knowledge , I felt that positivist statements about science were so obvious that only a fool would challenge them .
Thankfully , such a " fool , " called Mises , rose up .
He challenged the statements of these philosophers whose views have become so widespread in scientific discourse that many who are unfamiliar with philosophy take their doctrine as the only valid criterion for science .
I will not enter into a full refutation of positivism here , but instead will simply highlight Mises 's case for a method in the social sciences .
In Human Action , Mises identifies a methodological dichotomy between the social and the natural sciences .
This dichotomy is in how we use teleology and causality to explain different kinds of events .
These two terms are best explained by use of examples .
When we throw a ball , for instance , we do not reason that it is guided in a teleological way by some mystical spirit or " prime mover . "
Instead we use the laws of mechanics and causality to examine the position , velocity , and forces acting on the ball , in order to predict the future position and velocity of the ball .
In the inverse , one does not reason that there is some sort of direct , causal relation between traffic lights turning green , and bodies beginning to cross the road .
These are individuals acting with purpose crossing the road , who , only when the lights turn green , reason that it is safe to cross and then proceed to do so .
The reckless individual who is late for work may rush across the road regardless of what the traffic lights show .
It is this insight — that humans act purposefully , or teleologically — from which Mises deduces his entire system of economics .
To act means to aim at achieving an end via a means .
To act means to choose one mode of action out of all possible alternatives .
Therefore , acting is a demonstration of preference .
Of course , a person may make errors in his judgement , after which he realises that the state of affairs produced by acting in one way actually satisfies him less than some unrealised alternative would have .
This framework of action is amazingly general and can be used to explain all kinds of actions , even those normally considered outside the realm of " economics . "
Indeed the monk who shuns material riches and gives food to another man does so because he values feeding this man more highly than he does feeding himself .
It is this type of subjective analysis that forms the root of good economic inquiry .
" The consumer and his valuations lies at the root of all economic considerations . "
A classic example of the application of subjectivism can be produced if we want to work out the value of a factor of production , for example , land .
For instance , when asked why champagne is so expensive , the classical economists would have said that the businessman has to pay so much for the land in the Champagne region of France that he must subsequently charge a high price for the product he produces from it .
Yet , if people begin to dislike or distrust champagne , perhaps because they feel it causes them ill health , they will begin to value and demand it less with regard to other goods ; hence the market price will have to drop .
Subsequently , the fall in the price of the product will " impute " backwards to the price of the land on which it was produced .
Hence we would see a drop in the price of land in Champagne .
Thus we see that the consumer and his valuations lies at the root of all economic considerations .
It is because we , as consumers , value products for the subjectively defined ends we feel they help us achieve , that they have any value on the market at all .
Although this may seem obvious to the reader — telling you what you " already know " — it relies on one seeing more than what is immediate to the eye .
In essence , perhaps the most elusive entity in the entirety of economics is the market , the very concept at the heart of economic investigations .
" How does Paris get fed ? " asked Bastiat .
The assumption first undertaken in how one could get man to cooperate with man was that authoritarian interference is required to have every specialist serve his fellow citizen .
The shock that economists experienced in their investigations was that the truly anarchic state of society known as the " free market " nevertheless allowed for the coordination of production among different individuals pursuing their own self - interests .
It is this market that truly fed Paris .
It pursued innovations and supplied consumers better than the orders of a centralised government ever could .
We can see the effects of government interference in the world around us if only we open our eyes .
At each instance , government decouples the motion of the entrepreneur from the orders and demands made by the consumer .
The decoupling of consumer time preference from the production ratio of consumer and investment goods , which was brought about by the central bank lowering interest rates , produced an investment boom .
In this boom , businesses wasted resources and money on goods that , ultimately , were not desired by consumers .
This was followed , inevitably , by the current recession .
The lesson ultimately learned , although it is no doubt depressing for those who would like to control the lives of others , is that it is better to not interfere with the functioning of the market economy .
We should simply allow others to pursue their own ends through voluntary contractual relations .
As Mises notes in Human Action , " Observe the functioning of the market system … and you will discover in it … the finger of God . "

General Overview
Espresso Book Machine
I came to Iraq three days after Saddam Hussein fled Baghdad .
It was April 12 , 2003 .
At the time , Iraqis bristled when asked if they were Sunni , Shiite or Kurd .
It made no difference , they said , they were brothers .
And , in the heady aftermath of the war , for a short while it almost seemed true .
That mood seems to be upon the country again , and it is most welcome after the last six years of bloody murders between Shiites and Sunnis ; between Arabs and Kurds ; between Muslims and Christians .
Will it last ?
Or are Americans , as they have been in Kosovo and Bosnia and perhaps now in Afghanistan , turning away from the inconvenient realities of ethnic and religious differences , the depth of animosities , of struggles for power and territory ?
As the country ’s attention turns east to Afghanistan , I , too , have made the journey to Kabul , as my new assignment .
It is tempting to make analogies between the two troubled places , and there are some , but there are at least as many differences .
What are the lessons of Iraq that I carry with me ?
The cultures are as different as mountains and desert , and for outsiders , there is a familiar struggle to see the place as it truly is , not as we might wish it would be .
Back in 2003 , the Americans wanted to believe that an age of brotherhood and integration , loosed by American military might , had come to Iraq .
Many Iraqis wanted to believe it , too .
Thinking too much about the depth of distrust , long latent between sects and ethnicities , would mean acknowledging that a frenzy of violence waited in the wings .
They swept into the desert sands the centuries - long struggle of Sunnis and Shiites for dominance in the fertile river basin between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers .
It was as if officials thought that perhaps by saying they were brothers , they would become them .
Americans wanted to believe that their version of democracy was just waiting to spring to life in Iraq  a peaceful multiethnic , multireligious society adhering to the rule of law .
That longing to find in another country a mirror of ourselves trumped cold analysis and led to years of denial that came to an end only when the mutilated bodies at the Baghdad morgue mounted each day : to 30 , 40 and finally 75 to 100 .
Shiites murdered by Sunnis ; Sunnis murdered by Shiites .
I realized that a sectarian fight was starting to play out in November 2003 , but I had no idea how far it would go .
I should have been the canary in the coal mine  but like so many others around me , I did not want to believe what I saw .
I was working for The Los Angeles Times then ; it would be nearly four years before I would come to this newspaper .

A VIRUS that causes the common cold may be saving people from swine flu .
If this intriguing idea turns out to be true , it would explain why swine flu ’s autumn wave has been slow to take off in some countries and point to new ways to fight flu .
“ It is really surprising that there has not been more pandemic flu activity in many European countries , ” says Arnold Monto , an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor .

In the past , I�ve written several posts right here on this very blog about stuff like the best casino - themed movies and other similar topics .
As you probably know by now , I�m a pretty big gambler with a huge passion for online casinos , and ever since I started this blog I�ve found that while my love for kung - fu movies is still there , my interest in gambling has increased dramatically , which is why you see so many of these articles popping up recently .
Honestly , I was fairly certain that I�d lose the audience I�d gained over the months ( all three of you ) , but surprisingly , judging by your messages , you guys seem to be digging the new direction of the blog , which works out for me quite well !
And yes , of course there�s going to be articles themed around kung - fu movies in the future , that goes without saying !
But for now , let�s take a look at something that I�ve wanted to talk about for a while , namely � blackjack movies !
Now , keep in mind that there aren�t really all that many blackjack movies around , and thus just because I say that they �re the �best blackjack movies � that doesn�t mean that they �re actually great .
Still , I don�t think that any of them are bad , but who knows , you might enjoy them !
All that I�ll ask of you going in is that you don�t expect them to be realistic .
Those movies mostly tend to focus on the spectacle of card counting and what not , so if you �re looking for a scene where one of the characters is scrolling through this top 10 list of the best blackjack sites in the UK then you �re gonna be disappointed !
With that said , let �s get started !
Rain Man ( 1988 ) � I have a very complicated love - hate relationship with this movie , though that has nothing to do with its quality .
It mostly has to do with the portrayal of autistic people , which is �
Well , how should I say it � Inaccurate .
On one hand , the fact that Dustin Hoffman�s character Raymond is explicitly stated to have autism brought a whole lot of attention to the condition , which is one of the reasons why diagnoses of it increased ( no , it�s not because vaccines cause autism , it�s just that psychiatrists are now way better at diagnosing it than they were in the past ) .
But on the other , for the longest time everyone thought that Rain Man was the archetypal autistic person , and that everyone with autism can count cards at a casino and be a blackjack prodigy when obviously that �s simply not true .
Ah well , I can�t hold it against the movie too much , especially considering the fact that it came out almost 30 years ago .
Its message still rings quite clear , after all � accept your friends and family for who they are without judging them for their quirks and oddities .
21 ( 2008 ) �
In many ways , this is the ultimate blackjack movie .
Remember how I told you about unrealistic card counting movies focusing on spectacle ?
Well , that definition applies to � 21 � better than to any other movie on this list !
And the kicker is that it�s actually based on the true story of Jeff Ma , an MIT student who broke numerous blackjack tables alongside his fellow MIT friends with his awesome card counting skills .
And sure , many of the events depicted in � 21 � are heavily exaggerated in order to make for a more entertaining narrative , but who cares , it�s one hell of a ride from beginning to end , especially if you , like me , are a fan of blackjack !
The Gambler ( 2014 ) �
This is one of those extremely rare casino movies that doesn�t use casino as a metaphor for the decadence of the human soul or whatever , nor does it portray it as a rocking place of high - life and good - looking women .
Instead , � The Gambler� deals with a problem that millions of people worldwide also need to deal with � gambling addiction .
Its main character , played by Mark Wahlberg , often spends whatever little cash he has playing blackjack .
The negativity in his life doesn�t inherently come from casino itself � it comes from his persistence to feed his addiction , which range from dealing with loan sharks to taking money from his mother only to spend them on gambling .
And sure , the movie is n�t exactly great ( it only had a score of 55 on Metacritic ) , but my God , it�s one of the most human representations of gambling I�ve ever seen in a movie , and for that alone it�s worth being on this list !
( CNN ) --
An important hydroelectric dam shared by Brazil and Paraguay failed Tuesday night , pushing a large swath of central and southern Brazil into darkness , said the country 's minister of mines and energy , Edison Lobao .
At about 10:30 p.m. ( 7:30 p.m. ET ) , the Itaipu dam shut down completely , Lobao said in a radio interview .
Power began to slowly return Tuesday night , and authorities expected a restoration of power overnight , Lobao said .
An official at Brazil 's National Electric System Operator told CNN that the incident at Itaipu caused an outage of 18,000 megawatts .
The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
The outage was approximately equivalent to the amount of energy needed to power the state of Sao Paulo and its 20 million residents , the official said .
" Everything 's fine , " the official said , adding that as Itaipu rebooted , it would repower the affected regions .
Millions of people were affected by the blackout in six Brazilian states that included the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo .
The capital , Brasilia , was unaffected , CNN en Español reported .
Neighboring Paraguay and Uruguay also reported related blackouts , Lobao said .
Rio's main streets and avenues were in a total blackout .
Video footage showed long lines of cars at a near standstill on the roads , and the subway system in Rio came to a stop .
Itaipu provides more than 20 percent of Brazil 's energy .

Success in Afghanistan is measured in Washington by the ability to create an indigenous army that will battle the Taliban , provide security and stability for Afghan civilians and remain loyal to the puppet government of Hamid Karzai .
A similar task eluded the Red Army , although the Soviets spent a decade attempting to pacify the country .
It eluded the British a century earlier .
And the United States , too , will fail .
American military advisers who work with the Afghan National Army , or ANA , speak of poorly trained and unmotivated Afghan soldiers who have little stomach for military discipline and even less for fighting .
They describe many ANA units as being filled with brigands who terrorize local populations , exacting payments and engaging in intimidation , rape and theft .
They contend that the ANA is riddled with Taliban sympathizers .
And when there are combined American and Afghan operations against the Taliban insurgents , ANA soldiers are fickle and unreliable combatants , the U.S. advisers say .
American military commanders in Afghanistan , rather than pump out statistics about enemy body counts , measure progress by the swelling size of the ANA .
The bigger the ANA , the better we are supposedly doing .
The pressure on trainers to increase the numbers of the ANA means that training and vetting of incoming Afghan recruits is nearly nonexistent .
The process of induction for Afghan soldiers begins at the Kabul Military Training Center .
American instructors at the Kabul center routinely complain of shortages of school supplies such as whiteboards , markers and paper .
They often have to go to markets and pay for these supplies on their own or do without them .
Instructors are pressured to pass all recruits and graduate many who have been absent for a third to half the training time .
Most are inducted into the ANA without having mastered rudimentary military skills .
“ I served the first half of my tour at the Kabul Military Training Center , where I was part of a small team working closely with the ANA to set up the country ’s first officer basic course for newly commissioned Afghan lieutenants , ” a U.S. Army first lieutenant who was deployed last year and who asked not to be identified by name told me .
“ During the second half of my tour , I left Kabul ’s military schoolhouse and was reassigned to an embedded tactical training team , or ETT team , to help stand up a new Afghan logistics battalion in Herat . ”
“ Afghan soldiers leave the KMTC grossly unqualified , ” this lieutenant , who remains on active duty , said .
“ American mentors do what they can to try and fix these problems , but their efforts are blocked by pressure from higher , both in Afghan and American chains of command , to pump out as many soldiers as fast as possible . ”
Afghan soldiers are sent from the Kabul Military Training Center directly to active - duty ANA units .
The units always have American trainers , know as a “ mentoring team , ” attached to them .
The rapid increase in ANA soldiers has outstripped the ability of the American military to provide trained mentoring teams .
The teams , normally comprised of members of the Army Special Forces , are now formed by plucking American soldiers , more or less at random , from units all over Afghanistan .
“ This is how my entire team was selected during the middle of my tour : a random group of people from all over Kabul — Air Force , Navy , Army , active - duty and National Guard — pulled from their previous assignments , thrown together and expected to do a job that none of us were trained in any meaningful way to do , ” the officer said .
“ We are expected , by virtue of time - in - grade and membership in the U.S. military , to be able to train a foreign force in military operations , an extremely irresponsible policy that is ethnocentric at its core and which assumes some sort of natural superiority in which an untrained American soldier has everything to teach the Afghans , but nothing to learn . ”
“ You ’re lucky enough if you had any mentorship training at all , something the Army provides in a limited capacity at pre-mobilization training at Fort Riley , but having none is the norm , ” he said .
“ Soldiers who receive their pre-mobilization training at Fort Bragg learn absolutely nothing about mentoring foreign forces aside from being given a booklet on the subject , and yet soldiers who go through Bragg before being shipped to Afghanistan are just as likely to be assigned to mentoring teams as anyone else . ”
The differences between the Afghan military structure and the American military structure are substantial .
The ANA handles logistics differently .
Its rank structure is not the same .
Its administration uses different military terms .
It rarely works with the aid of computers or basic technology .
The cultural divide leaves most trainers , who do not speak Dari , struggling to figure out how things work in the ANA .
“ The majority of my time spent as a mentor involved trying to understand what the Afghans were doing and how they were expected to do it , and only then could I even begin to advise anyone on the problems they were facing , ” this officer said .
“ In other words , American military advisers are n’t immediately helpful to Afghans .
There is a major learning curve involved that is sometimes never overcome .
Some advisers play a pivotal role , but many have little or no effect as mentors .
” The real purpose of American advisers assigned to ANA units , however , is not ultimately to train Afghans but to function as a liaison between Afghan units and American firepower and logistics .
The ANA is unable to integrate ground units with artillery and air support .
It has no functioning supply system .
It depends on the American military to do basic tasks .
The United States even pays the bulk of ANA salaries .
“ In the unit I was helping to mentor , orders for mission - essential equipment such as five - ton trucks went unfilled for months , and winter clothes came late due to national shortages , ” the officer told me .
“ Many soldiers in the unit had to make do for the first few weeks of Afghanistan ’s winter without jackets or other cold - weather items . ”
But what disturbs advisers most is the widespread corruption within the ANA which has enraged and alienated local Afghans and proved to be a potent recruiting tool for the Taliban .
“ In the Afghan logistics battalion I was embedded with , the commander himself was extorting a local shopkeeper , and his staff routinely stole from the local store , ” the adviser said .
“ In Kabul , on one humanitarian aid mission I was on , we handed out school supplies to children , and in an attempt to lend validity to the ANA we had them [ ANA members ] distribute the supplies .
As it turns out , we received intelligence reports that that very same group of ANA had been extorting money from the villagers under threat of violence .
In essence , we teamed up with well - known criminals and local thugs to distribute aid in the very village they had been terrorizing , and that was the face of American charity . ”
We have pumped billions of dollars into Afghanistan and occupied the country for eight years .
We currently spend some $ 4 billion a month on Afghanistan .
But we are unable to pay for whiteboards and markers for instructors at the Kabul Military Training Center .
Afghan soldiers lack winter jackets .
Kabul is still in ruins .
Unemployment is estimated at about 40 percent .
And Afghanistan is one of the most food - insecure countries on the planet .
What are we doing ?
Where is this money going ?
Look to the civilian contractors .
These contractors dominate the lucrative jobs in Afghanistan .
The American military , along with the ANA , is considered a poor relation .
“ When I arrived in theater , one of the things I was shocked to see was how many civilians were there , ” the U.S. officer said .
“ Americans and foreign nationals from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia were holding jobs in great numbers in Kabul .
There are a ton of corporations in Afghanistan performing labor that was once exclusively in the realm of the military .
If you ’re a [ military ] cook , someone from Kellogg Brown & Root has taken your spot .
If you ’re a logistician or military adviser , someone from MPRI , Military Professional Resources Inc. , will probably take over your job soon .
If you ’re a technician or a mechanic , there are civilians from Harris Corp . and other companies there who are taking over more and more of your responsibilities . ”
“ I deployed with a small unit of about 100 or so military advisers and mentors , ” he went on .
“ When we arrived in Afghanistan , nearly half our unit had to be reassigned because their jobs had been taken over by civilians from MPRI .
It seems that even in a war zone , soldiers are at risk of losing their jobs to outsourcing .
And if you ’re a reservist , the situation is even more unfortunate .
You are torn from your life to serve a yearlong tour of duty away from your civilian job , your friends and family only to end up in Afghanistan with nothing to do because your military duty was passed on to a civilian contractor .
Eventually you are thrown onto a mentoring team somewhere , or some [ other ] responsibility is created for you .
It becomes evident that the corporate presence in Afghanistan has a direct effect on combat operations . ”
The American military has been largely privatized , although Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , has still recommended a 40,000 - troop increase .
The Army ’s basic functions have been outsourced to no-bid contractors .
What was once done by the military with concern for tactical and strategic advancement is done by war profiteers concerned solely about profit .
The aims of the military and the contractors are in conflict .
A scaling down of the war or a withdrawal is viewed by these corporations as bad for business .
But expansion of the war , as many veterans will attest , is only making the situation more precarious .
“ American and Afghan soldiers are putting their lives at risk , Afghan civilians are dying , and yet there ’s this underlying system in place that gains more from keeping all of them in harm ’s way rather than taking them out of it , ” the officer complained .
“ If we bring peace and stability to Afghanistan , we may profit morally , we might make gains for humanity , but moral profits and human gains do not contribute to the bottom line .
Peace and profit are ultimately contradictory forces at work in Afghanistan . ”
The wells that are dug , the schools that are built , the roads that are paved and the food distributed in Afghan villages by the occupation forces are used to obscure the huge profits made by contractors .
Only an estimated 10 percent of the money poured into Afghanistan is used to ameliorate the suffering of Afghan civilians .
The remainder is swallowed by contractors who siphon the money out of Afghanistan and into foreign bank accounts .
This misguided allocation of funds is compounded in Afghanistan because the highest - paying jobs for Afghans go to those who can act as interpreters for the American military and foreign contractors .
The best - educated Afghans are enticed away from Afghan institutions that desperately need their skills and education .
“ It is this system that has broken the logistics of Afghanistan , ” the officer said .
“ It is this system of waste and private profit from public funds that keeps Kabul in ruins .
It is this system that manages to feed Westerners all across the country steak and lobster once a week while an estimated 8.4 million Afghans — the entire population of New York City , the five boroughs — suffer from chronic food insecurity and starvation every day .
When you go to Bagram Air Base , or Camp Phoenix , or Camp Eggers , it ’s clear to see that the problem does not lie in getting supplies into the country .
The question becomes who gets them .
And we wonder why there ’s an insurgency . ”
The problem in Afghanistan is not ultimately a military problem .
It is a political and social problem .
The real threat to stability in Afghanistan is not the Taliban , but widespread hunger and food shortages , crippling poverty , rape , corruption and a staggering rate of unemployment that mounts as foreign companies take jobs away from the local workers and businesses .
The corruption and abuse by the Karzai government and the ANA , along with the presence of foreign contractors , are the central impediments to peace .
The more we empower these forces , the worse the war will become .
The plan to escalate the number of American soldiers and Marines , and to swell the ranks of the Afghan National Army , will not or defeat or pacify the Taliban .
“ What good are a quarter - million well - trained Afghan troops to a nation slipping into famine ? ” the officer asked .
“ What purpose does a strong military serve with a corrupt and inept government in place ?
What hope do we have for peace if the best jobs for the Afghans involve working for the military ?
What is the point of getting rid of the Taliban if it means killing civilians with airstrikes and supporting a government of misogynist warlords and criminals ?
“ We as Americans do not help the Afghans by sending in more troops , by increasing military spending , by adding chaos to disorder , ” he said .
“ What little help we do provide is only useful in the short term and is clearly unsustainable in the face of our own economic crisis .
In the end , no one benefits from this war , not America , not Afghans .
Only the CEOs and executive officers of war - profiteering corporations find satisfactory returns on their investments . ”

Subject : Re : DEATH PARK DEER :
The latest disturbing developments
Jason ,
If I understand correctly you are a self - proclaimed autodidact .
If so , please take the time to educate yourself on who we are and what we do , and not follow the misinformation and ignorance that you are regurgitating .
We euthanized 312 deer in 3 nights while training law enforcement personnel to be able to continue management in the future in the most humane way possible .
There were no crippled deer and all were shot in the brain .
The meat processor and State biologist can verify this because they saw every carcass , and they have no reason to lie about their observations .
In fact , the State would prefer hunting , so if we had conducted ourselves improperly they would have called us to task to have hunting be the only permitted management option .
Also , please realize that my organization was instrumental in the research that allowed for the registration of GonaCon , the vaccine that was part of your proposed solution .
I am conducting 100 surgical sterilization next month in Missouri as part of a suburban deer management program .
This is an initiative to come up with an alternative non-lethal solution that can be practical and cost effective in developed environments .
And remember millions of " semi- tame " cats and dogs are euthanized every year .
Tony DeNicola , Ph.D .

Do n't you know I 'm a millionaire ? :
' What groper footballer said to girl in nightclub before punching her in face '
Marlon King , pictured with his wife , denies punching a woman in the face at a celebrity nightclub
A premiership footballer groped a woman in a nightclub before breaking her nose when she rejected his advances , a court has heard .
Marlon King , 29 , allegedly shouted : ' Do n't you know who I am ?
I 'm a millionaire - you 're not even in my league ' , before hitting the petite student in the face .
The £ 25,000 - a- week Wigan Athletic striker is said to have approached the woman while she was with friends in the Soho Revue Bar in London last December .
She had never met King before and prosecutor Roger Daniells - Smith said none of the party had invited him to join them .
However , he said that did not stop the married father - of - three - who plays international football for Jamaica - from making advances by ' sexually touching ' the 20 - year - old woman on her bottom .
Mr Daniells - Smith told Southwark Crown Court : ' It was neither welcome nor consensual .
It was not an accidental brushing .
This was deliberate and sexual .'
He said the woman left King in no doubt what she thought of his behaviour and ' firmly ' insisted : ' Do n't do that .
Do n't touch me .'
But instead of ' taking the hint ' , King allegedly turned to two other women in the party and started touching them around their necks and chins .
Mr Daniells - Smith said they too told him to stop and he turned back to the student , stroking her hair .
He said : ' She told him to stop .
He replied " Do n't you know who I am ? I 'm a millionaire " .
She replied , " I do n't care who you are , take your millionaire self away " .
Support : King and his wife Julia pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court
' She brushed his hand away , but he grabbed her wrist .
She then pushed him away on the chest and at that moment Marlon King took one step backward and smashed her in the face with a clenched fist . '
Security staff at the club intervened and took him away .
Yesterday , the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , wept as she listed the injuries caused by the punch .
She said : ' It split my lip , broke my nose and gave me a black eye .
It felt like I was bleeding everywhere . '
Celebrity hang - out : King alleged ;y attacked the 20 - year - old woman at the Soho Revue Bar in London last December
The Wigan Athletic star 's alleged victim was then handed a photo taken on a friend 's mobile shortly after the attack .
Looking at the picture she told the court : ' That 's me .
That is blood from my face that dripped down my dress . '
The student had earlier told the court how King had grabbed her then touched up her friends before turning his attention back to her .
She said : ' He gave me a dirty look and started shaking his head at me .
' Then he was in my face saying " you 're not even in my league , love , I 'm a multi-millionaire " .
' I just carried on asking him to leave .
' I'm quite a lot smaller than him and he looked over my head at my friends , saying ' get this girl away from me ' .
' Then he started poking me in the head , pushing my temple like he was enjoying it , repeating " not even in my league " .
' I was quite offended but was trying to be controlled .
I kept on repeating " take your multi-millions and leave - no one cares , just get away from the table " .
' He started playing with my hair , pulling it .
It was n't hard - he was taunting everyone .
' I felt tiny , I felt really embarrassed .
I felt like he was invading my personal space .
' I did a shooing motion with my hand at which point he grabbed my wrist and pulled it down .
' That made me lean forward a bit at which point one of my friends grabbed his arm , saying ' get off her ' .
' Then he let go in such a way to push my friend back and when I looked up he punched me in the face .
' It was hard enough to knock me off my feet .
I fell back and he was still coming at me so my friend moved me away from the situation at which point I put my hand to my face and felt that I was bleeding . '
The barrister told jurors that King was on loan to Hull City at the time of the incident .
The footballer , from Waltham Cross , Hertfordshire , denies one count of sexual assault and one of causing actual bodily harm .
He claims although he was at the club , he was the victim of ' mistaken identity ' and did not attack the woman .
The trial continues .
Kaizen is a very interesting approach , also in the software industry .
On Wikipedia you ’ll find the following description of Kaizen :
Kaizen is a Japanese word adopted into English referring to a philosophy or practices focusing on continuous improvement in manufacturing activities , business activities in general , and even life in general , depending on interpretation and usage .
Kaizen aims to eliminate waste , to improve the process or activities ( techniques ) .
I heard about Kaizen the first time at an economic course , and I found the Muda ( seven wastes ) very interesting .
I tried to find locations or situations where you can detect such wastes :
Overproduction
Overproduction happens each time you engage more resources than needed to deliver to your customer .
For instance , large batch production , because of long change over time , exceeds the strict quantity ordered by the customer .
For productivity improvement , operators are required to produce more than the customer needs .
Extra parts will be stored and not sold .
Overproduction is the worst Muda because it hides or generates all others , especially inventory .
Overproduction increases the amount of space needed for storing raw material as well as finished goods .
It also requires a preservation system .
Overproduction happens then , when you do n’t follow the YAGNI principle .
Do n’t try to make assumptions about the future or the customers .
Just produce the things as simple as possible .
Unnecessary transportation
Each time a product is moved it stands the risk of being damaged , lost , delayed , etc. as well as being a cost for no added value .
Transportation does not make any transformation to the product that the consumer is supposed to pay for .
Do n’t build chatty interfaces , make use of the coarse - grained interface pattern .
Inventory
Inventory , be it in the form of raw materials , work - in - progress ( WIP ) , or finished goods , represents a capital outlay that has not yet produced an income either by the producer or for the consumer .
Any of these three items not being actively processed to add value is waste .
Deliver early and often .
Do n’t wait at the end of the project to deliver the whole software at once .
If you deliver your software earlier and often , you will receive more feedback and so the costs to fix bugs will reduce .
Also the customer will be happier because he could use much earlier important parts of your software and he could observe better the progress of the software project .
Motion
As compared to Transportation , Motion refers to the producer or worker or equipment .
This has significance to damage , wear , safety .
It also includes the fixed assets , and expenses incurred in the production process .
Good hardware and a good chair is very important to be productive .
Slow computers are just horrible to work with and a bad or cheap chair is not very good for the health of the software engineers .
If the software engineer feels comfortable , he ’s much more able to be concentrated or work longer .
Defects
Whenever defects occur , extra costs are incurred reworking the part , rescheduling production , etc .
Reduce Defects .
Unfortunately there does n’t exists a programming language where it is n’t possible to make no errors .
So testing is absolutely necessary .
Do unit testing with or without TDD , but a modern software project should have tests ( unit tests , integration tests or acceptance tests , etc. ) .
Without tests you do n’t have a safety net ( regression tests ) if you change something in your project .
One of the worst error a customer could find is one which he already found and was fixed .
Over -Processing
Over - processing occurs any time more work is done on a piece than what is required by the customer .
This also includes using tools that are more precise , complex , or expensive than absolutely required .
Overengineering and Patternoholics are a danger to do more than it is necessary .
Waiting
Whenever goods are not in transport or being processed , they are waiting .
In traditional processes , a large part of an individual product ’s life is spent waiting to be worked on .
Slow computers where you have to wait for a build step or just for the compiler are an unnecessary waste .
Also if you wait for an answer from your customer or an other teammate .
Do n’t wait , make a follow - up , make a phone call or write an other mail .
Also do n’t let the others wait .
If you receive an email , answer it or write a short email to say that you will response later , so that the other knows , that you saw his mail and you planed to response him .
Conclusion
One important question is : “ Do you add value to your solution , product or service which the customer is ready to pay for ? ”
This question or view is n’t new .
It focus all the actions in software engineering on business value , the value which the customer pays for .
To reduce the waste you have to improve ( Kaizen ) your code , methods and communication with others .
The seven wastes are a help to find locations or situations where waste could happen .
You do n't need psychedelic drugs to start seeing colors and objects that are n't really there .
Just 15 minutes of near - total sensory deprivation can bring on hallucinations in many otherwise sane individuals .
Psychologists stuck 19 healthy volunteers into a sensory - deprivation room , completely devoid of light and sound , for 15 minutes .
Without the normal barrage of sensory information flooding their brains , many people reported experiencing visual hallucinations , paranoia and a depressed mood .
" This is a pretty robust finding , " wrote psychiatrist Paul Fletcher of the University of Cambridge , who studies psychosis but was not involved in the study .
" It appears that , when confronted by lack of sensory patterns in our environment , we have a natural tendency to superimpose our own patterns . "
The findings support the hypothesis that hallucinations happen when the brain misidentifies the source of what it is experiencing , a concept the researchers call " faulty source monitoring . "
" This is the idea that hallucinations come about because we misidentify the source of our own thoughts , " psychologist Oliver Mason of the University College London wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" So basically something that actually is initiated within us gets misidentified as from the outside . "
Mason and colleagues published their study in October in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease .
To choose people for their study , the researchers asked more than 200 volunteers to complete a questionnaire called the " Revised Hallucinations Scale , " which measures the predisposition of healthy people to see things that are n't really there .
The scientists picked participants who scored in either the upper or lower 20th percentile , so they could compare how short - term sensory deprivation affects a range of individuals .
Study participants sat in a padded chair in the middle of an anechoic chamber , a room designed to dampen all sound and block out light .
The researchers describe the setup as a " room within a room , " with thick outer walls and an inner chamber formed by metallic acoustic panels and a floating floor .
In between the outer and inner walls are large fiberglass wedges .
" This results in a very low - noise environment in which the sound pressure due to outside levels is below the threshold of hearing , " the researchers wrote .
Though participants had a panic button , none of them used it .
After spending 15 minutes deprived of sight and sound , each person completed a test called the " Psychotomimetic States Inventory , " which measures psychosis - like experiences and was originally developed to study recreational drug users .
Among the nine participants who scored high on the first survey , five reported having hallucinations of faces during the sensory deprivation , and six reported seeing other objects or shapes that were n't there .
Four also noted an unusually heightened sense of smell , and two sensed an " evil presence " in the room .
Almost all reported that they had " experienced something very special or important " during the experiment .
As expected , volunteers who were less prone to hallucinations experienced fewer perceptual distortions , but they still reported a variety of delusions and hallucinations .
The researchers were not altogether surprised by such dramatic results from only 15 minutes of sensory deprivation .
Although few scientists are studying sensory deprivation today , a small body of research from the 1950s and 1960s supports the idea that a lack of sensory input can lead to symptoms of psychosis .
" Sensory deprivation is a naturalistic analogue to drugs like ketamine and cannabis for acting as a psychosis - inducing context , " Mason wrote , " particularly for those prone to psychosis . "
We still do n't know why some people are more likely to have hallucinations than others , but Fletcher says that some researchers consider the phenomenon particularly important because it suggests that symptoms of mental illness occur on a continuum with normality .
" Perhaps this reflects different ways of dealing with sense data , which under certain circumstances might be advantageous , " Fletcher wrote .
Next , the researchers hope to study how sensory deprivation affects schizophrenic patients and people who use recreational drugs that increase the risk of psychosis .
" There are claims that schizophrenic patients paradoxically find that their psychotic symptoms such as hearing voices are improved by sensory deprivation , " Mason wrote , " though the evidence for this is very long in the tooth indeed .
What happens to people who already hear voices when in the chamber ? "

The biggest topic in the upcoming week will undoubtedly be the escalating debate over whether the People 's Bank of China ( PBoC ) will relent to Obama 's persistent pleading , and in addition to de-pegging , allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar .
The debate is simple : the US needs the dollar to hit the bottom of the currency stack post haste , and for that to happen , China 's currency needs to appreciate .
This is merely in keeping with the Fed 's current strategy of inflating assets at all costs via monetary manipulation as both fiscal and " consumer " based attempts to increase prices have largely failed ( record unemployment may be a lagging economic indicator but it is a very much coincident wage - deflation indicator ) .
It is in this environment that the PBoC has been sending mixed signals , with a variation of the " party line " language in its Thursday release being read as a prompt that China is willing to play Russian Roulette with over 1 billion increasingly unhappy citizens in the biggest communism - capitalism experiment in history .
Yet as the Telegraph pointed out today , there is absolutely no risk ( so far ) of any accelerating renminbi appreciation becoming the policy course for China .
So for a slightly more than " soundbite " level evaluation of the pros and cons of " de- pegging " , we present the following curious piece of fiction from none other than paperback experts Morgan Stanley , and specifically its Chief Asia strategist , the mellifluously named Qing Wang .
Introduction
We highlight in this research note the pros and cons of renminbi de-peg and appreciation in the format of a hypothetical debate between a policy advisor who defends the status quo and a fund manager who argues that the current arrangement is unsustainable .
A Conversation on the Renminbi
An overseas fund manager recently visited Beijing as part of his regular macro due diligence trip to China .
He had a one - on - one meeting with an influential policy advisor from a local think tank , the purpose of which is to understand better the outlook for the renminbi exchange rate .
The following is a dialogue between the policy advisor ( or ‘ Ms. P ’ ) and the fund manager ( or ‘ Mr. M ’ ) :
Mr. M : Professor , thank you for sparing time to meet me .
In the interest of time and if you do not mind , may I start with a question by showing you this chart ( see Exhibit 1 ) .
The chart shows that since March this year , a number of currencies among emerging market ( EM ) economies have appreciated substantially against the USD .
However , the renminbi is among a handful of EM currencies that did not appreciate against the USD , making it one of the weakest currencies in the EM space .
Should n’t we expect the renminbi to appreciate soon ?
Ms. P : I beg to disagree .
Your observation is correct if one only focuses on the developments in the past 4 - 5 months .
However , before I answer your question , I also would like to present a chart ( see Exhibit 2 ) .
This chart shows the change in the exchange rates of the same set of EM economies between September 2008 – when the global financial crisis broke out – and March 2009 when the global economic and financial situation started to stabilize .
This chart shows that the renminbi was the strongest EM currency , because it was the only EM currency that did not depreciate against the US dollar in the wake of the global financial turmoil .
I recall that , back then , many market observers predicted that the renminbi would depreciate against the USD by following the footsteps of other EM currencies .
I believe that , had China allowed renminbi depreciation , the depreciation pressures on other EM currencies would have been even stronger .
Your observation that the renminbi is the weakest EM currency is valid only as far as the past 6 - 7 months is concerned .
If we take a slightly longer view , examining the cumulative performance since the crisis ( i.e. , August 2008 ) , the renminbi is still stronger than most other EM currencies .
Mr. M : These are fair points .
However , when I suggest that the renminbi should appreciate , my arguments are based not only on the developments of the past few months but also on the fact that China has , and is expected to continue to have , large and persistent current account surpluses , which suggest that the renminbi is undervalued and should appreciate ( see Exhibit 3 ) .
This is International Economics 101 , is n’t it ?
Ms. P : I do not disagree with you in principle .
I think the large and persistent current account surpluses in China have reflected a structural saving - investment imbalance as well as an undervalued exchange rate .
Renminbi appreciation should be part of the solution but not the only solution to reduce current account surpluses , especially given its structural nature .
That said , from a policymaker ’s perspective , any macroeconomic policy decision needs to take into account both the cyclical and structural conditions of the economy .
While renminbi appreciation makes lots of sense in view of structurally high current account surpluses , the case for renminbi appreciation is far from compelling from a cyclical point of view .
In theory , currency appreciation helps dampen export growth and contain inflation pressures .
The reality is that the Chinese economy is currently suffering deflation and a sharp decline in exports ( see Exhibit 4 ) .
At the current juncture , it does not make any sense for the policymaker to take policy action that would serve to exacerbate either deflation or weak exports .
This is Macroeconomic Policymaking 101 , is n’t it ?
Mr. M : I understand what you ’re saying , but the current situation is not sustainable .
The conditions for a renminbi appreciation will never be perfect ; there will always be some sort of downside .
I am afraid that the longer the necessary adjustment is postponed , the stronger the appreciation pressures will be .
Ms. P : Exchange rate adjustment is important , but I caution against over - emphasizing its role in rebalancing the economy .
The experience in 1H09 is a case in point .
China registered a current account surplus of US $ 134 billion in 1H09 , a 30 % decline compared to the level in same period in 2008 .
This is because while China ’s exports declined by 25 %Y in 1H09 due to a collapse in external demand , imports declined by only 21 %Y , reflecting relatively strong domestic demand underpinned by aggressive policy stimulus .
Both Morgan Stanley and consensus forecasts expect the current account surplus to shrink further in 2010 , as a result of stronger import than export growth due to robust domestic demand but a tepid recovery in external demand ( see Exhibit 3 ) .
If these forecasts were to materialize , it would suggest that the underlying external imbalances are improving towards a more sustainable situation .
Do n’t you agree ?
Mr. M : Well , yes , but even according to these forecasts , China ’s current account surplus would still be over 5 % of GDP in 2010 .
As long as a current account surplus of this magnitude persists , the expectation of renminbi appreciation is bound to remain strong and will surely lead to significant ‘ hot money ’ inflows , which contribute to large and persistent FX reserve accumulation despite potentially narrowing current account surpluses ( see Exhibit 5 ) .
And large FX reserve accumulation will constitute a major challenge to monetary policy implementation , namely the loss of monetary policy independence .
Are n’t Chinese policymakers concerned ?
Ms. P : You are absolutely right on this point .
In fact , I think this is by far the strongest argument for a flexible exchange rate arrangement in China , which is a pre-condition to independent monetary policy according to the theory of the ‘ Impossible Trinity ’ .
Mr. M : I am glad we finally agree on something .
Indeed , for such a large economy as China , independent monetary policy is critical to domestic macroeconomic and financial stability .
Is n’t this alone a sufficiently strong rationale for renminbi appreciation ?
Ms. P : This is indeed a theoretically sound argument , but it has proven to be very difficult to implement in practice .
For instance , while the renminbi was allowed to appreciate against the USD by over 20 % between July 2005 and July 2008 , it does not seem to me that the appreciation brought about any genuine monetary policy independence during that period .
On the contrary , I would argue that persistent FX reserve accumulation , in part driven by strong appreciation expectations , has further complicated monetary policy execution .
Do you not agree ?
Mr. M : True .
But I think it is precisely because the renminbi appreciation was too little and too slow to change expectations .
A sufficiently large appreciation would generate two - way risks and thus impart meaningful flexibility to the exchange rate .
Ms. P : How much does the renminbi need to appreciate in order to generate two - way risks in the short run – 10 % , 30 % or 50 % ?
Does anyone really know ?
As an expert in the internal capital market , do you believe that a 10 % one - off revaluation of the renminbi could bring about meaningful two - way risks ?
Even if you can make a case that a 30 % one - off revaluation will do the trick , do you think Chinese authorities – who are known for their hallmark gradualist approach reform – would take such a risk , given that a 30 % revaluation of the exchange rate could potentially put many Chinese exporters out of business overnight ?
Also bear in mind that the exchange rate is not just a relative price between tradable and non-tradable goods but a type of asset price , and it could easily overshoot , as every other asset price does .
Mr. M : Your arguments make sense .
However , as a market participant , I strongly believe that the government is unable to avoid a market - driven adjustment .
It is inevitable .
One can not control everything .
Something has to give .
You seem to be suggesting that the ‘ law of gravity ’ does not apply to China .
Am I missing something here ?
Ms. P : Yes , something is indeed missing in our discussion , which has so far focused on the role of the renminbi nominal exchange rate .
In theory , when a currency is considered to be undervalued and needs to appreciate , the exchange rate concept here is the real exchange rate , namely the nominal exchange rate between two currencies adjusted for the inflation rate differentials between the two economies .
In practice , country A ’s real exchange rate is estimated by calculating its real effective exchange rate ( REER ) , which is defined as the trade - weighted nominal exchange rate against a currency basket – also called the nominal effective exchange rate ( NEER ) – adjusted for the inflation rate differentials between country A and its trading partner economies .
A real appreciation of country A’s exchange rate can be achieved through the nominal appreciation of country A ’s currency or by a higher inflation rate in country A than in its trading partner countries , or a combination of both .
I agree with you that ‘ something has to give ’ .
In this context , the ‘ something ’ would be a higher domestic inflation rate in China relative to other trading partner countries if the appreciation of the renminbi nominal exchange rate is slow .
Mr. M : Higher inflation in China ?
But China is suffering deflation now ?
It may take another 12 - 18 months before inflationary pressure emerges in China .
Relying on higher inflation as part of the solution will be a long process .
Ms. P : This is where the point about cyclical versus structural conditions of the economy that I made earlier becomes relevant again .
Renminbi appreciation in real terms is justified over the medium term , namely if appreciation of the nominal exchange rate is slow , inflation pressures will eventually show .
In fact , I would advise that , in view of the high level of growth in China , the norm for annual inflation rate in China should be in the range of 4 - 6 % instead of the 2 - 3 % to which many Chinese seem to have become used to .
However , the current cyclical condition of the economy dictates that there are deflationary pressures .
Mr. M : I think that the relatively low inflation in China largely reflects strong supply capacity and thus fierce competition in the downstream manufacturing sector .
I doubt that this situation will change any time soon .
Ms. P : It also has to do with the low price of energy and natural resources , as well as low environmental costs .
Deregulating these prices and making them reflect their true opportunity costs are the key .
More generally , China needs to rationalize the relative price structure between energy and raw materials on the one hand and downstream manufactured goods on the other hand .
While this relative price normalization is likely to cause broad - based inflation , I believe that this type of inflation is what China needs and , when it materializes , should be tolerated .
Mr. M : Inflationary pressures seem already to have been reflected in the upward pressures on asset prices .
Ms. P : The post - crisis asset price reflation is a global phenomenon .
Indeed , preventing an asset price bubble will perhaps be a high policy priority .
But conventional monetary policy tools are ill - suited for this task .
I suggest that ‘ containing financial leverage ’ in the system be made a key policy objective with a view to minimizing systematic risks in the event of a bursting of the asset price bubble .
This will entail strict mortgage rules for homebuyers , strict restrictions on margin trading in stock market , strict capital adequacy requirements for banks , asymmetric liberalization of external capital account controls that induce capital outflows and discourage capital inflows , and preventing a one - way bet on the renminbi exchange rate that would induce hot money inflows .
Mr. M : Professor , I appreciate the discussion and your answers to my questions .
After hearing what you have to say , I now have a better understanding of the arguments in favor of the status quo .
And I do see the validity of many of your arguments .
At the same time , it seems to me that most of the points you have made are out of consideration of designing a course of policy action that serves the best interest of the Chinese economy itself .
However , when it comes to exchange rates , it always involves more than one party .
Other countries that are negatively impacted by China ’s exchange rate policy would complain and call on China to change its current practice .
Wo n’t these international peer pressures change the mind of Chinese policymakers ?
Ms. P : A strong Chinese economy should help the global economic recovery .
While I do not work for the government , I know the Chinese government ’s position on this issue is that the choice of exchange rate regime is in the domain of a country ’s sovereign decision .
That said , you seem to be suggesting that there are now strong and broad - based international pressures on China to change its exchange rate policy .
This is not my impression , however .
For instance , while the last G7 statement singled out the renminbi and called for its appreciation , as it did in the past , recent statements issued by G20 have been completely silent on the exchange rate issue , let alone singling out the renminbi .
As you know , the G20 has now replaced the G7 as the main international forum for discussing global policy coordination among major economies .
Take a look at the recent trends of trade - weighted exchange rates ( or NEER ) for Russia , Brazil and Korea and compare them to that for China , and you should understand why G20 ’s position on this issue is much softer ( see Exhibit 6 ) .
As the expert , please correct me if I am wrong .
I do not even think it is in the interest of the US to put pressure on China to allow the renminbi to de-peg from and appreciate against the US dollar at the current juncture when the US dollar is already under enormous downward pressure .
Would n’t the perception that ‘ even the Chinese are starting to abandon the US dollar ’ cause more USD selling in the FX market ?
Mr. M : Interesting observations .
On your last point , the current views of the market seem divided : while some share your view , others actually believe that a strong renminbi will eventually help strengthen the US dollar .
Well , professor , I really appreciate your time and I certainly enjoyed the discussion and have learnt a lot .
I hope to stay in touch .
Please do let me know if you change your view .
Ms. P : I also greatly appreciate your sharing your view from your perspective of an international capital market participant .
Understanding of the market is critical to formulating good policies .
Best of luck with your investments .
Our Takeaways from This Dialogue
First , given the fact that the renminbi exchange rate is still a policy tool instead of a market - determined price variable , one needs to think more like a policymaker than a hedge fund manager to gauge the likelihood of a potential policy shift on the renminbi .
Second , we maintain our long - standing view that the current renminbi exchange rate arrangement will remain unchanged at least through mid-2010 .
While an exit from the current regime of a de facto peg against the USD may occur in 2H10 , any subsequent renminbi appreciation against the USD will likely be modest and gradual .
Third , as we had predicted earlier , the relevant debate and speculation as to what would be an exit strategy for the renminbi has indeed emerged sooner rather than later .
However , we continue to believe that an actual decision – be it an exit strategy or maintaining the status quo – is unlikely to be made and implemented until after the middle of next year .
Fourth , looking ahead , China is likely to repeat a situation similar to that during 2005 - 08 , featuring strong expectations of renminbi appreciation , ‘ hot money ’ inflows , abundant external surplus - driven liquidity ( as opposed to the current abundant liquidity due to loose monetary policy ) , and the attendant upward pressures on asset prices .
Last but not the least , we expect that the current policy stance will remain broadly unchanged towards year - end and turn neutral at the start of 2010 as the pace of new bank lending creation normalizes from about Rmb 10 trillion in 2009 to Rmb 7 - 8 trillion in 2010 .
Policy tightening in the form of RRR hike , base interest rate hike or renminbi appreciation is unlikely before mid-2010 .
If , however , excess liquidity stemming from large external balance of payment surpluses were to emerge earlier than expected , we would not rule out the possibility that the RRR hike cycle could start as early as the beginning of 2Q10 .
Politischer Immaterialismus Stefan Höltgen
Ein Interview mit dem Piratenpartei -Mitglied Martin Haase
Martin Haase ist Professor für Romanistik an der Universität Bamberg , Vorstandsmitglied beim Chaos Computer Club , Mitarbeiter bei Wikipedia , Mitglied beim FoeBuD e.V. und seit kurzem auch bei der Piratenpartei .
Telepolis - Autor Stefan Höltgen hat ihn eine Woche nach der Bundestagswahl getroffen und mit ihm über Netzpolitik , die Verbindung von Geisteswissenschaften und Bürgerrechten und natürlich seine Piraten - Existenz gesprochen .
Professor Martin Haase
Herr Professor Haase , wie war denn die Woche nach der Bundestagswahl für Sie ?
Martin Haase : Die war insofern nicht ruhig , weil ich mich wieder in die akademische Arbeit gestürzt habe .
Das war also schon mal ganz anders als zu der Zeit vor der Wahl – ein richtiges Kontrastprogramm , wenn man so will .
Von der Wahl war in dem Moment gar nichts mehr zu spüren .
Wir fragen natürlich auch , weil Sie ja prominentes Mitglieder der Piratenpartei sind … Gab es Anlass zum Feiern ?
Martin Haase : Nun , es gab natürlich die Wahlparty am Wahlabend , bei der die Stimmung allerdings auffallend gedämpft war .
Ich kann mir das nicht ganz erklären .
Viele Leute hatten wohl mit einem besseren Ergebnis für die Piraten gerechnet .
Und das Ergebnis der Bundestagswahl war insgesamt ja nicht so ausgefallen , dass man besondere Begeisterung an den Tag legen müsste .
Für die Piraten war es aber schon sensationell .
Über 2 % aus dem Stand zu erreichen , also 850.000 Leute zu finden , die die Piraten wählen , von denen sie zu Anfang des Jahres vielleicht noch nie etwas gehört hatten , wäre natürlich schon ein Anlass zu feiern gewesen .
Im Internet hat es für die Piratenpartei besser ausgesehen .
In etlichen Portalen hatten sie sogar die absolute Mehrheit .
Hat man diesen Effekt vielleicht überschätzt ?
Martin Haase : Nein , ich glaube , es war jedem klar , dass das Internet nicht das widerspiegelt , was sich außerhalb des Netzes , sozusagen „ im realen Leben “ tut .
Nur wurde die Schätzung in der Euphorie , die alle hatten , etwas höher angesetzt .
Ich selbst habe die Piraten sogar bei 3 % gesehen .
Aber selbst 2 % sind wie gesagt kein schlechtes Ergebnis , oder um es anders zu formulieren :
Es ist das schlechteste Ergebnis der Piraten bei einer Bundestagswahl ( lacht ) .
Denn es soll sich ja noch steigern .
Aber weil es eben gleichzeitig auch das beste Ergebnis war , kann man schon zufrieden sein .
Sie sind selbst erst seit ein paar Monaten bei den Piraten .
Wie sind Sie denn zur Parteimitgliedschaft gekommen ?
Martin Haase : Das ist eine längere Geschichte .
Ich mache ja schon länger Netzpolitik und Fragen der IT - Grundrechte beschäftigen mich seit den 90er Jahren .
Ich kannte die Piraten seit ihrer Gründung ; so gesehen war es also naheliegend .
Ich wollte mich aber zunächst erstmal davon überzeugen , ob dort seriöse politische Arbeit gemacht wird .
Der Beitrittsgrund waren dann die Ereignisse im Mai dieses Jahres , als es um das Das ist eine längere Geschichte .
Ich mache ja schon länger Netzpolitik und Fragen der IT - Grundrechte beschäftigen mich seit den 90er Jahren .
Ich kannte die Piraten seit ihrer Gründung ; so gesehen war es also naheliegend .
Ich wollte mich aber zunächst erstmal davon überzeugen , ob dort seriöse politische Arbeit gemacht wird .
Der Beitrittsgrund waren dann die Ereignisse im Mai dieses Jahres , als es um das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz ging , das viele " Zensurerleichterungsgesetz " nennen .
Da gab es einen Termin mit Martin Dörmann , dem Berichterstatter der SPD , der „ das Internet “ eingeladen hatte – und ich war einer „ vom Internet “ .
Diese Veranstaltung hat mich in mehrfacher Weise richtiggehend wütend gemacht , weil dort relativ schnell deutlich wurde , dass bei der SPD nicht einmal eine Bereitschaft zuzuhören da war .
Und obwohl auf der Veranstaltung vereinbart wurde , dass es keine Presseberichterstattung geben sollte , wurde hinterher von der SPD eine Pressemitteilung verschickt , in der diese dann schrieb : „ Wir sind auf die Bedenken der Internet - Community eingegangen und diese sind in den Gesetzesentwurf eingeflossen . “
Das stimmte natürlich gar nicht .
Die Dinge ( z.B. die Befristung des Gesetzes oder die Überprüfung der nach wie vor geheimen Sperrlisten durch eine Expertengruppe ) , auf die tatsächlich eingegangen worden war , waren den Gesprächspartnern vorher in den Mund gelegt worden , und man hatte sich erhofft , dass dem einfach zugestimmt würde , was aber nicht passiert ist .
Insofern wurde in der Berichterstattung , die es wie gesagt ja sowieso nicht geben sollte , die Sachlage auch noch einmal völlig verzerrt dargestellt .
Hat die SPD dann quasi mit Ihnen als „ dem Internet “ bloß PR machen wollen ?
Martin Haase : Nun , die Argumente der SPD lauteten , dass man Frau von der Leyen keine „ Steilvorlage “ für den Wahlkampf bieten wolle und dass man als Regierungspartei unmöglich gegen den Gesetzesentwurf stimmen könne .
Eine Auseinandersetzung darüber gab es nicht .
Und anstatt mich weiter darüber zu ärgern - was passiert wäre , wenn dieses Gesetz verabschiedet wird - , bin ich im Juni der Piratenpartei beigetreten , obwohl ich ein Partei - Skeptiker war und immer noch bin .
Aber der Parteibeitritt hat mir gut getan , weil ich mich ab dem Moment nicht mehr über die merkbefreiten Äußerungen von Politikern anderer Parteien ärgern musste , sondern weil ich mich freuen konnte , weil sie so der Piratenpartei mehr Zulauf verschafften .
Außerdem gab mir das die Möglichkeit , die Themen , die mich bewegen und zu denen ich arbeite , an die Öffentlichkeit zu bringen .
Mir geht es bei der Piratenpartei um Themen , nicht um Posten .
Ich will auch in kein Parlament einziehen , sondern dort gewisse Ideen vorwärts bringen .
Wie verbinden Sie diese politischen Themen denn mit Ihrer Arbeit als Romanist ?
Gibt es da Gemeinsamkeiten oder Möglichkeiten der Verknüpfung ?
Martin Haase : Bürgerrechtsthemen sind den Linguisten und Romanisten keineswegs fern .
Da könnte ich jetzt sehr weit ausholen .
In den kleineren Zeiträumen hat es in der Linguistik immer ein Bedürfnis gegeben , sich für bürgerliche Freiheiten einzusetzen .
Das liegt daran , dass die Sprache , mit der wir uns beschäftigen , auf Kreativität beruht , und nur wenn man frei ist , kann man kreativ sein .
Und wenn man nicht frei ist , entsteht eine andere Form von Kreativität , die die Freiheitseinschränkungen zu umgehen versucht .
In der jüngsten Vergangenheit braucht man da nur an Noam Chomsky zu denken , der sich sehr stark auf diesen Gebieten engagiert .
In der Romanistik lässt sich das vor allem in der Sprachkritik sehen .
Viktor Klemperer , der eine Studie über die Sprache des Dritten Reiches herausgegeben hat , oder Leo Spitzer , ein Romanist , der sich schon in den 20er Jahren mit dem veränderten Sprachverhalten angesichts von Zensur beschäftigt hat .
Er hat Kriegsgefangenen - Briefe , die der Zensur unterlagen , ausgewertet und daran gezeigt , wie die Briefschreiber mit Hilfe vor allem dialektaler Sprachmittel versucht haben , die Zensur zu umgehen .
Die Tradition lässt sich bis zu Jakob Grimm , dem Gründungsvater der Germanistik , weiterverfolgen , der wegen seines Einsatzes für Freiheiten ja sogar seine Professur in Göttingen verloren hatte , und in der Romanistik bis Montesquieu und Rousseau , die sich philosophisch mit dem Staat beschäftigt und Konzepte wie die Gewaltenteilung entworfen haben .

Sie sind ja nicht nur theoretisch im Netz aktiv , sondern auch ganz praktisch : Sie betreiben neben Ihrer Universitätshomepage eine private Website , ein Weblog , Sie sind bei Twitter , Xing , bei Wikipedia aktiv .
Welche Möglichkeiten bekommen
Sie dadurch für Ihre universitäre Arbeit ?
Martin Haase : Ich profitiere davon sehr .
Ich habe zusammen mit anderen etwa die Ich profitiere davon sehr .
Ich habe zusammen mit anderen etwa die Glottopedia vorangebracht , ein Terminologie - Wörterbuch für die Linguistik , bei dem auch zahlreiche Studenten mitarbeiten , was wiederum ganz praktisch für deren Studium ist .
Ich bin dort im Scientific Advisory Board .
Diese Techniken lassen sich natürlich auch ganz direkt in die Lehre einbringen , indem man Vorlesungen als Podcast veröffentlicht und ähnliches .
2007 habe ich das Lehrbuch „ Einführung in die italienische Sprachwissenschaft “ herausgegeben , das bereits sehr „ netzaffin “ konzipiert wurde : Darin wurde etwa auf Daten und Medien wie zum Beispiel Sprachaufnahmen , die im Netz zu finden sind , verwiesen .
Und im Buch selbst haben wir versucht , auf Informationen wie Abbildungen und Karten , die unter freien Lizenzen im Internet zu finden waren , zurück zu greifen .
Das war natürlich nicht immer ganz einfach , weil man zu einigen Themen – etwa italienischen Regionen – freies Material wie Karten bekommen kann , von anderen hingegen nicht .
Die Urheberrechtsthematik zeigt sich bei solch einem Buch sehr deutlich .
Oft ist es auch gar nicht klar , wo die Rechte liegen , oder es gibt irreführende Auszeichnungen und man findet dann etwa Kartenmaterial , das fälschlicherweise als Public Domain gekennzeichnet ist , obwohl das nicht stimmt .
Daran zeigt sich schon , dass gerade in diesem Bereich dringend Reformen nötig sind , denn diese Unsicherheiten behindern natürlich die Kreativität .
Damit machen
Sie dann also auch in gewisser Weise Politik in eigener Sache .
Bringen Sie diese Themen auch bei den Piraten ein ?
Martin Haase : Ja , vor allem die Bildungspolitik ist da ein wichtiger Punkt .
Das ist zwar jetzt schon ein Kernthema bei den Piraten , aber wenn man dort demnächst bei Landtagswahlen antritt , wird das noch wichtiger , denn Bildung ist ein Thema der Landespolitik .
Ich denke dort ist einiges zu tun , denn gerade in der deutschen Bildungspolitik ist manches schief gelaufen und läuft immer mehr schief .

Ich denke dort ist einiges zu tun , denn gerade in der deutschen Bildungspolitik ist manches schief gelaufen und läuft immer mehr schief .
Vor allem der Bologna - Prozess sollte dringend noch einmal reformiert werden .
Da sind sich alle einig , dass wir eine „ Reform der Reform “ benötigen .
Das Schöne bei der Piratenpartei ist , dass es sie nicht nur in Deutschland gibt , sondern in ganz Europa , und alle haben das Thema „ Bildung “ als Kernthema .
Das gibt die Möglichkeit der Zusammenarbeit , um die europäische mit der Landesebene zu verzahnen , was bei anderen Parteien gar nicht möglich ist .
Freies Wissen ist ein wichtiges
Thema , das man in diese Diskussion auf jeden Fall einbringen sollte .
Konkrete politische Arbeit als Berater im Hintergrund ?
Martin Haase :
Ich habe zwar gesagt , dass ich keine Posten in der Piratenpartei bekommen möchte und auch in kein Parlament einziehen will , aber sollten die Piraten einmal irgendwo mitregieren , kann ich mir auch vorstellen , für einen Ministerposten im Bildungsbereich bereit zu stehen ( lacht ) .
Da könnte ich mein Expertenwissen jedenfalls am sinnvollsten einbringen .
Was ich keinesfalls möchte , ist als „ gebildeter Laie “ an Gesetzgebungsverfahren teilzuhaben über Themen , in denen ich mich nicht grundlegend auskenne .
Da wären Juristen besser aufgestellt .
Das heißt , Sie sehen auch die Möglichkeit , dass die Piraten in die Parlamente einziehen ?
Oder rechnen
Sie eher mit einer Diffusion der Themen in die anderen Parteien ?
Martin Haase : Beides ist sehr erstrebenswert , also dass die Piraten so erfolgreich werden , dass sie selbst oder die anderen mit ihren Themen Politik machen .
Dann braucht man am Ende die Piratenpartei vielleicht gar nicht mehr .
Ich glaube aber , da wird vieles von Leuten , die im Netz aktiv sind , auch nicht richtig verstanden .
Letztens gab es ein Beides ist sehr erstrebenswert , also dass die Piraten so erfolgreich werden , dass sie selbst oder die anderen mit ihren Themen Politik machen .
Dann braucht man am Ende die Piratenpartei vielleicht gar nicht mehr .
Ich glaube aber , da wird vieles von Leuten , die im Netz aktiv sind , auch nicht richtig verstanden .
Letztens gab es ein Interview mit Markus Beckedahl Julia Seliger und Gerhard Baum , die nach der Zukunft der Piratenpartei gefragt wurden und antworteten :
Das ist vielleicht nur ein vorübergehendes Phänomen und irgendwann braucht man die nicht mehr .
Dann gab es einen Vergleich mit den Grünen , zu dem die Interviewten meinten , man könne die beiden Parteien nicht miteinander vergleichen , weil hinter den Grünen mehrere lange vorher existierende Bewegungen standen .
Ich glaube hingegen , bei der Piratenpartei ist das nicht anders ; auch sie sind nur die Spitze von Bewegungen , die – wie etwa der CCC oder FoeBuD – schon sehr lange existieren und etabliert sind .
Das kann man sogar noch viel weiter fassen : Die Grünen sind eine postmaterialistische Partei , weil sie neue Ideen in die Politik gebracht haben , in denen es nicht mehr darum geht , Besitz zu vermehren und zu verteilen , sondern es ging – wie beim Umweltschutz – nun auch um nicht materielle Dinge .
Bei der Piratenpartei geht das noch weiter : Ein Berliner Netzaktivist schrieb , das sei eine zweite postmaterialistische
Bewegung – oder vielleicht könne man sogar von Immaterialismus zu sprechen .
Ich glaube , da ist etwas dran .
Die Leute , die da unterwegs sind , interessieren sich für neue Ansätze , die zum Beispiel aus der Open - Source - Bewegung kommen .
Nicht mehr nur Teilhabe am Reichtum , sondern auch Anerkennung für Kreativität und Leistung stehen da im Vordergrund .
Das würde dann auch erklären , warum es bei diesen Bewegungen , auch bei den Piraten , diese große Affinität zum Grundgesetz gibt , die man bei den anderen Parteien vielleicht etwas weniger sieht .
Worin sehen sie den Grund für diese besondere Form der „ Verfassungstreue “ ?
Martin Haase : Das hängt damit zusammen , dass die Leute , die sich damals das Grundgesetz ausgedacht haben , in einer ganz ähnlichen Situation waren nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und vor dem Einsetzen des Wirtschaftswunders .
Da hat man ethische Konzepte entwickelt , die für die jetzt jungen , netzaffinen Wähler von ganz starkem Interesse sind .
Es handelt sich dabei um Bewegungen ( im Plural ) , die sehr tragfähig sind und wo die Piratenpartei möglicherweise nur die Spitze des Eisbergs ist .
Daher glaube ich auch nicht , dass sie , anders als die Biertrinker - oder Autofahrer - Partei mit ihrem „ einen Thema “ , so schnell wieder verschwinden wird .
Vielmehr spiegelt ihre Existenz eine gesellschaftliche Entwicklung wider , die viele Leute so noch gar nicht im Blickfeld haben .

How Rewards Can Backfire and Reduce Motivation
Surely one of the best ways to generate motivation in ourselves and others is by dangling rewards ?
Yet psychologists have long known that rewards are overrated .
The carrot , of carrot - and - stick fame , is not as effective as we ’ve been led to believe .
Rewards work under some circumstances but sometimes they backfire .
Spectacularly .
Here is a story about preschool children with much to teach all ages about the strange effects that rewards have on our motivation .
It ’s child ’s play
Psychologists Mark R. Lepper and David Greene from Stanford and the University of Michigan were interested in testing what is known as the ‘ overjustification ’ hypothesis — about which , more later ( Lepper et al. , 1973 ) .
Since parents so often use rewards as motivators for children they recruited fifty - one preschoolers aged between 3 and 4 .
All the children selected for the study were interested in drawing .
It was crucial that they already liked drawing because Lepper and Greene wanted to see what effect rewards would have when children were already fond of the activity .
The children were then randomly assigned to one of the following conditions :
Expected reward .
In this condition children were told they would get a certificate with a gold seal and ribbon if they took part .
Surprise reward .
In this condition children would receive the same reward as above but , crucially , were n’t told about it until after the drawing activity was finished .
No reward .
Children in this condition expected no reward , and did n’t receive one .
Each child was invited into a separate room to draw for 6 minutes then afterwards either given their reward or not depending on the condition .
Then , over the next few days , the children were watched through one - way mirrors to see how much they would continue drawing of their own accord .
The graph below shows the percentage of time they spent drawing by experimental condition :
As you can see the expected reward had decreased the amount of spontaneous interest the children took in drawing ( and there was no statistically significant difference between the no reward and surprise reward group ) .
So , those who had previously liked drawing were less motivated once they expected to be rewarded for the activity .
In fact the expected reward reduced the amount of spontaneous drawing the children did by half .
Not only this , but judges rated the pictures drawn by the children expecting a reward as less aesthetically pleasing .
Rewards reduce intrinsic motivation
It ’s not only children who display this kind of reaction to rewards , though , subsequent studies have shown a similar effect in all sorts of different populations , many of them grown - ups .
In one study smokers who were rewarded for their efforts to quit did better at first but after three months fared worse than those given no rewards and no feedback ( Curry et al. , 1990 ) .
Indeed those given rewards even lied more about the amount they were smoking .
Reviewing 128 studies on the effects of rewards Deci et al. ( 1999 , p. 658 ) concluded that :
“ tangible rewards tend to have a substantially negative effect on intrinsic motivation (…)
Even when tangible rewards are offered as indicators of good performance , they typically decrease intrinsic motivation for interesting activities . ”
Rewards have even been found to make people less creative and worse at problem - solving .
Overjustification
So , what ’s going on ?
The key to understanding these behaviours lies in the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation .
When we do something for its own sake , because we enjoy it or because it fills some deep - seated desire , we are intrinsically motivated .
On the other hand when we do something because we receive some reward , like a certificate or money , this is extrinsic motivation .
The children were chosen in the first instance because they already liked drawing and they were already intrinsically motivated to draw .
It was pleasurable , they were good at it and they got something out of it that fed their souls .
Then some of them got a reward for drawing and their motivation changed .
Before they had been drawing because they enjoyed it , but now it seemed as though they were drawing for the reward .
What they had been motivated to do intrinsically , they were now being given an external , extrinsic motivation for .
This provided too much justification for what they were doing and so , paradoxically , afterwards they drew less .
This is the overjustification hypothesis for which Lepper and Greene were searching and although it seems like backwards thinking , it ’s typical of the way the mind sometimes works .
We do n’t just work ‘ forwards ’ from our attitudes and preferences to our actions , we also work ‘ backwards ’ , working out what our attitudes and preferences must be based on our current situation , feelings or actions ( see also : cognitive dissonance ) .
When money makes play into work
Not only this but rewards are dangerous for another reason : because they remind us of obligations , of being made to do things we do n’t want to do .
Children are given rewards for eating all their food , doing their homework or tidying their bedrooms .
So rewards become associated with painful activities that we do n’t want to do .
The same goes for grown - ups : money becomes associated with work and work can be dull , tedious and painful .
So when we get paid for something we automatically assume that the task is dull , tedious and painful — even when it is n’t .
This is why play can become work when we get paid .
The person who previously enjoyed painting pictures , weaving baskets , playing the cello or even writing blog posts , suddenly finds the task tedious once money has become involved .
Yes , sometimes rewards do work , especially if people really do n’t want to do something .
But when tasks are inherently interesting to us rewards can damage our motivation by undermining our natural talent for self - regulation .

Lingerie - clad Nicki Minaj grinds on Meek Mill
Nicki Minaj decided she ’d show off her own unique way of warming up and de-stressing before a show , by posting photographs of herself grinding on rapper Meek Mills .
The curvaceous chart - topper was gearing up to perform in Paris , but it seems the city of love had quite the effect on her , and she just could n’t control herself around her rumoured boyfriend .
Clad in a black bra , thong and fishnet bodysuit , the 32 - year - old had some poor soul snap some pictures of the pair , before posting the racy images on her Instagram page .
“ PARISSS !!!!!!!!!!!
U ARE THE FKN TRUTH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I ’m obsessed .
No one FUX with u !!!!!!!
@meekmill thnku for cmn out boo # The PinkprintTOUR , ” she captioned one of the snaps .
The pictures seemingly confirm that the star is dating the Levels hitmaker .
And whilst the images are pretty much ingrained on to our retinas now , it ’s nice to see she ’s been able to move on since her messy split from Safaree Samuels .
Just friends ?
Really ?
( Instagram )
The pair broke up at the end of 2014 after a 10 - year - relationship , during which time ; the producer said he felt like her “ employee . ”
He said on Power 105.1 ’s Breakfast Club radio show , “ I walked away .
I ’m not going to say I broke up , but I ’m the one who walked away .
I packed up my stuff and I left .
I just got to the point where the respect was n’t there .
“ Everyone around her works for her , you know ?
So it got the point where it was like , I ’m your man .
I ’m who you go to sleep with every night .
I ’m who you wake up with every morning .
And it got to the point where I was being treated like an employee , instead of like her man . ”
Nicki warmed up by throwing herself over Meek ( Instagram )
Despite their messy break up , the Anaconda star still seems to have a lot of love for her ex , and on what would have been their 11 - year - anniversary this month she reportedly tweeted then deleted , “ i will always love you . ”
Safaree also took to social media to commemorate the day , posting , “ Im not gonna front like i dnt kno wat today woulda been I hope ur happy and wish u nothing but the best .. luv u 4ever .
no love lost . ”
Nicki accused the blogger who broke the story of writing a “ fraudulent ” article , but did n’t deny tweeting the messages , leaving her fans rather confused about the state of her love life .
However , she ’s certainly been spending a lot with Meek recently , and just last month she posted a snap of the pair looking rather cosy together , cuddling whilst he kissed her on the cheek .
Well , we 've had a chance to have a quick and dirty snoop around Chrome OS and our early conclusions are rather predictable .
This really is a browser with an OS attached rather than vice versa .
You get your tab - based navigation up top , and the focus is of course on the internet , with minimal option buttons on the far right and app launchers at the top left .
Unfortunately , in order to access the more interesting apps , one requires a Google.com login which we do not have , so we were stuck gazing at only the Gmail and Calendar applications .
They act and function much like their online counterparts , but for the significant lag and choppiness that may be attributed to the still very early stage of development or the fact it 's running on a virtual machine .
We did n't manage to find any bugs as such , aside from somehow losing the aforementioned pair of apps on our second login , but that could 've just been due to our own fumbling with the VM software .
One thoroughly pleasing thing to note is that the " machine " booted to the login screen in under 10 seconds , and we were ready to browse the web within another five -- quite a feat already , and if paired to an equally smooth and responsive experience inside the OS , this could completely obliterate quick - launching browsing software like Splashtop Rest assured we 'll be doing our utmost to get access to the full , albeit still skeletal , Chrome OS experience , and as soon as we can take a look at the rest of the apps on offer , we 'll do a more in - depth analysis .
Stay tuned .

Fears over future of Wikipedia as 49,000 volunteers leave site
The free internet encyclopedia is one of the world 's most popular websites and uses volunteers to create pages and check facts
Fears are rising that the usefulness of Wikipedia could be undermined as thousands of volunteer researchers abandon the site .
The free internet encyclopedia is one of the world 's most popular websites and uses volunteers to create pages and check facts .
However the English - language version of the site suffered a net loss of 49,000 volunteer ' editors ' in the first three months of this year , compared with 4,900 for the same period a year earlier , according to a university study .
This is believed to be a result of increased bureaucracy to prevent errors - such as the death of Senator Edward Kennedy being announced prematurely - and the sense that Wikipedia is now part of the establishment .
Founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales , it has become the fifth most popular website in the world with about 325 million visits a month .
It allows registered users to modify entries but this can leave it open to abuse , most recently when its page for footballer Thierry Henry was flooded with obscenities after his handball helped France to beat Ireland in a World Cup play - off .
The research , by Felipe Ortega , at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid , found that tens of thousands of Wikipedia editors were no longer contributing - and were not being replaced .
Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia .
It has become the fifth most popular website in the world with about 325 million visits a month
Mr Ortega , who created a programme analysing the editing history of more than three million Wikipedia contributors , told The Times : ' If you do n't have enough people to take care of the project it could vanish quickly .
' We 're not in that situation yet .
But eventually , if the negative trends follow , we could be in that situation . '
He said contributors ' do n't feel the spirit of the first years ' .
He added : ' The articles are very tightly controlled by others now , and that makes it hard to jump in and contribute . '
Andrew Dalby , author of The World And Wikipedia : How We Are Editing Reality , questioned whether there was much left to add to the site , which already contains around three million articles .
He said it was also becoming more difficult to contribute .
' There is an increase in bureaucracy and rules , ' he said .
' Wikipedia grew because of the lack of rules .
That has been forgotten .
The rules are regarded as irritating and useless by many contributors . '
He added : ' There 's the frustration of realising that what you will do will not stay there forever .
Somebody else will come along and rewrite it , re-edit it and , maybe in your view , spoil it . '
It ’s week three of Sarah Palin ’s “ Going Rogue ” book tour , and while she has been met with rapture from her fans , she has received a wave of hostility from the mainstream media .
David Letterman devoted four minutes of his monologue on publication day to mocking her .
New York Times columnist David Brooks called her a joke , and Newsweek referenced “ The Sound of Music , ” asking on its cover “ How Do You Solve a Problem Like Sarah ? ”
Even domestic diva Martha Stewart weighed in , calling her “ boring ” and “ dangerous . ”
Palin is a media punching bag .
Which is exactly the way she likes it .
It ’s not that Palin is a masochist .
It ’s that she realizes how powerful a weapon contemptuousness toward her can be in the political war she will likely be waging in 2012 .
As commentators revile her , Palin realizes they are also empowering her .
Indeed , she is engaged in one of the greatest feats of rope - a - dope in political history .
Laugh at her , but you laugh at your peril .
She can ride that laughter right into the White House .
Of course , Palin did n’t discover the politics of contempt .
America was born not only as a protest against English political rule but against a larger sense of English superiority .
What distinguished America more than anything else from Europe was its sense of egalitarianism .
Americans tended to bristle at all the European formulations of high culture , and they rapidly devised their own popular culture of dime novels , crime pamphlets , vulgarized theater and more , which was a backlash against “ official ” high - minded European prescriptions .
It is commonplace among intellectuals that vast swaths of American popular culture are largely idiotic .
What those intellectuals never understood is that the popular culture was often idiotic by design -- as an act of hostility and aggression that continues to this day .
Nobody tells ordinary Americans what they should or should not like .
If our popular culture evolved into a kind of protest against hauteur , so did our politics .
Early on , politicians vied to show who was the least patrician and the most plebeian , and the election to the presidency of the hero of the War of 1812 , Andrew Jackson , is often cited as the point at which American politics turned and the egalitarian strain triumphed .
The upper crust hated “ the people ’s president , ” Jackson declaimed , and “ the people ” too .
By instinct or design , he knew just how to play on ordinary folks ’ sense of grievance .
Advertisement
This conflation of the maligned outsider and the maligned populace has been firing American politics ever since .
In contemporary times , no one mastered it as well as Richard Nixon , who came by his anger honestly as a poor boy growing up in Southern California , where he felt ostracized by the local “ in ” crowd .
He spent a lifetime trying to get even .
Nixon was able to turn his entire existence , much less his political career , into a battle between them and us , the Brahmins and ordinary folk , which made his loss to John F. Kennedy more than a personal political loss .
To him , it was a galling defeat of the common man by his presumed social betters .
By the time he ran again for president in 1968 -- after the best and brightest drove us into Vietnam and the liberal social engineers saw their dreams of racial harmony burst by race riots -- Nixon had learned how to nurse Americans ’ resentments , how to make himself the living symbol of the elites ’ alleged hatred for the low - born and how to tap what may be the single deepest reservoir in American politics :
They think they are better than you are .
Nixon understood that anti-elitism trumps everything -- in his case , even his own unlikability .
And when he delivered the masterstroke of lumping the mainstream media in with those elites , he effectively deflected any criticism of him as just more of “ their ” arrogance .
Every time he was attacked , Nixon emphasized , the silent majority of ordinary Americans was attacked .
Palin is playing that same card on the gamble that anti-elitism will trump her own inexperience , incompetence and lack of knowledge .
She knows that the more pundits harp on these so - called deficiencies , and the more the media cover it , the more she can claim that they are really just engaging in an old sport : expressing contempt for ordinary Americans , of which she is the self - proclaimed political exemplar .
Her self - promotion is designed to elicit their contempt for her and express her ’s for them , including the very title of her book .
At one point she describes inviting NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell to Alaska , ostensibly so Palin could be interviewed but really , she says , so that Mitchell and her fancy - pants East Coast crew could be “ slimed ” with fish guts .
Advertisement
We ’ve been getting a lot of stories like that one during this tour , and we ’ll be getting a lot more -- because it is really all Palin has to sell , and because it works .
It may even be more successful than Nixon ’s similar gambit .
Nixon ’s conflation of himself with the people was metaphorical .
He really was n’t very much like them .
Educated at Duke Law School , proud of his own sophistication , he only shared their hostility toward a sneering Eastern establishment .
In some ways , he undermined himself by his envy of the very people who despised him , including Kennedy , about whose success and ease he frequently prattled .
He pined for respect .
Palin appears to be unencumbered by any such complications .
Supporters profess to love her because she is just like them , without airs , which may be true .
Palin seems to have the benefit of her sincerity .
She is n’t a metaphor .
She is something more effective : a personification .
If she prefers the “ worst and the dumbest ” to the “ best and the brightest , ” Palin fans think that is exactly as it should be , which drives the elites to revile her further , which in turn further feeds the Palin contempt machine .
And she knows she has a very good foil in the Ivy League - educated , erudite , articulate Barack Obama , who is obviously everything Palin is n’t .
“ He ’s not one of us ” -- a “ tea - baggers ’ ” cry -- could very easily turn into “ he condescends to us . ”

SarahPalin can only hope that the barrage continues -- that “ they ” keep treating her as if she were a ninny , that “ they ” keep making fun of her .
She can hope because she knows that mockery has a way of triggering revenge , and revenge may be the best politics of all .

Egyptian Christians Fear More Muslim Violence
Egypt ( AINA ) -- Egyptian security forces have intensified their presence in the Upper Egyptian town of Dairout , in anticipation of a recurrence of Muslim violence against Christians .
Copts expressed their fear over leaflets entitled " These have to Die ! " which are being distributed to all Muslims in Dairout and neighborhoods , enticing them to " burn , vandalize and clean the country of these evil immoral infidels . "
Reports from Dairout , 313 km south of Cairo , confirm that Christian Copts are afraid to leave their homes and have stayed indoors since violence against them erupted on October 24 , 2009 .
This collective punishment of Copts was caused by an illicit sexual relationship between a Muslim girl , Hagger Hassouna , and the Christian Romany Farouk Attallah .
It was rumored that he sent videos of them intimately together to cell phones in Dairout before fleeing .
This prompted the Hassouna family to kill his father , Farouk Attallah , on October 19 , 2009 , in revenge .
Four of the Hassouna killers were detained by prosecution , leading to Muslim riots against the Copts ( AINA 10-27-2009 ) .
According to Wagih Yacoub of the Middle East Christian Assosiation ( MECA ) , Muslim - owned businesses are now displaying stickers with ' Allah Akbar ' ( Allah is Great ) to differentiate between them and Coptic - owned businesses , as a form of pre-planning for a forthcoming wave of Muslim violence .
Handwritten leaflets ( Arabic ) have been circulated among Muslims in Dairout for the last two days ; they call on Muslims to unite to take revenge for their religion and honor , claiming that Hagger Hassouna is innocent and that she was forced into vice , and " all Jews and Christians should come to learn that Muslim honor is precious . "
The fliers state that Muslims are the masters of the world since beginning of times until the present day , and entices them to " burn and vandalize and clean the country of the evil immoral infidels . "
It also calls on Muslims to take revenge for the " rings of prostitution " which are the churches and in particular the church in the village of Ezbet Hanna .
Those specifically named to be killed are Reverend Pavlos of the Church of the Virgin Mary , Coptic lawyer Gamal Youssef , two brothers who own an optometry practice , and a Copt who owns a beauty saloon and photography shop .
Muslims are asked to die for their honor and they will be rewarded with eternal paradise .
" Do not say it is a matter of just a girl , no , it is a public and a serious issue , it is the biggest issue , it is Islam 's issue . "
A transcript of the the leaflet ( in Arabic ) is published on Copts United website .
A video that surfaced yesterday entitled " Revenge for Honor , " showing a half - naked girl , assumed to be a Copt , is being distributed all over Dairout on cell phones .
Ezzat Aziz of Copts United reported on the contents of the video of the assumed Coptic girl by saying " Details of the video shows the fear experienced by the girl as four Muslim men were undressing her . "
According to Aziz the video seemed to have been shot in a secluded house and the girl was threatened to get undressed and was begging her captors to let her go as she was tired .
She was half - naked , but refused to take off the rest of her clothes .
The men repeatedly asked her if she " knew the Dairout Girl . "
Comparing the videos , Aziz said that the first ( of Hagger Hassouna ) shows " a girl who knew what she was doing " while the second ( of the assumed Coptic girl ) was of " a girl forced to undress . "
Aziz did not say whether the Coptic girl was named in the video , but he mentioned that the four men forcing her to undress proudly gave their full names .
Coptic websites have refused to publish the video of Hagger Hassouna , saying it would be incompatible with Christian ethics .
On Saturday , October , 31 the four Muslims accused of killing Farouk Attallah are expected appear in court again .
A repeat of the Muslim mob violence which took place on October 24 is anticipated should prosecution extend their detainment once again .

This morning 's massive breakfast picnic which closed the Sydney Harbour Bridge could become an annual event .
Sydney 's first Breakfast on the Bridge , held as part of a city - wide food festival , has been hailed a success , with about 6,000 picnic goers in attendance .
The eight lanes of bitumen were given a temporary makeover before dawn , including 10,000 metres of turf , live music and even a small herd of cows .
Sid Elias , who proposed to his girlfriend at the picnic , says he and his now fiance plan to spend their anniversaries at future picnics if it does become a fixture .
" I think I will yes - great story to tell , " he said .
Another picnic goer , James Beauchamp , says the event had a festive feel .
" It 's been fantastic - we just came in by train and there was a big queue but everyone was really friendly , " he said .
" I think it 's been a bit of a carnival atmosphere ; everyone really enjoying it and getting into the spirit and having a good time . "
Participants in the picnic were drawn from a ballot of 45,000 people and had to set up to eat from as early as 5:45 am ( AEDT ) .
Organisers have been rolling up and removing the tens of thousands of metres of turf and clearing the bridge , which was due to reopen at 1:00 pm ( AEDT ) .
New South Wales Premier Nathan
Rees earlier today added to speculation the event may become an annual fixture , hailing it as a major success .
Meanwhile , a man has been charged with driving offences after a police chase over the closed Harbour Bridge early this morning .
It is alleged the 25 - year - old man failed to stop at a police checkpoint at Kirribilli around 3:00 am and then lead police over the bridge and into the CBD .
I never managed a group larger than 5 people , luckily for the people in the group ( perhaps more so for those remaining outside ) .
Good managers are hard to find , which is the basis of my self - motivating motto : " This job could have been done worse " .
Such is the background for the hereby presented pearls of wisdom assortment .
As to " The Virtue of a Manager " title , it 's a ripoff of Paul Krugman 's exquisite title " The Conscience of a Liberal " .
" The Private Part of a Self - Important Self - Description " is a great template .
***
A prime virtue of a manager is the ability to take pride in someone else 's work .
No , seriously .
We 've recently deployed a debugger internally and an algorithm developer had a look at it .
I knew it was good , but it 's used to debug the sort of thing algo devs hate : code with an anal - retentive performance focus .
So the last thing I expected was praise , but praise it the guy did .
Now , I had previously known proud moments from having done things myself , and here I had this proud moment with 90 % of the work done by someone else .
And I 'm telling you , it was just like the real thing .
***
The defining trait of a manager is the distinctly wide gap between responsibility and understanding .
By far the funniest spot to have a gap at , hence the easiest target for a low blow : try to make jokes about a gap between one 's teeth and you 'll soon be exhausted , but this here is gold .
This is mean - spirited though .
Imagine living with a gap between your responsibility and your understanding and everybody laughing at you – how would that make you feel ?
Show compassion .
***
One can have the title of a manager or nominal reports for any of a number of reasons :
An HR system with per-title wage ceilings : can't give someone a raise without faking a title .
A diametrically opposed case : some forms of brain damage cause people to accept lower paychecks given more impressive titles , larger rooms , etc .
Someone is too senior to report to a team leader but does n't want a team to report to him , either .
…
In a roomful of managers , how do you find the real ones among this variety – not " real " as opposed to incompetent or unimportant , but " real " as opposed to fake ?
There are several cues , for example , only real managers can have other managers report to them .
But the perfect , if - and - only - if discriminator is that real managers do n't write code .
( The precise rule is that they can spend up to 2 % of their time on a favorite piece of code without getting disqualified . )
***
The principal function of a manager is being the responsible adult .
Some managers occasionally point this out in frustration , both mourning their technical skills which dry up during their current gig where they only get to exercise adulthood , and because being the adult means getting tired of the annoying kids .
A gal who both managed and met literally hundreds of managers during her career in some consulting agency said " Now I really understand management " when she got to babysit .
This is why I have hard time believing management can be taught – you can't teach adulthood , it can only result from people growing up by themselves .
I 'm not sure if this feeling is fully aligned with reality , but quite some very successful managers never went to a management school ( at least one of those is somewhat critical of MBAs ) , and some of those who went say it was worthless in terms of useful things learned .
The opposite is also true : childishness is fitting for a programmer .
We were two fake code - writing managers in a meeting with one real one , and at one point the real one said : " Let 's not be childish about this " .
The technically correct reply to her would have been " I 'M NOT CHILDISH ABOUT THIS , HE IS ! " , but I suppressed it for tactical reasons .
Some time later I told her : " You do n't want us to stop being childish about this , not as long as you 're interested in our output as programmers .
Recall : the reason you are n't still programming is because of not being childish enough to truly enjoy this sort of game . "
And in fact since she started managing 20 programmers , she 's been talking about her work all the time , which she did n't when she was programming .
Well , some people like to play and some prefer to babysit .
( I 'm not sure where this leaves the quasi - managers who write code ; presumably some are the elder and most responsible kid while others are the most restless who invent games for the gang . )

I 've recently got a driving license .
One thing I learned was that someone pushing his ( presumably broken ) car along the road is a " driver " as far as the law is concerned .
I find this counter - intuitive , probably because pushing a car is not categorized in my head as " driving experience " , but , at least in Israel , that 's the law .
Likewise , doing the work of three people is not what most of us associate with " managerial responsibility " .
However , if you 're given two reports without a drive of their own to work , that 's what your responsibility will be .
***
A manager will have favorite words .
For example : acute ( critical ) , priorities , agenda , rationale , integrity ( shoot this manager first ) , responsibility ( ownership ) , stakeholder .
Keep laughing at them .
Once you become a manager , you 'll have favorite words whether you want it or not – it is useless to resist the dynamics inherent to your situation .
My favorite word is " dynamics " .
Its connotations are deep and its applicability wide – heartily recommended .
***
Managers get to do a lot of knowledge - free decision making , which necessarily drives them insane .
Here 's how the manager 's bipolar disorder works .
During maniacal periods , the manager is the only one who can do anything around here .
This frequently happens when the manager is under external pressure , and he feels that control is slipping out of his hands .
He 's trying to compensate for his lack of knowledge by immense concentration and willpower .
( Managers always have ample emergency supplies of both . ) " Concentration " translates to an ability to derive general and far - reaching conclusions from insignificant details , then " willpower " translates to aggression .
Then depression follows : " Do n't bother me with details " .
This results partly from exhaustion quickly arrived at during the mania ( especially if reports were wise enough to not argue with the manager , letting his efforts defeat their own purpose . )
The manager has delivered his trademark concentration and willpower , so he no longer feels guilty on that front .
However , he 's overwhelmed by information and ( rightly ) feels that he does n't know what 's going on .
He decides it is none of his business and concentrates on the Big Picture ( does nothing ) .
Usually , the cycle repeats upon a new wave of external pressure .
Awareness of the management cycle on behalf of the manager himself can help soften the cycle but not eliminate it .
It is up to reports to apply counter - cycle measures by scheduling most work into depression periods when it is least disrupted .
Special attention must be given to long - term projects , frequently characterized by a prolonged depressive apathy period at the beginning followed by a period of maniacal frenzy lasting until the end .

There 's a naive brain model in the spirit of " the brain has a reptilian part , a mammal part and a human part " .
For example , if a student fails to answer a question in an oral exam with his human brain , the mammal brain feels bad about it and complains to the reptilian brain .
The reptilian brain then cheerfully replies , " Who 's causing the trouble ?
Oh , that little guy behind the table ?
Not to worry – I 'll kill him " .
The higher brains then supposedly suppress this – " What do you think this is , reptile – Jurassic Park ? " , and the tension is translated into sweating .
The manager is the team 's reptilian brain ; he does n't know enough to do real thinking , but he 's good at " taking responsibility " , bargaining , fighting , socializing , etc .
A manager does n't know how to implement the feature , except for suspecting , based on experience , that it will conflict with a couple other features and it will take a week or three for the whole thing to stabilize ( with him taking the heat when things break during those weeks ) .
Therefore , instead of technical advice ( which he might be otherwise qualified to give ) , he 'll propose something which solves the problem at his favorite social plane :
Prioritize the feature away , delaying the implementation until forever
Negotiate the feature away , by talking to whoever wants it out of it for something in return
Redefine the feature away , by reducing the scope to the few scenarios which absolutely can't be ignored
…
Do not drag management into anything you actually want solved .
Presented with a question , the manager will answer it by killing the little guy behind the table , so only go to him if you really want that .
And once awakened , he might take a lot of sweat to suppress .
( If he 's really a programmer posing as a quasi - manager , the chances for an actual solution can actually be worse : he 's more likely to feel guilty about his managerial ability and use the opportunity to exercise and develop that ability , instead of using his technical ability to think about the issue . )

There 's this quote from The Mythical Man-Month , supposedly by a pessimistic manager :
All programmers are optimists .
Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy god-mothers .
Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal .
Perhaps it is merely that computers are young , programmers are younger , and the young are always optimists .
But however the selection process works , the result is indisputable : " This time it will surely run , " or " I just found the last bug . "
This is backwards .
In reality , programmers are the more pessimistic people .
Perhaps it 's because experience teaches programmers that programs always have bugs while teaching managers that programs always ship .
Perhaps it 's because the programmer is the one with the actual knowledge , and the ignorant are always optimists .
But however the selection process works , how many programmers have you seen saying " it will never work " and how many managers ?
A programmer might be more optimistic locally , hoping in vain to have fixed this one piece of code where he has the illusion of complete understanding .
However , it is invariably the manager who believes that everything will work out .
A programmer can't really believe that because there are so many things nobody even understands that are yet to be faced .
But the manager is used to knowing little and understanding less , and thus has learned to translate uncertainty to optimism .
In fact a programmer can learn it , too , in the areas which are of little interest to him .
I know a programmer who does n't care about optimization and who consequently describes others ' efforts to fit a program into a given performance budget as doomed to success : " It runs at the word of command " – a programmer 's expression of the managerial worldview worthy of a seasoned manager .
***
We do n't know how to test for programming ability .
The best tech companies spend 5 to 10 interviews to solidly confirm that the candidate knows what is taught during the first 1.5 years of an undergraduate CS curriculum .
Other processes measure less accurately by asking less relevant questions ; the inaccuracy is somewhat ameliorated by the lack of precision – the non-uniform quirks of interviewers and general randomness of the process eliminate biases , causing all kinds of good candidates to sneak through the gates .
It is well known that we can't find out during the interview what we inevitably find out once someone gets the job , but what are the corollaries ?
Here 's one I 've heard a lot : trust recommendations more than interviews .
Here 's another I have n't : let others interview and get the new hires , then steal the best .
( Objection : the first recommendation is good for the company while the other is only good for the manager following it .
Well , " competition between managers over team members is n't a zero - sum game – it improves teamwork across the company " , this one we weasel out of in a snap . )

We have a VIP club at work called Bottleneck , its principal activity being the collective purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages .
The club operates during work hours ( regular meetings held on Thursdays , emergency meetings scheduled upon arrival of packages from abroad ) .
Our room being the headquarters , I 'm naturally a member .
By now the club has shifted to high - end liquors at prices causing the consumption to contract to a sip per cup of coffee , but originally it was affordable to actually drink .
I noticed that minor alcoholic intoxication has a notable impact on my programming ability .
I can still lay my hands on the right variable , but by the time I do I forget what you do next with these things .
There 's that handy member somewhere in it , dot something , but dot what ?
However , managerial ability is not affected .
Things I can do just fine following a meeting of the Bottleneck club include progress monitoring , planning , risk assessment , general technical advice , and requirement negotiation .
Now that I think of it , perhaps the managerial functions are affected for the better .

netless .
a digital network that is using city public transport as its information carrier .
permission - less , distributed and friend - 2 - friend , netless is an independent communication tactic ; invisible digital network that does not need wires or dedicated radio frequencies .
alternative communication device that helps its users to avoid such controlled and observed space as the internet .
free from governmentally owned medium channels ( radio frequency ranges , emission power regulations ) , proprietary locked technologies and cable networks , netless stays Yours Truly .
netless is an anamorphic structure of nodes that is capable of holding some amounts of digital data .
each node is a small , low - power wireless digital transponder .
there is no permanent network connection .
every time any node would appear in the vicinity of any other node - they would establish a wireless link and swap the data that was stored internally .
netless is [ re|mis|ab ] - using city transportation grid as its data backbone .
nodes of the network are attached to city vehicles - trams , buses , taxis and possibly - pedestrians .
information exchange between the nodes happens only when the carriers pass by each other in the city traffic .
digital data switches its routes just the same way you 'd switch from tram # 2 to bus # 5 .
the similarities between city transportation maps and circuitry of modern networks are not accidental .
their purposes are identical - to provide efficient transport flow between all the locations of the area they cover .
routes are designed to match the necessary throughput without congesting at peak times .
so why not to use already existing city transportation network for digital data transfers ?
netless nodes act as parts of automated ' sneaker ' network , physically transporting the data and sharing it with all other nodes along the way .
in order to retrieve data , user must join netless by becoming a node and getting out to the city .
surely , in a few hours the user node will retrieve complete contents of the network ( for that particular period ) , which can be further filtered and deciphered .
the principal of data gathering and distribution of netless is left intentionally primitive .
any node tries to retrieve any new data available to it and pass it onto any other node .
like this the entire network stays in sync , allowing new data to replace old one .
each time a file is being transfered from node to node , the TTL ( Time - To - Live ) value of the file is decreased and once reached zero that file may be replaced by a new one .
netless nodes are not meant to run on batteries *.
they would retrieve energy from such ' natural ' sources as machinery vibration , radio frequency static noise , audible and non-audible sounds and noises and solar power .
in a well saturated city environment the netless network would be completely self - sustainable and capable of running on its own forever .

Plaintiffs in a federal suit seeking to overturn Prop. 8 - two same - sex couples , a gay - rights organization and the city of San Francisco - contend that the measure 's real purpose was to strip a historically persecuted minority group of rights held by the majority .
If the courts find that the ballot measure was motivated by discrimination , they could strike it down without having to decide whether gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry .
" The intent or purpose of Prop. 8 is central to this litigation , " Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker declared Thursday in requiring backers of the November 2008 measure to give the opposing side their internal campaign communications .
Backers ' argument
A day earlier , Prop 8 's sponsors told Walker in a court filing that their opponents ' claim of anti-gay motivation is legally irrelevant .
In a final round of arguments seeking to uphold the measure without a trial , defenders of the ballot measure said California voters were entitled to amend their Constitution to preserve the traditional , male - female definition of marriage for numerous reasons - including a belief that " extending marriage to same - sex couples carries a risk of weakening the institution of marriage . "
Because there is no constitutional right to same - sex marriage , it would n't matter if the plaintiffs could show that Prop.
8 " was also accompanied by irrational attitudes such as animus , " or prejudice against lesbians and gays , said attorney Charles Cooper .
The initiative , approved by 52 percent of the voters , overturned the state Supreme Court 's May 2008 ruling that gave gays and lesbians the right to marry in California .
The state court upheld Prop. 8 as a valid state constitutional amendment in May but also ruled that 18,000 same - sex couples who married before the election were legally wed .
Walker has scheduled an Oct. 14 hearing in San Francisco on whether to dismiss the suit or let it go to trial in January .
Judge looks for bias
In previous rulings , Walker has said the constitutionality of Prop. 8 is not an open - and - shut legal question but could depend on a variety of factors , including whether backers were biased against gays and lesbians .
He amplified that view Thursday in ordering Prop. 8 's sponsors to disclose documents , including notes and e-mails between campaign officials and consultants , that discussed their strategy and the message they wanted to send to the voters .
Although " voters can not be asked to explain their votes , " Walker said , a ballot measure 's authors and strategists can be scrutinized to see what their motives were .
He cited a magazine article last year by the heads of the public relations firm that managed the Prop.
8 campaign in which they discussed their strategy , including plans to show how advocates of same - sex marriage would indoctrinate schoolchildren .
Walker said the article undermined the campaign 's insistence that its strategy discussions were confidential .
Bad precedent ?
Andrew Pugno , a lawyer for the Prop. 8 sponsors , said Friday it was unprecedented to allow " the losing side of a campaign to pry into the most intimate strategy discussions of the winning side . "
" This will make any citizen group think twice before attempting a ballot initiative , " Pugno said .
He said his clients might ask a federal appeals court to intervene .
A lawyer for the plaintiffs , Theodore Boutrous , said Walker 's order would allow them to see whether the justifications Prop.
8 's defenders are now claiming for the measure were part of the campaign or after - the - fact rationales .
" Our position is not dependent on the notion that everyone who voted for Proposition 8 was acting out of bad motives , " Boutrous said .
He said the plaintiffs would look for " evidence that bolsters our argument that Proposition 8 was irrational and disfavors a group in a way that 's unconstitutional . "
Sci -fi film makers have for years had to solve a tricky problem :
How should electric cars sound ?
Nissan ’s facing a similar problem for its real e-car , and turned back to Sci-fi–its Leaf EV will sound like those in Blade Runner .
Over at AllCarsElectric they ’ve got a post about this very issue , highlighting the work of Nissan ’s Toshiyuki Tabata .
An engineer for many years concerned with suppressing the sounds Nissan ’s vehicles make , Tabata is now leading the team that ’s crafting the artificial sounds Nissan ’s future electric cars will make .
The team decided that trying to recreate the sound of an internal combustion engine was crazy , despite Nissan ’s management steering them in this direction .
I say hats - off to Tabata for making this very bold decision : “ We decided that if we ’re going to do this , if we have to make sound , then we ’re going to make it beautiful and futuristic . ”
Instead of looking to the past of the automotive industry –not particularly identified with the making of beautiful sounds ( though a Ferrari ’s purr is close ) –Tabata looked to film scores , since the artists involved here were trying to craft attractive sounds .
Eventually Tabata ’s team succeeded in producing a sound “ closer to the world of art ” and settled on high - pitched sounds not too dissimilar to the noises made by the flying Spinner cars in Ridley Scott ’s Blade Runner .
They wo n’t be permanently emanating from the car though , only between 0 and 12 mph , at which point road and air turbulence noise become significant .
And if you ’re busy wondering what all the fuss is about electric cars and noise , then you ’ll need to know the entire electric car industry is deep in thought about the matter .
Fisker has decided Karma drivers can select different sounds–one of which is half F1 - car , half - jet engine .
Chevy ’s still deciding how its
Volt will sound .
VW ’s E -up apparently sounds like a gasoline - engine , and there ’s even a patent for an electromechanical device to do it all automatically .
Why all the effort ?
It ’s to address safety concerns .
Electric cars that use 100 % electric motive power generate very little noise of their own –which is a good thing , as noise constitutes wasted energy .
But lawmakers and road - safety advocates are concerned that e-vehicles will thus pose a danger to pedestrians and other road users , used to checking for the sound of an oncoming vehicle before crossing the road .
While you could argue that people should really look before crossing , then these same advocates say , “ Ah , but what about blind people ? ”
While the point is fairly made , and the safety of the vision - impaired is paramount , it does smack of a nannyish approach .
Bicycles can move faster than 12 mph and do so pretty silently –are we suggesting these should emanate zapping noises too ?
There ’s also a lesson from history that highlights the strangeness of this thinking :
In 1865 the U.K. passed a new Locomotives
Act which required all road - going self - propelled vehicles to be proceeded by a man walking 60 yards ahead with a red flag or lantern to warn pedestrians and horse - riders of the oncoming danger .
Its requirements were lessened in 1878 , though vehicles were n’t permitted to make smoke or steam for fear of scaring horses .
It was n’t repealed until 1896 .
Personally I think artificial electric car noises wo n’t be in our future for long .
Once we ’re all used to the idea of the silent vehicle we wo n’t need sounds .
And I love the idea of significantly reduced noise pollution from the streets outside all our homes .
Saying this , however , I ’ll admit I wish Nissan ’s Tabata had skipped Blade Runner and gone for Forbidden Planet instead–it ’d be much more fun if our cars sounded like Robbie The Robot ’s : ( check out the clip from about 2:15 onwards )
Sen. Specter Emerges as Key Civil Liberties Advocate in Patriot Act Markup
Created : October 08 , 2009 11:19 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) just gave a remarkable speech at the Senate Judiciary Committee markup session explaining why he ’s voting against reauthorization of the Patriot Act provisions because the substitute Leahy - Feinstein bill , which I described earlier today , does n’t adequately protect American civil liberties .
Responding to Sen. Dianne Feinstein ’s ( D - Calif. ) assurances that the bill , as proposed , is necessary and important based on classified information she ’s received that ca n’t be shared with the American public , Specter demurred .
“ We have moved a distance from where we were before , in requiring a foreign terror connection , ” he said , noting that several provisions of the bill no longer require that .
“ In 2005 , the bill was handled unanimously .
The core of the bill required a connection with a foreign power .
That ’s really what we ’re looking for here in the Patriot Act .
When that requirement is taken away it seems to me it guts the structure of the Patriot Act .
You have the provision of lone wolf , with no connection to a foreign power , which is the core of the patriots act .
It has n’t been used at all .
It seems to me something this committee ought not rush to retain . ”
As for “ roving wiretaps , ” Specter added that he opposed those back in 2001 because they failed to require the FBI to specify who they ’re wiretapping .
“ The whole point of probable cause for search and seizure is probable cause with specificity , ” said Specter .
“ Our committee ought to be more assertive as a guardian of separation of powers .
This has a philosophical connection to what we ’re doing on state secrets , ” he said , referring to the state secrets privilege that the Justice Department has repeatedly asserted to dismiss lawsuits charging government wrongdoing .
“ Now all you have to do is have the executive branch assert state secrets and that closes the matter . …
It ’s still the executive branch , without judicial review to take a look . ”
He continued , “ I would hope this committee would be more assertive of the separation of powers under the Constitution . ”
It ’s not all that surprising that Yale University Press would be wary of reprinting notoriously controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a forthcoming book .
After all , when the 12 caricatures were first published by a Danish newspaper a few years ago and reprinted by other European publications , Muslims all over the world angrily protested , calling the images  which included one in which Muhammad wore a turban in the shape of a bomb  blasphemous .
In the Middle East and Africa some rioted , burning and vandalizing embassies ; others demanded a boycott of Danish goods ; a few nations recalled their ambassadors from Denmark .
In the end at least 200 people were killed .
So Yale University and Yale University Press consulted two dozen authorities , including diplomats and experts on Islam and counterterrorism , and the recommendation was unanimous :
The book , “ The Cartoons That Shook the World , ” should not include the 12 Danish drawings that originally appeared in September 2005 .
What ’s more , they suggested that the Yale press also refrain from publishing any other illustrations of the prophet that were to be included , specifically , a drawing for a children ’s book ; an Ottoman print ; and a sketch by the 19th - century artist Gustave Doré of Muhammad being tormented in Hell , an episode from Dante ’s “ Inferno ” that has been depicted by Botticelli , Blake , Rodin and Dalí .
The book ’s author , Jytte Klausen , a Danish - born professor of politics at Brandeis University , in Waltham , Mass. , reluctantly accepted Yale University Press ’s decision not to publish the cartoons .
But she was disturbed by the withdrawal of the other representations of Muhammad .
All of those images are widely available , Ms. Klausen said by telephone , adding that “ Muslim friends , leaders and activists thought that the incident was misunderstood , so the cartoons needed to be reprinted so we could have a discussion about it . ”
The book is due out in November .
A ban on the use of massive deep - sea fishing nets in South Pacific waters is about to be announced .
Gillnets , which can be 100 kilometres long , are banned in European waters but are allowed in the South Pacific .
Australia and New Zealand proposed the ban after two Spanish boats were spotted fishing with gillnets between the two countries .
A meeting is underway in New Zealand and it is expected the ban will be announced tonight or tomorrow , and will be in force by February .
Duncan Currie from Greenpeace says the ban must be total and long - lasting .
" Unfortunately the history of fishing shows that if boats think a buck can be made then they will try to use whatever sort of loophole to come down here , " he said .
" There was a deep - sea gillnet found in Antarctic waters which measured in total 130 kilometres long ; these things do have to be watched very carefully . "
Deadly nets
A week ago the ABC reported that gillnet was bulging with 29 tonnes of Antarctic toothfish and a significant bycatch of skates .
Toothfish stocks in the Southern Ocean are under threat and the two species of toothfish - antarctic and patagonian - are seriously depleted .
Australian authorities found the illegal net in the Southern Ocean , in an area managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ( CCAMLR ) .
Gillnets target fish species that live on the bottom of the ocean such as the beleaguered deepwater dogfish .
Australia 's deepwater migratory sharks and other fish species are likely to be caught in the nets , including harrison 's dogfish , which is considered to be critically endangered due to overfishing .
The gillnet fleets are targeting sharks for their meat and for liver oil which is used around the world in cosmetics .
The oil from the deepwater dogfish is highly prized .
Gillnets are a particularly lethal form of fishing .
If the fishing net gets lost , it acts like a " ghost net " and continues to catch fish as it bobs about in the ocean .

Bernie Ecclestone says he is disappointed that Force India did not give its vacant seat to Indian GP2 driver Karun Chandhok .
Vijay Mallya's squad promoted reserve driver Tonio Liuzzi to the race drive made available by Giancarlo Fisichella 's switch to Ferrari from Monza onwards .
But Ecclestone believes the team should have picked Chandhok , who is in his third season of GP2 .
" I was hoping Vijay would give Karun a chance , " Ecclestone told the Hindustan Times .
" And I 'm a little disappointed that he has put the Italian guy in ...
Whether he has to do this by contract I do n't know , but I would 've liked to see Karun in the car for rest of the season . "
The Formula 1 commercial rights holder is keen to get Chandhok on the grid to help build interest in the sport in India ahead of the nation 's first grand prix in 2011 .
" We need to get Karun in the Formula 1 car quickly , " said Ecclestone , " and he has got the talent and the ability , so it 's a case of somebody just getting on and doing it now . "
Chandhok was a race winner in GP2 with iSport last season but has had a more difficult time with the Ocean team this year , with a third place at Silverstone his only podium finish to date .
Clutterhs 0.1
This is a very early announcement for an initial release of bindings for Clutter 1.0 , now on Hackage , http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clutterhs
What is Clutter ?
------------------
See http://www.clutter-project.org/
Clutter is a GObject based library for creating 2.5D interfaces using OpenGL .
It 's currently being used in projects such as Intel 's Moblin platform and GNOME Shell .
Clutterhs
----------------
It uses c2hs , and depends on gtk2hs from darcs for the glib / gobject bindings .
Overall , its usage should be similar to gtk2hs .
Most of the core Clutter components are mostly bound .
Currently missing are relatively low level pieces , and some backend specific stuff , ClutterListModel , ClutterUnits , and a few random pieces scattered around .
There is some documentation , but that is also currently incomplete .
More examples and a tutorial are planned .
Right now for examples , I suggest people look at the simple demos in the git repository .
The best example to look at for usage would be http://jayne.hortont.com/git/cgit.cgi/clutterhs.git/tree/clutter/demo/ClutterGame.hs
This is my first Haskell project , and suggestions on the API , bug reports , etc. are appreciated .
Special thanks to Sean O'Sullivan and Rensselaer Center for Open Source for their generous support .

The way a person becomes smart is to store in their brain only the information that they have to know , dismissing the rest .
If it ’s written down , I do n’t need to know it .
That ’s what Albert Einstein would have you believe .
But not Damjan Stanković .
In an ideal Damjan Stanković world , you ’d know how long you were at that stoplight because it would tell you what it ’s up to .
Tell me what you ’re up to , stoplight !
Do n’t hold back your secrets , you stoplight you !
I would love to know how much time I have before I am able to race to the next copy of you .
I want to know how much time I have so I can hurry up and stop again !
Truly .
Stanković promotes this stoplight as an eco solution in the following ways :
If you ’ve got the amount of time you ’ve got to stop in front of you , you can shut your engine off , wait , be calm , and turn it back on again when the time is almost up .
This not only lessens the amount of gas you use sitting still , but it lessens the amount of crazy madness you have wondering if the stoplight is stuck , or just really , really long .

My thought process for this hand went like this .
Villian is a winning regular .
By checking back the flop , I know that he almost certainly does not have a flush draw .
I put his range on KT or less .
When he bets the river , I ’m almost always beat .
He can easily have A8 , maybe AJ , or he might be on a complete bluff .
Now if we look at the hand from my perspective , I check the flop .
If i had a flush draw , I would check with the intention of raising most of the time .
He checks behind .
I lead the turn .
If I had a flush draw , I would lead turn almost all the time if my opponent checked back the flop .
Villain cannot eliminate a flush draw from my range because I would have played it exactly the same .
So why turn a made hand into a bluff ?
Well , I ca n’t call because I ’m beat probably 80 % of the time here .
My hand is strictly a bluff catcher and a bad one at that because he can be betting for value so many hands that crush my meager jacks .
But I do have this little thought in my head which is my opponent cannot have a flush and I can .
On the spot I have to weigh my options , is it better to check fold or is it better to check raise .
I decided to make the raise and it was the correct decision .
Poker is fun when you are able to get to this high level thought process .
One of my strengths in poker is the ability to find spots to turn made hands into bluffs .
Not many people do this but it is something to think about .
However , in order to do this , you have to be able to put all the information together and have a good reason to do so .
It is commonplace , 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , to hear the events of that time described as miraculous , a dream come true , something one could n’t have imagined even a couple of months beforehand .
Free elections in Poland with Lech Walesa as president : who would have thought it possible ?
But an even greater miracle took place only a couple of years later : free democratic elections returned the ex-Communists to power , Walesa was marginalised and much less popular than General Jaruzelski himself .
This reversal is usually explained in terms of the ‘ immature ’ expectations of the people , who simply did n’t have a realistic image of capitalism : they wanted to have their cake and eat it , they wanted capitalist - democratic freedom and material abundance without having to adapt to life in a ‘ risk society ’ – i.e. without losing the security and stability ( more or less ) guaranteed by the Communist regimes .
When the sublime mist of the ‘ velvet revolution ’ had been dispelled by the new democratic - capitalist reality , people reacted in one of three ways : with nostalgia for the ‘ good old days ’ of Communism ; by embracing right - wing nationalist populism ; with belated anti-Communist paranoia .
The first two reactions are easy to understand , and they often overlap ( as in today ’s Russia ) .
The same rightists who , decades ago , were shouting ‘ Better dead than red ! ’ are now often heard mumbling ‘ Better red than eating hamburgers . ’
The nostalgia for Communism should n’t be taken too seriously : far from expressing an actual wish to return to a grey Socialist reality , it is a form of mourning , of gently getting rid of the past .
And nationalist populism , far from being peculiar to Eastern Europe , is a common feature of all countries caught in the vortex of globalisation .
Much more interesting is the recent resurrection of anti-Communism , everywhere from Hungary to Slovenia .
In October 2006 , large protests against the ruling Socialist Party paralysed Hungary for weeks .
Protesters blamed the country ’s economic crisis on its leaders , the Communists ’ successors .
They denied the legitimacy of the government , although it came to power after democratic elections , and when police were used to restore a minimum level of civil order , comparisons were drawn with the Soviet army ’s crushing of the 1956 uprising .
In short , it was said that the Velvet Revolution of 1989 had to be repeated since , beneath the false appearance of democracy , nothing had really changed , the same dark forces were pulling the strings of power .
In December 2006 , Poland strengthened the ‘ lustration ’ law , which made it illegal for collaborators with the Communist secret police and others linked with the old regime to hold public office .
Another aspect of the same process is the redefinition in the Baltic countries and in Slovakia of Nazi collaborators as ‘ anti-Communist combatants ’ ; their collaboration , even their participation in anti-semitic pogroms , is justified as a tough but necessary part of the patriotic struggle against Communism , as a lesser evil .
In the Ukrainian Velvet Revolution that brought Viktor Yushchenko to power , the same songs were sung that used to be sung by Ukrainian nationalists who collaborated with the German occupation .
No wonder that , at the instigation of some post - Communist countries , the European Parliament passed a resolution equating Communism with Nazism .
And no wonder that , in Slovenia , the populist right reproaches the left for being a ‘ force of continuity ’ – with the old Communist regime .
New problems and challenges are seen in terms of old struggles and the call for gay rights darkly interpreted as part of a Communist plot to demoralise the nation .
How and why are these ghosts being raised in countries where many young people do n’t even remember Communism ?
Anti-Communists ask a simple question – ‘ If capitalism is really so much better than socialism , why are our lives still miserable ? ’ – and offer an equally straightforward answer : it is because we do n’t yet have capitalism , we do n’t yet have true democracy .
Ex-Communists are still in power , disguised as owners and managers .
We need another purge , the revolution must be repeated .
One ca n’t help noticing the resemblance with the way the old Communist regime used to put the blame for its failures on the continuing influence of the ‘ forces of the past ’ .
This new generation of anti-Communists has an image of society that is uncannily similar to the traditional leftist image of capitalism : a society in which formal democracy is a mask concealing the rule of a wealthy minority .
In other words , the anti-Communists do n’t see that what they are denouncing as a perverted pseudo - capitalism simply is capitalism .
Indeed , one could argue that , when the Communist regimes collapsed , the disillusioned former Communists were better suited to run the new capitalist economy than the populist dissidents .
While the heroes of the anti-Communist protests continued to indulge their dreams of a new society based on justice , honesty and solidarity , the ex-Communists were able without difficulty to accommodate themselves to the new capitalist rules .
Paradoxically , in the new post - Communist condition , the anti-Communists stood for the utopian dream of a true democracy , while the ex-Communists stood for the cruel new world of market efficiency , with all its corruption and dirty tricks .
Is capitalist realism the only answer to socialist utopianism ?
Was what followed the fall of the Wall really the era of capitalist maturity , the leaving behind of all utopias ?
What if that era relied on a utopia of its own ?
November 1989 marked the beginning of the ‘ happy 1990s ’ , Francis Fukuyama ’s utopian ‘ end of history ’ : liberal democracy , he announced , had effectively won , the advent of a global , liberal world community lurked just around the corner , and the remaining obstacles to this happy ending were merely contingent ( pockets of resistance where the local leaders had n’t yet grasped that their day was done ) .
In contrast , 9/11 marked the symbolic end of the ‘ happy 1990s ’ : it signalled the beginning of our current era , in which new walls are springing up everywhere , between Israel and the West Bank , around the European Union , on the US - Mexico border – but also within single states .
It seems that Fukuyama ’s 1990s utopia had to die twice : the collapse of the liberal - democratic political utopia on 9/11 did not affect the economic utopia of global market capitalism , but the 2008 financial meltdown surely has .
In the 1990s , it was believed that humanity had finally found the formula for an optimal socio-economic order .
The experience of the last few decades has clearly shown that the market is not a benign mechanism that works best when left alone .
It requires violence to create the conditions necessary for it to function .
The way market fundamentalists react to the turmoil that ensues when their ideas are implemented is typical of utopian ‘ totalitarians ’ : they blame the failure on compromise – there is still too much state intervention – and demand an even more radical implementation of market doctrine .
Today we observe the explosion of capitalism in China and ask when it will become a democracy .
But what if it never does ?
What if its authoritarian capitalism is n’t merely a repetition of the process of capitalist accumulation which , in Europe , went on from the 16th to the 18th century , but a sign of what is to come ?
What if ‘ the vicious combination of the Asian knout and the European stock market ’ ( Trotsky ’s characterisation of tsarist Russia ) proves economically more efficient than liberal capitalism ?
What if it shows that democracy , as we understand it , is no longer the condition and engine of economic development , but its obstacle ?
And if this is the case , maybe post - Communist disappointment should not be dismissed as a sign of ‘ immature ’ expectations .
When people protested against Communist regimes in Eastern Europe , most of them were n’t asking for capitalism .
They wanted solidarity and a rough kind of justice ; they wanted the freedom to live their own lives outside state control , to come together and talk as they pleased ; they wanted to be liberated from primitive ideological indoctrination and hypocrisy .
In effect they aspired to something that could best be described as ‘ socialism with a human face ’ .
Perhaps this sentiment deserves a second chance .
The annual SEMA Show ( where SEMA is short for Specialty Equipment Market Association ) kicks off on Nov 3 , 2009 in Las Vegas .
As a lover of muscle cars , this is something that sets a big tone for your next year .
Why ?
Because even though it ’s in Las Vegas , what happens at SEMA does n’t stay at SEMA !
If you ’ve never heard of SEMA before , do n’t worry .
The Association and their annual show is n’t intended for the general automotive consumer – it ’s for the automotive industry and press .
Each year representatives from the major automakers and the entire specialty parts and restoration industry get together , show off their new products , and try to one - up each other to get the most notice possible in doing so .
Why does this matter to you ?
Easy – because some of the most innovative and neatest parts for your muscle car have been premiered by people trying to be the “ Coolest and the Baddest ” at the SEMA show !
Whether you ’re building a pro-touring car , doing a coucours restoration , or are just maintaining a beautiful classic , SEMA matters to you ( you can also thank them for keeping vehicles older than 25 years out of the Cash for Clunkers debacle , but that ’s a story for another day ) .
What are some of the cool things you may find premiered at the SEMA show ?
How about paddle shifters connected to a modern automatic transmission …. that bolts in to your ’ 71 ‘ Cuda , or a brand new ’ 67 Mustang …. or ’ 69 Camaro ( see video below from the 2008 show ) .
Bolt in modern suspension systems .
Subframes with provisions for modern engines .
Full length floor pans .
Newly manufactured parts for Mopars ( finally ) – you name it !
The show itself has provided a competition to put out the best products … and we the consumer are the winners .
We get the best products at the best price as a result .
( Just compare the ease of restoration and modification we enjoy now with the atmosphere 10 years ago ! )
In addition to parts , information about up - and - coming items of interest to muscle car fans is front and center as well ( such as what will happen in 2010 for the “ Yenko ” brand , which is currently owned by Classic Industries . )
It ’s also a place where innovators get to show off their products …on the track .
This year the 2009 OPTIMA Ultimate Street Car Invitational will be held immediately following SEMA and is an invitation only event to the best in the pro-touring industry ( and our previous podcast guests Larry Callahan and Randy Johnson will be competing ) !
All in all , SEMA has a lot to do with the face that there may never be be a better time in history to be a muscle car fan .
We really do have everything at our fingertips to restore a car to factory status or build an all out racer …. and it just keeps getting better !

It 's now a lot easier to install on Ubuntu .
It 's now a lot easier to integrate with panels such as gnome - panel or xmobar .
It 's now a lot easier to try out various layouts , and there are more layouts to choose from .
They think that maximizing a window as much as possible whenever possible is useful .
I think that 's true with terminals and chat windows , but less so for many other windows .
For instance , I always want GVim to be 80 columns wide .
They think that minimizing windows to very small sizes is more acceptable than allowing windows to overlap .
I disagree .
They think that forcibly resizing windows wo n't break them .
Unfortunately , forcibly resizing windows makes the Gimp look terrible , and it often cuts off the last line of text in GVim .
They think that I do n't care about having an integrated desktop environment such as the one GNOME provides .
In reality , I like the idea of using weird window managers as part of my GNOME desktop .
I really like all those things that Ubuntu puts on my gnome - panel such as the network manager , update manager , mixer , etc .
It works with the gnome - panel .
It has layout managers that can take hints from applications so as not to chop off the last line of text in GVim .
It can create exceptions for certain applications , such as the Gimp , placing them in a " floating " layer that is more suitable for such applications .
It has layouts that allow windows to overlap in useful ways .
Having the computer help you manage your windows using smart algorithms is a good idea .
Trying bold , new ideas in user interface design is a great idea .
xmonad is a tiling window manager .
If you do n't know what I 'm talking about , take a peek at one of the screencasts .
I 've been using xmonad for the last couple weeks .
It 's been a couple years since I tried it last , and it 's really improved :
Every time I try out a tiling window manager , I am reminded of the fact that I fundamentally disagree with the premise : Fortunately , of all the tiling window managers , xmonad is the most understanding of my needs :
Hence , xmonad is my favorite among all the tiling window managers that I 've tried .
There are a couple premises that I fundamentally agree with : That last point is important .
There 's a great saying in The Myths of Innovation : " Do n't worry about people stealing your ideas .

Not every new idea is good , butlots of new ideas is very good .
xmonad exemplifies what I 'd like to see more of in the Linux world .
Linux has always been a little behind in terms of user interface design .
Instead of cloning Windows or OS X , I really like the idea of creating our own new , interesting , and clever approaches to user interface design .
Do you remember the time when neither Windows nor OS X had virtual desktops ?
I like having things that those guys do n't have , which is why I 'm happy to see the innovation that xmonad is providing .
Could Jesus Christ have visited Glastonbury ?
Jesus Christ could have come to Britain to further his education , according to a Scottish academic .
Church of Scotland minister Dr Gordon Strachan makes the claim in a new film entitled And Did Those Feet .
The film examines the story of Jesus ' supposed visit , which survives in the popular hymn Jerusalem .
Dr Strachan believes it is " plausible " Jesus came to England for his studies , as it was the forefront of learning 2,000 years ago .
" Coming this far was n't in fact that far in the olden days , " Dr Strachan told BBC Radio 4's The World At One .
" The Romans came here at the same time and they found it quite easy . "
Dr Strachan added that Jesus had " plenty of time " to do the journey , as little was known about his life before the age of 30 .
The legend that Jesus Christ came to Britain was popularised in a poem written by William Blake in the early 19th Century and made famous as a hymn 100 years later .
William Blake 's " Jerusalem " spread the idea Jesus came to England Now the first words of the hymn - " And did those feet " - are the title of a new film based on a book researched by Dr Strachan , who lectures on the history of architecture at Edinburgh University .
" It is generally suggested that he came to the west of England with his uncle , Joseph of Arimathea , who was here for tin , " said the academic .
Dr Strachan claimed Jesus Christ could have come to England to further his education .
" He needed to go around to learn bits and pieces about ancient wisdom , and the druids in Britain went back hundreds if not thousands of years .
He probably came here to meet the druids , to share his wisdom and gain theirs . "
Among the places Jesus is said to have visited are Penzance , Falmouth , St - Just - in - Roseland and Looe , which are all in Cornwall , as well as Glastonbury in Somerset - which has particular legends about Jesus .
" St Augustine wrote to the Pope to say he 'd discovered a church in Glastonbury built by followers of Jesus .
But St Gildas ( a 6th - Century British cleric ) said it was built by Jesus himself .
It 's a very very ancient church which went back perhaps to AD37 . "
The film And Did Those Feet is being screened on Friday in central London .

A car responsible for clearing a path for Vice President Biden ’s motorcade was involved in a West Side collision that sent three people to the hospital today , sources said .
Biden , who was headed to an appearance on “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , ” was not hurt .
It was the second accident involving a Biden trip in two days .
The latest crash occurred at 5:40 p.m. at West 49th Street and Tenth Avenue .
Biden ’s motorcade , which was going to make it ’s way uptown to the show ’s 11th Avenue studio , was about ten minutes away at the time , authorities said .
Cops had stopped traffic on Tenth to clear a path for Biden when a livery cab tried to get around it by driving up the left lane .
Meanwhile , three unmarked police cars were headed west on 49th Street .
At the intersection the middle car hit the livery cab , police and federal sources said .
“ They t- boned him , ” said Joe Lewis , a clerk at the nearby Skyline Hotel .
The livery driver and two Intelligence Division cops in the middle car suffered neck and back injuries and were taken to Roosevelt Hospital where they were treated and released .
The cab had a passenger who was treated at the scene for a minor injury and was released .
Witnesses said the passenger side door of the cab was caved in and the police car ’s bumper was ripped off .
But cops were able to push the crash cars aside so that Biden was able to continue on his way to the studio to tape the show that aired at 11 p.m .
The crash was a bizarre echo of an accident in Biden ’s motorcade on Monday .
The vice president was in Albuquerque , N.M. to help Democratic candidates when a woman drove around two police vehicles who were blocking an intersection for the vice president ’s motorcade .
The woman struck the car of a sheriff ’s deputy , who was rushed to a hospital for evaluation .

Who are the real criminals ?
My apologies for titling this post with a 1960s slogan , but the stuff I have been reading about makes me so angry that I thought a little vintage rhetoric was justified .
Anyway , Glenn Reynolds is not kidding when he speaks of " THE CRIMINALIZATION OF EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING " :
With the proliferation of criminal law , everyone is a criminal of some sort , whether they know it or not .
Perhaps because too many people have taken notice , in Washington , they 're finally Perhaps because too many people have taken notice , in Washington , they 're finally holding hearings on the subject .
And the stuff that is coming out is truly disgusting : Chairman Robert C. Scott , Virginia Democrat , and ranking member Louie Gohmert , Texas Republican , conducted a truly bipartisan hearing ( a D.C. rarity this year ) .
These two leaders have begun giving voice to the increasing number of experts who worry about " overcriminalization . "
Astronomical numbers of federal criminal laws lack specifics , can apply to almost anyone and fail to protect innocents by requiring substantial proof that an accused person acted with actual criminal intent .
Mr. Norris ended up spending almost two years in prison because he did n't have the proper paperwork for some of the many orchids he imported .
The orchids were all legal - but Mr. Norris and the overseas shippers who had packaged the flowers had failed to properly navigate the many , often irrational , paperwork requirements the U.S. imposed when it implemented an arcane international treaty 's new restrictions on trade in flowers and other flora .
The judge who sentenced Mr. Norris had some advice for him and his wife : " Life sometimes presents us with lemons . "
Their job was , yes , to " turn lemons into lemonade . "
The judge apparently failed to appreciate how difficult it is to run a successful lemonade stand when you 're an elderly diabetic with coronary complications , arthritis and Parkinson 's disease serving time in a federal penitentiary .
If only Mr. Norris had been a Libyan terrorist , maybe some European official at least would have weighed in on his behalf to secure a health - based mercy release .
Krister Evertson , another victim of overcriminalization , told Congress , " What I have experienced in these past years is something that should scare you and all Americans . "
He 's right .
Evertson , a small - time entrepreneur and inventor , faced two separate federal prosecutions stemming from his work trying to develop clean - energy fuel cells .
The feds prosecuted Mr. Evertson the first time for failing to put a federally mandated sticker on an otherwise lawful UPS package in which he shipped some of his supplies .
A jury acquitted him , so the feds brought new charges .
This time they claimed he technically had " abandoned " his fuel - cell materials - something he had no intention of doing - while defending himself against the first charges .
Mr. Evertson , too , spent almost two years in federal prison .
It 's the old principle of " if they want you , they 've got you ! "
The number of things that are illegal are mind boggling .
It 's the old principle of " if they want you , they 've got you ! "
The number of things that are illegal are mind boggling .
The Heritage Foundation cited a 2004 estimate that there were at least 4000 federal crimes , but said there could be many more .
Those of us who are online tend to hear about federal laws criminalizing things like annoying someone on the Internet , or using a false name in violation of TOS , but in reality , almost anything can be a federal crime .
Reason has a long piece on the subject , and noted that public welfare offenses are systematically becoming crimes based on congressional whims .
So people like Edward Hanousek are going to prison for " crimes " of which they were never even aware were being committed :
In 1996 Edward Hanousek Jr. , a road master for a railroad company running between Alaska and Canada , was convicted of negligently discharging a harmful quantity of oil into the Skagway River , a U.S. waterway , in violation of the Clean Water Act .
An independent contractor had accidentally ruptured a pipeline while attempting to clear rocks off the tracks .
Hanousek was off duty and at home that day , nowhere near the accident site , and he had no knowledge of the pipeline rupture until after the fact .
The government nevertheless prosecuted Hanousek , a federal jury convicted him , and he received a sentence of six months in prison , six months in a halfway house , six months of post - release supervision , and a $ 5,000 fine .
These are just three of the many cases that illustrate how federal criminal law has overstepped its proper bounds , prescribing draconian punishments for offenses that should be handled at the state level or that should not be considered crimes at all .
During the last century , especially in the last three decades and in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks , Congress has made federal crimes out of an astonishing array of behavior , much of which is already prohibited by state law , could be better addressed with civil penalties , or is considered wrongful not because it violates anyone 's rights but only because Congress says so .
Any attempt to even count the number of crimes is doomed to failure , and even the Congressional Research Service said ( remember this was over five years ago ) that it was impossible :
In an October 2003 column published on Townhall.com , Rebecca Hagelin , vice president of the Heritage Foundation , noted : " America started out with three federal laws -- treason , counterfeiting and piracy .
In 1998 , the American Bar Association counted more than 3,300 separate federal criminal offenses on the books -- more than 40 percent of which had been enacted in just the past 30 years .
These new laws cover more than 50 titles of the U.S. Code and encompass more than 27,000 pages .
Today , the Congressional Research Service says it no longer can even say how many federal crimes exist . "
She continued : " Are we that much more evil than we were 200 years ago that we need this many laws to keep us off of each other ?
Or has the nanny state veered completely out of control -- creating crimes where no evil existed , pinning blame where no harm was intended ? "
One reason it 's impossible is that many offenses are " derivative " in nature :
One reason it 's impossible to get a definitive count of federal offenses is that many are derivative , defined by other criminal acts .
Laws against money laundering , for example , make otherwise innocent transactions criminal if the government believes they were intended to disguise the source of drug money or other ill - gotten gains .
Under the USA PATRIOT
Act , federal investigators can criminalize many normal financial transactions by alleging even the most tenuous connection to the funding of terrorism or other illegal activity .
Federal prosecutors recently used the PATRIOT
Act 's money laundering provision against Las Vegas officials accused of taking bribes from a strip club owner .
And as illustrated by the indictment of University of Alabama booster Logan Young , derivative crime laws can be used to transform a single offense into several , allowing prosecutors to pile on charges in a way that encourages a guilty plea .
I know it 's tedious to read example after example , but I think that if these people had to endure prison in our name ( which is , BTW , the nature of a federal prosecution ) , the least we can do is read about their fate .

The Hansens ( who made the mistake of going into the plastics business ) went to federal prison for years because an employee slipped in contaminated water .
He was n't injured , but that did n't matter : Consider the case of Christian Hansen and his son Randall , owners and operators of the Georgia - based LCP Chemicals and Plastics .
In 2001 the Hansens were convicted of more than 30 environmental violations , including offenses under the Clean Water Act , the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act , the Endangered Species Act , and the Comprehensive Environmental Recovery and Compensation Liability Act .
The elder Hansen was sentenced to 10 years in prison , while his son was sentenced to four years .
Even though only one employee testified to slipping in contaminated wastewater ( but reported no resulting injury ) , the Hansens were convicted of endangering the health and safety of employees , among many other charges .
Perhaps the most disturbing feature of prosecutions like this one is that federal regulatory statutes such as the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species
Act impose criminal liability on the basis of negligence and do not require any culpable intent by the accused .
The Supreme Court has determined that certain " public welfare " offenses can trigger criminal sanctions without a showing of criminal intent , recklessness , or even knowledge of the violation .
Thus , Congress can impose harsh criminal penalties on business owners and supervisors who have no knowledge of or control over regulatory violations that may occur at their firms .
Environmental regulations , antitrust laws , securities regulations , and a host of other federal laws aimed at nonviolent , nonpredatory behavior the government wants to discourage illustrate how far we have moved from the traditional view of crime as deliberate wrongdoing .
Only intentional crimes against people or their property should be subject to criminal penalties .
If the Hansens ' environmental violations merited sanctions , they should have been civil , not criminal .
And if Edward Hanousek , the railroad supervisor mentioned at the beginning of this article , was negligent in overseeing the independent contractor who accidentally spilled oil into a river , whatever harm resulted should have been addressed in a civil proceeding , requiring payment for cleanup or restoration of the waterway .
Back to ... the most important decision is the decision whether to prosecute .
But while we 've larded criminal procedure with due process , the decision to prosecute -- or not -- is almost entirely discretionary on the part of prosecutors .
We either need to cut back on the criminalization ( my first choice ) or start cabining prosecutorial discretion .
I agree .
The problem with relying on discretion is that it lends itself to completely arbitrary rule , and with everything being illegal , it 's just a question of whether the government feels like prosecuting you .
And as Courts consistently have rejected constitutional challenges by defendants complaining of selective prosecution .
The federal prosecutor did not have to explain why he chose to prosecute Palmer but not Roberts for essentially the same conduct .
Prosecutors enjoy a legal presumption that they exercise their discretion soundly , making their decisions almost entirely unreviewable .
Even if the federal prosecutor had chosen to prosecute Palmer but not Roberts because he personally disliked Palmer , there would be no remedy for that abuse of discretion .
I wo n't mince words here .
The whole federal system has become monstrous and tyrannical .
Back to Glenn , who thinks we should cut back on criminalization itself : I agree .
The problem with relying on discretion is that it lends itself to completely arbitrary rule , and with everything being illegal , it 's just a question of whether the government feels like prosecuting you .
And as Reason points out , there 's no practical remedy for abuse of prosecutorial discretion , because prosecutors enjoy a legal presumption that they acted fairly : I wo n't mince words here .
The whole federal system has become monstrous and tyrannical .
Especially in the wrong hands .

BBC News , Caracas
Hugo Chavez made the comments on his weekly TV programme Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez has insulted Colombia 's defence minister over comments critical of the country 's anti-drug trafficking efforts .
In his weekly TV programme , Mr Chavez said that Gabriel Silva must be " mentally retarded " .
Last week , Mr Silva released a statement accusing Venezuela of failing to tackle international drug routes .
He said there was " almost a free traffic " of flights loaded with drugs from Venezuelan territory .
The bad feeling between the Venezuelan and the Colombian governments has been kept under control by a mutual silence for several weeks now , but it only takes a small event for it to erupt into insults again .
In this instance , the Colombian defence minister 's comments were more than enough .
On his Alo Presidente programme , Mr Chavez gave a typically damning response .
" The Colombian defence minister ?
I think he 's mentally retarded , " he said .
He added that the only explanation for his behaviour was that he was " following instructions from the empire " , referring to the US .
The president 's comments come shortly after an official protest note was sent to Colombia by the Venezuelan foreign ministry .
But many commentators in Venezuela and Colombia say that such measured diplomacy is what is missing from this confrontation .
Mr Silva is due to head to meet US Defence Secretary Robert Gates in Washington shortly .
This latest outburst by Washington 's most vocal critic in Latin America comes at a sensitive time over the US military 's use of seven military bases on Colombian soil - something they say will help in the fight against drug trafficking , but which Mr Chavez says will destabilise the security of the region .

The metal was originally thought to have fallen from an aircraft A couple from Hull have been told that a 4lb ( 1.8 kg ) chunk of metal which smashed through the roof of their home may have come from space .
The RAF investigated the unidentified falling object after it landed in Peter and Mair Welton 's loft in July .
It was not known where the metal had come from but it seemed likely that it was " space debris " , investigators said .
The RAF Flight Safety Branch said it was the only incident of this kind it had dealt with for five years .
Consulted with NASA
The RAF investigate all objects falling from the sky in case they originate from an RAF aircraft .
It was initially thought that the metal may have fallen from an aircraft but tests revealed it had not come from a plane .
The investigating team consulted with the European Space Agency and NASA before concluding that the metal was " consistent with space debris " , the RAF said .
An RAF spokeswoman said : " In the last five years the RAF has become involved in only one incident involving suspected space debris .
" If requested the RAF will investigate incidents of space debris but they do not have a standing remit to do so . "

This simulation depicts the decay of a Higgs particle following a collision of two protons in the CMS experiment CERN
AS DAMP squibs go , it was quite a spectacular one .
Amid great pomp and ceremony – not to mention dark offstage rumblings that the end of the world was nigh – the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , the world ’s mightiest particle smasher , fired up in September last year .
Nine days later a short circuit and a catastrophic leak of liquid helium ignominiously shut the machine down .
Now for take two .
Any day now , if all goes to plan , proton beams will start racing all the way round the ring deep beneath CERN , the LHC ’s home on the outskirts of Geneva , Switzerland .
Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg is worried .
It ’s not that he thinks the LHC will create a black hole that will engulf the planet , or even that the restart will end in a technical debacle like last year ’s .
No : he ’s actually worried that the LHC will find what some call the “ God particle ” , the popular and embarrassingly grandiose moniker for the hitherto undetected Higgs boson .
“ I ’m terrified , ” he says .
“ Discovering just the Higgs would really be a crisis . ”
Why so ?
Evidence for the Higgs would be the capstone of an edifice that particle physicists have been building for half a century – the phenomenally successful theory known simply as the standard model .
It describes all known particles , as well as three of the four forces that act on them : electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces .
It is also manifestly incomplete .
We know from what the theory does n’t explain that …
" We 've got some players who are n't playing as well as they can , " Holland said .
" But I like the makeup of our team .
I think we 're real close to playing good .
We 're in the process of finding out who we are . "
" I believe that over the course of 80 games , players find their own water levels , " Holland said .
" Every player can play real good or real bad for four to six games . "
Will Datsyuk and Zetterberg be at the 90 - point level ?
Maybe not .
But they are too good not to be point - a- game players , Holland said .
" They 're too good , and I 've watched them for too long , " he said .
As for the players who replaced the departing free agents , they are off to slow starts as well , but Holland insisted Jason Williams , Patrick Eaves , and Todd Bertuzzi will be helping the club by the end of the year .
Bertuzzi assisted on the winner Tuesday , although it was just his fourth point of the season ( one goal , three assists ) .
Williams has just two goals in 10 games , and Eaves has zero points in just four games .
As the first month of the regular season draws to a close , Holland knows there are lots of people fleeing the Red Wings ' bandwagon .
" Yeah , but I understand , " he said .
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan began legal action on Thursday to seize properties in Queens and across the country where several mosques are located in a broad move against a nonprofit organization that was accused of illegally providing money and other services to Iran .
The organization , the Alavi Foundation , owns the land on which the mosques sit , as well as a majority interest in an office tower at 650 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan , which has also been slated for seizure by the government .
The authorities accused the Alavi Foundation of spending millions of dollars to obtain and develop the properties , in violation of federal laws that ban trade with Iran .
In addition to the Queens property , which is at 55 - 11 Queens Boulevard and houses the Imam Ali Mosque , the government sought forfeiture of the foundation ’s ownership in seven other properties , several of which house mosques .
Another of the properties is a 36 - story granite - and - glass tower at 52nd Street known as the Piaget Building .
Moderate House Democrats are drafting a proposal that would continue to shield big banks from potentially tougher state regulations of credit cards , mortgages and savings accounts .
The plan would differ from President Barack Obama ’s proposal to give states a role in regulating large financial institutions that operate nation - wide .
The lawmakers say it would be more practical and less expensive not to force the banks to comply with 50 different regulatory regimes .
ADVERTISEMENT
But their proposal , spearheaded by Illinois Democratic Rep. Melissa Bean and discussed at a hearing Wednesday , is n’t sitting well with consumer advocates who say banks should n’t be allowed to skirt state regulations if the restrictions do n’t suit them .
“ That ’s the system we have now .
That ’s the system that failed , ” said Ed Mierzwinski , consumer program director for U.S. Public Interest Research Groups .
The current regulatory regime allows banks to follow either state or federal regulations .
Whereas community banks often follow state rules , large banks typically opt for federal oversight so they can operate in various states under one set of regulations .
Under a plan by Obama and Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank , lenders would have to answer to both state and federal regulators .
A new Consumer Financial Protection Agency , or CFPA , would set the federal standard but states would be free to impose tougher rules .
The House Financial Services Committee , chaired by Frank , planned to take up legislation creating a CFPA the week of Oct. 12 .
ADVERTISEMENT
While the financial industry is lobbying against a new regulator , Frank said the agency is needed because the Federal Reserve and other regulators dropped the ball when it came to protecting the average American using credit cards and buying homes .
“ I think it ’s fair to say that no callouses will be found on the hands of those in the federal bank regulatory agencies who had consumer responsibility because there is no evidence of hard work , ” he said at a panel hearing .
While Bean supports creation of a CFPA , she said in an interview this week that subjecting federally chartered banks to state laws would be too cumbersome to implement and would pass on added costs to consumers .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If you have 50 different regulatory regimes that an institution has to comply with every new offering they make , every new service they want to provide , there ( would be ) 50 different sets of forms with 50 different sets of training , ” she said .
Bean said she is drafting an amendment with input from other Democrats that would allow federally chartered banks to follow federal regulations under the CFPA and ignore state laws .
She says her plan would still allow for multiple watchdogs because states could cooperate with federal regulators to sue banks in civil court for violation of federal law .
Just recently , like , very recently ( maybe a few hours ago ) Unity released their base - level product , Unity Indie for free .
This is pretty huge news for the game development community .
It is , as they say ( and forgive the pun ) a Game Changer .
If you do n’t already know , Unity is a very powerful tool for rapidly building games .
( it is billed as a 3d game engine , but it also works quite well for 2d games )
One of the many features of Unity is the ability to take the game project you have built , and with the click of the mouse , build a version for the mac , a version for the pc and a version that runs in a web browser .
This is excellent for distributing your game but it has other side benefits as well .
I collaborate with people all over the world , and we use the in browser games to share our ideas quickly and easily , not to mention it is much easier to get your testers to test out your prototypes if all they have to do is open a browser window .
Before now , the indie version was not very expensive , less than $ 200 or so , but now that it is free , I think we will see a flood of new and interesting games come out in the coming months .
What does this mean for indie game development ?
Well , the obvious thing is that we will see a ton more web based titles , probably lots of crap , but there will always be a few gems in there .
I think that Flash development will start to see a big challenge from the Unity guys .
I know a ton of flash guys who have been eyeing unity for awhile now and this will most likely push them over the edge .
dont get me wrong , flash is a great tool , and it is great for making games , but it is not a game - building - tool .
Unity is designed from the ground up to make games .
Here is a good post to read if you a flash dev who is on the fence : http://diamondtearz.org/2009/01/14/10-reasons-for-flash-developers-to-learn-unity-3d/
The even bigger news for me as an iPhone developer is that I think many many more people will start to use unity to build games for the iPhone .
Now , Unity iPhone Basic ( the cheapest iPhone license ) is still about $ 400 .
And some of the zero budget indie developers might have to think twice about that kind of money ( it is totally worth it , trust me )
But now you can download the Unity Free and prototype your game , or release a web version or just get to know unity and then be ready to port it over to the iPhone version .
We are doing that right now with ‘ Mole ’ and I will be blogging about what it takes to move a prototype level game from the desktop version of unity into a working iPhone version .
I will also be interested to see how this effects the other iPhone game - focused APIs like cocoas2d .
Cocoas2d and the like are still free ( so still $ 400 cheaper than using unity to develop your game ) and if you are building a 2d game it makes a lot of sense to start with cocoas2d , but I can tell you from my personal experience that building a 2d game with unity is very easy and if your time is worth anything to you then the $ 400 investment to upgrade to iPhone Basic is well worth the money .
Also , I cant stress this enough , you can now prototype your game in Unity for free .
Even if you then decide to use cocoas2d to build the deployment version ( a few reasons you might want to do this , more on that in a second ) you can still do a rapid prototype with Unity to figure out all your gameplay mechanics and decide if the game is fun or not .
So , Unity is great , but what are the downsides ?
Well , in terms of desktop or web development , there are n’t any real downsides .
Go get a copy and start making games .
In terms of iPhone development there are a few caveats .
First off , as i have mentioned , it is not free .
But $ 400 is very cheap for what you get .
The biggest issue with using Unity Basic ( and to some extent this applies to the pro version as well ) to develop iPhone games is that your app size will not be under 10 M ( which is the size limit for apps to be able to be downloaded over the cell network ) .
For the most part this is not a big deal , most games with any amount of depth tend to be bigger than 10 M no matter the development tools used .
However , the casual games that you are trying to sell for $ 0.99 and you want to be an impulse buy , and so you want them to be less than 10 M , these are nigh impossible to make with Unity .
Why is that ?
Well , the unity engine is very capable , comes with all sorts of great things like built in physics , scripting , shaders , and lots of other goodies , but all that comes at the cost of size .
If you spring for iPhone Advanced then you can strip out parts of the engine you are not using , and possibly get under the 10 M mark , but this is a very hard thing to do .
My advice : even if you are looking to build small casual games for the iPhone , I would still suggest you get the now free Unity and prototype with it .
Then once your game is working fall back on one of the other frameworks like cocoas2d to build it .
However , if you have even an inkling that your game will exceed the 10 M limit , then just get the iPhone version .
Cheers !

With Unity3D now available for free , anyone can download it to their PC / Mac and start creating their own video game with the software .
For those of us without any game development experience whatsoever , though , the challenge of struggling to navigate through all the panels and coding windows seems just as prohibitive as the engine 's former $ 200 price .
To help acclimate newcomers to Unity , Infinite Ammo's Alec Holowka posted a set of videos designed to ease novices into the game authoring tool .
While there are already dozens of official and unofficial tutorials online , this series has the benefit of coming from an indie dev whose games you might 've previously enjoyed .
Also , Infinite Ammo used the software to create all of its titles so far ( Paper Moon , Heroes + Villains , Marian ) .
Holowka manages to make Unity feel approachable to even non-programmers like myself -- I plan to use these lessons to finally create my dream game , a 3D adventure about a cat that wakes people up .
You can watch two more tutorial videos covering movement scripts , the scene editor , basic physics , and more after the break .
Settlers uproot olive trees from Palestinian land near Ramallah Ma'an News September 7 , 2009
Bethlehem � Ma�an � Israeli settlers uprooted 50 olive trees near the Palestinian village of Al - Maghayir , north of the city of Ramallah on Monday afternoon , according to Israeli radio .
Israel�s military believes the attack was a preemptive response to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu�s decision to reduce construction in West Bank settlements .
Netanyahu is expected to announce some curbs on settlement expansion later this week .
On Monday , his government approved the construction of 500 new homes in the settlements , which are illegal under international law .
Last Thursday 150 olive trees were found uprooted in the same village , which lies near the unauthorized settler outpost of Nofe Yarden .
On Friday , clashes were reported in the area , when , according to settlers , Palestinians stormed the outpost and set fire to a mobile home .
No one was reported injured .

" Avec un pic de 30 000 billets vendus en trois heures , la FFF a enregistré l'une des ventes les plus rapides de son histoire , ajoute la Fédération .
Ceci traduit une mobilisation fulgurante du public français à l'occasion de la double confrontation face à la République d'Irlande . "
Interrogé lundi par l'AFP sur l'avantage ou non de recevoir au match retour , le sélectionneur de l'équipe de France Raymond Domenech avait répondu : " On ne sait pas .
On verra à la fin .
De toute façon , si c'est pour jouer dans le stade chez nous avec 30 000 Irlandais comme en 2004 ...
Il faut une vraie mobilisation .
Il faut que les Français se précipitent sur les billets pour que les Irlandais ne les achètent pas tous .
Ce serait une première victoire . "
" Il ne faut pas que les Irlandais aient plus de places que ce qui doit leur ê tre alloué , soit 20 000 places " , avait - il ajouté .

Three original stories edited together as one .
This story was originally simultaneously printed in a standard format limited series and a prestige format limited series .
For Thanksgiving dinner , what side dish would you prefer to accompany your turkey  a serving of well - marinated conflict over how much or how little you eat , or some nice , fresh criticism of your cooking skills ?
As families gather around the country this week to celebrate Thanksgiving , many of them are bracing for the intense emotions of the holiday meal .
The combination of food and family often brings out longstanding tensions , criticism and battles for control .
Simple issues like cooking with butter or asking for seconds are fraught with family conflict and commentary .
“ If we had an audiotape of a lot of families talking together , you would hear so much chatter about what other people are eating , who gained weight , who lost weight , who ’s eating like a bird , who ’s having seconds , ” notes Cynthia M. Bulik , director of the eating disorders program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
Dr. Bulik told the story of a patient whose mother scolded her for not eating her homemade cookies .
“ You do n’t like my cookies ? ” she asked .
As a result , the daughter relented and took a cookie .
But when she then reached for a second , her mother scolded her again .
“ Do you really think you need another one ? ” she asked her .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday that some countries had offered to provide Iran with uranium enriched to 20 percent for use as nuclear reactor fuel , the official IRNA news agency reported .

Iran has always insisted on its right to carry out its own enrichment of uranium for a nuclear program which it says is for purely peaceful purposes , mainly to generate electricity .
It rejects Western suspicions its real aim is to build an atomic bomb , which would require uranium enriched to around 90 percent .
“ There have been some proposals by individual countries and groups of countries .
We are ready to hold talks with anyone interested .
Our experts will soon start talks with those sellers , ” Ahmadinejad said .
He said Iran could also buy nuclear fuel from the United States , its old enemy .
“ We want to buy fuel .
We can buy it from anywhere and America can be a seller , ” ISNA news agency quoted him as saying .
Uranium enrichment is at the heart of a long standoff between Iran and the West , which took a new twist last month when Tehran disclosed the existence of a previously secret underground enrichment plant near the holy Shi’ite city of Qom .
Diplomats say it did so after learning Western intelligence services had discovered the site .
Russia stepped into the debate on Wednesday , urging countries not to jump to hasty conclusions about the newly revealed plant and saying Iran was showing signs of cooperation with inspectors .
Russia ’s Foreign Ministry complained of media speculation surrounding activities at the site .
“ We are convinced that hasty conclusions on this score will not benefit the objective assessment of the situation , ” it said in a statement .
DIVERSION CONCERNS
Western concerns center on the possibility that Iran could accumulate supplies of enriched uranium and divert them from its civilian program in order to built a nuclear warhead .
To address this , Western diplomats say Iran agreed in principle at talks last week in Geneva to send about 80 percent of its stockpile of low - enriched uranium to Russia and France for processing .
It would then be returned to Tehran to replenish dwindling fuel stocks for a reactor in the capital that produces isotopes for cancer care .
Ahmadinejad made no mention of Iran sending its uranium abroad for further enrichment .
So far no purchasing agreement had been finalized , he said .
“ Representatives of some countries have said that France is ready to provide nuclear fuel for the Tehran reactor ... they ( France ) should officially propose it , then we will review it , ” state broadcaster IRIB quoted the president as saying .
IRNA quoted Ahmadinejad as saying last week ’s talks with six world powers -- the United States , Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany -- in Geneva “ were constructive and a positive step forward . ”
The talks are expected to win Iran a reprieve from tougher U.N. sanctions , although Western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by Tehran to buy time to develop its nuclear program .
Iran also agreed with the six powers in Geneva to allow access for inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to the newly disclosed nuclear site at Qom .
Subsequent talks with IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei in Tehran on October 3 and 4 sent out a positive signal from Tehran , the Russian Foreign Ministry said .
“ We see this as an instance of practical implementation of the agreements on strong cooperation between Iran and the IAEA in clarifying the circumstances of the construction , ” it said .
World powers at the next round of talks aim to press Iran for a freeze on expansion of enrichment as an interim step toward a suspension that would bring it major trade rewards .
Iran has repeatedly rejected such demands .

Honduras has been suffering from a political crisis for four months A deal to resolve the political crisis in Honduras is " dead " , ousted President Manuel Zelaya has said .
He was speaking after interim leader Roberto Micheletti said he was forming a " unity government " without Mr Zelaya 's representatives .
The US government has expressed its disappointment over the breakdown of the accord , which they helped broker .
Honduras has been shaken by a political crisis that began when Mr Zelaya was forced out of the country on 28 June .
Speaking to journalists on Friday , State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said it was urgent that a unity government be created " immediately " and called on both sides to return to the negotiating table .
He said the US government was " disappointed by the unilateral statements " made by Mr Zelaya 's and Mr Micheletti's negotiating teams on Thursday .
Mr Micheletti acted as a deadline passed for putting a power - sharing agreement into effect .
The two rivals agreed to a power - sharing deal last week , with a deadline for it to be implemented by midnight on Thursday ( 0600 GMT Friday ) .
But Mr Zelaya had warned on Thursday that he would withdraw from the deal unless Congress held a vote on his restoration to power .
He has said elections planned for 29 November will not be valid unless he is restored to power first , though the agreement did not guarantee the ousted leader 's restitution .
' Theatre ' Interim authorities did not consider the Congressional vote demanded by Mr Zelaya to be an essential part of the agreement .
They said the agreement set a deadline for the formation of a government , but not for Congress to meet .
As the power - sharing deadline passed , Mr Micheletti said he had " finalised the process of confirming a unity government " .
This failure was as predictable as was the original coup which preceded it
Richard , BBC reader , La Ceiba , Honduras
Readers react to latest development " Everybody , with the exception of Mr Zelaya , recommended Hondurans to lead the institutions of our country as part of the new government , " he said .
Though Mr Zelaya had not submitted a list of names , Mr Micheletti said the government was " representative of a large ideological and political spectrum in our country and complies strictly with the agreement " signed last week .
Mr Zelaya , who has been sheltering in the Brazilian embassy since his return to Honduras in September , responded by pronouncing the accord " dead " .
" It 's absurd what they are doing , trying to mock all of us , the people who elected me and the international community that supports me , " he said .
" We 've decided not to continue this theatre with Mr Micheletti . "
Mr Zelaya was ousted after planning to hold a non-binding public consultation to ask people whether they supported moves to change the constitution .
His critics said the move was unconstitutional and aimed to remove the current one - term limit on serving as president and pave the way for his possible re-election .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s Ministry of Health has banned the use of physical punishment to wean teens off the net , months after a boy was beaten to death at an Internet boot camp .
Chinese parents have turned to more than 200 organisations offering treatment for Internet “ disorders ” as the government increasingly warns of unhealthy Internet habits among the young .
Many of the camps are imbued with a military atmosphere .
Patients are forced to replace hours in front of the computer with arduous physical drills or even more extreme “ treatments ” .
“ When intervening to prevent improper use of the Internet , we should ... strictly prohibit restriction of personal freedom and physical punishments , ” the ministry said in a draft guideline for Internet use by minors , posted on its website ( www.moh.gov.cn).
It appeared to have dropped the term “ Internet addiction ” , widely used in earlier ministry documents , perhaps in a bid to calm worried parents who fuelled a mushrooming business of harsh camps to prevent teens from spending hours online .
The death of 15 - year - old Deng Senshan , just hours after he checked into an Internet bootcamp in the southwestern Guangxi region in early August , caused a media storm in China .
Days later another teenager , Pu Liang , was taken to hospital with water in the lungs and kidney failure after a similar attack in Sichuan Province .
The government in July had already banned electro - shock therapy as a treatment for Internet addiction , after media reports about a controversial psychiatrist who administered electric currents to nearly 3,000 teenagers .
The latest guidelines suggest officials in Beijing do not think that those with unhealthy Internet habits should be forced offline permanently .
“ The goal of intervention is ... to urge the target people to use the Internet in a healthy way , ” the guideline said .
“ It ’s not to stop them from using the Internet . ”
Finally , a videogame with the balls to depict the generic post - apocalyptic wasteland as it really will be : utterly boring and lifeless .
Borderlands takes place on Pandora , an Arizona - like planet where the bleakness is offset by its cel - shaded - esque appearance .
Though Pandora is mostly deserted , bandits , mercenaries , and other hired guns troll its surface in search of the Vault , an intergalactic piggybank filled with untold riches and awesome technology that a supposedly advanced species had the foresight to abandon for the sake of plot .
If this all sounds like a lazy rehash of last year ’s revolutionary Fallout 3 , hang on : Borderlands cribs further by having you navigate through the game from a first - perspective perspective and leveling up your stats in a shooter .
Hell , you ’ll even see a humming robot and a bobblehead in the first 30 minutes .
Borderlands distinguishes itself by being a small - scale MMORPG , enabling up to four players to band together in pursuit of the Vault .
While the game is playable offline in a solo campaign and in a split - screen mode , irritatingly challenging , dull boss battles ( like a giant solder who shoots fire ) assure that the only true way to play is online with others .

But Borderlands is far from perfect online .
Enemies become incrementally tougher depending on how many players are in action , but this has a two - pronged effect :
From the outset , you can join up with an astonishingly higher - leveled party , stand still , make a sandwich , and just soak up experience and weapon - proficiency levels while literally doing nothing .
Alternately , you can get sidelined by dangerous foes while your party completes a mission without you , leaving your character ’s campaign stalled until you ’re high - level enough to beat it yourself .
Without voice chat ( which is reportedly coming with an update — audacious for an online co-op game ) , you ’re ultimately at the whim of whatever jerks you get paired with .
Occasionally , you ’ll luck out with a group of higher - level folks who will shepherd you through with gifts of fancy weapons and protection , but usually , you ’ll get some dicks who just want to duel as a break from the monotony of looting for more gear .
And there ’s plenty to loot for .
While the game ’s four classes and skill trees are interchangeable , Borderlands ’ millions of randomly generated guns are like snowflakes , from the flaming submachine guns to the shock - inducing sniper rifles .
It ’s just too bad that the rest of Borderlands lacks anything resembling that much firepower .
Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iran is charging three American hikers with espionage , a Tehran prosecutor said Monday .
The three Americans have been detained since July 31 on charges of illegally crossing the border from Iraqi Kurdistan into Iran .
Their family and friends say it was an innocent mistake .
The announcement of the charges comes only days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met privately with the families of Shane Bauer , Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal , who were detained along the Iran - Iraq border at the end of July .
Tehran 's prosecutor general , Abbas Ja'afari Dolatabadi , announced the charges in an interview with the official Iranian news agency IRNA .
" The charge against the three U.S. citizens who were arrested on the Iran - Iraq border is espionage .
Investigation of their cases is in progress , " he told IRNA , adding : " There will be more to say [ about them ] soon . "
Clinton repeated Monday the Obama administration 's call for the release of the hikers , requesting that the Iranian government " exercise compassion . "
" We believe strongly that there is no evidence to support any charge whatsoever , " said Clinton , speaking in Berlin .
" The allegation that our loved ones may have been engaged in espionage is untrue , " said a statement from the hikers ' families .
" It is entirely at odds with the people Shane , Sarah and Josh are and with anything that Iran can have learned about them since they were detained . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday the three hikers are " innocent young people who should be released by the Iranian government . "
He said the United States has not obtained confirmation of the charges through Swiss emissaries .
Dolatabadi also said a Danish journalism student who was arrested last week in Iran was still under investigation .
" A journalist must have an official permit from authorized officials , " he told IRNA .
" Therefore , the investigation will continue .
We have also requested information from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance [ which accredits foreign journalists ] and after they respond to our inquiry we will make our decision . "
Clinton on Thursday repeated a call to the Iran government to release the American hikers on humanitarian grounds .
" As a mother my heart went out to all of them .
I cannot imagine what it would feel like to know that your child was in prison for now 100 days with very little contact between you and them , " she said .
" I told them that we are doing everything we possibly could to get Shane and Joshua and Sarah home .
And we are exploring every angle .
Obviously I would hope that the government of Iran would free them on humanitarian and compassionate basis and return them to their families , " she said .
The United States , which has no diplomatic relations with Iran , has relied on Switzerland to appeal directly for the hikers ' release .
A Swiss diplomat has met twice with the Americans in their Iranian prison .
The most recent visit was on October 29 , the hikers ' families said the following day .
The 40 - minute visit took place at Evin Prison in Tehran , where Bauer , 27 , Shourd , 31 , and Fattal , 27 , are being held .
" We were informed via the State Department that Shane , Sarah and Josh are in good physical shape and we 're obviously happy they received another visit , " the families said in a written statement .
" Today marks exactly three months since our children were detained and we urge the Iranian authorities to let our children speak to us directly .
Every time our telephones ring , we hope they it is them calling to tell us they 've been released . "
The Swiss diplomats took clothes and other supplies , including books and writing papers , to the Americans , the statement said .
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told CNN that the Swiss ambassador was granted the second consular visit after several requests .
A senior State Department official told CNN that it was reported the three seemed to be nervous and scared , but also appeared to be in good physical and psychological health .
The only other consular access came when Swiss diplomats visited the hikers on September 29 .
In an effort to obtain the hikers ' release , their families in late October released video of the three -- shot two days before they were detained -- fooling around , the families said , like friends on vacation .
The video was shot by Shon Meckfessel , a friend who accompanied them on their Kurdistan trip .
Meckfessel had planned to join them on their outing but stayed behind because he felt ill .
The videos show the relaxed travelers enjoying themselves as they take a break from exploring a town in Kurdistan .
" Yo it 's hot .
Yo it 's hot .
It 's ' cause I 'm in Iraq .
Someone get me a fan .
Someone get me a fan .
' Cause I'm in Kurdistan , " Fattal raps as he chuckles and points to the Iraqi landscape behind him .
The videos have been posted on YouTube and at www.freethehikers.org.
The Americans entered northern Iraq from Turkey on July 28 during a planned five - day hike .
Bauer and Shourd had been living in Damascus , Syria ; Fattal was visiting .
They set out to hike in northern Iraq 's Kurdistan region .
Meckfessel , who spoke with Bauer the morning of their hike , said his friends did not know they were near the border and made " a simple and regrettable mistake " by crossing into Iran .

Four former Marines will stand trial for the slaying of a sergeant and his wife in the couple ’s French Valley home last year , a judge ruled Wednesday .
Marine Sgt. Jan Pietrzak , 24 , and his wife , Quiana Jenkins - Pietrzak , 26 , were found bound with duct tape and shot to death , execution style , in their living room Oct. 15 .
Jenkins - Pietrzak had been sexually assaulted and someone had tried to set fire to the home .
Although racist words were painted at the crime scene , investigators concluded that robbery , not race , was the motive .
All four defendants are black , as was Jenkins - Pietrzak .
Jan Pietrzak was white .
Two of the men charged with the crime were assigned to his unit .
Emrys John , 19 , Tyrone Miller , 21 , Kevin Cox , 21 , and Kesaun Sykes , 22 , are each charged with two counts of murder .
John is charged as the shooter .
All four defendants have pleaded not guilty .
The prosecutor is seeking the death penalty .
During the fifth and final day of the preliminary hearing , Investigator Gary LeClair of the Riverside County Sheriff ’s Department testified Wednesday that Sykes told investigators Pietrzak answered the door that night holding a knife .
Cox told investigators that when Pietrzak saw the men armed with guns , he said , " What the ( expletive ) ?
What the ( expletive ) ?
Are you guys serious ? "
The four men then forced their way inside and ransacked the home but were unable to find anything of great value , LeClair said .
While the husband was being held in another room , Sykes told investigators , the men cut off the wife ’s nightgown with a knife and commented on her body , LeClair said .
Sykes said it was Miller ’s idea to " dance her around " in front of " Sgt. P , " hoping it would be his " breaking point " and that he would tell them where money and valuables were hidden , LeClair testified .
Sykes said they took Jenkins - Pietrzak to the living room and raped her with an object while her husband — who had been beaten , bound and gagged — watched , LeClair testified .
Finally , they forced the couple to their knees in the living room and shot them both multiple times in the head , investigators said .
Sykes told investigators that they were in the house about 30 minutes .
On the ride home afterward , the men discussed whether the two were dead and joked and laughed , LeClair said .
Ultimately , just a few pieces of jewelry , including the couple ’s wedding rings , were stolen , along with some other items of little value and an ATM card that was used to withdraw a few hundred dollars .
Investigators recovered many of the stolen items from the defendants ’ homes .
Sykes described the haul to investigators as " petty , " LeClair said .
Pietrzak was a helicopter airframe mechanic based at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar .
Miller and John were assigned to his unit .
A trial date has not been scheduled .

Race may have been the motive for the brutal murders of Brooklyn - raised Marine Sgt. Jan Pawel Pietrzak and his wife , Quiana .
After insisting for months the Pietrzaks were slain by four other Marines for their money , a key prosecution witness dropped a bombshell Friday – racist remarks were spray - painted in the couple ’s California home .
The words " N — – Lover " were found on the wall near the master bedroom and on a bathroom mirror , Riverside County Homicide Investigator Benjamin Ramirez testified .
Pietrzak , 24 , was white , his 26 - year - old wife was black , and the four accused Marines are black .
Ramirez ’s revelation came at the start of a two - day hearing to determine if the Camp Pendleton Marines should stand trial – and plunged the victims ’ heartbroken mothers into tears .
" We ’re going to visit our children at the grave , " Henryka Pietrzak - Varga of Bensonhurst said later .
" That ’s all we have left after this . "
Pietrzak ’s mother and Quiana ’s mother , Glenda Faye Williams - Jenkins , have said from the moment their children were found tortured and murdered in October that this was not just a robbery gone bad .
Riverside County Prosecutor Dan DeLimon refused to explain why they were silent about the racial angle .
" That will be addressed when the preliminary hearing continues on May 8 , " he said .
The accused Marines – Pvt. Emrys John , 18 ; Lance Cpl. Tyrone Miller , 20 ; Pvt. Kesuan ( Psycho ) Sykes , 21 , and Pvt. Kevin Cox , 20 – have all pleaded not guilty .
They face the death penalty if convicted .
Prosecutors say the Pietrzaks were murdered after the shotgun - toting Marines burst into their home in Temecula , Calif .
The killers tied up and tortured the couple .
They violated Quiana repeatedly .
Then John shot them both in the head , prosecutors say .
Ramirez gave a horrific description of the scene he encountered when he arrived at the Pietrzaks ’ ransacked home .
As he testified , the victims ’ mothers cried quietly while the accused Marines sat stone - faced .
Quiana was found leaning against a couch with red duct tape covering her eyes and gunshot wounds to her head and right side , Ramirez said .
Pietrzak was found leaning against his wife , his face , wrists and ankles bound with red duct tape .
He had been shot in the right cheek and there was blood " almost covering his entire face , " Ramirez said .
Ramirez said police found two sofa cushions that they believe were used to muffle the gunshots – as well as evidence the killers tried to cover their tracks by setting a small fire .
They left behind footprints that tied them to the crime , the investigator said .
Also , a day after they questioned Miller , detectives found a dozen firearms and three apparently stolen passports in his quarters .
They also found two check cards in Quiana Pietrzak ’s name , a bracelet with the victim ’s names engraved inside in Polish – and Pietrzak ’s blue military dress uniform , complete with medals , hanging in Miller ’s quarters .
NY Daily News : Suspects in torture - murder of Brooklyn marine Pawel Pietrzak and wife , drank beer after murder
When they were done torturing and killing Brooklyn - raised Marine Sgt. Jan Pawel Pietrzak and his wife , they broke out the beers .
The girlfriend of one of the four Marines charged with the brutal crimes said on a taped police interview played in court Friday that the suds came out after the men came back to her apartment from the Pietrzaks ’ home , dressed in black and reeking of gunpowder .
" They cracked [ open ] some beers and were drinking beer , " said Melissa Buck .
The accused triggerman , 19 - year - old Pvt. Emrys John , was carrying a shotgun , said Buck .
" Good job , E , " one of the accused killers said , Buck told an investigator .
" You earned your stripes tonight . "
Buck , who is dating accused Pvt. Kevin Cox , testified on the second day of a two - day hearing to determine if the Camp Pendleton Marines should stand trial .
As Buck ’s words echoed through the court , some of the suspects – dressed in civvies – appeared to be smiling .
" They ’re smiling , " Pietrzak ’s horrified mother , Henryka , said .
" They ’re like celebrities sitting there in their ties .
It ’s hard to see that . "
John , Cox and the other Marines , Pvt. Kesuan ( Psycho ) Sykes and Lance Cpl. Tyrone Miller , have pleaded not guilty .
They face the death penalty if convicted .
Prosecutors insist the Pietrzaks were slain for their money , but a homicide investigator has said the Marines spray - painted racist remarks in the couple ’s California home before they split .
Polish - born Pietrzak , 24 , was white .
His 26 - year - old wife , Quiana , was black .
Both were tied up , and Quiana Pietrzak was sexually assaulted before John executed them last October , prosecutors said .
On the stand , Buck testified that this was not the first burglary for Miller , Cox or Sykes , who are all 21 .
" I went one time " with them on a heist a month or two before the Pietrzak job , she admitted .
Buck , 25 , said she did not see the Marines divide the loot they allegedly took from the Pietrzaks , some of which was found later at Miller ’s quarters at Camp Pendleton .
Obama 's deputy technology officer McLaughlin : Free speech is net - neutrality foreign policy
When President Obama told university students in Shanghai last week that he ’s a “ big supporter of non-censorship , ” it took 27 minutes for one major Chinese portal to delete that part of his speech .
After two - and - a - half hours , almost all portals in the nation took out the comments from news coverage .
Despite what appeared to be the Chinese government ’s clampdown on the controversial issue of online censorship , an explosive exchange about Obama ’s support for “ open Internet use ” surfaced on blogs and on Twitter .
“ That is the optimistic part of the story , ” said Andrew McLaughlin , the nation ’s deputy technology officer , recounting the event .
In a telecom law conference last Thursday by the University of Nebraska - Lincoln law school , McLaughlin and Tim Wu , a law professor at Columbia University , talked about how an open Internet , or so - called net neutrality , underlies free speech on the Web .
Without it , censorship can occur .
“ If it bothers you that the China government does it , it should bother you when your cable company does it , ” McLaughlin said .
The two technology - policy experts talked on the panel , moderated by Post Tech , about the balance of promoting U.S. beliefs in free speech and open - Internet policies while also respecting the political and cultural norms of other nations .
McLaughlin ran global policy ( non-U.S. policy ) for Google out of the San Francisco Bay Area before joining the administration earlier this year .
The tricky thing about the Internet is that because of the architecture of the Web that gives access providers -- either a government or telecom / cable company -- control over Web content , those entities have an outsized influence over the flow of information .
“ Optimistic view is that censorship is the last - ditch , last - gasp effort by
centralized regimes to control what you do , ” said McLaughlin , the former head of policy for Google .
“ The pessimistic view of the Internet is that it is basically a tool for perfect control . ”
Bringing that back to the United States , the Obama administration views free speech and net neutrality as “ intrinsically linked , ” he said .
The U.S. has a long - held belief that free speech is a national core value , even more so than most nations , he said .
And key to that is ensuring that the corporations giving users access to the Web do n’t act as gatekeepers of information and speech .
The FCC is in the middle of shaping new rules for Internet access that would prevent a service provider such as Verizon , AT&T or Comcast from blocking or prioritizing any legal content on the Web .
McLaughlin said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski's push for new rules supports the adminsitration ’s views on freedom of expression and innovation .
“ In this country our commitment to Internet freedom is so strong that we not only have a First Amendment that restricts the government from restraining free speech , but we also think that companies that provide access turn into speech regulators themselves , ” McLaughlin said .
“ That 's how I think about the issue because of the peculiar nature of access providers to ride off of scarcity in connectivity and long - term contracts with customers .
Because of that control , they are in a position to potentially favor one competitor or speaker than another . ”
So why should the U.S. care if other nations disagree ?
Mclaughlin said the reasons are in part tactical .
Countries that agree with U.S. principles of free exchange of ideas and free economics and markets are aligned with U.S. strategic objectives , he said .
That becomes trickier when allies like Germany and South Korea pursue divergent policies on free speech .
To post a comment on an online forum or blog in South Korea , for instance , a resident has to identify himself or herself through an authentication process that requires a name and national identification number .
In Germany , it is illegal to express allegiance to the Nazi party or to express hate language toward Jews online .
“ You 'd have an armed revolt in this country if you tried to do that , ” McLaughlin said .
“ In Germany , they have a unique historical experience and set of democratic institutions that have repeatedly over decades validated that certain kinds of speech are off limits . ”
Wu advocates for free speech but also cautions that the government treads a fine line between exporting its values and respecting those of other nations .
In the late 1990s , protesters in Seattle demonstrated at a World Trade Organization ministerial meeting against what they thought were flaws of globalization .
Now ,
Wu said , there runs the risk that multinationals of the Internet economy – such as Google – are spreading their cultural norms around the globe .
“ In the 1990s , there were some who were afraid that the world was becoming too simple and a single culture , ” Wu said .
“ Now you have people in countries who tend to dislike Google , for example , because they are creating a sense of uniformity by saying what counts as important on the Web because of their algorithm . ”

Who would not wish for a close relative like Aunt Jane ?
In early 1817 , the year she died , suffering , perhaps , from lymphoma and beginning work on a novel she became too ill to finish , Jane Austen wrote a letter to her 8 - year - old niece , Cassandra .
“ Ym raed Yssac , ” it begins , “ I hsiw uoy a yppah wen raey . ”
Every word in the letter is spelled backward , from that opening New Year ’s wish to her dear Cassy to the signature , “ Ruoy Etanoitceffa Tnua , Enaj Netsua . ”
The author , here as elsewhere , does not condescend to her readers , but she also knows who they are and how to give them pleasure .
Imagine an 8 - year - old girl , perhaps as precocious as her aunt , playfully deciphering these good wishes .
The difficulty comes , though , in imagining Austen herself .
She was such a subtle reader of her characters ’ manners , so knowing about their flaws and virtues , yet herself so opaque and mysterious a presence that it is hard to imagine her in the flesh .
You have to read her the way her most sentient characters read their companions , attending to subtle signs , mannerisms and language .
And for anyone who has even begun to take her measure , there may be no greater pleasure than to visit the new exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum , “ A Woman ’s Wit : Jane Austen ’s Life and Legacy . ”
Like Austen ’s own voice , the show is exquisitely informative while being almost laconic , displaying a wealth of material with careful explication , yet allowing the viewer to tease the writer ’s sensibility out of the objects on display .
The only thing out of character is a self - conscious , 16 - minute documentary , “ The Divine Jane , ” created for the show , in which contemporary figures speak about Austen ’s importance  though little that Cornel West , Fran Lebowitz or Colm Toibin have to say comes close to what the documents communicate on their own .
How quaint seem the days when naÃ ƒÂ¯ve hacker wannabes phished PayPal logons , then posted them on IRC chat channels , to try to make a few bucks — but mostly for bragging rights .
That was circa 2002 - 2003 .
Fast forward to the present .
At this moment , Facebook is being blanketed by two high - volume email phishing campaigns .
These are serious , money - making drives that leverage PCs infected in previous attacks .
While the perpetrators get rich , they also lay groundwork assuring future attacks .
This new breed of multi-purpose , continually - expanding phishing campaign is also inundating Twitter — nearly to atrophy .
Twitter is at a loss as to how to effectively deal with hordes of hacked Twitter account holders stampeding to change their passwords .
Meanwhile , Hotmail , Gmail , YahooMail and AOL mail are under seige , as well .
Phishing attacks to trick legit users into giving up their log - on credentials have become so routine that newbie hackers can pull them off with ease , using free tool kits ; some of these newbie phishers are so fresh - faced that they feel compelled to brag about their new - found skills to the British press .
But make no mistake : phishing has evolved into a very serious , lucrativeÃ‚Â criminal industry .
After a lull earlier this year , phishing levels spiked 200 % between May and September , according to IBM X - Force .
Phishing for financial account log-ons , common for nearly a decade , continues .
By now , most Web users know enough to avoid them .
However , in the ever - evolving calculus of the cybercrime , the username and password to your non-financial Web accounts — especially Hotmail , Facebook , Twitter , Gmail , YahooMail and AOL mail — have emerged as white hot commodities .
“ These log - ons can be used to accomplish a number of tasks , ” says Sam Masiello , threat researcher at McAfee ’s MXLogic messaging security section .
“ A user ’s login information could potentially lead to a gold mine . ”
Unstoppable campaigns
The ongoing Facebook attacks vividly illustrate what ’s going on at the cutting edge .
Two top botnet gangs are bombarding Facebook members with targeted phishing emails to get control of their Facebook accounts .
There is nothing Facebook can do directly — beyond warning its members — to slow down these attacks .
“ This virus has been spreading over email , not on Facebook , ” says Facebook spokesman Simon Axten .
“ We ’re educating users on how to detect this through the Facebook Security Page . ”
In this ongoing attack , the bad guys are directing an army of computers they ’ve previously infected to systematically send out trageted email messages , like the one shown below , Ã‚Â to millions of Facebook members .
The messages advise recipients to click “ here ” to activate a “ new login system that will affect all Facebook users . ”
This takes the victim to a mocked - up Facebook log - in page , shown below , with the victim ’s email address already filled in , but the password blank .
Typing your password , of course , gives up full access to your Facebook account to the crooks .
But they are n’t done yet .
Another prompt , shown below , Ã‚Â then appears advising you to download an “ update tool , ” which actually installs the ZeuS banking Trojan , ( insert usat ZeuS , link ) which lurks on your harddrive waiting for a chance to steal your online banking log - ons , the next time you type them .
As of this morning , messaging security firm AppRiver had counted 41 different Web domains sending out 600 of these targeted phishing emails per minute .
“ We have seen around 6 million pieces of email so far this morning , ” says Fred Touchette , senior analyst at messaging security firm AppRiver .
At its peak yesterday , about 1,000 viral emails per minute were being pushed out , he says .
“ This was a two - pronged attack , ” says Touchette .
“ The first purpose was to phish Facebook accounts , and the second was to attempt to deliver a Trojan onto the victim ’s machine . ”
The Trojan installed was none other that ZeuS , the uber popular Banking Trojan that can be customized to do everything from stealing account log -ons to specific banks , to automating man - in - the - middle attacks that stealthily extract funds while the real account user is logged on .
See LastWatchdog ’s investigative report on A - Z , the rich young creator of ZeuS , who presumably continues to earn royalties for his masterpiece .
This same group of phishersÃ‚Â has tried variations of this type of phishing attack — with lures purporting to come from the IRS , the HMRC and a banking consolidation service in the UK called One Account .
The phishers ’ main goal is to “ intercept financial account information , ” says Touchette .
Bredolab wormhole
The other big , ongoing Facebook phishing campaign began on Monday , 26OCT2009 , around noon Pacific time , says Jamie Tomasello , abuse operations manager for messaging security firm Cloudmark .
These emailsÃ‚Â purport to come from [ email protected ] , and contain a zip file said to hold the recipient ’s new password , recently changed for security reasons by Facebook .
This simple ruse is fooling many smart , computer - savvy people .
Cloudmark has found evidence of Facebook members actually going into their junk mail folders to retrieve these viral messages , then clicking on the infectious zip file .
This installs a the Bredolab Trojan downloader , a versatile little program that works like a wormhole into the PC ’s harddrive .
The thought of a tech - savvy Facebook user grabbing a viral email out of a junk mail folder and clicking on an viral zip file must have the attackers joyous .
“ People are very addicted to their Facebook accounts .
They are so accustomed to communicating frequently and rapidly all the time , ” says Tomasello .
“ They are aware of all the attacks , and are concerned about them .
Yet many of them believe this is a legitimate security message from Facebook that got inadvertently sent to their junk mail folder . ”
Unlike the attackers spreading ZeuS infections , the Bredolab campaigners do not try to first get the recipient to type in his or her password .
As shown below , this criminal gang cut right to the quick and asks you to download a zip file that installs the Bredolab wormhole , according to security firm M86 .
One of the first programs the attackers download through the wormhole is a botnet management program that enlists the PC into the infamous PushDo botnet , one of the most prolific distributors of pharm spam , says Bradley Anstis , Vice President of
Technical Strategy at M86 Security .
By installing the wormhole and botnet agent up front , the attackers quickly gain the option to come back later and download a keystroke logger to grab the any Web mail , social network or financial account log-ons .
In fact , researchers at VeriSign iDefense found evidence the bad guys followed up rather quickly to do just that .
“ The Bredolab downloader installed two additional Trojans — in this case , ZeuS and Glacial Dracon , ” says Ryan Olson , Rapid Response Director at VeriSign iDefense .
“ Both of these Trojans are designed to steal information as well as credentials for online banking Web sites , ” Olson continues . ” In the end , the goal of these attacks is usually financially motivated – and the market for online banking credentials is relatively lucrative . ”
Virgin accounts
In the evolving cyberunderground , valid Web mail and social network accounts are considered highly valuable “ virgin ” assets , useful for sending out viral e-mail messages likely to go unblocked by spam filters , Sophos researcher Beth Jones says .
Virgin
Web mail or social network accounts can sell for as much as $ 2 – more than double what a stolen credit card account number fetches , says Fred Rica , principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers ’ security practice .
Besides botting you and stealing all of your account log-ons , the bad guys can now also use your Web mail and social networks accounts to carry out a matrix of lucrative online capers , made all the easier if you use just one or a handful of the same passwords .
They can send out e-mails that appear to come from you to everyone in your address book to try to get them to divulge passwords .
And they can scour your e-mail folders for clues to the social networks and online banks you use , then crack into those accounts – and change the passwords so only they can access them .
Part of this is because many online services require an e-mail address to set up a Web account .
Meanwhile , replacement passwords are typically sent to that e-mail address – a perfect setup for a crook who is in control of the e-mail account , says Amichi Shulman , chief technical officer of security firm Imperva .
Entry - level cybercrime
The harvesting of virgin Web mail accounts has become a cornerstone of the cyberunderground , so much so that it has evolved into an entry - level cybercrime , says AppRiver analyst Touchette .
Starter kits , complete with slick , ready - made faked log - on pages for each of the top Web mail services and social networks , are readily available – for free .
A newbie phisher has only to supply a website on which to host the faked page and collect the stolen passwords .
This has become a widespread activity , one that is keeping the cyberunderground supplied with a new generation of scammers getting in on the ground floor .
The crooks supplying the free tool kits have a stake in flushing out as many virgin accounts as possible .
“ Each account presents new opportunities to make money , ” Touchette says .
Other attacks
The demand for virgin Web mail accounts has , in fact , become so robust that top - tier cybercrime gangs are going after them with other kinds of attacks as well .
Some specialize in tainting legitimate Web pages , or corrupting search results , with imperceptible infections .
Clicking on the tainted Web page or corrupted search result can open a backdoor on the user ’s PC , through which the attacker can install a program to steal keystrokes – especially those typed into a Web mail log - on form .
Another popular attack involves hacking into the databases of employment sites , shopping sites or any site that collects sensitive information , including valid e-mail addresses .
ScanSafe researcher Mary Landesman says she regularly finds caches of thousands of stolen Web mail log -ons stashed away in nooks and crannies of the Internet , often organized in a way that makes it clear an infection or database hack was used to harvest the data .
“ Most disturbingly , we came across a cache of stolen credentials quite by accident posted in plain view on a now defunct website , ” she says .
“ Presumably others could have found it as well . ”
Twitter users can no longer change passwords
Yet the phishing ruses are arguably the quickest , cleanest way to steal log-ons to non-financial Web accounts .
Twitter is being swamped with simple email phishing ruses .
The bad guys are also creating new Twitter accounts and steal existing ones , then using them to send out viral microblogs —
Tweets carrying infected Web links .
Because these links are shortened , it ’s impossible to spot a good vs. malicious one .
And Tweets move in real time pushed out from multiple sources around the globe , viewable by anyone using the service at that moment .
This characteristic imparts a veil of trustworthiness ripe for cyber criminals to take advantage of .
Many Twitter users whose accounts have been compromised via phishing attacks and malicious URLs circulating in Tweets change their passwords to maintain their existing accounts .
But so many are doing that that Twitter can’t handle the avalanche of passwordÃ‚Â change requests .
Twitter has begun locking out password changes , and now advises users not to change their usernames and passwords .
Tomorrow , 29OCT2009 , antivirus company Kaspersky plans to publicly unveil something called Krab Krawler , a tool it has been developing that ’s designed to troll Twitter microblogs for malicious URLs and then add them to Kaspersky ’s blacklist of malicious programs .
Meanwhile , variations of the phishing email attacks slamming Facebook messages are being aimed at other high - profile targets .
Phishing ruses purporting to come from the IRS , FedEx , UPS and Her Majesty ’s Revenue & Customs , to name a few .
One that ’s now in circulation , shown below , purports to come from the FDIC , and is also spreading the Bredolab wormhole .
M86 ’s forensic work reveals that the FDIC phishing attack is also the handiwork of the same the Pushdo botnet gang behind the Facebook Bredolab phishing scam .
Not at all surprising .

** Gordon - Levitt Lightens Up **
If the postcollegiate career of Joseph Gordon - Levitt came off like a cry for Sundance seriousness — he played an abused rent boy , a suicidal war vet , a tragic high school amnesiac — the summer of 2009 was like bellowing to the bartender for another bucket of Red Bull and vodka .
A few years back , the former child star ( TV's Third Rock from the Sun ) emerged from Columbia a serious young man intent on working only in things he found " creatively stimulating . "
This year he finally expanded his definition of stimulating enough to bookend the summer - movie season with roles in the sweetest ( and by far the best ) romantic comedy in years and the summer 's most cynical action flick .
He says he did G.I . Joe for the prosthetics .
" It was really special to have a face that was not my own face ! " he says .
He did ( 500 ) Days of Summer for more organic reasons :
He liked the script , the director , and co-star Zooey Deschanel , and he was intrigued by playing Tom Hansen , the romantic doofus whose low - key charm is the cornerstone of the movie 's appeal and the reason countless young women left the theater thinking they 'd just met the man of their alt - girl dreams .
Gordon - Levitt has been expanding his tastes outward , directing a short - film adaptation of an Elmore Leonard story , " Sparks , " as well as funneling his energies toward the art site Hitrecord.org .
Recently , Gordon - Levitt says he heard something that he loves : that one of the NBA 's all - time missed - shot leaders is Michael Jordan .

GENEVA , Switzerland — International aid and humanitarian organizations are increasingly under the threat of attack in Afghanistan and are struggling to find ways to operate safely in areas where the U.S. and the Taliban are at war .
Amid concerns for security , the United States Agency for International Development has opened an investigation into claims highlighted in a GlobalPost special report that some international contractors may be involved in payments — through local Afghan subcontractors — that end up in the hands of the Taliban in exchange for protection in Taliban - controlled areas .
GlobalPost has been in contact with several senior officials at aid agencies in Kabul and in Geneva about the unique dangers and challenges these organizations face in operating amid conflict .
The officials agreed that no established NGO would ever knowingly pay a local insurgency , such as the Taliban , for safe passage for their staff because it is a dangerous and slippery slope , and one that could ultimately imperil their operations more .
Given accounting requirements , the officials say it is impossible that the Taliban could be paid directly even by subcontractors .
But they say it is harder , perhaps even impossible , to know if local subcontractors in a Taliban - controlled community may be making payments or delivering some form of aid indirectly to the Taliban at some point down the line .
It is all part of a difficult and dangerous terrain that NGOs traverse all over the world in areas of conflict .
These aid organizations also highlighted what they say is a problematic effort by the Pentagon to help address security concerns by essentially enlisting the aid agencies in fighting the war in Afghanistan .
That , they say , will place them in greater peril , not less .
A three - hour meeting here for U.N. aid agencies , NGOs and an assortment of diplomats in room XI of the Palais des Nations , the U.N. ’s headquarters in Europe , last week , rolled out a progress update and flashy marketing pitch for an Afghan war “ information and knowledge sharing ” platform , called the Civil - Military Fusion Centre .
The basic idea of the center , which has been germinating for nearly two years , is to establish a mechanism that will let military planners tap the vast reservoir of information that NGOs and aid organizations have on the ground .
Of course , the exchange also promises to provide the NGOs with access to what the military knows .
( The center ’s web portal is Civil Military Overview . )
What has particularly upset humanitarian organizations is the suggestion made during the presentation that several hundred NGOs are already “ users ” of the centre ’s information and that they therefore support the idea by implication .
The claim is apparently based on a mailing list for a newsletter , which the center put together without first asking the NGOs if they actually wanted to participate .
Most do n’t .
“ The simple fact that your name is on their list is being used to claim that you support the project , ” Laurent Saillard , director of Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief ( ACBAR ) , told Global Post in a phone interview from Kabul .
Saillard said he plans to ask to be dropped from the distribution list .
“ If the military wants to share information , ” he said , ” they can declassify it so that everyone can see it .
We do n’t want to receive information that will include us in a military dynamic . ”
Saillard is n’t the only one .
“ The fact that they are calling it civil - military fusion says it all , ” Ashley Jackson , Oxfam ’s head of communications in Kabul , said in a phone interview .
“ It creates confusion and it blurs the lines .
It is very dangerous , and it undermines both our impartiality and our ability to work in these areas . ”
“ Even the term itself is a problem , ” said Jonathan Mitchell , emergency response director for NGO Care International ’s secretariat in Geneva .
“ The word ' fusion ' implies a connection between humanitarianism and the military .
The suggestion that we would be involved in sharing information through some sort of database that is managed by the military goes against all concepts of maintaining a clear distinction between humanitarian actors and the military . ”
The NGO concern is that the soldier who helps a villager as part of a Provincial Reconstruction Team ( PRT ) , may come back shooting tomorrow .
To a villager , already at the mercy of forces beyond his control , blurring the lines between aid and combat can make everyone , including aid workers , look like the enemy — and that makes life difficult , if not dangerous , for humanitarians .
A report by the U.N. last year documented a dramatic increase in the killing and abduction of aid workers in Afghanistan
The term “ fusion centre ” originally referred to anti-terrorism response and prevention centers set up by U.S. Homeland Security and the Justice Department from 2003 to 2007 , as part of the Global War on Terror ( GWOT ) .
The goal of those centers was to provide a better way of sharing information between intelligence and law enforcement agencies .
Eventually , the private sector was roped in and AT&T , Sprint , MCI and Verizon were encouraged to provide intelligence information on Americans as well as foreign suspects .
At least 72 U.S. - based fusion centers are currently recognized by Homeland Security .
The Civil - Military Fusion Centre is currently being sold as a NATO initiative , but the headquarters is in Norfolk , Va. , and the officer assigned to present the idea in Geneva was a U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel .
No one seriously questions the fact that Washington is calling the shots on this one , and in fact , a number of people attending the briefing saw it as an extension of Hillary Clinton ’s goal of creating a synergy between the three D's — Diplomacy Development and Defense .
That may make sense from Washington ’s perspective , but from the NGO ’s viewpoint the program effectively turns aid workers into amateur intelligence agents and bolsters the Taliban ’s rationale for kidnapping and assassination , a point that does n’t seem to have occurred to the Pentagon , or if it did , no one seems to have really cared .
An initial red flag was waved when Richard Holbrooke , the administration ’s chief trouble shooter in Afghanistan , casually remarked last April that 90 percent of what the U.S. actually knows about Afghanistan comes from aid agencies and humanitarian groups .
Holbrooke ’s remarks reinforced the Taliban ’s contention that humanitarian workers are really an arm of the war effort against them and thus legitimate targets .
The fact that the Pentagon is still pushing the center despite the furor that surrounded Holbrooke ’s remarks is added proof that Washington still lacks a firm grasp of Afghan thinking on the ground .
NGOs feel especially vulnerable because the influence of armed insurgent groups is clearly growing and simply being able to function in many of these areas often requires delicate negotiations .
None of the NGOs or aid organizations will pay for protection , but it is getting harder to accomplish anything outside of Kabul without running into the Taliban .
Lex Kassenberg , Care ’s country director in Afghanistan , said in a phone interview from Kabul that contacts with the Taliban are strictly forbidden .
“ I know that Care does n’t have the money to pay anyone , ” Kassenberg said , but he adds that when you are providing aid to a community , it is not always possible to know who might be a Taliban supporter .
“ We need to be able to work with local communities in a country like Afghanistan based on the community ’s needs , ” said Care ’s Jonathan Mitchell .
“ We ca n’t always know the political affiliation of all the members of the community , and in fact , it is not our business to know that . ”
Laurent Saillard said that the idea of paying for protection is crazy .
“ If you start doing that , it is the beginning of the end .
It never stops , and very quickly , you are out of the game . ”
But talking with possible Taliban supporters or any of the myriad armed insurgent groups springing up across the country is another matter .
“ We ca n’t avoid it , ” said Saillard .
“ Otherwise our people in the field would be shot , or kidnapped .
In any other conflict we talk to all sides .
Why should we make an exception in Afghanistan ?
If we want to reach out , we have no choice but to talk and negotiate access and security of our teams .
That is just the way it is . ”
Saillard co-chairs the civil - military working group with the Kabul representative of the U.N. ’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , and he suggests that the U.N. is clearly better placed than NATO to provide coordination that is politically neutral .
With European allied support for the Afghan war effort beginning to waver , and serious questions being raised about the lack of achievable goals , the contacts that the NGOs and humanitarian agencies maintain with local populations may provide an invaluable resource when it comes to eventually negotiating a political solution .
For the moment , keeping that option open means maintaining as great a distance from the military as possible .
How thorough was her vetting , really ?
Could anyone have possibly given her a scrupulous enough vet ?
How much of a problem was it that the rest of the campaign had to struggle to figure out who she was along with the rest of us ?
The vetting was clearly minimal at best .
The McCain campaign 's priority was secrecy , not thoroughness .
Palin filled out a questionnaire , A.B. Culvahouse did a phone interview with her for a few hours , Steve Schmidt and Marc Salter spoke with her in person , and that was about it .
Though they successfully pulled off the secret mission of plucking the sitting governor from Alaska unnoticed , the consequences of not thoroughly understanding their own candidate became clear almost immediately .
It was major problem for the communications shop , since they were unable to handle media requests and answer questions about Palin quickly and correctly .
They knew almost nothing about her at first and were given no heads up that she was a serious candidate for the VP slot .
Why did she force Steve Schmidt to tell her children about her decision to run ?
What was that about ?
It certainly seems odd that Palin would have a stranger announce to her children that their mother was running for vice president .
Though we can't pretend to know for certain why she did so , one McCain staffer speculated to us that Palin thought that having Steve Schmidt make a grand announcement would add to the excitement of the event .
Still , Palin 's lack of candor about the event in her interview with Sean Hannity is a perfect example of her tendency to wildly exaggerate the truth .
Does she want to run for president in 2012 ?
Who does she think she represents ?
Does she acknowledge the perception that Americans do n't think she 's prepared ?
We both strongly believe that she will at least explore the possibility of running for president in 2012 .
She has not been very coy about her presidential ambitions , saying more than once that she would " crash through " any doors that might open for her on the road to the White House .
She thinks she represents the deeply conservative Republican base -- the people whom she really does seem to believe represent the " real America . "
It does not seem that she realizes just how polarizing she really is .
It 's important to remember that she spoke to adoring crowds of tens of thousands of people who hung on her every word during the 2008 campaign , and she will do the same thing on her upcoming book tour .
Sarah Palin is someone who is heavily impacted by perceptions she gains from what she sees with her own eyes .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The Karting event took place in Florianopolis in Brazil
Ferrari's Felipe Massa has returned to racing for the first time since his life - threatening accident last season .
The Brazilian driver finished third in a charity karting event won by Michael Schumacher in southern Brazil .
Massa was hosting the " International Challenge of the Stars " - an event that raises money for local charities - for the fifth successive year .
The 28 - year - old suffered a fractured skull in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix in July .
At the time of the accident there were fears that Massa could have suffered loss of vision .
606 : DEBATE
Veteran F1 driver Rubens Barrichello , whose spring flew off the former Brawn driver 's car to hit Massa in Hungary , also took part in the charity kart race .
Massa , who has had plastic surgery on his injury , is not due to return to F1 until next year .
Ferrari hired Italian Giancarlo Fisichella to replace Massa for the final five races of this season after a neck problem prevented seven - time F1 champion Schumacher from driving in his place .
ANOTHER STATE INTRODUCES FIREARMS FREEDOM ACT
By Chuck Baldwin
November 6 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
According to a report published on the Tenth Amendment Center 's web site , " Introduced in the Ohio House on October 16 , 2009 , the ' Firearms Freedom Act ' ( HB - 315 ) seeks ' To enact section 2923.26 of the Revised Code to provide that ammunition , firearms , and firearm accessories that are manufactured and remain in Ohio are not subject to federal laws and regulations derived under Congress ' authority to regulate interstate commerce and to require the words " Made in Ohio " be stamped on a central metallic part of any firearm manufactured and sold in Ohio . ' "
The report went on to say , " While the HB315 's title focuses on federal gun regulations , it has far more to do with the 10th Amendment 's limit on the power of the federal government .
It specifically states :
" ' The regulation of intrastate commerce is vested in the states under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution , particularly if not expressly preempted by federal law .
The congress of the United States has not expressly preempted state regulation of intrastate commerce pertaining to the manufacture on an intrastate basis of firearms , firearm accessories , and ammunition . '
" Some supporters of the legislation say that a successful application of such a state - law would set a strong precedent and open the door for states to take their own positions on a wide range of activities that they see as not being authorized to the Federal Government by the Constitution . "
See the report here .
Two states have already passed their own Firearms Freedom Acts : Montana and Tennessee .
And , along with Ohio , at least 7 other states have introduced similar bills .
Those states are Alaska , Florida , Michigan , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , and Texas .
More information regarding the status of these State bills can be seen here .
As you might suspect , the federal government does n't take too kindly to these State laws .
In fact , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives ( ATF ) sent an open letter to all Montana and Tennessee firearms dealers denouncing the State laws .
ATF assistant director Carson Carroll wrote that " Federal law supersedes the Act . "
The Tenth Amendment Center quotes constitutional historian Kevin Gutzman as correctly stating , " Their [ ATF 's ] view is that the states exist for the administrative convenience of the Federal Government , and so of course any conflict between state and federal policy must be resolved in favor of the latter .
" This is another way of saying that the Tenth Amendment is not binding on the Federal Government .
Of course , that amounts to saying that federal officials have decided to ignore the Constitution when it does n't suit them . "
Ah !
But that 's just the problem : the federal government has been ignoring the Constitution for decades -- so much so that if there is going to be any restoration of genuine liberty in the country , the states are going to have to stand up to this out - of - control national leviathan and say , " No . "
And they are going to have to say it loudly enough for Washington to get the message .
And I cannot think of a freedom issue that is better to " draw a line in the sand " for than the issue of the right of the people to keep and bear arms .
At the end of the day , the Second Amendment was never about hunting or target shooting .
It has always been about protecting the people and states against federal tyranny .
The Second Amendment itself states , " A well regulated Militia , BEING NECESSARY TO THE SECURITY OF A FREE STATE , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed . "
( Emphasis added . )
Note that the purpose of the right to keep and bear arms was to insure " the security of a FREE STATE . "
( Emphasis added . )
" Free from what ? " you ask .
Free from federal tyranny .
Free from an overbearing , encroaching , heavy - handed , would - be national government .

The founders -- even the Centralists of the day -- all acknowledged that the right to keep and bear arms was , first of all , for the protection of the people against government tyranny .
Observe :
" [ I ] f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens , little , if at all , inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms , who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow - citizens . "
( Alexander Hamilton , The Federalist Papers , Number 29 )
" While the people have property , arms in their hands , and only a spark of noble spirit , the most corrupt Congress must be mad to form any project of tyranny . "
( Rev. Nicholas Collin , Fayetteville [ NC ] Gazette , October 12 , 1789 )
" The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government . "
( Thomas Jefferson )
" Who are the militia ?
Are they not ourselves ? . . .
Congress has no power to disarm the militia .
Their swords , and every other terrible implement of the soldier , are the birthright of an American . . .
[ T ]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments , but , where I trust in God it will ever remain , in the hands of the people . "
( Tench Coxe , ally of James Madison and member of the Continental Congress , Freeman 's Journal , February 20 , 1778 )
Coxe also said , " As civil rulers , not having their duty to the people duly before them , may attempt to tyrannize , and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country , might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow - citizens , the people are confirmed by the next article [ the Second Amendment ] in their right to keep and bear their private arms . "
( Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution , Philadelphia Federal Gazette , June 18 , 1789 )
So , for now , 10 states have proposed -- and 2 have passed --a Firearms Freedom Act , properly declaring that federal authority granted in the Constitution regarding interstate commerce cannot apply to products ( firearms , in this case ) that are manufactured and sold within the territory of each respective State .
In other words , 10 States are serving notice to Washington , D.C. , that they are going to insist that the federal government stop ignoring the Constitution of the United States .
In the same vein , Tennessee State legislator Susan Lynn recently sent an open letter to the State legislative bodies of the other 49 states stating :
" On June 23 , 2009 , House Joint Resolution 108 , the State Sovereignty Resolution , was signed by Governor Phil Bredesen .
The Resolution created a committee which has as its charge to :
• Communicate the resolution to the legislatures of the several states ,
• Assure them that this State continues in the same esteem of their friendship ,
• Call for a joint working group between the states to enumerate the abuses of authority by the federal government , and
• Seek repeal of the assumption of the powers and the imposed mandates . "
In the body of her letter , Rep . Lynn states , " The role of our American government has been blurred , bent , and breached .
The rights endowed to us by our creator must be restored . "
The Tennessee State representative continued by saying , " The Constitution does not include a congressional power to override state laws .
It does not give the judicial branch unlimited jurisdiction over all matters .
It does not provide Congress with the power to legislate over everything .
This is verified by the simple fact that attempts to make these principles part of the Constitution were soundly rejected by its signers .
" With this in mind , any federal attempt to legislate beyond the Constitutional limits of Congress ' authority is a usurpation of state sovereignty -- and unconstitutional . "

" " Whether they ’re antique rifles or modern handguns and shotguns , the U.S. has a lot of firearms .
In 2007 , U.S. companies manufactured 3.85 million guns , according to the ATF .

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives all citizens the right to keep and bear arms .
If data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics are any indication , many Americans are exercising this freedom .
Nationally , 42 percent of people responding to a 2008 survey reported having a gun in their home .
That 's up from 36 percent in 1999 , when gun ownership reached an all - time low .
Among gun owners , 58 percent own pistols , 63 percent own shotguns and 59 percent own rifles [ source : Bureau of Justice Statistics , 2003 , 2008 ] .
The sales data paint a slightly different picture .
According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation , a third of all gun sales can be attributed to handguns ( such as revolvers and pistols ) , a third to rifles and shotguns , and a third to ammunition .

Unfortunately , these statistics do n't drill down to specific models .
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) offers some insights with its firearms manufacturing and export reports , which tally the number of guns produced by U.S. manufacturers each year .
But production levels do n't tell the whole story .
For example , some custom gun makers may produce fewer than 20 weapons a year , yet their products stir intense customer loyalty .
Still , it 's this article 's job to present the five most popular guns in civilian hands .
To facilitate the task , we made our final selections using several criteria , including manufacturing data , historical significance and anecdotal information from gun sites and enthusiasts .
We also considered guns across five major small arms categories -- muzzleloaders , shotguns , rifles , revolvers and pistols .
We wo n't discuss machine guns and other fully automatic assault rifles , which are heavily regulated and not generally considered civilian - friendly weapons .
Let 's start with a throwback .

The Afghan Speech Obama Should Give
( But Won't )
By Tom Engelhardt
Sure , the quote in the over - title is only my fantasy .
No one in Washington -- no less President Obama -- ever said , " This administration ended , rather than extended , two wars , " and right now , it looks as if no one in an official capacity is likely to do so any time soon .
It 's common knowledge that a president -- but above all a Democratic president -- who tried to de-escalate a war like the one now expanding in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan , and withdraw American troops , would be so much domestic political dead meat .
This everyday bit of engrained Washington wisdom is , in fact , based on not a shred of evidence in the historical record .
We do , however , know something about what could happen to a president who escalated a counterinsurgency war : Lyndon Johnson comes to mind for expanding his inherited war in Vietnam out of fear that he would be labeled the president who " lost " that country to the communists ( as Harry Truman had supposedly " lost " China ) .
And then there was Vice President Hubert Humphrey who -- incapable of rejecting Johnson 's war policy -- lost the 1968 election to Richard Nixon , a candidate pushing a fraudulent " peace with honor " formula for downsizing the war .
Still , we have no evidence about how American voters would deal with a president who did n't take the Johnson approach to a losing war .
The only example might be John F. Kennedy , who reputedly pushed back against escalatory advice over Vietnam , and certainly did so against his military high command during the Cuban Missile Crisis .
In both cases , however , he acted in private , offering quite a different face to the world .
We know that there would be those on the right , and quite a few war - fightin ' liberals as well , who would go nuclear over any presidential minus option in Afghanistan .
Many of them will , in fact , do so over anything less than the McChrystal plan anyway .
And we know that a media storm would certainly follow .
But when it comes to how voters would react , especially at a moment when unhappiness with the Afghan War ( as well as the president 's handling of it ) is on the rise , there is no historical evidence .
Sometime in the reasonably near future , President Obama will undoubtedly address the American people on whatever decision he makes about the war in Afghanistan .
Every sign indicates that he will hew to Washington 's political wisdom about what a war president can do in this country .
Ever since late September when someone leaked Afghan War commander General Stanley McChrystal 's report to the president on the disastrous situation in Afghanistan and the counterinsurgency war he wants to wage there , we 've been all but living inside Obama 's endless comprehensive review of war strategy .
After all , we get daily reports from " the front , " largely in the form of a flood of leaks to the media , on just what 's being considered -- from General McChrystal 's estimated troop escalation numbers , to Ambassador Karl Eikenberry 's private cables to the president suggesting no more troops be sent , to recent outbursts by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the president decrying all the leaks and rumors .
This , of course , is what happens when your deliberations drag out over months while the key players , military and civilian , jostle , jockey , and elbow each other for advantage .
In these last weeks , we 've grown accustomed to previously esoteric terms like the " hybrid option " and " counterterrorism - plus . "
While we do n't know what exactly is going through Obama 's mind , or just when or in what form he will address us , we do know something about what his conclusions are likely to be .
While there may be " off- ramps " and an " end game " for the Afghan War lurking somewhere in the distance in his plan , we know , as a start , that he 's not going to recommend a minus option .
We have long been assured that any proposals for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan were never " on the table . "
And despite Ambassador Eikenberry 's near zero-option position , we also know that the president is likely to choose some form of military escalation ( even if these days , unlike in the Vietnam era , the word used is usually " surge " ) .
We do n't know how many U.S. troops will be involved or whether they will be weighted toward trainers and advisors or combat forces , but it seems clear that some will be sent .
It 's not for nothing that the Pentagon is ramping up new Afghan bases and reinforcing old ones .
Undoubtedly , the President 's speechwriters are already preparing the text for his Afghan ... well , we do n't really know whether it will be " remarks , " an announcement as part of a press conference , or a more formal address to the American people .
In any case , we -- the rest of us -- have had all the disadvantages of essentially being in on the president 's councils , and none of the advantages of offering our own advice .
But I do n't see why we should n't weigh in .
Personally , I prefer not to leave the process to his speechwriters and advisors .
What follows , then , is my version of the president 's Afghan announcement .
I 've imagined it as a challenging prime - time address to the American people .
Certainly , the subject is important enough for such an address , even if the last time Obama did this , in March , it was via an unannounced appearance on a Friday morning .
So here 's my President Obama -- in , I hope , something like his voice -- doing what no American president has yet done .
Sit down , turn on your TV , and see what you think .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc will pay $ 26 billion to buy out Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp in a bet the nation ’s largest rail company will benefit from a recovering U.S. economy .
The deal , announced on Tuesday , is the billionaire investor ’s biggest - ever acquisition and may prompt him to sell some of his other investments , which include a wide range of companies from Coca - Cola Co to General Electric Co , some Buffett watchers said .
By betting on BNSF , Buffett -- the world ’s second - richest person and a long - time model train buff -- renewed interest in a storied , but highly cyclical American industry that has tried to reinvent itself by emphasizing its ability to move goods cheaply and efficiently .
“ It ’s an all - in wager on the economic future of the United States , ” Buffett , who has been building up his rail holdings for several years , said in a statement .
“ I love these bets . ”
Buffett will pay a premium of 31.5 percent over BNSF ’s closing stock price on Monday , valuing the railroad at $ 34 billion , or 18 times estimated 2010 earnings .
Most rail companies ’
P/E ratios are in the mid-teens .
BNSF shares jumped 27.51 percent and other U.S. and Canadian rail shares also rose , as analysts said the deal puts an oft - neglected industry in Wall Street ’s focus and could bring some fresh money into the sector .
But they did not expect a wave of deals in the railroad sector , given regulatory concerns .
“ Buffett has always stated that he likes the longer - term viability of the rails ... but people really were n’t paying attention , ” said Longbow Research analyst Lee Klaskow .
“ This is shining a spotlight on this group , bringing more investors into the fold . ”
SHARE DEAL UNUSUAL FOR BUFFETT
Buffett , who has long preferred all - cash deals , is paying $ 100 per share in cash and stock for the 77.4 percent of BNSF shares that Berkshire does not already own .
Berkshire would also assume $ 10 billion of BNSF debt .
It would pay about $ 16 billion in cash , of which $ 8 billion would be from its own funds and the rest from debt .
Smoothing the way for the share exchange , Buffett reversed his long - time opposition to stock splits , which has resulted in Berkshire having the highest per-share prices of any shares on the New York Stock Exchange .
Buffett agreed to a 50 - for - 1 split of Berkshire Class B stock , which will make it much more accessible to retail investors .
The Class B shares trade at over $ 3,000 , and the Class A shares at more than $ 100,000 .
The B shares were up about 1.9 percent and the A shares about 1.7 percent .
Berkshire could not do an all - stock deal because it would deplete its capital beyond what insurance regulators would allow , said Justin Fuller , an analyst at Midway Capital Research & Management in Chicago and author of the Buffettologist.com blog .
Buffett is not expected to shed any of Berkshire ’s biggest holdings , which include insurers such as Geico , analysts said .
It has close to 80 units with products ranging from carpeting to natural gas , ice cream , paint and underwear .
“ They tend to accumulate capital faster than they know what to do with it and this is a really good deal for them , ” Fuller said .
“ It will create a lot of value for Berkshire . ”
RECOVERING ECONOMY
Buffett , 79 , is one of the world ’s most revered investors and is known for making big long - term bets .
In October 2008 , after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off global selling , he wrote in The New York Times : “ Fears regarding the long - term prosperity of the nation ’s many sound companies make no sense . ”
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The deal , expected to close in the first quarter of 2010 , comes as the U.S. economy begins to recover from its worst downturn since World War Two .
BNSF , the No. 1 U.S. railroad by revenue , operates in the U.S. West and Midwest .
It said in September that freight volumes were recovering and it was encouraged by an improvement in consumer - related markets .
The deal really marks a bet on the future of coal , said Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago .
“ Buffett is trying to get into coal , but doing it in a cheaper way , ” Ablin said .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
U.S. railroads have invested in technology and improved the efficiency of operations , while arguing that their method of transport is cheaper and cleaner than shipping goods by truck .
The deal came together quickly .
“ I made ( BNSF Chief Executive Officer Matt Rose ) an offer and he said he would take it to his board and it took about 15 minutes , ” Buffett told CNBC television .
“ We wo n’t be making any huge deals for a while . ”
With Berkshire ’s support , BNSF would be able to invest in its infrastructure and not have to worry about meeting quarterly expectations , said Thomas Russo , a partner with Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster , Pennsylvania , which counts Berkshire as its second - largest holding .
RAILS RALLY
BNSF , with its Western presence , is a key shipper of Asian goods into the U.S. interior and the leading shipper of coal and agricultural commodities , according to Robert W. Baird .
About a third of BNSF ’s revenue comes from intermodal freight -- containers moved from ship to rail or truck -- with 23 percent from coal , and 19 percent from farm goods .
BNSF ’s 2008 revenue of $ 18 billion was about $ 1 billion ahead of that of its nearest rival , Union Pacific Corp .
BNSF shares closed up 27.51 percent at $ 97 .
Union Pacific gained 7.9 percent , Norfolk Southern Corp rose 5.4 percent and CSX Corp rose 7.3 percent .
The Dow Transports index , which includes all these stocks , gained 5.3 percent and is up 75 percent from March lows , beating the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .
Canadian National Railway Co rose 1.8 percent and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd rose 3.2 percent .
Berkshire held a 1.9 percent stake in Union Pacific and a 0.5 percent stake in Norfolk Southern , according to Thomson Reuters data .
The small size of those holdings was unlikely to attract regulatory scrutiny , said Bob Szabo , executive director of Consumers United for Rail Equity .
Buffett said he is not interested in buying Union Pacific .
Los Angeles - based money manager Capital Group Cos , which oversees the $ 780 billion American Funds mutual fund family , would be one of the big winners in the deal .
Its fund unit held a 9.5 percent stake , making it the largest shareholder after Buffett , according to Thomson Reuters data .
Goldman Sachs and Evercore Partners Inc acted as financial advisers to BNSF , and the company ’s legal counsel is Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP .
Berkshire did not have a financial adviser , but its transaction counsel is Munger , Tolles & Olson LLP .
By allowing gays and lesbians to marry just like we allow any two other consenting adults to marry .
Marriage , as defined in the law , is a secular institution and contract between two people who wish to share their lives with each other , and provides a slew of legal benefits you simply can’t easily get any other way .
Some , such as tax benefits , ca n’t be received in any other manner .
So , if we deny gays and lesbians the right to marry , we deny them the right to a beneficial contract that can enhance their lives in a way no other substitute contract can .
Most opponents of gay marriage laws present their case as protecting their religious freedom and religious institution of marriage .
I have some bad news for these people .
The government can not and does not regulate the religious institution of marriage , only the secular contract .
Gays and lesbians already get married religiously , and there are plenty of religions perfectly happy to perform the ceremony for them .
Besides which , while you have the freedom to practice your religion as you see fit ( so long as you bring no harm to another ) , other people have this same religious freedom , including the freedom to allow gays to marry in their services .
Furthermore , Maine ’s gay marriage law does n’t force churches to perform marriage ceremonies that go against their religious beliefs .
A gay couple will instead simply find a church who supports their marriage , or they ’ll be married by a justice of the peace .
No infringement of religious freedom is required to provide equal rights to gay couples .
So , to those who would deny the right to marry to gay couples , stop pretending you ’re protecting marriage .
You are n’t , you ’re simply trying to enforce your view of religion on everyone else and deny a group their civil rights .
Frankly , I ’m tired of hearing this argument that the religious institution of marriage will fail if gays are allowed to marry , and I ’m tired of hearing you treat religious marriage and secular marriage as the same thing , because they are n’t .
They ’re just currently tied a little too closely together in the law .
Stop trying to deny gay and lesbian couples their civil rights .
Do n’t force your religious beliefs onto others .
Instead , learn to live peacefully with your neighbors , and accept them for who they are .
We ’ll all be better off if we can manage this .
So vote no on question 1 , and show the state of Maine and the United States that we support marriage , equality , and civil rights by allowing gays to marry .
Note :
For reference , this is question 1 in Maine on November 3rd , 2009 : “ Do you want to reject the new law that lets same - sex couples marry and allows individuals and religious groups to refuse to perform these marriages ? ”

Immaculate arm
This prosthetic arm was designed by Hans Alexander Huseklepp , a designer in Norway .
It is designed to be connected to the wearer 's nervous system , like the most advanced , but less aesthetically designed , prosthetics currently are .
Because each of its joints is a globe joint it is capable of a larger freedom of movement than a normal human arm .
The exterior parts of the arm are made from the plastic Corian , the inner layer is textile .
This image is a model built to demonstrate the concept .
( Image : Hans Alexander Huseklepp )
Out of uncanny valley
Huseklepp says that he wanted to get away from traditional designs , which hide their technological skeletons under silicone rubber .
" They imitate the look of a natural arm perfectly but as soon as someone touches it they realise it ’s a prosthetic , " he says .
This can make things awkward due to an effect dubbed " Uncanny Valley " , a term used to describe how close mimics of human appearance seem more creepy than more stylised attempts .
( Image : Hans Alexander Huseklepp )
Handle with care
" Pity them who have broken their leg , not for the inconvenience of their condition , but for the ugliness of the prosthetic devices they have to contend with . "
That 's how designer Damien O'Sullivan describes his motivation to explore different styles for prosthetics .
He thinks this porcelain cast will be an object to be treasured once the wearer has recovered , rather than cast aside as a reminder of misfortune .
( Image : Damien O'Sullivan ) Advertisement
Brace yourself
This back brace has been designed in the style of a corset to help wearers " recover the pleasure of getting dressed , " says its creator Francesca Lanzavecchia .
Each plastic brace is custom - fitted to the wearer .
Other versions of the brace sport tattoo - style designs or feature piercings to resemble the modifications made to real skin .
( Image : Francesca Lanzavecchia )
Ironic design
Lanzavecchia designed this cane to " ironically flaunt " the health problem that might cause someone to need it .
The stick 's pitted appearance is a replication of the effects of osteoporosis on bone .
Another in the series has a handle made in the shape of a ball and socket joint , like the hip .

Legs cast in soil
Aimee Mullins is an actress , model , athlete and bilateral amputee .
She has 12 pairs of prosthetic legs .
They include a pair of Cheetah legs used for sports , an everyday pair with springs and shock absorbers , and decorative pairs that are transparent or carved from wood for the catwalk and photo shoots .
Here Aimee wears legs that are cast in soil , complete with potatoes , in a photo taken by visual artist Matthew Barney for his film Cremaster 3 .

Subversive fashion
Mullins strode down the catwalk wearing these carved legs from designer Alexander McQueen , kickstarting her modelling career in 1999 .
Mullins says that her achievements in the realm of fashion and the arts have done " as much if not more " than her sporting successes to challenge the notion that wearing a prosthetic limits what a person can do .
Part of the reason is that it makes it possible to deal with a " worthy " subject with a light touch , she says .
" Poetry and whimsy matter .
The glamour of the catwalk makes it easy to change someone 's beliefs before they even realise their views have been challenged .
It 's more subversive than science or sport " .
( Image : Archive of Aimee Mullins )
Glass legs
Mullins 's " glass legs " , here stuffed with earth and potatoes , are actually made from the kind of clear polyurethane used to make bowling balls .
" The way people view disability is changing , " Mullins told New Scientist .
" All sorts of people from all sorts of disciplines are getting involved in the conversation around prosthetics and the body – people are starting to look at things that have been medical rehabilitation or assistance devices as objects of desire " .
Read an interview with Mullins here .

To wear or not to wear
This feather cuff , designed by Tonya Douraghy , gives the wearer a choice if they do n't want to mask their missing limb completely with a prosthetic .
It is meant to be worn over the residual limb , slipped on over the stump .
They can design it so that the stump is either hidden in the feathers , or out in the open .
Douraghy says , " In one sense , it is aesthetic adornment but also an alternative to being forced to complete the amputated limb in a life - like way " .
( Image : Tonya Douraghy )
Feather light
This feathered wing is designed to be used in a similar way .
Designer Carli Pierce says it can either be fitted over a residual limb or used to decorate a conventional prosthetic .
Pierce describes it as " an accessory that encourages the amputee to wear something fanciful and delicate , rather than utilitarian and industrial " .

Telescopic foothold
Hugh Herr heads the biomechanics group at the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
He was a professional climber until he had an accident that led to both of his legs being amputated .
Herr continued to climb , though , and started making his own prosthetics to improve his climbing abilities .
This photograph shows his telescopic legs , which can be made longer or shorter as circumstances demand .

Clearly , Matt Drudge has developed a fascination with the declining U.S. dollar .
Zeroing in on the dollar 's decline
On Tuesday , Matt Drudge ran a headline about the weakening U.S. dollar on his website , Drudgereport.com .
In and of itself , that would be unremarkable , except that it was the 18th time Drudge had posted a link to a story about the weak dollar this month .
And October was only 20 days old .

Clearly , Matt Drudge has developed a fascination with the declining U.S. dollar .
“ He ’s fixated on it , ” said Tom Rosenstiel , director of the Pew Research Center ’s Project for Excellence in Journalism .
“ There ’s no question that Drudge can alter what people are paying attention to . ”
Market watchers say it ’s unlikely that Drudge is actually moving the currency markets with his relentless attention .
“ I do n’t think that anyone who seriously trades currencies reads The Drudge Report before making important buy or sell decisions , ” said Chris Roush , a professor of business journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
But Drudge does have the ability to put news items on the radar screen of major media outlets and political figures in Washington .
And other people are paying attention to Drudge , too : A source close to the U.S. national security community said that Drudge ’s link to a story in the [ London ]
Independent earlier this month instantly grabbed the attention of senior American officials .
The story raised the prospect that foreign governments were in talks to replace the U.S. dollar as the default currency for oil trading .
Any kind of coordinated attack on the value of the dollar could be seen as a national security threat , and defense and intelligence officials were curious about the source of the anti-dollar rumors that day .
On Tuesday , Drudge spotlighted a one - paragraph item from the Agence France - Presse news service titled “ We are ‘ worried ’ about weak dollar : Eurogroup chief . ”
That same day , the dollar hit a new 14 - month low against the euro , with the continental currency trading as high as $ 1.4994 against the dollar .
That represented a continuation of the greenback ’s steady slide this year :
The euro traded at $ 1.25 against the dollar as recently as March .
Drudge ’s interest in the brutal year for the buck is intensifying .
According to a search of the website DrudgeReportArchives.com , which is not affiliated with Drudge himself , the Internet pioneer has already posted more stories on the dollar in October than he did the month before , when he posted links to 13 stories about the currency .
“ There ’s definitely an appetite from a fairly large number of people for these kinds of stories , ” said former Bush Treasury and White House spokesman Tony Fratto , who is now a CNBC contributor .
“ People are looking for cheat sheets for how the economy is doing , and they look to the Dow , the unemployment number and now the value of the dollar . ”
Many economists say one reason for the slumping dollar is the strengthening global economy .
In the darkest days of the financial collapse last year , investors flocked to the dollar — largely because it is seen as a safe , if low - return , investment in troubled times .
What ’s more , there ’s one economic upside to a soft dollar : increased exports for U.S. manufacturers .
Reporter Nelson Schwartz noted in an article in The New York Times on Sunday : “ A weak dollar could prove beneficial to the American economy by aiding long - suffering manufacturers , rebuilding a stronger industrial base and lifting exports even if it makes life harder for trading partners around the world , especially in Europe . ”
But that Times article , titled “ In Dollar ’s Fall , Upside for U.S. Exports , ” did not receive a link from Drudge .
Drudge also has tried to tie President Barack Obama to the dollar ’s plunge .
“ Obama Dollar Retreats Most Against Commodities in Wealth Shift , ” noted Drudge ’s link to a Bloomberg story Oct. 13 .
“ Obama Under Fire Over Dollar , ” he headlined Oct. 7 , linking to a story in the Financial Times .
That ’s leading some to conclude that Drudge ’s conservative politics are playing a part in his focus on the issue .
“ I think Drudge has been taking a page out of Fox News ’ playbook , ” said Adam Penenberg , a journalism professor at New York University and author of “ Viral Loop : From Facebook to Twitter , How Today ’s Smartest Businesses Grow Themselves . ”
“ Because Republicans have been making hay over their belief that America is becoming weak , its “ socialist ” economy in shambles , stories on the falling dollar help buttress this worldview , ” Penenberg said .
One financial consultant who asked not to be named agreed with that analysis .
“ The problem is now that fundamentals - driven dollar weakness is being politicized as an anti-Obama weapon , thus Drudge , ” said the consultant .
“ Drudge is simply looking at the charts and then hitting the administration on it . ”
Other conservatives have been interested in the decline of the dollar as well this month .
On Oct. 6 , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted an item on her Facebook page reacting to the reports of an anti-dollar effort in the oil markets .
“ Even the possibility of such a talk weakens the dollar and renews fears about its continued viability as an international reserve currency , ” Palin wrote .
“ In fact , today a United Nations official called for a new global reserve currency to replace the dollar and end our ‘ privilege ’ to run up huge deficits . ”
Palin laid the blame for the weak dollar squarely on the Obama administration : “ All of this is a result of our out - of - control debt , ” she wrote .
“ This is why we need to rein in spending . ”
Traditionally , the dollar is a topic that politicians shy away from , since too - casually worded comments by officeholders can accidentally tank the currency markets .
But that ’s been changing in recent months as the decline of the dollar has mirrored larger concerns about the state of the U.S. economy and America ’s place in the post - crash financial world order .
As global temperatures and energy costs continue to soar , renewable sources of energy will be key to a sustainable future .
An attractive replacement for gasoline is biofuel , and in two studies published online in Genome Research , scientists have analyzed the genome structures of bioethanol - producing microorganisms , uncovering genetic clues that will be critical in developing new technologies needed to implement production on a global scale .
Bioethanol is produced from the fermentation of plant material , such as sugar cane and corn , by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae , just as in the production of alcoholic beverages .
However , yeast strains thriving in the harsh conditions of industrial fuel ethanol production are much more hardy than their beer brewing counterparts , and surprisingly little is known about how these yeast adapted to the industrial environment .
If researchers can identify the genetic changes that underlie this adaptation , new yeast strains could be engineered to help shift bioethanol production into high gear across the globe .
Two studies published in Genome Research have taken a major step toward this goal , identifying genomic properties of industrial fuel yeasts that likely gave rise to more robust strains .
In one of the studies , researcher Lucas Argueso and colleagues from Duke University and Brazil have sequenced and analyzed the structure of the entire genome of strain PE - 2 , a prominent industrial strain in Brazil .
The group 's work revealed that portions of the genome are plastic compared to other yeast strains , specifically the peripheral regions of chromosomes , where they observed a number of sequence rearrangements .
Interestingly , these chromosomal rearrangements in PE - 2 amplified genes involved in stress tolerance , which likely contributed to the adaptation of this strain to the industrial environment .
As PE - 2 is amenable to genetic engineering , the authors believe that their work on PE - 2 will open the door to development of new technologies to boost bioethanol production .
In a second study published in Genome Research , researchers from Stanford University and Brazil led by Boris Stambuk and Gavin Sherlock have also analyzed the genome structure of industrial bioethanol yeasts , searching for variations in the number of gene copies in five strains employed in Brazil , including PE - 2 .
Stambuk and colleagues found that all five industrial strains studied harbor amplifications of genes involved in the synthesis of vitamins B6 and B1 - compounds critical for efficient growth and utilization of sugar .
The group experimentally demonstrated that the gene amplifications confer robust growth in industrial conditions , indicating that these yeasts likely adapted to limited availability of vitamins in the industrial process to gain a competitive advantage .
Furthermore , the authors suggest that this knowledge can be utilized to engineer new strains of yeast capable of even more efficient bioethanol production , from a wider range of agricultural stocks .
It is evident that an expanding human population will require more energy that exerts less impact on the environment , and the information gained from these genomic studies of industrial bioethanol yeasts will be invaluable as biofuel researchers optimize production and implement the technology worldwide .

A Brief Bio : Shawn Antoski did not lace up the blades until he was 12 years old .
The prototypical tough guy of hockey , Antoski made his way up through the ranks , but at every step of the way it was his fighting talents that helped him most .
In North Bay , in junior , he averaged nearly 200 pims a year , and as a result Vancouver drafted him in the first round of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft .
For the next three years he fought his way to recognition in the minors , but by 1993 Antoski had made the Canucks full - time .
Early the next season , though , he was dealt to Philadelphia , and within two years he had added Pittsburgh and Anaheim to his list of NHL cities .
Antoski missed much of 1996 - 97 recovering from hernia surgery , but his career came to an end just nine games into the following season when he was involved in a serious car accident on November 24 , 1997 and had to retire because of his injuries .
An Expanded version : Antoski played his junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the North Bay Centennials , and was selected by the Vancouver Canucks in the first round ( 18th overall ) of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft , just ahead of future superstars Keith Tkachuk and Martin Brodeur .
Although his role was primarily that of an enforcer , Antoski was noted for his skating ability , which was exceptional for a player of his size .
While his offensive ability was very limited , his speed and size made him a fearsome forechecker and a heavy bodychecker .
He was also an able fighter .
Antoski turned pro in 1990 and was assigned to the Milwaukee Admirals , Vancouver 's IHL farm team .
He would spend most of the next three season toiling in minor pro , although he received a brief callup each year , playing in a total of 8 NHL games .
He would finally establish himself as an NHL regular in the 1993 - 94 , appearing in 55 games for the Canucks and recording 3 points and 190 penalty minutes .
The highlight of his career would come in that year 's playoffs , as Vancouver reached the Stanley Cup Finals .
Playing on a gritty fourth line with Tim Hunter and John McIntyre , Antoski was a physical catalyst for the team and played probably the best hockey of his career .
Early in the 1994 - 95 season , Antoski was dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers for Josef Beranek , and would again participate in a lengthy playoff run as Philadelphia reached the conference finals .
In 1995 - 96 , he would set career highs by appearing in 64 games and recording 204 PIM , and scored his first career playoff goal .
Antoski signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the 1996 - 97 season , but only appeared in 13 games for the Penguins before being dealt to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks , and only appeared in 2 games for the Mighty Ducks before his season was ended due to injury .
He returned to the Ducks the following season , but on November 24 , 1997 he was involved in a serious car accident which left him with a compressed skull fracture .
While he recovered fully , it marked the end of his hockey career .
Antoski appeared in 183 NHL games , recording 3 goals and 8 points , along with 599 PIM .
He also suited up for 36 playoff games , recording 4 points and 74 PIM .
His younger brother Shayne was a teammate in North Bay , and would also go on to a brief pro career , playing two seasons in the ECHL .

We live in times when fact and propaganda are all too easily — and often deliberately — conflated .
I recall , a long time ago , sitting in my public high school 's Advanced Placement US History course , when the instructor explicitly mentioned " lack of government regulation " as one of the causes of the Great Depression .
The odd aspect was that he prefaced this explanation with an explicit warning to me that I would not like what he was about to say .
It was as if he knew that he was presenting an ideologically charged position as fact — and he did it anyway , because , in his mind , no other interpretation of the Great Depression was possible .
He and millions like him would benefit immensely from reading Robert P. Murphy 's The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression and the New Deal .
The myth of the Great Depression being caused by laissez - faire capitalism — and being solved by either the New Deal , World War II , or both — is so prevalent that in popular - opinion surveys , Franklin Delano Roosevelt routinely appears in the top five of all US presidents , while the name of Herbert Hoover has become synonymous with government inaction during an economic crisis .
Hundreds of books , essays , and even works of fiction have been published to challenge these notions — but somehow the fallacies have prevailed ; and they have been eagerly exploited by the would - be FDRs of the past seven decades .
For millions of Americans who have not studied Austrian economics and the Mises / Hayek theory of the business cycle , or read the brilliant critiques of the New Deal by H.L. Mencken , Isabel Paterson , Albert Jay Nock , Garet Garrett , and John T. Flynn , the commonplace myth of laissez - faire as ruinous and FDR as savior appears true , self - evident , and incontestable .
Unfortunately , many of these same people vote for politicians and policies that promise a " New New Deal . "
Such a plan would further exacerbate the current economic crisis , which is fueled by hyperregulation , Federal Reserve manipulation of the money supply , and the unforeseen consequences of prior interventions , including the original New Deal .
Murphy 's work seeks to correct popular misunderstandings of the Great Depression by attacking them directly .
Virtually every single commonly encountered assertion — that the Depression was caused by the excesses of capitalism , that Hoover exacerbated the Depression by " doing nothing , " that the New Deal revitalized economic activity and mitigated unemployment , and that World War II energized the United States into recovery — is refuted at length .
In the course of this debunking , the reader is treated to concise , elegant explanations of the Austrian theory of the business cycle , the economics of tax reduction , the virtues of the gold standard and the dangers of fiat currencies , and to discussions of the errors both in Keynesian prescriptions for deficit spending and in the Chicago School 's suggestion that the Federal Reserve triggered the Great Depression by failing to inflate sufficiently .
To add flavor to the book and enable readers to identify with more concrete aspects of the policies it criticizes , Murphy discusses many of the follies and corruptions of the New Deal : FDR 's use of " lucky numbers " to set the price of gold , the persecution of the Schechter brothers for defying the National Recovery Administration 's restrictions on poultry production , FDR 's attempt to pack the Supreme Court with his supporters after the court ruled in favor of the Schechter brothers , the confiscation of private citizens ' gold holdings , and the New Dealers ' pervasive use of government funding to bribe and intimidate constituencies into supporting FDR 's policies .
Murphy skillfully reminds us that the politicians who seek to suppress our economic and political liberties in favor of a central plan are neither omniscient nor benevolent ; they quite frequently pull policy prescriptions out of thin air and they are anything but evenhanded , tolerant , or concerned for objective human wellbeing .
Behind the lofty rhetoric and faux amiability of men like FDR stands the harsh , impatient , implacable , and often indiscriminate enforcer , in the mold of those thugs who broke into peaceful men's homes to ensure that they were not violating the National Industrial Recovery
Act by sewing clothes at night .
If there is any hope for an intellectual rejection of New Deal ideology in the United States , Murphy 's book will be one of the crucial elements motivating it .
Murphy bridges the gulf between high theory and the concerns accessible to the majority of readers .
While it is unfortunate that , given the state of education in our time , most Americans would not be able to immunize themselves against common economic fallacies by directly reading Menger , Mises , Hayek , and Rothbard , Murphy helps bring some of the key ideas of these thinkers into a format more accessible to a layman with no formal economic training .
Murphy also incorporates the work of such historians as Burton Folsom and Paul Johnson , and he draws on biographical information to shed light on the lives , motivations , and personalities of Calvin Coolidge , Herbert Hoover , and other key figures of the 1920s and 1930s .
Murphy does for the popular understanding of the Great Depression in the early 21st century what Frederic Bastiat did for free trade in the mid-19th and what Leonard Read and Henry Hazlitt did for basic economic principles in the 20th .
I am a former student of Murphy , and I can credit his instruction for enabling me to advance from a basic understanding of Austrian economics to the publication of a paper in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics .
From personal experience , I know him to be well - read , cosmopolitan , sophisticated , and capable of articulating the arguments — and recognizing the strengths and weaknesses — of an immense variety of theories and worldviews .
At the same time , he possesses a talent for communicating complex and challenging ideas , connecting them to concrete phenomena , and even joking about them .
$ 20 $ 17 " Murphy bridges the gulf between high theory and the concerns accessible to the majority of readers . "
As such , he is eminently suited to bringing some of the most important economic and historical insights of the 20th century to a mass audience .
Indeed , it might reasonably be hoped that thousands of readers of this book will use it as a gateway to discovering the works of the many free - market thinkers cited therein .
The lists of suggested readings ( " Books You 're Not Supposed to Read " ) peppered throughout the text make it a worthwhile purchase by themselves .
Perhaps someday my old US history teacher , and men like him , will use The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Great Depression in their courses to balance the many explicitly pro–New Deal and prointerventionist texts and presentations that dominate public - school curricula today .
If this is too much to hope for , then at least this book has the potential to appeal to many young students and be sought out by them on their own initiative — as an antidote to the fallacies they encounter from " mainstream " sources .
Take that iPhone !
That ’s right , Stuff Magazine has named the HTC Hero Gadget of the Year as part of its 2009 Stuff Gadget Awards event .
The revolutionary touchscreen smartphone , which is based on Google ’s Android system , received the honour for its innovative take on social networking , slick multi- touch interface and superior multimedia skills .
Editor and expert judget Fraser Macdonald also commented , saying “ With the HTC Hero , we ’ve finally got a phone that fully exploits the potential of the Android OS to be as clever and as sexy as the iPhone . ”
The Hero beat out the other major contender , the iPhone ( seriously , again ? ) .
That works for us , we ’re just glad somebody saw the light .

A thin square of shiny polyester is the main player in Atiha Sen Gupta ’s play , What Fatima Did .
The plot focuses upon the sudden decision of a non-religious young woman to wear hijab .
An insightful and funny look into the reaction of those around her , the play asked some very good questions about identity , religion , and culture .
Despite not being a Londoner myself , I could relate to some of the struggles depicted .
However , what was noticeably absent from the play was Fatima herself , and this left me confused about Gupta ’s overall message .
The story is centered around a group of teenagers living in London .
Their group consists of a set of twins named Fatima and Mo , and three other friends .
Upon their return from summer vacation , the group discovers that Fatima has inexplicably decided to begin wearing hijab , and their reactions , in particular , that of her boyfriend George , present some interesting questions and challenges .
The largest question , by far , was that of identity .
What was refreshing was that the idea of religion was not in the forefront , rather the hijab was dissected in relation to the type of identity crisis that one would have at seventeen .
One of the strongest points is made by Ayesha , a self - proclaimed feminist in the group , who insists that the hijab is “ stained with blood ” , and is vehemently against what she believes it symbolizes .
Ayesha also believes that Fatima is wearing hijab for culturally Muslim reasons rather than religious reasons .
In her insinuation that it is a political statement rather than a religious one , Ayesha made an interesting point about the way in which some young Muslim women today decide to wear hijab .
Especially in a Western nation , it becomes significant , at times , especially for an adolescent to find a balance between identities .
The reaction of Fatima ’s mother was also interesting .
She speaks of the struggle of women in her family against the hijab , and she is wildly against Fatima ’s decision .
She speaks of her grandmother ’s struggle to protect her mother ’s right not to wear hijab .
I thought that her reaction was incredibly powerful .
Once the hijab migrated to the west , I began to think about how its symbolism has changed .
If it represented a lack of autonomy in the case of Fatima ’s great - grandmother , could the hijab eventually become the symbol of a different type of Muslim woman ?
The most obvious omission from the play was Fatima herself .
She was not heard from or seen .
Her absence helped the audience see the powerful impact of her decision .
However , in the focus on the thoughts of others , I think Gupta reinforced a part of the hijab debate , which has bothered me for a long time .
The voice of the “ veiled ” woman has been noticeably absent from the discussion , and I had hoped that the play would provide a look from a young Muslim woman ’s perspective .
While the reactions of those around her were significant and powerful , ultimately , the play left me with more questions about where Fatima was , rather than what she did .
The torch relay for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics got underway Thursday from ancient Olympia in Greece , with the sun 's rays igniting the silver torch during a break in the clouds .
Torch 's origins A group of Bombardier engineers in Quebec designed the 2010 Olympic torch , drawing inspiration from Canada 's long winter season , said team leader Bruno Contois .
" You 've got those curves and ridges all over the place that represent snowdrifts , " he told CBC News .
" At the same time those curves [ were ] inspired by the sports we do here in Canada during the winter , skiing or skating , that leave traces behind you . "
The torch is wind - resistant up to 60 km/h , can withstand temperatures as low as – 40 C and is safe to carry at altitudes reaching 2,100 metres .
The torch can also endure " snow , rain and sleet , " Contois said .
The ceremony kicked off an eight - day relay through Greece before the torch is handed over to Games organizers .
On Oct. 30 , the flame will arrive in Canada for the biggest - ever relay , covering 45,000 kilometres over 106 days and ending in Vancouver on Feb. 12 , the opening day of the 2010 Winter Games .
" The flame has a unique power to unite us as countries and as people , " said John Furlong , chief executive officer of the Vancouver organizing committee , who was at the ceremony .
" Today we create a bridge between ancient Olympia and a young Canada .
We are joined together by common ideals and an eagerness to make the world a better place through fair play , respect and a commitment to peace and the power of sport . "
Greek actress Maria Nafpliotou , playing the role of a high priestess , said a prayer to Apollo and released a white dove after tilting a torch into a parabolic mirror aimed at the sun .
Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson , B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell and federal Sports Minister Gary Lunn were among those in attendance Thursday .
Cape Spear , N.L. , to Old Crow , Yukon
" It does make it real , " Campbell told CBC News .
" As I was there today , I thought of the thousands of people who 've been pulling for this to happen for almost a decade now .
I thought of [ VANOC chairman ]
Jack Poole who 's such an exceptional team leader for all of us in bringing people together in giving them the Olympic spirit , the 90 communities around British Columbia who are preparing for the torch to arrive ... and over 1,000 in Canada . "
The Canadian portion of the relay stretches from as far east as Cape Spear , N.L. , south to Point Pelee , Ont. , north to Alert , Nunavut , and west to Old Crow , Yukon .
International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge was also present Thursday as hundreds of spectators sprawled on the sloped , grassy hills on the site of the ancient Greek stadium that hosted the ancient games .
" The Olympic torch and flame are symbols of the values and ideals which lie at the heart of the Olympic Games , " said Rogge .
Nafpliotou lit the torch for Vassilis Dimitriadis , the first to run out of the stadium at the temple of Hera .
The Greek slalom skier , dressed in winter gear , took the torch towards its destination for the end of Thursday , Kalavyrta .
The relay in Greece will cover 2,180 kilometres , culminating at Panathenian Stadium in Athens on Oct. 29 .
The line between haves and have - nots in the 21st century may ultimately be drawn by reference to the most fundamentally important commodity on the planet – water .
More than gold or oil , arable land or technological advancements , the building block of continued human life , both individually and collectively , is clean drinking water .
And perhaps the first country to face the consequences of running out of water , and the large - scale social , political and economic consequences of thirst , is Yemen .
Yemen is a country of over 20 million people that sits on the coast of the Arabian Peninsula just south of its larger neighbor , Saudi Arabia .
It is a country plagued by war , burdened by refugees and internally displaced persons , without many of the functioning elements of government and civil society necessary to take on such an all - encompassing existential challenge as depleting its groundwater reserves .
Experts believe that within a decade , Yemen ’s capital , Sana ’a , could run out of water .
The growing shortages in the provinces have reinforced tribal divisions within the country , leading to infighting , hoarding and profiteering .
The imminent disappearance of water can be devastating to a Yemeni community , leaving desperate individuals – who lack the money to pay the “ going rate ” from the tanker trucks – to walk miles , and wait hours , to collect water from sources that may only be available irregularly .
Wealthy Yemeni with ready cash can buy clean water shipped across the country in guarded tanker trucks .
The rest of population has only one option – wait for the rain to fall .
Is this a vision of what more and more of the world may face in the near future ?
Will the wars of the future be started not as a scramble for oil or secure trading markets for exports or geopolitical higher ground but , rather , for the simple necessity of clean drinking water ?
Regardless of one ’s personal view on climate change , the reality of water shortages and droughts ( whether originating from natural or man-made causes ) is real enough .
And any scarce resource will soon enough become a focus of short - term greed and long - term exploitation , as different constituencies scramble for their “ fair share . ”
To think that this is a regional issue , limited to a few desert countries in the Middle East , may be a tremendous mistake .
A four - year drought in Kenya has devastated large parts of that African country .
Some have argued that the problems underlying the conflict in Darfur ultimately derive from ongoing droughts in Sudan .
Further afield , reports from China indicate that many of their fastest - growing cities will cease to be self - sufficient for water in the next few years .
Even Australia , like a number of other countries facing demographic and resource challenges , is considering large - scale projects involving the desalinization of seawater .
Few Americans think more about water and its effect on our economy and our lifestyles and our livelihood than Californians .
But what is the answer ?
Desalinization is perhaps the most expensive way currently available of obtaining drinking water , and its ultimate effect on the marine environment is unknown .
Changes in agricultural practices and food consumption patterns would require strong and coordinated governmental and nongovernmental action on a widespread basis .
Recent history has taught that we ignore the concerns and needs of others in the world at our own peril .
To the extent that we ourselves have adequate access to sources of clean drinking water for the foreseeable future does not mean that we should be ambivalent about these questions .
The impact of failed states on our security at home and our mutual interest in stability abroad is real , and should be a priority for us .
If the future lines of battle in many strategically important countries will be drawn between the “ water - rich ” and the “ water - poor , ” then we should be prepared now to address these concerns .
The disparate impact of population growth in certain areas with declining resources can , with the passage of time , reach across the globe and impact us very directly .
We often are confronted with pleas from charities for aid to starving , drought - ridden countries , whether by way of celebrity Christmas records or fund - raising rock concerts or television appeals .
But the reality of thirst as a driver for internecine and cross - border political and military struggle is potentially a much more profound challenge for us to face .
Perhaps the time to start thinking more seriously about this important resource , and prioritizing its continued availability in at - risk countries , is sooner than we would have thought .
The best way to win the “ water wars ” of the future may be not to have to fight them at all .

Why I hate Star Trek
I have a confession to make : I hate Star Trek .
Let me clarify : when I was young —
I 'm dating myself here — I quite liked the original TV series .
But when the movie - length trailer for ST : TNG first aired in the UK in the late eighties ?
It was hate on first sight .
And since then , it 's also been hate on sight between me and just about every space operatic show on television .
ST : Voyager and whatever the space station opera ; check .
Babylon Five ?
Ditto . Battlestar Galactica ?
Did n't even bother turning on the TV .
I hate them all .
I finally found out why :
At his recent keynote speech at the New York Television Festival , former Star Trek writer and creator of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica Ron Moore revealed the secret formula to writing for Trek .
He described how the writers would just insert " tech " into the scripts whenever they needed to resolve a story or plot line , then they'd have consultants fill in the appropriate words ( aka technobabble ) later .
" It became the solution to so many plot lines and so many stories , " Moore said .
" It was so mechanical that we had science consultants who would just come up with the words for us and we'd just write ' tech ' in the script .
You know , Picard would say ' Commander La Forge , tech the tech to the warp drive . '
I 'm serious .
If you look at those scripts , you 'll see that . "
Moore then went on to describe how a typical script might read before the science consultants did their thing : La Forge : " Captain , the tech is overteching . "
Picard : " Well , route the auxiliary tech to the tech , Mr. La Forge . "
La Forge : " No , Captain .
Captain , I 've tried to tech the tech , and it wo n't work . "
Picard : " Well , then we 're doomed . "
" And then Data pops up and says , ' Captain , there is a theory that if you tech the other tech ... '"
Moore said .
" It 's a rhythm and it's a structure , and the words are meaningless .
It 's not about anything except just sort of going through this dance of how they tech their way out of it . "
As you probably guessed , this is not how I write SF — in fact , it 's the antithesis of everything I enjoy in an SF novel .
SF , at its best , is an exploration of the human condition under circumstances that we can conceive of existing , but which do n't currently exist ( either because the technology does n't exist , or there are gaps in our scientific model of the universe , or just because we 're short of big meteoroids on a collision course with the Sea of Japan — the situation is improbable but not implausible ) .
There 's an implicit feedback between such a situation and the characters who are floundering around in it , trying to survive .
For example :
You want to deflect that civilization - killing asteroid ?
You need to find some way of getting there .
It 's going to be expensive and difficult , and there 's plenty of scope for human drama arising from it .
Lo : that 's one possible movie in a nutshell .
You 've got the drama — just add protagonists .
I use a somewhat more complex process to develop SF .
I start by trying to draw a cognitive map of a culture , and then establish a handful of characters who are products of ( and producers of ) that culture .
The culture in question differs from our own : there will be knowledge or techniques or tools that we do n't have , and these have social effects and the social effects have second order effects — much as integrated circuits are useful and allow the mobile phone industry to exist and to add cheap camera chips to phones : and cheap camera chips in phones lead to happy slapping or sexting and other forms of behaviour that , thirty years ago , would have sounded science fictional .
And then I have to work with characters who arise naturally from this culture and take this stuff for granted , and try and think myself inside their heads .
Then I start looking for a source of conflict , and work out what cognitive or technological tools my protagonists will likely turn to to deal with it .
Star Trek and its ilk are approaching the dramatic stage from the opposite direction : the situation is irrelevant , it 's background for a story which is all about the interpersonal relationships among the cast .
You could strip out the 25th century tech in Star Trek and replace it with 18th century tech — make the Enterprise a man o'war ( with a particularly eccentric crew ) at large upon the seven seas during the age of sail — without changing the scripts significantly .
( The only casualty would be the eyeball candy — big gunpowder explosions be damned , modern audiences want squids in space , with added lasers ! )
I can just about forgive the tendency of these programs to hit the reset switch at the end of every episode , returning the universe to pristine un - played - with shape in time for the next dramatic interlude ; even though it 's the opposite of real SF ( a disruptive literature that focusses intently on revolutionary change ) , I recognize the limits of the TV series as a medium .
Sometimes they make at least a token gesture towards a developing story arc — but it 's frequently pathetic .
I 'm told that Battlestar Galactica , for example , ends with a twist ... the nature of which has been collecting rejection slips ever since Aesop ( it 's one of the oldest clichés in the book ) .
But I can even forgive that .
At least they were trying .
The biggest weakness of the entire genre is this : the protagonists do n't tell us anything interesting about the human condition under science fictional circumstances .
The scriptwriters and producers have thrown away the key tool that makes SF interesting and useful in the first place , by relegating " tech " to a token afterthought rather than an integral part of plot and characterization .
What they end up with is SF written for the Pointy - Haired [ studio ]
Boss , who has an instinctive aversion to ever having to learn anything that might modify their world - view .
The characters are divorced from their social and cultural context ; yes , there are some gestures in that direction , but if you scratch the protagonists of Star Trek you do n't find anything truly different or alien under the latex face - sculptures : just the usual familiar — and , to me , boring — interpersonal neuroses of twenty - first century Americans , jumping through the hoops of standardized plot tropes and situations that were clichés in the 1950s .
PS : Do n't get me started on Doctor Who ...

Blackhawks Know Where The Wild ( Things ) Are
By Marcus Gilmer in Miscellaneous on Oct 22 , 2009 9:00 PM
We 'll hand it to the Blackhawks ; it may not be a bear hell - bent on destruction , but we get a kick out of this commercial for next week 's game against the Minnesota Wild , using Where The Wild Things Are for inspiration .
Thanks for the tip , Matt !
Biz Stone , Twitter 's co-founder , has revealed plans for paid - for business accounts that will be rolled out by early next year in a bid to bring much needed revenue streams to the microblogging behemoth .
In an interview with the BBC , the site 's charismatic CEO , confirmed that Twitter will always remain free for everyone whether business users or individuals .
However , paid - for commercial accounts will , he said , offer a " special layer of access " which will include feedback and statistics .
Twitter is currently valued at around $ 1 billion after having raised around $ 155 million over the last two years .
However , developing a proper revenue model has been slow to come despite the fact that the service had undergone a massive explosion in traffic since it was founded in 2006 .
Analytics firm Alexa shows that Twitter is now the thirteenth most visited website worldwide and has lately introduced a " what 's happening " feature .
Stone has also confirmed that Twitter could potentially ramp up its efforts to license and syndicate content with other internet companies like it did with Google and Bing already .
One can guess that Twitter will be going the Freemium way like Spotify whereby most of the basic features will be free and the more exclusive ( and useful ) ones will be paid for .
Twitter has already managed to recruit more than 6 million users worldwide ( that was back in February 2009 ) , a figure that is bound to reach 9 - digit figures by the end of next year .
Since the beginning of the month , Twitter has also signed deals with Orange and Linkedin .
Our Comments
Most of these have been requested by the business community anyway and will certainly prove to be massively popular .
Importantly , the corporate accounts will allow businesses to differentiate themselves from the masses .

Scientists have long wondered how an extinct goat that once lived on barren Mediterranean islands could survive in such a harsh environment .
Now they know :
In a first - of - its - kind trick for the mammal kingdom , this goat lived like a lizard .
Myotragus balearicus skeletons were made from lamellar - zonal bone , which is textured like the growth rings of trees , according to a fossil analysis published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
It 's found only in creatures that can't regulate their body temperature internally , such as amphibians and reptiles .
These animals slow their metabolism when food is scarce or temperatures are cold , and speed up during times of plenty .
The presence of this pattern in Myotragus suggests that the goat " grew unlike any other mammal but similar to crocodiles at slow and flexible rates , " wrote the study 's authors .
The odd goat 's on - the - fly metabolic adjustment was probably an evolutionary leftover from when mammals first split from dinosaurs , and had n't yet developed the relatively steady , fast - paced metabolic rates they now possess .
Myotragus also had an extremely tiny , energy - efficient brain .
For most of the last 6 million years , these adaptations made it well - suited for existence on the arid , nutrient - starved islands of Majorca and Minorca , where it had no predators .
But they were also the downfall :
When humans arrived on the islands 5,000 years ago , they had no trouble hunting the sluggish goat to extinction .

Maybe the Fed is trying to show we do n't need a Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
Fed : The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced final rules that prohibit financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine ( ATM ) and one - time debit card transactions , unless a consumer consents , or opts in , to the overdraft service for those types of transactions .
Before opting in , the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution 's overdraft services , including the fees associated with the service , and the consumer 's choices .
--
To ensure that consumers have a meaningful choice , the final rules prohibit financial institutions from discriminating against consumers who do not opt in .
The final rules require institutions to provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms , conditions , and features ( including pricing ) that they provide to consumers who do opt in .
For consumers who do not opt in , the institution would be prohibited from charging overdraft fees for any overdrafts it pays on ATM and one - time debit card transactions .
" The final overdraft rules represent an important step forward in consumer protection , " said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke .
" Both new and existing account holders will be able to make informed decisions about whether to sign up for an overdraft service . "
The final rules are effective July 1 , 2010 .
Mazin S. Motabbagani ( or , in accurate transcription , al - Mutabaqani ) is assistant professor of Orientalism at King Saud University in Riyadh , and head of the Occidental Studies Unit in the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies , also in Riyadh .
Born a Jordanian by origin in 1950 , he submitted his doctoral thesis in 1993 to the faculty of Islamic propagation at Riyadh 's Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University where he also taught .
Motabbagani's thesis , like most of his later academic work , focuses on Orientalism ( al - istishraq ) , the study of Islam and the Muslim world by Western scholars .
He has devoted no fewer than seven books and numerous articles to this topic .
Motabbagani 's position takes its cue from the work of Edward Said , treating all Western scholarship on the Muslim world as biased and unreliable .
To Said 's leftism , however , Motabbagani adds a heavy dose of Wahhabi intolerance for anything that challenges a strict interpretation of Islam .
As such , his article represents a genre of Middle Eastern writing that heavily distorts the West .
We publish it to convey what that literature contains and to demonstrate the extent to which Middle Eastern Muslims have accepted Said 's views .
Readers should be aware that the text contains many factual errors .
Thus , Motabbagani asserts that " the international Zionist movement applied its attention to these [ Orientalist ] studies , planting a number of its protégés and professors in order that the studies , conferences , and debates would all support the Zionist perspective , " a conspiracy theory that is not only false but one that ignores the predominantly anti-Zionist tilt of Middle East studies in the United States .
Or he writes that " America 's need for [ Oriental ] studies only grew after the second Gulf war , or Iraq 's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 , " which is about fifty years late .
Other statements have no basis in fact : writing about " those who called for the monitoring of Middle East studies , evicting any Arab influence from these studies " is wrong and ignores the substantial numbers of Arab scholars working in the field at Western universities .
The writer 's claim about an " assassination " of Ismail Faruqi and his wife is also wrong but fits his conspiracy theory about fighting Arab influence .
The following is excerpted from a paper by Motabbagani , originally published in 2003 .
Raymond Ibrahim translated from Arabic to English .

U.S. Middle East Studies
Motabbagani 's position takes its cue from the work of Edward Said , treating all Western scholarship on the Muslim world as biased and unreliable .
To Said 's leftism , however , Motabbagani adds a heavy dose of Wahhabi intolerance for anything that challenges a strict interpretation of Islam .
The West 's concern for studying and knowing the world is very old , as represented by its schools , Orientalist institutions , and various research centers .
And while the West has abandoned the name " Orientalism , " it has not done away with its goal , as Middle East — or " area " or " regional " — studies have appeared .
These studies have received the care of the United States of America , especially after the withdrawal of the British Empire and America 's readiness to take its place in its sphere of influence .
Thus , a number of U.S. governmental regulations supporting Middle East studies , or regional studies , appeared .
Among other things , this is what caught the attention of a British governmental committee , led by Sir William Hayter ( d. 1995 ) , when it visited America to assess its educational programs .
The United States government continued fostering Middle East studies to the point that the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Senator Henry Jackson 's era increased the number of American and British professors offering degrees dealing with the region .
This British Orientalist committee ( it went on to become American later ) invited Bernard Lewis in 1974 ; likewise , the U.S. Congress held a number of conferences in 1985 to study what is called " fundamentalism " in the Islamic world .
Edward Said and the Kuwait War
America 's need for such studies only grew after the second Gulf war , or Iraq 's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 .
Support for such studies grew , as did grants — some of which stipulated service in U.S. governmental departments , particularly intelligence .
This provoked strong objections from many of the professors ; yet , the American government financed these studies in a conditional manner .
In addition to the American government , the international Zionist movement applied its attention to these studies , planting a number of its protégés and professors in order that the studies , conferences , and debates would all support the Zionist perspective , so that Israel would continue receiving unconditional support .
Likewise , some Arabs and Muslims undertook the creation of chairs for Arab and Islamic studies .
Yet they did not succeed the way the Zionists did ; in fact , some of these chairs produced results opposite of what was intended .
Then a number of Arab and Muslim professors rose to these studies and tried to influence them internally by portraying the Muslim issue in a neutral and honest manner so that the Orientalist approach , which so disfigured Islam and Muslims , would cease .
This situation got to the point that some of the major professors were assassinated , such as Ismail Faruqi , and others .
His point of view was such that it was impossible for disciplines and studies to be taught in a neutral manner in the United States .
Another thing happened regarding these studies , that is , the appearance of Edward Said and his famous book ( Orientalism , 1978 ) , as well as his notable zeal regarding the Palestinian issue .
A number of changes occurred in these studies ; moreover , these changes spread to related Middle East topics .
Voices began appearing discussing the Palestinians as a real people evicted from their land and exposed to killing , imprisonment , and torture .
When communism fell , and the Soviet Union dissolved , and Eastern European governments came crashing down , and when it was announced that the Cold War had come to an end , there appeared in the West , particularly America , those who called on taking Islam as the new enemy in place of the former foe .
Many of the top representatives of this view confided in a number of Orientalists — at their head , Bernard Lewis , via his famous U.S. Congressional hearing regarding the situation of the Arabs and Muslims vis -à - vis Western civilization .
He later went on to publish this under the provocative journalistic title of " The Roots of Muslim Rage . "
A number of journalists and Middle East experts , such as Chris [ sic : Charles ] Krauthammer , joined him .
Middle East Studies Post-9/11
The events of September 11 , 2001 , brought about great changes in Middle East studies — foremost among them the persistent accusation that Islam breeds terrorism .
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was subjected to a major portion of this attack , due to its prominent place in the Islamic world .
Specialists in Middle East studies increasingly came to adopt the policies of the neo-conservatives in the American government .
These Middle East specialists came to provide the " intellectual cover " for American policies in the Arab and Islamic worlds , particularly , the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan , and other policies .
Nor did the matter rest with blaming Islam for terrorism ; there appeared those who called for the monitoring of Middle East studies , evicting any Arab influence from these studies , Arab influence which had taken to speaking the truth in regards to the rights of Palestinians after decades of ignoring — indeed , oppressing — them .
The claim was made that these studies had failed in predicting the realities of events , as in Martin Kramer 's book , Ivory Towers on Sand .
Nor did the attacks on the Orient or Middle East studies cease with Kramer 's book ; no , Daniel Pipes , Middle East specialist and founder of the Middle East Forum in Philadelphia , launched an Internet website [ Campus Watch ] dedicated to monitoring Middle East studies , encouraging those immersed in these studies to submit criticisms regarding professors in the field .
Likewise , a Jewish organization calling itself " The David Project Center for [ Jewish ] Leadership , " appeared in Boston supporting Pipes 's project of monitoring and watching Middle East studies , as well as supporting the Israeli point of view regarding origins of the Islamic - Israeli struggle in Palestine .
No[r ] vell de Atkine and Daniel Pipes went on to coauthor a long article titled " Middle East Studies : What Went Wrong ? "
In this article , they discussed a number of issues regarding Middle East studies , as if they were presenting a courtroom defense for a number of Middle East studies researchers , at their head , Bernard Lewis , Fouad Ajami , Judith Tucker , and others while directing very sharp criticism at Edward Said , Yvonne Haddad , Joel Beinin , Rashid Khalidi , Joseph Massad , and others .
Among the most dangerous things the field of Middle East studies has been exposed to is the call of neoconservatives , or defenders of the good of the United States — as they call themselves — for a governmental council , approved by the U.S. Congress [ Senate ] and the House of Representatives , that would monitor Middle East studies in American universities receiving governmental support .
Due to all this , it has become urgent and pressing to investigate the position of Middle East studies in European and American universities , which , by definition , are among the most influential forces directing the external foreign policies of the American empire vis -à - vis the Islamic world , due to essential , and influential , factors in these studies , as well as the sources of pressure which these studies are exposed to .
A study initiated by a team of Sydney researchers published October 12 in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin shows that homicides of strangers by people diagnosed with schizophrenia are exceptionally rare events .
The study is one of a series of studies of homicide by the mentally ill by two senior lecturers in psychiatry at the University of New South Wales , Dr Olav Nielssen at St Vincents Hospital and Dr Matthew Large at Prince of Wales .
This study is an international collaboration with researchers in Canada , Finland and the Netherlands .
An international multicentre study was necessary as there were so few stranger homicides by people with mental illness in NSW in the last 15 years .
The study calculated a rate of stranger homicide by those with schizophrenia of one in 14 million population per year in advanced countries .
It also compared the characteristics of 42 patients who killed strangers with a matched sample of patients who killed family members .
The stranger homicide offenders were more likely to be the homeless and to have a history of antisocial conduct .
The victims were more likely to be males and the offences rarely occurred in the victim 's home or workplace .
More than half of the subjects in both groups had never received treatment for schizophrenia .
" The lack of any particular distinguishing features and the extremely low base rate means that it would be impossible to predict who might commit this sort of offence and when they might occur " said Dr Nielssen .
" However , most of the patients in the study were not receiving treatment , and providing earlier treatment to first episode patients , and a good standard of care to all patients with established illness could prevent some of these tragic events " .
" What the paper shows , more than anything else , is that the public fear of the mentally ill is completely misplaced " said Dr Large .
" These events are so rare that they are almost impossible to study , yet the fear of serious violence by the mentally ill is a major cause of stigma " .
URBANA , Ill . 
Two years after becoming vice president for research at the biggest hospital in this university town , Suzanne Stratton said she had finally seen enough .
She had clashed repeatedly with a doctor who oversaw the local patients enrolled in more than 130 federally sponsored cancer studies  work that the hospital promoted in local television advertisements but that Dr. Stratton , who has a Ph.D. in molecular biology , said was often putting patients and science at risk .
In a meeting with Carle Foundation Hospital administrators late last year , Dr. Stratton demanded that they take action .
She cited an outside audit that had found “ major deficiencies ” in 12 of 29 experiments being overseen by the doctor she had clashed with , potentially endangering patients or skewing the studies ’ results .
Dr. Stratton says her bosses responded by firing her , ushering her out of the hospital later that same day .
But federal officials , alerted by Dr. Stratton , have corroborated many of the shortcomings she found .
They are continuing to investigate  an inquiry with implications for the nation ’s cancer research effort that go far beyond the Carle Cancer Center .
Planets grow in the dusty discs that form around infant stars
Astronomers may have found a way to identify those Sun - like stars most likely to harbour orbiting planets .
A survey of stars known to possess planets shows the vast majority to be severely depleted in lithium .
To date , scientists have detected just over 420 worlds circling other stars using a range of techniques .
Garik Israelian and colleagues tell the journal Nature that future planet hunts could be narrowed by going after stars with particular compositions .
Scientists think events early in the star 's formation may be responsible for producing the lithium phenomenon .
Theory holds that planets grow from a disc of dusty material that develops around infant stars .
The researchers propose that this disc and its contents alter the young star 's spin , mixing its upper layers more effectively into the interior where its contents can be " burnt " in the fusion processes that power it .
" When discs form around stars there is interaction of angular momentum between disc , planets and parent star ; and this interaction affects the rotation of the parent star and that will affect the lithium abundance , " said Garik Israelian from the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias , Tenerife , Spain .
The relative low abundance of lithium in our Sun 's upper layers has long been a fascination for scientists .
Researchers who have studied meteorites with compositions unchanged since the beginning of the Solar System say the element 's presence in our star ought to be 140 times greater than is observed .
Physicists know the Sun 's upper layers as viewed today do not convect deeply enough to take any lithium to a location that is sufficiently hot to burn the element .
This suggests mixing conditions must have been different in the past .
The outcome of the research is a tool astronomers can now use to help pinpoint the right type of stars where they are likely to detect planets .
" Suppose you had 50 or 100 candidates for parent - bearing stars , " explained Dr Israelian .
" Those which have a very low abundance of lithium will be the best candidates around which you might find planets , " he told BBC News .
Astronomers detect exoplanets , as they are called , using a number of methods .
One technique looks for the gravitational " wobble " a massive planet will induce in its parent star .
Another approach is to monitor a star for extended periods in the hope a planet will pass across its face .
This transit reveals the planet 's presence by making the star 's light dim ever so slightly .

Bruno Senna is confident he will be racing in Formula 1 next season after missing out on a deal to race with the Brawn team in 2009 .
Last year 's GP2 runner - up came very close to a deal with the former Honda team , but in the end the Brackley - based squad decided to retain Rubens Barrichello alongside Jenson Button .
Senna , the nephew of three - time world champion Ayrton , has spent the season racing in the Le Mans Series as he continued working towards an F1 deal for 2010 .
And the Brazilian , speaking to reporters at the new Abu Dhabi circuit , said he is now almost sure he will be on the grid next year .
" Pretty high , in the 90s [ per cent ] , " Senna said about his chances of being in F1 next year .
" I 'm happy about it .
It 's been a very tough year .
Sometimes I found myself feeling a bit far away from F1 .
But we were slowly trying to get back into it .
" Obviously the beginning of the year was very tough because people were only talking about double diffusers and regulations , so it 's been really hard to actually have good contact with the teams , because they have been really having some difficult worries about other things other than drivers .
" But eventually you get in touch , see what the real options were , and we focused on these options and here we are , quite close to getting a deal . "
He added : " It 's looking pretty good actually .
We have some good offers on the table , and this is what we needed really .
I think Formula 1 is in a tough moment , with many drivers on the market and that does n't make it easy for drivers outside of Formula 1 to get it .
But luckily with the new teams there are more slots .
It 's getting close . "
When asked when he was hoping to be able to announce something , he said : " I really hope by Interlagos . "
Senna admitted it was tough to be so close to the deal last year and eventually do n't get it .
" It was frustrating not to get the drive , especially because I was quite close to it , but that 's motor racing , you have to learn how to deal with difficult times and there are plenty of them in your career , " he said .
" I just kept my head up and just try to work on another deal for 2010 , and that 's what we are doing . "
Despite that , the Brazilian reckons the Le Mans Series experience will be useful for Formula 1 next year , especially as refuelling will be banned .
" I did the Le Mans Series with good success : in three races I got two podiums , which is not bad for a rookie year .
I was really trying to get some different experience and it actually counted very much .
Now I know how to save fuel , save tyres , and it 's going to be important for next year .
" Fuel consumption is going to be an issue and for sure it 's a good preparation .
But the best preparation would be to be in Formula 1 definitely . "
Senna revealed he was in talks with two of Formula 1's new teams , but admitted he would prefer to race with an outfit with F1 experiences .
" Campos and Virgin [ Manor ] are top of the list I think of the new teams .
So we are talking to them , but it 's still a bit early to say anything , " he said .
" If the proposal is right , I would prefer to be in a team that 's currently there .
It 's a much less risky option .
There are many variables in a new team coming into Formula 1 , but in any case I need to be able to trust the team can do a good job and show my potential next year . "
He also said the Force India team was also a possibility .
" We are still talking to them , but we have to wait and see .
They have quite a few situations , so they need to sort their lives out because we can negotiate that . "
Senna will return to single - seater action today at Jerez , where he joins the iSport GP2 team to help with development , a test he also says will help him re-acclimatise himself to open - wheel cars .
" First , I need to get back into single - seaters .
I have n't driven a single - seater since November last year and that 's a long time .
And secondly , iSport wanted me to go there and help with development .
" They were a bit off the pace this year and they want to know if it 's car bound or driver bound , and I hope I can prove that it was driver bound . "
Strike Out
Reading Unedited Text
by John Walker
July 2005
Prior to the advent of large - scale data networks , and apart from communication among family and friends , the vast majority of text read by people was edited — reviewed and corrected by a professional editor before it was published in a newspaper , magazine , or book .
Direct , computer - mediated communication between individuals has produced a grand disintermediation of communication ; the medium of text has escaped the bounds and the mediation of the traditional media .
This , like most things , has its good and bad points .
On the positive side , the rôle of the editor as gatekeeper has been largely transcended ; everybody has potential access to an on - line audience of enormous size , and there is no entrenched power which determines whose work will be widely read — in principle , only merit and the ability of a writer to make joyful noise , generating awareness of their work , determines how broad an audience it will reach .
On the other hand , one of the functions editors have provided over the centuries is sending back the work of drooling morons to their own respective mailboxes and fixing up the prose of those insightful enough to have something interesting to say yet sufficiently incompetent so as to stumble over the language between idea and its expression in words on the page .
When we move beyond the age of the editor , into this brave new world of newsgroups , discussion boards , weblogs , and the like , we dispense not only with the constraint which filters the words of writers , but the quality control which ensures they 're ready to meet the eyes of readers .
Modern - day readers of un-edited text are faced with a challenge which never faced their ancestors reading letters to the editor — that any elbow - typing moron can foul the intellectual commons with their incoherent and / or inane ravings .
How can one cope with this ?
An approach which works for me is what I call “ Strike Out ” or “ One strike and you 're out ” .
When reading unedited text in any medium , when you encounter the very first misspelled word , ungrammatical construct , or gratuitous obscenity , simply let the text mentally fade to white , avert your eyes , and skip to the next item by another author .
In effect , you 're telling the authors of prose you read , “ My time is important .
If you can't take the time to spelling check and read over the messages you post , then why should the thousands of people to whom they are addressed have the slightest regard for what you have to say ?

Note : I do not , in any way , intend to impugn English - language postings by people with a different mother tongue .
Acquiring a language , especially in adulthood , is tough , and unlimited slack is due to those who have done so and have the courage to use their language skills in fora where criticism can be swift and devastating .
I find it quite easy to distinguish the errors made by those writing English as a second ( or third , or fourth , etc. ) language from the slapdash scribblings of marginally literate Anglophones , although this may be due in part to my own experience using ( and abusing ) a second language in my day - to - day life .
Of course , to an engineer like me , the test of any scheme is how well it works , and anything worth considering should be tested under the most demanding circumstances available , so I will draw the example for this document from a discussion on the “ Slashdot ” site which , by the evidence , is disproportionately frequented by morbidly obese hateful people with extremely limited social skills who cannot spell .
I do not recommend you visit this site , but it is a formidable proving ground for anything involving bad writing .
I chose , as the test case , a discussion which took place on July 6th , 2005 , regarding an individual who was arrested for poaching Internet access from somebody with an unsecured wireless access point .
Let 's start with a message which is on topic , well written , and thus does n't strike out .
This one we read to the end and go on to the next .

It 's more like sitting on the sidewalk outside someone 's house at night .
Their porch light is on and you 're reading a book by that light .
One could say you 're using the light they paid for without their permission .
On the other hand , they 're letting the light spill out into public land .
Now let 's move on to some messages which struck out .
I 've shown the word on which the message struck out in red with a line through it , after which the message “ just fades away ” .
The unread part of the message is shown in the background colour to indicate how much you saved reading by striking out the message , with additional strikes within the message highlighted to indicate what you avoided by ceasing to read at strike one .
The formidable challenge posed by the humble apostrophe strikes out the following message in the second sentence .
Re : Open doors ( Score : 5 , Interesting ) ( #12991772 )
That is an interesting point that you 've brought up .
It is completely opposite way of thought than how American 's have previously thought about property .
For example how many of you grew up and left doors unlocked to your house or car all the time .
I for one never locked my car doors at home nor the front door to my house .
It is your private property and you never expect anyone who was n't welcome to break those boundries , but we have welcomed the Internet with it 's complete opposite point of view .
I wonder if this same ideal is why people do n't bother securing wireless even when most have some grasp of the reprocutions of not securing their wireless .
Our next batter swings and misses on the first character ( although I 've shown the first three words to indicate things continue to go downhill from there ) , being one of those Slashdot denizens who is so eager to expose their thoughts before a global audience that there is n't time to depress the Shift key when socially constructed language conventions demand it .
Water , water everywhere but not a drop to drink ( Score : 4 , Interesting ) ( #12991499 ) and i supose if you go and drink water from a public fountatin i should be arrested too for the fact the water is open to the public and not locked down .
Sounds like they dont want to take fault for not fencing up a public oasis in the middle of no where because you know if it isnt yours its owned already by some one else more powerful and richer then you .
Also what if the wifi is a public wifi by choice for the people to use ?
is it still stealing then ?
Now we encounter one of those folks who is so intimidated by the apostrophe that they eschew it entirely , striking out on the second word .
Signal Strength ( Score : 5 , Interesting ) ( #12991979 )
Ok lets just say for arguments sake that he wanders with his laptop to the opposite side of his house , far away from his own wireless access point .
The computer sees the other access point has a stronger signal and latches on to it during a break in communication with his own access point .
He is unaware of the change and continues with his business .
Are the default settings for wireless access communication illegal ?
What would stop someone from plugging in a wireless access point boosting the signal strength and calling the police any time someone accidentally connects ?
I live in an apartment complex with about 7 other visible access points .
I occasionally get bored and plug in a spare access point with no internet connection attached to see who accidentally locks on to me and loses their internet access .
Our next contributor to the discussion is one of those people who is so clever they 've come up with the idea to use the vulgar Anglo - Saxon word for copulation as a term of emphasis , striking out thereby in the first sentence .
This Story Is n't About WiFi ... ( Score : 5 , Insightful ) ( #12991996 )
It is about the fact that the guy was a obscenity creep .
Seriously - if he REALLY thought what he was doing was OK , why did he act all cagy and close the laptop / drive away every time the homeowner saw him ?
WiFi or not , this guy was acting strange in front of someone 's home in such a way that I think it would probably freak most people out .
The cops used the WiFi excuse just to bust the guy and I say jolly good show on them .
I would feel very diferently if the guy simply said to the homeowner who he was and the fact that he was surfing on his net connection , but he did n't .
Now we have a call to action , exhorting readers to call the office of a public official whose title figures in no English dictionary of which I am aware .

Strikeout Statistics
How well does striking out messages work , in terms of how much slipshod writing ( and the presumably sloppy thinking it transmits ) you avoid reading ?
Taking the examples above , which were picked essentially at random from the discussion thread , we find that a total of 34 words were read before the respective messages struck out , from a total of 444 words in the original postings ( not counting headers or identification information ) .
Striking out the messages thus eliminated more than 90 % of the text you 'd otherwise have read in these messages .
Another way to look at the effectiveness of striking out messages is to examine the percentage of all messages which strike out .
I went through the entire discussion thread , looking only at messages moderated at levels + 4 and +5 ( the highest ) , and ignoring any messages moderated as “ Funny ” ( including them would doubtless have increased the strikeout totals , but my constitution is not up to reading missives deemed “ funny ” by Slashdot regulars ) .
With these pre-filters , a total of 34 messages made it through without striking out , while 28 struck out .
Thus , about 55 % of messages survived the strikeout filter .
Figuring that striking out a message reduces the amount of it you read by about 90 % , one can estimate that adopting the strikeout rule cuts the amount of bad text you read in unedited venues by about half , which is not bad for a simple mental trick .
However , one can imagine technological fixes which could go well beyond this .
The Banish Button
One can imagine extending the strikeout concept so you never see further messages from an author you 've struck out .
Imagine if your favourite discussion board or blog comments displayed a Banish Button next to each posting , like the one I 've affixed to the bottom right of the message below .
As soon as the message strikes out , you simply press the button , and the message disappears along with all other messages from that poster , present and future .
Try it on the message below .
( For typographic consistency , I show the message like others which have struck out ; in the actual implementation , the message would completely disappear , leaving only a placeholder in case you decided to give it a reprieve .
And , yes , I 'm aware the image swapping if you toggle the button several times does n't always work with Internet Exploder ; if you find this intolerable , switch to a better browser . )
Should charge the idiots who leave in unencrypted ( Score : 5 , Insightful ) ( #12991486 )
If microsoft left xp disks at street corners unattended complete with legal cororate serial numbers would they be surprised if people were using them ?
Same idiocy here .
Leave a network open and someone 's going to get in .
If you 're lucky it 's just for free internet .
Implementing this would simply require the bulletin board or blog software to maintain a list of banished posters for your login , and hide messages from them when preparing pages for your scrutiny .
( Obviously , if you logged in anonymously , you would n't have access to this service [ you might be able to banish messages during the current session , but the list of banished posters would n't be saved for future visits to the site ] .
But that 's fine — most site operators want to encourage users to log in , anyway , and this would be another way to add value for those who do . )
If Web - wide identification systems such as Gravatar and OpenID catch on , it will be possible to banish posters globally — somebody you banish for an obscene or inane blog comment will disappear from all blogs you read which use the same identity system .
Of course irritating people can make up multiple identities , but if the software provides them feedback which indicates how quickly and broadly they get banished every time they pop up under a new name , perhaps they will eventually be deterred by the knowledge that nobody is reading their ravings .
“ Spelling Fascists ”
I 'm certain that my reward for all the five or six minutes of patient , unremunerated toil I 've invested in describing how to cope with a Web bursting with unedited text will be castigation as a “ spelling fascist ” .
So be it — it 's a free network , at least for the moment .
But let 's consider some of the arguments ( or “ arguements ” , as those advancing them may prefer to write ) in favour of illiterate prose and see whether they hold water .
It 's the message that counts , not the spelling .
Well , yes … but if you 're asking me to ponder your judgement of the merits of , say one operating system , desktop environment , application suite , or programming language against another , or the fine points of a political or legal argument grounded in a discussion of history , I 'm inevitably going to weigh what you say according to my own perception of how authoritative an observer you are of the domain about which you 're declaiming .
Now all of these things : operating systems , desktops , applications , languages , history , law , and politics , are thousands of times more complicated , especially as regards their comparative merit to diverse individuals than , say , the proper use of the possessive case in English or the distinction between “ its ” and “ it's ” .
If the writer can't master the latter , how much weight should one give to their opinions of matters which require far more attention to detail ?
The Internet is a dynamic medium ; there 's no time to carefully proofread text before posting it .
Consider what the folks who advance this argument are saying .
“ I 'm in such a hurry that I can't be bothered to critically read what I 've written before I dispatch it to be read by hundreds , thousands , or millions of other people .
My time is so valuable , the five or ten minutes it would take to spelling and grammar check my posting , then read it over for coherence and edit it accordingly cannot be justified .
Better all of my readers spend the time to figure out what I was trying to say than I spend a minute making it clear . ”
And these guys want us to read their scribblings ?
Questions and Quibbles
Since posting this document , I 've received more comments and questions than were occasioned by anything I 've posted on my Web site in years .
This was n't entirely unexpected , as I was aware that people might read some of what I have to say as incendiary , but I was a bit surprised since I did n't in any way highlight the document on the site nor front - load it with controversy .
The experience has , to some extent , restored my faith in the maturity of the on - line community .
First of all , without a single exception to date , the comments I 've received were well written and reasoned , and even when they took extreme exception to what I had to say , argued on the issues as opposed to descending to ad hominem arguments , maledicta , or invective .
The comments I 've received so far have highlighted both things I 'd thought about but did n't include in the first draft of this document , and raised issues I had n't considered which , after some head scratching , I 'll address in the sections below .
Why is correct spelling so important ?
Why does bad spelling so offend you ?
Shortly after posting “ Strike Out ” , I came across a superb discussion of this issue in an with Bernard Pivot in the July 2005 issue of the French magazine Historia , in which he begins when asked whether we 're living in the final days of correct spelling ( my translation ) : “ No , because [ spelling ] remains a politeness one owes to our language , and a politeness one owes to those to whom one writes . ”
Yes !
I think that 's one of the reasons I 'm offended by bad spelling — because it 's fundamentally as impolite as insulting somebody , especially in an age where it is almost 100 % avoidable at the cost of a few seconds of additional effort ( running a spelling checker ) .
But consider that much of the Internet has always been observed to be an impolite medium — people say things in E - mail messages and newsgroup postings which they would never think of saying face to face , and almost any unmoderated / edited forum is likely to develop recurrent and unending flame wars .
This , I think , may be a corollary of Heinlein 's observation that “ An armed society is a polite society . ”
If you insult somebody to their face , there 's always the possibility you 're going to get a punch in the nose or worse .
When there is no possibility of immediate retaliation other than words , and even more when individuals lurk behind anonymity and pseudonyms and thus escape all accountability , you end up with a coarse and impolite society like the Internet .
Perhaps the sloppy writing and easy resort to invective are consequences of an on - line society without accountability or recourse .
Are n't you concerned about missing a nugget of wisdom in a misspelled or ungrammatical message ?
In almost every circumstance when you 're reading unedited text , whatever you read has already been heavily filtered before you read it .
I went back and ran the numbers for the Slashdot thread I used as the test case , and found that by reading at moderation level 4 and above , a total of 95 % of the posted messages were discarded before I ever saw them by the moderation setting .
Now that filtering was done by people unknown to the readers , based on criteria known only to the anonymous moderators of the moment .
Doubtless some valuable information was lost in that filtering process as well , so I 'm not overly concerned about losing a bit more with my filter .
Even in completely unmoderated Usenet groups ( which , I 'll admit , I 've found too painful to read since the mid-1990s ) , what you read is still filtered — randomly — by the mere fact that you can't possibly read it all .
Unless somebody is totally obsessed and spends their whole life reading the newsgroup , they 're going to miss some things simply because messages scrolled off when they were n't looking .
Again , losing some content to a filter should be judged compared to how much is lost even without one .
The fact that on - line discussions tend to contain a lot of redundant content means that if you miss something , you 're likely to run into it again in a subsequent posting ( and again , and again … ) .
I call this “ the principle of abundance ” — what you gain by reading unedited media is such an abundance of messages that regardless of how you filter them , as long as it's vaguely rational , you will eventually find the information you need because anything worth saying is said repeatedly ; if you skip a poorly - written message with valuable content , odds are there 's a better - phrased message with the same information further down the list .
Is n't it arrogant to insist on perfect spelling and grammar in messages you 're reading for free ?
The fundamental question is whether there is a correlation between the quality of writing and the value of the message content .
I have found that in the unedited venues I read there is such a correlation and that it is quite high .
Other people disagree , but maybe that 's because they 're reading other material — if they do not see the correlation I do , then they should not use the strike out rule , which is only a personal heuristic , not a proposal for an Internet standard !
One data point I find interesting in this regard is Jerry Pournelle 's site , where he posts letters from readers on many of the same topics as Slashdot articles .
Jerry selects the mail he posts based on interest to his audience ( and the degree of filtering is quite high ) , but he does not edit letters for spelling or grammar — what he gets is what he posts .
Well , it turns out that far fewer of these E - mail messages strike out than do messages on Slashdot , which to me says there is a correlation between content and good writing .
On the other hand , on some of the law professor blogs , you hardly ever see a message strike out ( even in the comments , not just the postings ) .
You do n't get to be a law professor without superb written communication skills , even if your ideas are complete gibberish , so here the strike out rule is of little use .
“ Arrogance ” is defined as having an inflated sense of self - worth or importance .
Is it arrogant to value one 's time and try to avoid wasting it by reading messages which do n't contain information of sufficient value to justify the time spent reading them ?
If so , then colour me arrogant .
Choosing not to read all of somebody 's message is not an insult , affront , or attack upon the author , nor does it imply a claim of superiority — it 's simply a judgement that the time spent reading the rest could be better spent reading something else — a decision made innumerable times by anybody reading a newspaper or magazine .
Your “ Banish Button ” is nothing more than a news reader kill file entry !
Why make such a big thing about it ?
Precisely !
For more than two decades , programs for reading Usenet news groups have supported “ kill files ” , which permit hiding messages based upon their content .
When somebody despoils a news group , one need only add the sender 's identity to the kill file , and it's as if they never posted further messages , as far as that reader is concerned .
News reader kill files are a “ client side ” implementation of filtering .
The “ Banish Button ” I propose is simply a server side implementation of the same thing , with the added fillip that with the advent of portable cross - site identities , banishing a user in one forum will hide their messages in all others where they post with the same identity ( precisely as a kill file entry for a user name will hide postings by that user in all Usenet news groups ) .

Intelligence officers are said to have known months ago about Hasan ’s attempts to reach the terror network through the internet but decided to monitor him , hoping it would lead them to al - Qaeda operatives .
It was thought Hasan might lead them to a “ big fish ” and there was no indication he was about to carry out an attack of his own , one source said .
Basically , they all are .
The EPA city - cycle measures the Volt 's characteristics about as well as a square peg fits a round hole .
In this mess , the number you get depends how you trim the test to fit the car .
The projected EPA economy rating of the GM Volt has set off a storm of criticism across the Internet .
While a number of blogs played the story straight ( 1 , 2 ) , the Good Math blog attacked it as nonsense , which got picked up by Reddit .
Critics say that the actual fuel economy seen by drivers could be as low as 50 MPG ( the claimed figure for charge - sustaining mode ) , or as high as infinity .
So who 's right ?
By current standards , the Volt is neither fish nor fowl .
When starting with a fully - charged battery , it can go a nominal 40 miles without burning a drop of fuel ( the AER ) .
After that , it has a nominal rating of 50 MPG .
All of this will be affected by weather , driver style , use of air conditioning , and the whole panoply of real - world complications .
A feather - foot driving in town may get 60 miles on the battery , a leadfoot may get 20 miles AER and just 30 MPG afterward , and sitting in stalled traffic with the A/C going full blast is going to eat into everything .
If you take the EPA city cycle with the provisos agreed between GM and the EPA and measure only the liquid fuel , you get the magic number of 230 MPG .
Green Car Congress gave a rather straightforward analysis :
Based on the same draft EPA methodology , the Volt would also deliver “ triple - digit ” combined cycle fuel economy along with combined cycle electricity consumption of 25 kWh / 100 miles , according to GM .
At the US average cost of electricity ( approximately 11 cents per kWh ) , GM calculates that a typical Volt driver would pay about $ 2.75 for electricity to travel 100 miles , or less than three cents per mile .
From the data we ’ve seen , many Chevy Volt drivers might be able to be in pure electric mode on a daily basis without having to use virtually any gas .
EPA labels are a yardstick for customers to compare a vehicles ’ fuel efficiency .
So , a vehicle like the Volt that achieves a combined triple - digit fuel economy is a game - changer ...
The key to high - mileage performance is for a Volt driver to plug into the electric grid at least once each day .
— GM CEO Fritz Henderson
Since it 's obvious that almost nobody would get that 230 MPG figure , or even ± 10 % of this value , it 's worth asking : what does the prospective Volt buyer need to know ?
Off the top of my head , I can think of this :
How much electricity they would use .
How often they'd have to visit the gas station using gasoline
using E - 85
Whether plugging in at work , or forgetting to plug in at night , would change those numbers substantially .
Whether there are any electric rate plans which would make the car significantly cheaper to own .
The overall monthly cost at various fuel prices and electric rates .
Comparison with other makes and models .
This does n't call for a flamewar .
This calls for an on - line calculator , perhaps integrated with a mapping service which can project energy consumption on the typical commute , errands such as shopping , and trip to the relatives or the beach .
But without adjusting for speed limits , traffic , lead feet and hyper- milers , and even the weather , would anyone still get within 10 % ?
The battle over the numbers does not look to end any time soon .

The Hubble Space Telescope has captured an impressive image demonstrating what happens when two spiral galaxies crash into each other at high speed :
The European Space Agency 's Hubble site explains : " Studies have revealed that as galaxies approach one another , massive amounts of gas are pulled from each galaxy towards the centre of the other , until ultimately , the two merge into one massive galaxy . "
The above pile - up , dubbed NGC 2623 and lying 250 million light - years away in the constellation of Cancer , shows the " the late stages of the merging process with the centres of the original galaxy pair now merged into one nucleus " .
The evidence comes in the form of two " tidal tails " , showing star formation provoked by the " dramatic exchange of mass and gases " during the collision .
NGC 2623 also boasts " an active galactic nucleus , where one of the supermassive black holes found at the centres of the two original galaxies is stirred into action " .
ESA elaborates : " Matter is pulled toward the black hole , forming an accretion disc .
The energy released by the frenzied motion heats up the disc , causing it to emit across a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum . "
Accordingly , NGC 2623 is " very bright in the infrared " , and therefore qualifies as a highly - active " luminous infrared galaxy " ( LIRG ) .
It 's been studied as part of the Great Observatories All - sky LIRG Survey ( GOALS ) , with Hubble , NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X- ray Observatory among those instruments helping to " further characterise objects like active galactic nuclei and nuclear star formation by revealing what is unseen at visible wavelengths " .

The city of Oakland has agreed to pay $ 245,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by an Oakland Fire Department captain who alleged that she was discriminated against after she suffered a seizure and passed out on the job .
Vicky Evans - Robinson , 55 , who has served as a spokeswoman for the agency , filed a disability discrimination lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court in 2006 after the city temporarily barred her from returning to active duty following an on - the - job seizure and other medical problems .
Judge Ronni MacLaren ruled on Nov. 13 that the city was not liable for disability discrimination but said a jury would have to decide whether Evans - Robinson was subjected to " adverse employment actions because of a medical condition . "
The Oakland City Council decided to settle the case four days after the ruling rather than risk a negative decision by a jury .
The council is expected to formally ratify the agreement on Dec. 8 .
" There were legitimate concerns on both sides as to what a jury might think , " Evans - Robinson 's attorney Duane Reno said Sunday .
In 2000 and 2001 , Evans - Robinson was the public information officer for the Fire Department , answering questions from the media at major fire incidents .
After her first seizure in 2005 , she was medically cleared to return to work , but she lost consciousness in 2006 after she was reinstated and , in a separate incident in 2007 , had another seizure , according to court documents .
The lawsuit accused the department of refusing to allow her to return to active duty on three occasions from 2005 to 2008 .
She claimed the city ignored reports by her neurologists and failed to arrange for evaluations by its own neurologists in a timely manner .
City officials denied any wrongdoing , saying they gave Evans - Robinson time off for necessary medical evaluations and because they wanted to ensure that she was able to perform her duties as a fire captain without endangering herself or others .
Evans -Robinson has been back to work for more than a year and now works with the hazardous materials division , Reno said .

I 'd like to play a lot more maps that are featuring ion storms , anyone have any ?
Any map helps !
Edit : I noticed that i can change ion storm value from no to yes in the map files so i'd like to ask if anyone has a tutorial of some sort or can give me indications because if i could just change the ion storm value of maps i love that would be so much more easier .
If possible , i'd like an explanation on how to change ion storm timer and duration too and how to trigger it and make it safe to play ( so it actually triggers and the map does n't crash ) .
Thanks in advance !
Terror legislation was used to stop a British climate change activist from travelling to Denmark , it has emerged .
Chris Kitchen , 31 , said he was prevented from crossing the border on Tuesday at about 5 pm when the coach he was travelling on stopped at the Folkestone terminal of the Channel Tunnel .
Mr Kitchen told the Guardian that police officers boarded the coach and , after checking all passengers ' passports , took him and another climate activist to be interviewed under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 , a clause which enables border officials to stop and search individuals to determine if they are connected to terrorism .

He was asked what he intended to do in Copenhagen and also about his family , work and past political activity .
Mr Kitchen said he pointed out that anti-terrorist legislation did not apply to environmental activists but said the officer replied that terrorism " could mean a lot of things " .
His coach had left by the time his 30 - minute interview had finished and police paid for a ticket for him to return to London .
Mr Kitchen said he believed the officials knew his name and had planned to remove him before they boarded the coach as passports were not initially scanned .
" The use of anti-terrorist legislation like this is another example of political policing , of the government harassing and intimidating people practising their hard earned democratic rights , " he told the Guardian .
" We are going to Copenhagen to take part in Climate Justice Action because we want to protest against false solutions like carbon trading and to build a global movement for effective , socially just solutions .
" People who are practising civil disobedience on climate change in the face of ineffectual government action are certainly not terrorists , and I am sure that their actions will be vindicated by history . "

Mr Kitchen said he would make a second attempt last night to get to Denmark .
Once there , he plans to take part in discussions organised by a network of protest groups coming together under the banner Climate Justice Action in the run-up to the United Nations summit .
Friends of the Earth 's head of climate Mike Childs said : " It 's outrageous to stop someone from travelling to Copenhagen to protest on climate change .
" Climate change is a global crisis that will have catastrophic consequences unless world leaders take drastic action to tackle it , so it 's not surprising people want their voices to be heard .
" The police should be supporting people 's right to protest peacefully .
" One of the most effective ways to campaign is to unite as many voices as possible at the same time and this is exactly what Friends of the Earth will be doing in Copenhagen in the coming weeks . "
A Home Office spokesman said : " There has been no change in policy .
" Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 enables an examining officer to stop , search and examine a person at a port or in a border area to determine whether they are someone who is or has been concerned in the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism .
" The exercise of the powers by the police is an operational matter for each force . "

India has been hit by several floods in recent weeks
At least 125 people have been killed after three days of torrential rains battered the Indian states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh , officials say .
Most victims were either washed away in rivers or died as their homes collapsed , police said .
Karnataka is the worst affected state .
Officials say that at least 102 people have died there in the last three days .
Hundreds of people remain stranded and the state government has asked for help with the rescue effort .
It wants Delhi to provide military helicopters .
Indian Air Force planes are already part of the rescue operation .
' Crops damaged '
Among those waiting to be rescued are hundreds of pilgrims in the holy town of Mantralaya , which has been flooded .
" The situation is serious .
We have asked for helicopters from the Indian Air Force to help us , " said Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa after holding a crisis management meeting .
Boats from the Madras Engineering Group , a specialised military wing , have been requisitioned to help with the rescue effort .
About 22,500 houses have been damaged in rains blamed by weather experts on the cyclone in the Bay of Bengal .
The authorities say incessant rains have not only damaged crops but also disrupted communication and transport links in many areas of Karnataka and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh .
The Karnataka opposition has attacked the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) government for what it called its failure to provide relief to the villagers in the affected areas .
The state cabinet was attending a three - day orientation camp when the rains first struck .
The meeting ended on Thursday .
" So many people are dying ... thousands of livestock have perished in the floods and standing crops have been washed away .
But the BJP government ministers are taking lessons ... on how to govern , " remarked former chief minister and leader of the Janata Dal Secular party , HD Kumaraswamy .
Mr Yeddyurappa denied the charge , saying his officials were working hard to provide relief .

BARACK OBAMA has already roughly doubled the number of American troops in Afghanistan since taking office in January .
But Stanley McChrystal , the man he chose to command American troops there , wants tens of thousands more .
If he does not get them , warns the general , the mission “ will likely result in failure ” .
On the other hand , it costs $ 250,000 a year to keep a single American soldier in Afghanistan .
An Afghan soldier who speaks the language and can drink the water costs only a twentieth as much , as one adviser reportedly told Mr Obama earlier this year .
With the budget in tatters , the deficit swelling and foreigners audibly fretting about the dollar , can America 's president really commit to spending vastly more each year in the Hindu Kush , for as long as it takes to prevail ?
And will the voters like it if he does ?
It seems that Mr Obama is no longer sure .
The winner of the Nobel peace prize is hesitating to ramp up the war in Afghanistan .
Rather than accepting General McChrystal 's recommendation , he is soliciting more advice , consulting with congressional leaders ( many of whom hate the war ) and weighing all his options .
His hawkish critics accuse him of dithering .
Charles Krauthammer , a conservative pundit , likens him , with some justification , to Hamlet — wordy and endlessly vacillating .
Republicans snort that he was bluffing all along when he said he would get tough in Afghanistan .
It was all a ruse , they say , to make it sound to centrist voters that he could be trusted with America 's security even as he milked the anti-Iraq war movement for every vote and dollar he could get .
Some anti-war types feel the same way .
Congressional Republicans think the decision is pretty straightforward .
The surge worked in Iraq , so another one should work in Afghanistan .
The only alternative is defeat , which would dismay America 's allies and embolden its enemies .
Some Democrats concur with this assessment .
Ike Skelton , who heads the House armed services committee , told ForeignPolicy.com that Mr Obama should follow General McChrystal 's advice because he is the man on the ground , “ like Roosevelt supported Dwight Eisenhower on D - Day ” .
But many Democrats disagree .
Vice - President Joe Biden has argued for months that it makes little sense to spend 30 times as much money in Afghanistan as in Pakistan when there are far more al - Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan and the state they seek to overthrow there has nuclear weapons .
He counsels a more parsimonious strategy in Afghanistan , using aerial drones and special forces to kill al - Qaeda leaders but otherwise handing over as much responsibility as possible to Afghans as quickly as they can be trained .
And there are other Democratic concerns .
As the evidence of electoral fraud in Afghanistan becomes clearer , Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House of Representatives , asks : “ Do we have an able partner in President Karzai ?
Is the government capable of acting in a way that is not fraught with corruption ? ”
And are America 's NATO allies , Britain apart , really committed to this struggle ?
Meanwhile , Jim McGovern , a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts , is pushing a bill calling for an exit strategy .
He argues that extra American troops will only antagonise the Afghans and give the Taliban a recruiting tool .
Putting blood and treasure where his mouth was
What is Mr Obama to do ?
Public opinion offers no clear guidance .
According to Gallup , 48 % of Americans want to send more troops to Afghanistan , while 45 % are opposed .
Americans are more hawkish than they were a month ago , when it was 41 % in favour of a surge and 50 % against .
But these numbers are fickle — the anti-war documentaries are only just beginning to air .
Support for the war is weakest among Democrats , of whom only 36 % want a surge , while 50 % are opposed .
Republicans are strongly in favour ( 73 % to 18 % ) , while independents are about evenly divided .
Democrats fear two things .
One is that they might pour billions of dollars and hundreds of lives into Afghanistan , and still lose .
The other is that a costly and unpopular war could scuttle their domestic agenda .
How will they pay for universal health care , for example , if they keep burning banknotes in the Afghan inferno ?
All the big groups that have waited eight years for a Democratic president — greens , gays , labour unions , ethnic minorities and so forth — are at least somewhat worried that a quagmire in Afghanistan might cripple Mr Obama before he can grant their wishes .
They think of Lyndon Johnson , whose escalation of the war in Vietnam , that “ bitch of a war ” , cut short his march towards the Great Society at home .
So far , American street protests against the Afghan war have been small and sporadic — a few women in pink and committed peaceniks shouting slogans such as “ Ground the drones ! ” and “ Foreclose the war , not our homes ! ”
But the protests against the Vietnam war started small , too .
Mr Obama is said to be searching for a middle way : perhaps a modest reinforcement , but not all the troops General McChrystal is asking for , coupled with a more concerted effort to help Pakistan deal with the jihadists in its lawless tribal areas .
Some people fear this might end up being the worst of both worlds , involving a political hit for no military gain .
But whatever he asks Congress for , he will probably get .
Republicans are sure to back more troops , and even doveish Democrats will be reluctant to humiliate their president .
Mr Obama is wise not to be rushed .
And he is wise to ponder deeply the historical precedents .
But he might well reflect on a line from a British counter - insurgency specialist , quoted in Lewis Sorley 's book “ A Better War ” , which White House staff are said to be busily reading .
South Vietnam , he says , could have been saved if America had not cut off military aid to its government .
“ Perhaps the major lesson of the Vietnam war ” , said Sir Robert Thompson , “ is : do not rely on the United States as an ally . ”

An American plane named in an inquiry by the European parliament into alleged CIA torture flights landed at Birmingham airport last month and was met by British special forces helicopters .
Plane spotters said the Gulfstream jet touched down from an undisclosed location on 2 October and was met by two army air corps Dauphin 2 helicopters used by the SAS at Hereford .
The 22 - seat plane is registered to L - 3 Integrated Systems , a Montana - based subsidiary of a US defence corporation .
It made numerous flights between Ireland and Egypt in 2003 and was involved in an accident at Bucharest airport in Romania in 2004 after a flight from Bagram airbase in Afghanistan .
The European parliament reported that seven passengers disappeared after the accident and deplored the CIA 's use of Romania as a stopover for extraordinary renditions of terror suspects including the British national Binyam Mohammed .
The report 's authors said they regretted " the lack of control of the Gulfstream aircraft with registration number N478GS " .
A Ministry of Defence source said that the meeting at Birmingham airport had nothing to do with the rendition of prisoners , whatever the allegations about the plane 's past use .
" This was routine military liaison between two allies , " he said .
The plane departed the next day at the same time as a Boeing 757 operated by Comco , a private company that provides flights for the US defence department , which had arrived a day earlier .
The Gulfstream has also been photographed at Glasgow Prestwick airport , Shannon airport in Ireland and Stuttgart airport in Germany .
We ’ve experienced over the years the phenomenon of news organizations borrowing our stories without attribution .
Typically , what happens is that someone in the journalism business will use one of our stories as a starting point for their own “ reporting . ”
So then they ’ll get someone , either on or off the record , to “ confirm ” the same thing we ’ve already reported , and then they ’ll report the item without acknowledging where they first saw it .
But , to our knowledge , we ’ve never had our words cut and pasted verbatim by anything other than a small , no - name blog site or message board .
Until now .
Yesterday afternoon , our own Michael David Smith ( who writes primarily for AOL ’s FanHouse.com ) posted a blurb regarding Dolphins linebacker Joey Porter ’s belief , as articulated on NFL Network , that Pats quarterback Tom Brady has his own set of rules .
Rich Eisen , the NFLN host extraordinaire who handled the segment with Porter , tweeted a link to the MDS story .
Several hours later , someone from “ ESPN.com staff ” posted the first five paragraphs of the MDS story — word for freaking word .
Word .
For freaking word .
You can do your own comparison .
Here ’s MDS ’ story .
And here ’s the ESPN.com story .
( We figure that the ESPN.com link wo n’t survive much longer .
So we ’ve got a screen grab of it . )
Despite the fact that our friend Mike Reiss ’ photo appears on the still - active - as - of - this - posting ESPN.com page , we ’re certain that this was n’t something Reiss did .
Mike ’s character is above reproach , and my guess is that he wo n’t be happy about this one at all .
( We also assume he currently knows nothing about it . )
We ’re not trying to get the member of “ ESPN.com staff ” who lifted MDS ’ work product fired .
But if ESPN is interested in syndicating some of our content , we think there ’s a better way to go about it .
You know , a way that involves paying us for it .

The first death sentence has been passed against a defendant accused of involvement in the mass protests in Iran against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election , prompting fears of a wave of executions against opposition activists .
A revolutionary court in Tehran handed the penalty to Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani , 37 , after convicting him of muhabereh – taking up arms against Iran 's Islamic system .
The sentence was imposed after he confessed to working for a little - known exile group , the Iran Monarchy Committee , which Iranian officials describe as a terrorist organisation .
Prosecutors alleged that he plotted political assassinations with US military officials in Iraq before returning to Iran " aiming at causing disruption during and after the election " .
Ali -Zamani admitted guilt during a series of public mass trials that began in August in which scores of senior pro-reformist politicians confessed to fomenting the unrest that followed Ahmadinejad 's victory .
Opposition leaders condemned the events as " show trials " and say defendants were tortured to force them to confess .
Human rights campaigners today challenged Ali-Zamani 's conviction and warned that it paved the way for further politically driven executions .
" It 's not a good omen , " said Hadi Ghaemi , of the International Committee for Human Rights in Iran .
" If this is the trend of sentencing then it spells really bad news that we should expect more political executions along these lines .
That 's why this verdict has to be protested right now both inside and outside Iran . "
More than 100 people arrested in the upheaval remain in custody , including prominent supporters of the defeated reformist candidates , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , who insist the election was stolen .
Unlike many others in detention , Ali -Zamani is not well known .
His indictment said he had joined the Iran Monarchy Committee after hearing about it on a television satellite channel .
His activities are said to have included distributing anti-regime CDs and propaganda , as well as copies of the Satanic Verses .
Ali-Zamani was accused of meeting an American called Frank in the Iraqi city of Irbil and passing information about conditions inside Iran in exchange for money .
He was also alleged to have received instructions on how to build a chemical weapon from a fellow member of the IMC .
Another part of the indictment alleges that he met two US military officers named " Mike and Robert " and gave them information on Iranian officials who had allegedly been targeted for assassination .
Prosecutors claimed that Ali -Zamani – who they say had a criminal record for forging revolutionary guard and judicial stamps – took part in an operation , called Salman , in which he gave the IMC information on members of the hardline Basij volunteer militia .
They said he had conducted " vast communication activities " inside Iran before being arrested by intelligence officers .
The allegations were dismissed by the IMC , which is run by Iranians living in Europe and the US .
Iran has previously accused the group of being behind a bombing in a Shia religious centre in Shiraz last year that killed 15 people .
A committee spokeswoman , Dordaneh Fouladvand , confirmed that Ali-Zamani had worked with the organisation but insisted he had played no role in the post-election protests .
His activities had been limited to working for its radio station , Radio Tondar , she said .
" We are surprised by the confession he has made in court .
He has given it under pressure and we strongly deny all he has said , " Fouladvand said .
" He had absolutely no links with the Americans and has n't been involved in any operations inside Iran .
His job was simply to pass on news for our radio station and to make broadcast packages . "
Ghaemi said Ali -Zamani's arrest may have happened before the election , raising the possibility his execution verdict had been passed to deter further protests .
" What is significant is that the indictment makes clear that before he could engage in any action , he was arrested by the intelligence ministry , " he said .
" The text shows that there is no action or crime that they can tie him to . "
AMD ’s latest roadmap calls for the arrival of 12 - core Magny - Cours Opteron processors in the first quarter of next year , so it ’s about time we started seeing some samples out in the wild .
XtremeSystems Forums member s7e9h3n has gotten hold of one , and he ’s poked , prodded , and posted screenshots aplenty .
Judging by the first CPU - Z screenshot , the sample has 12 cores , 12 threads , a 1.7GHz clock speed , 6MB of L2 cache ( 512 KB per core ) , 10 MB of L3 , and a 1.04V core voltage .
s7e9h3n actually seems to be running two of these CPUs in a sample Socket G34 motherboard packed with 8 GB of 1,333MHz DDR3 memory .
The system successfully ran wPrime as well as a memory bandwidth test , in which it reached almost 42 GB / s. ( Socket G34 systems are supposed to have four memory channels , so if my math is right , 42 GB / s is pretty much the theoretical maximum with 1,333MHz DDR3 . )
s7e9h3n also tried overclocking , and he eventually managed to reach a blistering 3GHz at 1.165V .
He claims the processors throttled themselves to avoid overheating at that speed , though — not a surprising course of action , since Magny - Cours is still based on 45 - nm process technology , which is very much like running a pair of Istanbul Opterons in a single socket .
Iraq inquiry : British officials ruled against ' illegal ' ousting of Saddam
British officials considered a plan to topple Saddam Hussein two years before the Iraq War but ruled it would be illegal just months before Tony Blair signed up for the American invasion .
Senior diplomat Sir William
Patey told the first day of the Chilcot Inquiry into the 2003 invasion that Britain looked at a proposal for regime change in Iraq in late 2001 .
It was a response to growing ' drum beats ' for war in Iraq coming from the U.S. , the inquiry heard .
Protesters posing as Tony Blair , George Bush and Gordon Brown outside the inquiry .
Their hands were bloodied and they held dollar bills to signify their belief that the Iraq invasion was over oil
But the Foreign Office ' options paper ' concluded there was ' no legal basis ' for ousting the dictator .
It warned that Britain should ' keep a long way from the regime - change end of the spectrum ' .
Details of the paper prove that British officials were considering the possibility of removing the Iraqi dictator much earlier than has previously been admitted .
Tony Blair denied that regime change was British policy until the final days before the invasion .
Chairman John Chilcot ( background , 3rd L ) speaking during the first day of the Iraq Inquiry in central London
But the revelation that Whitehall officials regarded targeting Saddam as unlawful will strengthen the criticism that Mr Blair caved in to the American desire for war and rode roughshod over international law .
The details emerged on the first day of the hearings of the Chilcot Inquiry , set up to look into the war , its build - up and aftermath .
Sir William , who was then head of the Middle East Section at the Foreign Office , revealed that in early 2001 the Foreign Office drew up a policy paper called ' A Contract with the Iraqi People ' which set out what a ' post - Saddam ' Iraq might look like .

In secret meetings in Washington even before the 9/11 attacks , Bush administration officials told their British counterparts they wanted to oust the Iraqi dictator .
Sir William , now ambassador to Saudi Arabia , said : ' In February 2001 we were aware of these drum beats from Washington and internally we discussed it .
Our policy was to stay away from that .'
Later that year , after the 9/11 attacks , Sir William secretly drew up a second options paper because the Americans had made clear a conflict was possible .
He said : ' We had at the end the regime change option - which was dismissed at the time as having no basis in law .
It was very much an internal paper .
We did n't go into how to achieve regime change . '
Sir Roderic Lyne was a special advisor to BP Sir Lawrence Freedman is a professor of war studies at King 's College
Sir Martin Gilbert once compared Blair and Bush to Churchill and Roosevelt Baroness Usha Prasha is a cross bench member of the House of Lords
On three separate occasions , Sir William said that the view in Whitehall was that ' there was no legal basis for ' regime change .
That view was echoed by Sir Peter Ricketts , former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and now chief mandarin at the Foreign Office .
He said : ' Regime change in 2001 was something that we thought there could be no legal basis for . '
Just a few months later - in March 2002 - Mr Blair apparently pledged to George W. Bush that he would support a U.S. invasion during a summit at his Texas ranch .
Sir William further undermined Mr Blair 's justification for war , saying that Saddam was not seen as ' an immediate threat ' and it would have taken ' a few years ' before he became a serious danger to the West .
By early 2003 Downing Street 's ' dodgy dossier ' was claiming that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction could be deployed against British targets in Cyprus within 45 minutes .
The invasion took place on March 20 that year .
Yesterday 's testimony reinforces the widely held view that Mr Blair arranged the intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to suit his political decision to back Mr Bush .
International lawyers have long argued that the war was illegal and controversy has raged over the fact that the Government 's legal advice appeared to change in the run up to war .
The Attorney General Lord Goldsmith eventually claimed the war was legal because Saddam Hussein was in breach of UN resolutions - despite Mr Blair 's failure to secure a resolution explicitly endorsing war .
While the atmosphere was genteel inside the inquiry room , outside emotions were a little more evident .
Protesters in Tony Blair and George Bush masks , holding handfuls of cash smeared with fake blood , gathered in the street outside the QEII centre opposite Westminster Abbey .
Some of the families of the 179 British servicemen and women killed in the conflict spoke of their grief while others watched grimly as the mandarins gave evidence .
BUT THERE WON'T BE A VERDICT UNTIL 2011
The Iraq War inquiry is not likely to report until 2011 and will not find anyone guilty when it does .
Chairman Sir John Chilcot revealed yesterday that the inquiry is now expected to drag on several months longer than expected .
He said he and his committee will try to finish by the end of next year .
But he warned that the need to be thorough could see it drag on into 2011 .
' I hope people will bear with us , ' he said .
Sir John is not likely to deliver his verdict on what is widely regarded as Labour 's greatest foreign policy disaster until long after the party may have been driven from office .
He used his opening statement on the first day of hearings to confirm that no one will be blamed for the war .
' We are not a court or an inquest or a statutory inquiry ; and our processes will reflect that difference , ' he said .
' No - one is on trial .
We can not determine guilt or innocence .
Only a court can do that .
' But I make a commitment here that once we get to our final report , we will not shy away from making criticisms where they are warranted . '
Sir John will seek immunity from prosecution for witnesses who might incriminate themselves .
But no one will be on oath - instead they will sign a pledge that they have told the truth .
Sir John explicitly rejected a report yesterday that he would not be able to rule on the legality of the war because his team lacks top level legal advice .
He said the committee would ' be hearing about the legal basis for military action ' in ' the New Year ' .
" Then I come to the central lie of the letter , " Agassi writes .
" I say that recently I drank accidentally from one of Slim 's spiked sodas , unwittingly ingesting his drugs .
I ask for understanding and leniency and hastily sign it : Sincerely .
" I feel ashamed , of course .
I promise myself that this lie is the end of it . "
Agassi said the ATP reviewed the case , accepted his explanation and threw it out .
The tour responded with a statement , noting an independent panel makes the final decision on a doping violation .
" The ATP has always followed this rule , and no executive at the ATP has therefore had the authority or ability to decide the outcome of an anti-doping matter , " the statement said .
The International Tennis Federation said it was " surprised and disappointed " by Agassi 's revelations .
" Such comments in no way reflect the fact that the tennis anti-doping program is currently regarded as one of the most rigorous and comprehensive anti-doping programs in sport , " the ITF said in a statement .
In the past three years , the organization has begun overseeing anti-doping efforts on behalf of the ATP and WTA tours .
" The events in question occurred before the World Anti-Doping Agency was founded in 1999 and during the formative years of anti-doping in tennis , when the program was managed by individual governing bodies , " the ITF said .
The president of WADA , Jim Fahey , said he was disappointed by Agassi 's revelations and expects the ATP to " shed light on this allegation . "
Agassi , who married tennis star Steffi Graf and has two children , retired in 2006 .
Excerpts from his autobiography , which comes out Nov. 9 , are being published this week in the London newspaper , as well as Sports Illustrated and People magazines .
In a story posted on People magazine 's Web site Tuesday , Agassi says : " I can't speak to addiction , but a lot of people would say that if you 're using anything as an escape , you have a problem . "
According to the Times of London , Agassi writes in his book that " Slim " was the person who introduced him to crystal meth , dumping a small pile of powder on the coffee table .
" I snort some .
I ease back on the couch and consider the Rubicon I 've just crossed , " Agassi writes .
" There is a moment of regret , followed by vast sadness .
Then comes a tidal wave of euphoria that sweeps away every negative thought in my head .
I 've never felt so alive , so hopeful -- and I 've never felt such energy . "
" I 'm seized by a desperate desire to clean .
I go tearing around my house , cleaning it from top to bottom .
I dust the furniture .
I scour the tub .
I make the beds . "
U.S. Fed Cup captain Mary Joe Fernandez , a contemporary of Agassi's , described the revelations as disappointing and " a bit of a shock . "
" It takes a lot of guts and courage to come out and say something that nobody would have really known about , " Fernandez said .
" I 've always admired Andre .
He was a huge part of inspiring my generation , and he did a lot of great things and continues to do a lot of great things .
He 's opening up now , and that 's his choice .
Maybe people can learn from it and not make the same mistakes . "
Among the most successful and popular tennis players in history , Agassi drew attention not just for his play , but also for his outfits , hairstyles and relationships with women , including a failed marriage to actress Brooke Shields .
Agassi's first major championship came at Wimbledon in 1992 , and he won a gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics .
But by late 1997 , he dropped to No. 141 in the rankings , and he was playing in tennis ' equivalent of the minor leagues .
He resuscitated his career in 1998 , making the biggest one - year jump into the top 10 in the history of the ATP rankings .
The next season , he won the French Open to complete a career Grand Slam , then added a second career U.S. Open title en route to finishing 1999 at No. 1 .
After an exhibition match Sunday in China against longtime rival Pete Sampras , Agassi was asked if his autobiography contained any major revelations .
" I think I had to learn a lot about myself through the process , " Agassi said .
" There was a lot that even surprised me .
So to think that one wo n't be surprised by it , it would be an understatement .
" Whatever revelations exist , you 'll get to see in full glory , " he added .
" But the truth is , my hope is that somebody does n't just learn more about me , what it is I 've been through , but somehow through those lessons , they can learn a lot about themselves .
And I think it 's fair to say that they will . "
In a posting on People 's Web site , Agassi says he " was worried for a moment , but not for long , " about how fans would react if they found out he used drugs .
" I wore my heart on my sleeve and my emotions were always written on my face .
I was actually excited about telling the world the whole story , " Agassi says .
According to the publisher , he worked closely on the book with Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist J.R. Moehringer , author of " The Tender Bar . "
A writer from SI first revealed the crystal meth reference on a Twitter posting Tuesday .
According to the Times of London excerpt , Agassi was walking through New York 's LaGuardia airport when he got the call that he had failed a drug test .
" There is doom in his voice , as if he 's going to tell me I 'm dying , " Agassi writes .
" And that 's exactly what he tells me . "
" He reminds me that tennis has three classes of drug violation , " Agassi writes .
" Performance - enhancing drugs ... would constitute a Class 1 , he says , which would carry a suspension of two years .
However , he adds , crystal meth would seem to be a clear case of Class 2 . Recreational drugs . "
That would mean a three - month suspension .
" My name , my career , everything is now on the line .
Whatever I 've achieved , whatever I 've worked for , might soon mean nothing .
Days later I sit in a hard - backed chair , a legal pad in my lap , and write a letter to the ATP .
It 's filled with lies interwoven with bits of truth . "
Fernandez said the episode did n't shake her faith in tennis ' anti-doping program .

Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen was punched in the face by an irate fan outside a South Bend restaurant early Sunday morning and has a swollen eye , a person briefed on the incident said on Monday .
That person said Clausen was " sucker - punched " by a fan as he left an establishment after having dinner with his parents .
The fan allegedly said something to Clausen and / or a female acquaintance .
A South Bend police spokesman said that no police reports were filed over the weekend involving Clausen , according to the Chicago Tribune .
The newspaper also reported that the name of the bar was CJ's and that a bartender at the establishment said that Clausen had been there with family members and other Irish upperclassmen after Notre Dame 's loss to Connecticut on Senior Day .
The source told ESPN.com that the injury is not expected to keep Clausen from playing this weekend against Stanford .

It 's easy to assume videogames are made by overworked , underpaid , pasty geeks who subsist on pizza and soda and are ridden hard by publishers eager to capitalize on market trends and consumer ignorance by releasing the same game over and over again .
Actually , most of that is true .
With the industry expanding and game budgets on the way to rivaling Hollywood movies , publishers are intent on playing it safe , which explains the glut of me - too shooting games on the Xbox 360 -- if you can't beat 'em , copy 'em .
This got us thinking :
What if there was a step - by - step guide to crafting a stellar shooter , or at least a shooter that blatantly rips off stellar shooters ?
After kissing Cliff Bleszinski's ass and breaking into Infinity Ward using night vision goggles , we 've compiled the strategies behind building grim - dark war games for an audience of armchair commandos .
Sure , a whole lot of work goes into developing a game , but coming up with a kick - ass name is arguably one of the most important parts .
Equally important : making sure the word " of " is between two nouns .
That could make all the difference between selling a million copies and being relegated to the bargain bin .
Another vital step is designing the perfect box art .
They say that those who do n't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it .
With war games , repeating the past is necessary , and not just because many war games are retelling WORLD WAR II for the umpteenth time ; D - Day is to shooters as Hoth is to Star Wars .
A quick look at the Xbox 360 software library yields some interesting information .
Based on statistics made up on the spot for this study , a whopping 75 % of Xbox 360 retail releases feature a man holding a gun on the cover .
80 % of the time , he 's a member of the military .
And , perhaps most importantly , those games make a profit 100 % of the time .
If you 're making a shooter ( and 75 % of Xbox 360 developers are ) , remember these key rules to creating box art that we found on an encrypted email intercepted from Treyarch , keepers of the Call of Duty franchise when Infinity Ward is on vacation .
There is more to designing a shooter than kick - ass box art , a killer , if misleading ad campaign ( more on that later ) , and succinct title .
Gameplay might not rank as important as graphics in today 's visuals - obsessed market , but like nipples on a man it still has to be there .
The trifecta of characters , enemies , and levels are the crux of most games , and shooting games are no different .
Characters should embody time - honored archetypes .
The protagonist should be the unwilling hero , swept into events bigger than himself and forced to fight for the greater good to save everything .
His partners can run the gamut -- one could be a grizzled veteran who lives on the battlefield , another the smarmy cynic always cracking jokes , and of course a leader who holds rules and regulations above all else . :
The leader should be the one you kill off at the end of the first level .
When choosing enemies , developers have free reign and can really flex their creative muscle .
With a variety of bad guys to choose from , it 's often tough to pick just one .
In that case , feel free to combine two distinct enemy types .
" Nazi zombies " has already been done , so consider spicing things up .
Gamers love shooting terrorists , and aliens are still a hot commodity , so make the antagonists part of a Martian terror cell intent on destroying the planet because of ideological differences : Martians despise the electoral college more than humans do .
And lastly , there 's picking the levels your bullet drama plays out in .
War - torn villages and shantytowns are nice , but put them on the moon and you 're golden .
If you 're covering World War II ( again ) , be sure to include the invasion of Normandy on D - Day since according to gaming that was the most important part of the entire war .
If your game tackles real - world political issues in geographical hotspots , play that up as much as possible .are basically shit - holes where the poor eke out a miserable existence , but in Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 they are awesome places to shoot terrorists and " accidentally " put civilians out of their misery .
Afghanistan is tragically proving increasingly dangerous for real - life U.S. troops , but its mountainous terrain is a great place for campers to get a kill streak going .
So , you 've finished your dream shooter ... or just a shooter modeled after another company 's dream shooter that was picked up to fill a gap in a publisher 's portfolio .
Now , you have to let people know about it .
To ensure maximum consumer penetration , millions of dollars should be dropped on TV spots featuring zero gameplay footage , magazine ads with months - old , out - of - context quotes taken from the same magazines they are featured in , and a series of live - action viral videos .
If the game has a modern , realistic bent , consider using beat - boxing terrorists in caves rapping about destroying America ( " We da Mujahideen / we come clean / Praisin ' Allah with our AKs in ya grill / we 's ballahs " ) .
Another good idea is a contest .
If your game is called " Twilight of Liberty , " the suits in marketing could challenge contestants to send in photos of themselves LARPing in a post - apocalyptic , martial law - run America .
The winner would need to be very convincing : building a replica Vault - Tec fallout shelter in your backyard is good , but stocking it with food stolen from convenience stores with illegal weapons you purchased at a gun show is better .
The game just hit shelves .
Reviews are pouring in . called it " A masterpiece of game design ... best shooter ever ! "
Popular website EGN.com declared it the " Game of the Forever . "
You just received an interview request by a mainstream media outlet that typically refuses to cover anything gaming - related because they are a legitimate news source and do n't like to lower themselves to reporting on videogames .
Fanboys on various videogame message boards are engaging in vicious flame wars defending or attacking your game even though none of them have actually played it .
Analysts are predicting huge sales figures .
Your company has already started planning the sequel , which will actually be a prequel .
Time to do it all over again ... again .
Which one would you address as " Your honor ? "

Ken and I were both somewhat shocked and completely appalled by a story coming out of swampy Tangipahoa Parish in Louisiana , flush up against Mississippi , that a justice of the peace , Keith Bardwell , had refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple .
We 'll get back to that in a moment .
First let 's look at a bit of context .
In recent years Tangipahoa Parish has been dragged into court seven times for promoting religious doctrine in public schools .
The Tangipahoa Parish School Board should have been a chapter in Charles Pierce 's Idiot America : How Stupidity Became a Virtue in the Land of the Free .
One of the cases involved a warning sticker the school board decided to put on science books railing against evolution .
Justice of the Peace Bardwell must have taken the warning against evolution to heart -- and resisted with all his might .
The parish is one of the poorest and least educated in Louisiana .
It 's a solidly Republican area although almost 30 % of the population is black ( and Democratic ) .
In 2004 Kerry won 36.5 % of the parish 's votes but last year Obama took only 33.8 % .
Part of the 1st congressional district -- and represented by reactionary lunatic Steve Scalise ( R ) -- the median income in Tangipahoa Parish is less than half of the $ 40,948 for LA - 01 .
Bardwell has been the Justice of the Peace there for 34 years .
He was first elected as a Democrat butrealized that his beliefs were more aligned with the new anti-Lincoln Republican Party and he switched and was re-elected as a Republican .
It is n't likely he 'll be finishing his current term , which would end in 2014 .
You probably know that Bardwell -- who insists he is n't a racist having " piles and piles " of black friends who use his bathroom -- refused to sign the marriage certificate for 30 year old Beth Humphrey , who is white , and 32 year old Terence McKay , who is black , based on a claim that children of black - white interracial marriages are n't accepted by either black or white society .
He must have neglected to read the newspapers since the last presidential election -- either that or he spends his days watching the anti-American broadcasts from Fox News or listening to Hate Talk radio .
In any case , the law on this matter was settled by the Supreme Court in 1967 ( Loving v Virginia , which ruled that miscegenation laws are unconstitutional ) .
Both Louisiana 's Republican governor , Bobby Jindal ( who once represented backward Tangipahoa Parish in Congress ) , and Lousiana 's Democratic senior senator , Mary Landrieu , have called for Bardwell 's ouster .
Interestingly , two of the state 's most overt racist politicians , junior Senator and sexual predator David Vitter and Rep. Scalise , have been uncomfortably silent on the episode .
The local newspapers seem split between those generally outraged by Bardwell 's racist attitude and those who are embarrassed that his actions shined a spotlight on Tangipahoa Parish 's backwardness .
They have , after all , been electing and re-electing Bardwell , not to mention Scalise and Vitter .
And apparently this is n't the first interracial couple Bardwell has illegally refused to marry .
Three other couples have stepped forward to say they 've had the same problem with him .
This one probably would never have been reported either except for the national discussion of racism going on now because of the very public racist antics of media bigots Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck .
We 'll let you know -- at least via twitter -- as soon as Vitter takes the diaper out of his mouth and condemns Bardwell .
Here he is -- Keith Bardwell , a good example of why people like David Vitter get elected to public office :

Cannabis is the most common " problem drug " among under 25s Cannabis remains the most abused drug among people in Northern Ireland who have sought treatment for drug problems , according to new figures .
The annual Drug Misuse Database also found that there was 4 % increase in the number of users seeking help for cannabis abuse , compared to last year .
The statistics also showed that 72 % of patients who presented for treatment for the first time were male .
The figures are based on data collected from 1,755 patients across NI .
The patients had to give their consent to be including in the survey which covers the twelve month period ending 31 March 2009 .
' Gender divide '
AVERAGE AGE OF FIRST TIME USE OF MAIN DRUG Cannabis - 15 years old Ecstasy - 18 years old Cocaine - 21 years old Heroin - 22 years old Other opiates - 26 years old Codeine / paracetamol - 28 years old Other drugs - 32 years old Benzodiazepines - 33 years old
The figures show a significant gender divide in the profile of problem drug users .
Half of the female patients who took part were over 40 years old and 42 % of them reported that benzodiazepines were their main problem drug .
Benzodiazepines , which include drugs like valium and temazepam , have a sedative effect and can be proscribed to treat anxiety .
Male clients were more likely to be younger and cited cannabis abuse as their biggest problem .
' Reduction '
The increase in the abuse of cannabis appears to buck the trend however , as the number of people reporting abuse of benzodiazepines fell by almost a third .
There was was also a slight decrease in the number seeking treatment for cocaine addiction .
Overall , there was 12 % reduction in the number of people included in the latest database , down by 229 compared to the year before .
Half of of the patients seeking help for drug problems were unemployed and a further 17 % were in receipt of other benefits .
Geography also appeared to play a part in the figures .
In the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust area , 45 % of those surveyed reported that benzodiazepines was their main problem drug while among heroin users across the five trusts , the Northern Trust area had the highest proportion of people which cited it as the substance they abused most .
The Northern Trust includes the town of Ballymena , which has had a widely reported problem with heroin over the last few years .
As well as those seeking help for drug problems for the first time , the survey also included data from returning patients requiring treatment for the first time in six months .
More than a quarter ( 27 % ) of those who took part had previously undergone treatment for drug misuse .
There were a further 88 patients who did not agree to the inclusion of their details in the database .
The authors of the database which is produced by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency , said it was important to note that the report " does not provide information on the overall size and nature of problem drug use or misuse in Northern Ireland " .

The Axis of Corporate Evil never ceases to amaze .
Dead peasant insurance , also called Dead janitors insurance , is a wide spread but little known practice among corporate entities .
The " Dead peasant " is industrial slang for the rank and file employee who is worth a considerable sum of money dead or alive .
The Wall Street Journal reports that corporations by the hundreds take out life insurance policies on their own employees with the companies as the beneficiaries .
When an employee dies , sometimes years after the employee has left the company , the company receives the death benefit .
" Most workers covered this way do n't know it , nor do their families , " says the Journal .
To make matters more interesting the companies use this little gambit as a tax shelter .
It allows corporations to boost profits by taking advantage of the tax - shelter features of life insurance .
While the employee is alive they are a great little investment for the employer .
Without their knowledge or consent a company as beneficiary can subsequently borrow money against the policy and then claim the interest as a tax deduction .
While the employee lives , the company gains from the loans and tax break .
When the employee dies , the company gets the death benefit pay out yielding billions of dollars .
Read on :
That was certainly the case with the family of Margaret Reynolds , a 62 year old Ohio woman who died in 1998 .
Her family received a $ 21,000 death benefit from her employer , C.M. Holdings .
The money was from a life insurance policy the company provided for is employees .
What Reynolds did not know during her lifetime , and her family did not know after her death , is that her employer had taken out another life insurance policy on her with itself as the beneficiary .
When she died , her family received the $ 21,000 while her employer received an insurance payout form the “ dead peasant policy ” of $ 180,000 .
Reynolds , like many other workers , had been used .
Her son was outraged at the news of this deception because during the last years of Reynold ’s battle with Lou Gehrig ’s Disease , the family had “ begged C.M .
Holdings for $ 5,000 to pay for a specialized wheelchair so they could take her to church , ” a request the company refused .
Veniality is inherently blind to human suffering .
In 1996 the IRS deemed the tax deductions improper and would no longer permit them saying that the corporate owned life insurance or COLI served no legitimate purposes ; the agency " is investigating more that 85 companies that it says took 6 billion in illegal deductions . "
Some COLI policies even cover part - time and short - term workers and , in some cases , workers ' relatives .
The policies can remain in force long after the worker leaves the company .
Many of the companies are challenging the disallowance saying that the death benefits go toward paying for other employee benefits but as a rule the courts do not accept that excuse .
Some argue that since the company pays for the premiums and has every right to benefit from it .
Yet it ’s hard to ignore the fact that the company uses the employees name without compensating the employee for that use .
A clear case of exploitation ; in some cases if the employee is informed they have to give their approval to this practice as a condition of employment .
Not only is this unethical in practice it ’s a big financial drain on the U.S. Treasury , as well as , a major concern to the Securities and Exchange Commission , Congress and the courts .
Described as , “ A product actively marketed by the insurance industry as an ‘ attractive , off - balance - sheet asset , ’ " so far it ’s been the source of an estimated $ 6 billion in lost tax revenue to the U.S.
Treasury annually and the subject of several pending tax court cases .
It ’s all the rage among Corporate America ’s top 1 % Enron subsidiary Portland General and Dow Chemical have engaged in this practice .
Companies listed by The Examiner as taking out “ Dead Peasant ” policies include American Electric Power , AT&T , Ball , Basset Furniture , Eaton , Nestle USA , Olin , Pitney Bowes , PPG Industries , Procter & Gamble , Trans World Entertainment and Walt Disney .
One attorney for the Hartford Life Insurance Co. hazards a guess that up to 25 % of the Fortune 500 companies have them covering the lives of 5 million to 6 million workers .
Many corporations are currently appealing the their tax dodging tactics to the 6th District Court .
Wal - Mart used them in the early 90s when they were most popular as a means of sheltering income from taxes , turning liabilities into assets , and funding costly executive benefits .
In 1995 Wal - Mart decided they were n't making any money from these policies and dropped the program .
Maybe they mean no new policies .
According to the Houston Chronicle , 5 to 6 million corporate serfs have life insurance policies held on them by Fortune 500 magnates , and Wal - Mart holds some 350,000 .
Wal - Mart launched a program in 1994 promising its employees a $ 5,000 death benefit .
The company was so determined its workers should take advantage of the program that it threatened any who turned it down with the forfeiture of their health insurance .
While no longer legal in Texas , California and a few other states require written consent from employees , even so , many such disclosures do n’t explain where the proceeds of the death policy will go .
One has to wonder how hard the insurance companies have pushed this idea .
Welcome to the Brave New Corporate World where everything -- even death -- has become a commodity traded by profiteers and an early demise has become the bottom line .

An Australian Special Forces explosives detection dog has been found alive and well almost 14 months after going missing in action ( MIA ) in Afghanistan .
Sabi was found by a US soldier at an isolated patrol base in north - eastern Uruzgan last week .
The black Labrador was declared MIA in September 2008 during the same battle with the Taliban in which SAS Trooper Mark Donaldson won his Victoria Cross .
Sabi was present with her handler when their combined Australian , US and Afghan National Army convoy was ambushed by an insurgent force .
Nine Australian soldiers , including Sabi 's handler , were wounded during the engagement .
Sabi spent more than a year in the desolate south of Afghanistan and repeated attempts were made by the Special Operations Task Group to find her .
The US soldier who found her , and who can only be identified by his first name John , was aware Australian Special Forces soldiers were missing one of their explosive detection dogs .
He said it was immediately obvious that Sabi was no ordinary dog .
" I took the dog and gave it some commands it understood , " he said .
She was flown to Tarin Kowt to be reunited with one of her trainers and he knew instantly it was Sabi .
" I nudged a tennis ball to her with my foot and she took it straight away .
It 's a game we used to play over and over during her training , " the trainer said .
" It 's amazing , just incredible , to have her back . "
Currently in the United Kingdom after meeting Her Majesty the Queen , Trooper Mark Donaldson said Sabi 's return closed a chapter of their shared history .
" She 's the last piece of the puzzle , " he said .
" Having Sabi back gives some closure for the handler and the rest of us that served with her in 2008 .
It 's a fantastic morale booster for the guys . "
At the time of her disappearance Sabi was coming to the end of her second tour of duty in Afghanistan , having previously deployed to Uruzgan in 2007 .
Sabi will now undergo a period of quarantine before a decision can be made about the timing of her return to Australia .

Steve Harris , Electronic Gaming Monthly 's founder and once again owner after re-acquiring its publishing rights earlier this year , revealed the returning magazine 's cover for its planned December 2009 issue , which features Mass Effect 2's Commander Shepard ( in fact , it 's a variation of the game 's boxart ) .
Issue # 238 , EGM 's first since former owner Ziff Davis suspended publishing in January 2009 following its sale of the 1UP Network to UGO / Hearst , promises a collection of previews for 2010 games such as Super Mario Galaxy 2 , Bioshock 2 , Halo Reach , and many others .
The cover also brings back the Electronic Gaming Monthly logo that was replaced in early 2007 with the shorter EGM , though this logo has a slight change in its stripe .

Fritchey 's Fun Facebook Feed
By Kevin Robinson in News on Nov 30 , 2009 6:00 PM
If you 're on Facebook ( and who is n't , these days ? ) , then you know that people use the social networking application not only to stay in touch , but also to share their thoughts and personal events with their network of friends and acquaintances .
Social networking has become so prevalent in society that even politicians and elected officials use it communicate with constituents .
Unfortunately , they tend to use it in a dry and almost " safe " way - sticking to an unwritten script of stating a position on an issue , thanking supporters / asking them to help support a campaign , piece of legislation or friendly candidate , and sharing information about issues the candidate is working to promote or support .
11th District state representative John Fritchey , however , breaks that mold .
Fritchey is famous for his Facebook updates - in fact , he 's pretty well known for embracing social media applications , from Twitter , to Facebook , to yes , even Blogger .
" Social networking is an incredibly effective tool for elected officials - if properly used .
It has the ability to not only open lines of communication but also to strengthen the relationships with your audience , " Fritchey told us .
" But the key is that it be genuine .
My friends , personal and political , know that I write everything on my blog , post all my own Facebook material and do my own tweets , so they know that they 're not only hearing from me , but hearing it in my own words . "
If you 've spent any time at all connecting with Fritchey online , you know the authenticity of what he 's putting out there - be it sharing news clips about regulating puppy mills in Illinois , discussing the hijinks in his district office , or asking for Halloween costume ideas .
" While I want to get my message out there , I also want to be myself .
So when you look on my Facebook page , you 're as likely to see one of my musical picks as you are to read about current political events .
This approach not only lets me use social networking for its intended purpose of keeping in touch with friends , but it also brings political followers into the circle , which much more often then not , helps build their support .
I think that a lot of elected officials are n't real comfortable with the idea of showing the amount of candor that I do online , but I think that for the most part , my followers appreciate it .
At the end of the day , it 's a fun and easy way to show your human side , which a lot of people forget that elected officials have . "
The policy pre-dates the tenure of current RNC Chairman Michael Steele , said a spokesperson .
RNC to opt out of abortion coverage
The Republican National Committee will no longer offer employees an insurance plan that covers abortion after POLITICO reported Thursday that the anti-abortion RNC 's policy has covered the procedure since 1991 .
" Money from our loyal donors should not be used for this purpose , " Chairman Michael Steele said in a statement .
" I do n't know why this policy existed in the past , but it will not exist under my administration .
Consider this issue settled . "

Steele has told the committee 's director of administration to opt out of coverage for elective abortion in the policy it uses from Cigna .
Federal Election Commission Records show the RNC purchases its insurance from Cigna , and two sales agents for the company said that the RNC ’s policy covers elective abortion .
As of Thursday , the RNC ’s plan covers elective abortion – a procedure the party ’s own platform calls “ a fundamental assault on innocent human life . ”
Informed of the coverage , RNC spokeswoman Gail Gitcho told POLITICO earlier Thursday that the policy pre-dates the tenure of current RNC Chairman Michael Steele .
“ The current policy has been in effect since 1991 , and we are taking steps to address the issue , ” Gitcho said .
The RNC moved quickly Thursday to assuage any concerns its members might have .
In a letter obtained by POLITICO , RNC Chief of Staff Ken McKay writes to the 168 committeemen and committeewomen across the country that Steele " takes this issue very seriously . "
He writes that the RNC has been evaluating its health insurance policy and will continue to do so .
Leading up to passage of the House health care reform bill last week , 176 House Republicans joined 64 Democrats in voting for the so - called Stupak amendment , a measure that prohibits federal funds from being used to buy health insurance that covers elective abortions .
A spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee – the campaign arm for the House Republicans – said it does not include coverage for elective abortions in its employee insurance policy .
“ The policy does not cover abortions unless the life of the mother is in danger , ” the NRCC spokeswoman said .
According to several Cigna employees , the insurer offers its customers the opportunity to opt out of abortion coverage – and the RNC did not choose to opt out .
But rank - and - file Republicans said Thursday before the change was announced that the policy should – and would – be changed .
“ We were not aware of this , obviously , and this will , of course , be fixed , ” said James Bopp Jr. , a Republican National Committeeman from Indiana .
“ I think Chairman Steele will see to it that that ’s the case . ”
Rep. Jack Kingston , a Georgia conservative , said “ they need to drop that clause ” from the policy or find a new one .
“ From a philosophical standpoint , it ’s inconsistent , ” Kingston said .
“ It makes me think someone is n’t scrutinizing the purchases . ”
Cigna spokesman Chris Curran declined to discuss the specifics of the RNC ’s plan , saying it ’s against company policy to reveal even the identities of its insured .
But he said that Cigna ’s products “ are designed to meet the requirements of our individual employer clients .
Employer clients are informed of the services covered and it is their choice to decide which benefits meet their needs . ”
There is no indication that any RNC employee used the abortion coverage , but Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said it ’s “ no surprise ” that the RNC had been offering it .
“ It ’s an employer that wants to provide standard health benefits for its employees , ” she said .
“ That ’s why the Stupak amendment goes too far in taking away benefits that women have today , and that ’s why women wo n’t allow the Stupak amendment to become law . ”
The Stupak amendment , named for sponsor Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , was adopted by the House before it passed the health care bill on Saturday night .
It prohibits a government - backed health care plan from offering abortion services and bans the use of federal subsidies for individuals to buy into health care plans that provide abortion coverage .
Rep. John Shadegg of Arizona was the only House Republican who did not vote in favor of the amendment .
He voted “ present . ”
While 64 Democrats voted for the amendment , the majority did not – and the Democratic Party ’s 2008 platform says the party “ unequivocally supports Roe v.
Wade and a woman ’s right to choose a safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay . ”
The Democratic National Committee provides abortion coverage to its employees , the committee said .
The hidden beauty of the sewer rat
von Nora Sobich | Oct 15 , 2009
Even Le Corbusier enthused about the untreated surface in which the building process eternalized itself in the form of a negative imprint when he spoke of the " grandness of board - marked concrete " .
Anyone serious about concrete is a fan of purism .
Sensual and archaic - looking fair - faced concrete celebrates an essential nakedness which also makes the load - bearing structure of the building " visible " .
Great craftsmanship is required to reveal the full beauty of concrete .
It is often more expensive than natural stone and as such at times referred to as the marble of the 20th century .
The fact that concrete can display itself as something with aesthetic appeal , and not just be hidden in the skeleton of a building is a trend which took time , however .
The examples of monotonous mass architecture , for which the material basically stands , speak a different language .
For the majority of the population concrete is the absolute evil - doer , the cemented cuss word for everything ugly and dismal in the modern age .
Concrete has been celebrated over the centuries for its functional properties alone .
The material has not been granted an independent aesthetic aura in spite of its construction properties .
Concrete with character
Despite his experiments with concrete , even the great Frank Lloyd Wright , who is revered like a saint as the inventor of modern American architecture , was unable to rouse ongoing enthusiasm for its aesthetic qualities .
The aim was , as he wrote , to make something " timeless , fine and beautiful " from the " sewer rat " .
Wright breathed something of the spirit of " arts and crafts " into the sterile construction of concrete blocks when he developed four artful slabs with almost Oriental decoration .
The most famous building constructed from them is Ennis House in Los Angeles , which was built in 1924 and became a backdrop in Ridley Scott 's film Blade Runner .
An ingenious concrete temple whose aesthetics at the time caused great offense .
The signature which architect and great concrete artist Paul Rudolph gave the provocative material also received little applause beyond the concrete avant - garde .
The surface of Rudolph 's famous cord concrete is roughly ribbed as if a plough had been dragged over a field .
Rudolph used this surface processing for the first time in the 1960s at the Yale School of Art and Architecture , and later also in the Lindemann Center in Boston .
For Rudolph , as with many others , it was about the plasticity of the material which he emphasized with his cord concrete as if the hands of the designer were perceivable in every detail of his monumental concrete sculptures .
Only a fine weather material ?
Perhaps the surface design of concrete was first recognized so late because concrete ages very badly and often loses its beauty overnight .
The material requires good weather - cold and especially rain do not agree with it .
Concrete walls discolor quickly , becoming dark and patchy , forming cracks and orange - colored stains from corroded reinforcement iron .
However , in recent years the improvement in the material composition of concrete has not only expanded the field of possible applications but also contributed to its aesthetic acceptance .
A big step here was the invention of self - compacting concrete , " SCC " for short , enriched with silicate powder and synthetic mobile solvent so that the concrete ventilates alone from gravity and gains a finer surface .
This new quality opens up further possibilities :
The cool , clear aesthetics of SCC is a preferred material in spa and wellness oases as well as at home as a patina - forming concrete wall or monolithic concrete furniture which gains its own character over time - like a leather chair .
Concrete experienced a heyday as an added decorative element in Eastern bloc architecture , where wall images and relief plates became a real socialist ornament .
Now concrete is booming as a design tool for facades and surfaces , without its intrinsic archaic expressiveness becoming kitsch .
Fair - faced concrete is increasingly declared to be a sort of facade paper and communicative projection surface , and painted , written and printed on .
It is a planar wallpaper on which much is imaginable .
Relief - type drawings , photos and structures can be engraved into it .
The printed concrete wall of the Eberswalde Library by Swiss architects , Herzog & de Meuron , looks like modern graffiti art .
Concrete does n't always have to be gray
It is only half true that concrete has to be gray because it can also be effectively dyed .
In the 1950s Alfonso Ossorio integrated a typical kidney - shaped swimming pool in a resplendent red-blue concrete geometry on Long Island .
Today the most common coloration is a subdued brick red .
The new Liechtenstein Art Museum in Vaduz shows more of the refined side of concrete with a black polished concrete facade sanded and polished so smoothly that it acts like a mirror reflecting its surroundings .
This technique of sanding and polishing is also used for floors .
For this purpose a rough - mixed concrete is usually chosen which once treated , looks similar to a terrazzo surface .
Tempting transparency
One of the sensations in the eventful history of concrete is so - called transparent concrete .
This innovation which has been permanently enhanced in recent years with considerable improvement to the transparency , contains optical glass fibers .
This transparent concrete is not just a decorative element .
It can be used to erect complete buildings .
Some even expect it to replace the dominating glass architecture .
Concrete can do many things .
Although its versatility is often considered a character weakness it is precisely this ability to change - like no other material - which over and again enables it to capture the zeitgeist .
Today 's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery , publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine , and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a signficant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada , but also to the marijuana legalization movement .
His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $ 5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts , but those have gone up in smoke today .
Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General 's most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets -- one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery 's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canda .
Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on .
After two decades as Canada 's Prince of Pot , Marc Emery will surrender himself today in B.C. Supreme Court and become the country 's first Marijuana Martyr .
Emery will begin serving what could be as long as five years behind bars as Uncle Sam 's prisoner for a crime that in Canada would have earned him at most a month in the local hoosegow .
It is a legal tragedy that in my opinion marks the capitulation of our sovereignty and underscores the hypocrisy around cannabis .
Emery has n't even visited America but he was arrested in July 2005 at the request of a Republican administration that abhorred his politics .
He is being handed over to a foreign government for an activity we are loath to prosecute because we do n't think selling seeds is a major problem .
There are at least a score of seed - sellers downtown and many , many more such retail outlets across the country .
In the days ahead , once the federal justice minister signs the extradition papers , Emery will be frog - marched south to Seattle where his plea bargain will be rubber - stamped and he will be sent to a U.S. penitentiary .
For comparison , consider that the B.C. Court of Appeal last year said a one - month jail sentence plus probation was appropriate punishment for drug and money - laundering offences of this ilk .
The last time Emery was convicted in Canada of selling pot seeds , back in 1998 , he was given a $ 2,000 fine .
Marc Emery is no longer a free man .
Canada 's Prince of Pot was taken into custody today .
He turned himself in at the BC Supreme Court in Vancouver , and is now jailed in Vancouver awaiting imminent extradition to the US , where he is set to plead guilty to one count of marijuana distribution for selling pot seeds over the Internet .
Emery is expected to be sentenced to five years in federal prison in the US for his seed sales .
He sold millions of seeds in the decade prior to his 2005 arrest and became a leading hemispheric advocate for marijuana legalization , using the profits from his seed sales to fund reformers across the continent .
He also called out then drug czar John Walters for lying about marijuana and interfering in Canadian domestic politics , leading then DEA head Karen Tandy to issue this press release lauding his arrest as a blow to the legalization movement :
Can you say politically motivated ?
I knew you could .
One American attorney familiar with his case told me this weekend that Emery could have fought the prosecution and sought to have shown that it was unlawfully politically motivated , but that Emery and his Canadian legal team did n't want to take that risk .
That 's understandable , given that Emery was looking at decades or even life in prison if he lost .
Now , America 's legions of unknown marijuana martyrs are being joined by one very big name .
Let 's hope that Emery 's unjust imprisonment turns a spotlight on the hideousness of a US federal legal system that turns a blind eye to torture but cages a man for selling pot seeds .
The Vancouver Sun's Ian Mulgrew sums it up nicely in an op - ed piece entitled Marc Emery 's Sentence Reeks of Injustice and Mocks Our Sovreignty
There 's more at the link above , but you get the gist .
Mulgrew , of course , is right on the money .
The Canadian government has shamefully failed to protect one of its citizens from the crazed drug war machine south of the border , and the US government is shamelessly imprisoning yet another non-violent pot person -- this time mainly to shut him up .
We should demand that Marc Emery and all other marijuana prisoners be immediately released .
Short of that , we should , as Emery requests , demand that he be allowed to serve his time at home in a Canadian prison .
In the late 1990s , several child sponsorship organizations amended their disclosures after a series of articles in The Chicago Tribune revealed that while they were soliciting money to sponsor a specific needy child , that child was not necessarily receiving the money directly .
More recently , charities that ask donors for money to buy a farm animal have added disclaimers to their pitches , stating that money might not buy a cow or a duck but finance broader programs .

Now Kiva is the latest nonprofit group to have to overhaul its explanation of how it works .
Where its home page once promised , “ Kiva lets you lend to a specific entrepreneur , empowering them to lift themselves out of poverty , ” it now simply states , after Mr. Roodman ’s post : “ Kiva connects people through lending to alleviate poverty . ”
Kiva is not the only site with transparency problems .
GlobalGiving , whose Web site allows donors to choose among various projects to support , has raised money for philanthropic projects of three or four profit - making companies , according to Dennis Whittle , its co-founder and chief executive .
It did not , however , tell donors that their money would support a company ’s philanthropic projects rather than one proposed by a nonprofit .
For instance , it raised $ 975 for SunNight Solar Enterprises , a small start - up that develops solar - powered consumer products , so it could distribute 500 free solar - powered lights to refugees in camps .
After The New York Times raised questions about the issue , Mr. Whittle said in a blog post on The Huffington Post that GlobalGiving was considering whether to tell potential donors when it was raising money for a business rather than a nonprofit .
Premal Shah , Kiva ’s president , said he could foresee a day when Kiva really did provide person - to - person connection , once some legal hurdles are cleared and when people in the developing world began using their mobile phones to use credit and make payments .

EXCLUSIVE
In the latest deadly reality show incident , a contestant died last week after suffering a stroke .
He was injured while performing a stunt on ABC 's physically grueling hit series " Wipeout , " TheWrap has learned .
Tom Sparks , 33 , a recent graduate of the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism , was rushed from the northern Los Angeles set of the show to a local hospital two weeks ago .
Sparks later was transfered to Cedars Sinai Medical Center , where doctors performed several brain surgeries .
But doctors ultimately decided there was too much brain damage , and he could n't be saved , according an email sent to alumni by an Annenberg faculty member .
Sparks died Nov. 5 .
The death highlights an emerging challenge for the increasingly dominant nonfiction TV business , which relies heavily on everyday individuals , often placed in difficult situations .
Despite what the industry describes as rigorous vetting procedures , deeper physical and psychological issues are often hard to detect .
Currently taping its third season , and loosely derived from several physically challenging Japanese game shows , “ Wipeout ” requires its contestants to negotiate myriad obstacle courses — such as jumping over hurdles while traversing a 40 - foot - long treadmill — in an attempt to collect a cash prize .
Problems first arose when Sparks complained of knee pain on the first part of the obstacle course , and producers instructed him to stop his run , an individual close to the production told TheWrap .
Medics noticed that he was experiencing shortness of breath , and he was taken to a local hospital for further examination .
Sparks and his wife , Kate , with whom he was competing on " Wipeout , " had been married two months and had just returned from a European honeymoon .
“ We offer our heartfelt condolences to the family , ” a joint ABC / Endemol statement read .
“ This is a tragic loss and our thoughts are with them at this time . ”
Members of Sparks ’ immediate family were n’t available for comment .
However , his father , Bill Sparks , has told friends and family that his son suffered from a pre-existing condition , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ( APS ) , a disease that causes unnatural clotting of the blood .
According to the nonprofit APS Foundation 's website , detection of the disease requires a specialized blood test that would not typically be conducted during a routine physical exam .
As with virtually all shows involving physical competition , Endemol subjects contestants to an exam prior to their participation , the individual close to the production said .
Certainly , Sparks gave no prior indication of ill health .
He wrote on his Facebook page that he had recently completed the Long Beach Marathon .
Graduating from USC in 2001 with a bachelor 's degree in communications , he had served production roles for L.A. ’s KROQ Radio and ABC ’s " Jimmy Kimmel Live , " before becoming a morning deejay on radio station KSKI in Sun Valley , Idaho .
A regular contributor to the broadband video venture CalifornialifeHD.com , he returned to USC in 2007 and received his master 's degree just last spring .
“ Tom truly was one of the most positive people I ’ve worked with in broadcasting , ” said CaliforniaLifeHD producer Heather Dawson .
“ He started working for our show last summer after graduating from USC .
He was a true talent and well liked by everyone . ”
In announcing a Wednesday memorial service in Los Angeles for his son , Bill Sparks requested donations be sent to the APS Foundation of America in lieu of flowers .
Editors note :
This story was amended to reflect that it is not clear that Tom Sparks suffered a stroke while performing the stunt .

In the film , The American President , the president 's speechwriter Lewis Rothschild ( played by Michael J Fox ) appeals to the commander - in - chief to take a firm , clear stand against the Right .
" People want leadership , Mr President , and in the absence of genuine leadership , they 'll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone . " he says .
" They want leadership .
They 're so thirsty for it they 'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage , and when they discover there 's no water , they 'll drink the sand . "
The president ( played by Michael Douglas ) retorts that the American electorate 's problem is not a lack of leadership but an undiscerning palate .
" We 've had presidents who were beloved , who could n't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight , " he says .
" People do n't drink the sand because they 're thirsty .
They drink the sand because they do n't know the difference . "
As the faithful wait in line in small towns across the country ( some for more than a day ) to see Sarah Palin on her book tour , the question of whether the US is deprived of a competent political class or gets the leadership it both deserves and truly desires seems as pertinent as ever .
On the one hand there is roughly between a quarter and a third of America that will clearly believe anything .
That is the figure that strongly approved of George Bush 's handling of the economy last year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the bailout .
That same figure , in the immediate aftermath of hurricane Katrina , believed that Bush 's response to the disaster was " about right " , and still supports the war in Iraq .
That also happens to be approximately the same proportion of Americans who back Palin for president .
Most data suggest the overlap is considerable .
Palin 's rise to prominence , from little - known governor to one of the most popular and arguably most charismatic Republicans in the country in just a year , has been startling .
She had a thin record when she was picked to run as vice - president .
Today , having quit the Alaska governorship mid-term and published a bestseller , only her wallet is thicker .
Her resignation speech was so rambling that you would have struggled to find a coherent sentence with an industrial - strength searchlight .
" Let me go back to a comfortable analogy for me – sports , " she announced .
" I use it because you 're naive if you do n't see the national full - court press picking away right now : A good point guard drives through a full court press , protecting the ball , keeping her eye on the basket ... and she knows exactly when to pass the ball so that the team can win . "
This was not the answer to a hostile interview from the " liberal media elite " but a prepared speech of her own making .
It would be easy to discount her as just a media phenomenon who would go away if we stopped talking about her .
That would be a mistake .
It would be even easier to poke fun at her as just a small town hick who has blundered into the limelight with a nod , wink and a " you betcha " .
That too would be a mistake .
For the very things that liberal commentators ridicule her for – being inarticulate , unworldly , simplistic and hokey – are the very things that make her attractive to her base .
Indeed , every time she is taunted she becomes more popular because it reaffirms the ( not entirely mistaken ) view that the deeply held values of a sizable section of the population are being disparaged .
The same dynamic was true for George Bush , but with one crucial exception .
Bush is the scion of a wealthy family who turned his back on the cultural trappings of his class while embracing the social confidence and political and financial entitlement that came with it .
Palin had none of those advantages : she grew up far from power and privilege in every sense .
The difference in their comfort levels when put on the spot with simple questions was evident when each was asked about their newspaper reading habits .
Bush was cocky : " The best way to get the news is from objective sources .
And the most objective sources I have are people on my staff who tell me what 's happening in the world . "
Palin froze : " I 've read most of them … all of them , any of them that have been in front of me over all these years . "
In her world , Ivy League is a slur ; cities are not the " real America " ; and those who know the price of arugula but cannot handle a rifle are not to be trusted .
Palin is the antithesis of an aspirational figure .
Her supporters love her not because they want to be like her , but because they already are like her .
So for better and for worse , Palin is an entirely self - made – and , if her book is anything to go by , self - invented – personification of the kind of political animal Bush sought to both emulate and nurture .
Bush was Palin - lite .
To that extent her performance over the past year has been more tragic than comic .
Palin represents the thwarted aspirations and brooding resentment of a large section of white working class Americans .
That is not to suggest that her supporters are necessarily racist , but polls show her support is racially exclusive .
Her base has plenty to be resentful about .
Their wages are stagnant , their economic security has eroded , and their prospects for social and economic advancement have stalled .
In 2004 , white Americans were the only racial group for whom the poverty rate actually rose .
The fact that it was lower than every other group is of little comfort .
Demographically , they are set to become a minority by 2042 .
Geopolitically , the country for which they display so much patriotic fervour has lost one war , is losing another , and is regularly lectured by others about the urgency of putting its fiscal house in order .
America is not what it used to be .
The country they keep saying they want to " take back " no longer exists and is not returning .
So when Palin rails against Washington DC , bank bailouts and elitist media she catches their ear .
The longer unemployment keeps rising , house prices keep falling and universal healthcare continues to be elusive , the more ears there will be .
Motivated , organised and angry , Palin 's wing of the Republican party does not have the numbers to make bad things happen ; but , as it showed over the summer during the healthcare town hall meetings , its determination to derail good things should not be underestimated .
The trouble is that while many of their grievances are well founded , their affection is certainly misplaced .
None of their problems can be remedied by the politics championed by Palin .
Indeed , the greater the traction her politics gets , the worse things will be for her base .
The America whose passing they mourn was lost precisely because of the freemarket , low - tax , warmongering agenda she advocates .
To crawl through the desert in search of water only to find sand is disappointing ; to not know the difference between water and sand is delusional ; but to go looking for sand in the belief that it will truly quench your thirst , not once but twice , well that is truly depressing .
TAMIL NADU , India , Sept. 30 ( UPI ) -- Geologists in Tamil Nadu , India , said a trove of dinosaur eggs was peeping out of the sand beds on grazing land in plain sight as they walked by .
The site is part of an area rich in ancient organisms dating back 140 million years , geologists told The Times of India .

" We found clusters and clusters of spherical eggs of dinosaurs .
And each cluster contained eight eggs , " M.U. Ramkumar , geology lecturer of the Periyar University , said .
He said each egg was about 5 to 8 inches in diameter .
They were lying in sandy nests of about four feet .
The clusters of eggs were under volcanic ash from the Deccan eruptions .
Scientists have long thought the Deccan eruptions were a reason for extinctions in the area .
The eggs , which may be 65 million years old , were from both the Carnosaur , an aggressive , predatory dinosaur , and Sauropods , long - necked herbivores that became extremely large .
Fossils of these reptiles were found on earlier expeditions but this is the first time so many nests and so many clusters of eggs were found , the newspaper said .
The eggs were sent to Germany for further study .
The area where they were found is cordoned off to discourage vandalism .
A computer whiz - kid who created forged rail tickets to avoid paying for his daily commute for more than two years was given a suspended sentence and ordered to pay the fares today .
IT consultant Jonathan Moore , 27 , saved a total of £ 12,472 by using his computer skills to design and produce phoney tickets for rail trips from East Sussex to London .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But he was caught when a ticket inspector on a First Capital Connect train spotted his bogus ticket during a routine inspection on the Bedford to Brighton service last November .
Subtle differences in the colour and material of Moore 's ticket were noticed by the eagle - eyed inspector , who helped bring his enterprising scam to an end .
A further 11 forged tickets dating back to 2006 were discovered in a plastic wallet in which Moore kept his ticket , and on a laptop seized at his home were designs for more than 70 fraudulent tickets .
Moore , of Goldstone Villas , Hove , was sentenced at Brighton Crown Court today .
He was given a nine - month suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty in August to fraud , making 74 forged travel tickets and possessing 11 forged tickets .
He was ordered to repay the £ 12,472 of unpaid ticket charges .
Judge Richard Hayward described it as a " skilful and sophisticated fraud committed over a long period of time " to save Moore the cost of rail travel .
The court heard that Moore 's deceit involved him designing and printing off three - and six - monthly rail tickets from his laptop computer over a sustained period .
Prosecutor Tara Celikoz said : " The matter first came to light in November last year when Mr Moore was approached by a conductor on his journey on a Bedford to Brighton train .

" An inspection took place and Mr Moore briefly flashed a season ticket which the conductor noticed had many discrepancies .
" Upon arrival at Brighton station , Mr Moore was arrested and in interview he admitted making the tickets on a laptop to help him travel from Brighton and Hove to London stations . "
There was no evidence Moore sold on any forged tickets , and it was said he admitted committing the offences from July 2006 to last November at the earliest opportunity .
Defence counsel Martin Cray said Moore , who had no previous convictions and lives with his partner of seven years , quit his IT job after his employers indicated they would take disciplinary action .
He said he could offer no excuse for his client 's actions other than to say he was undergoing difficulties both at home and at work .
In mitigation , Mr Cray said : " He made an initial admission on the train to the officers , then at his home he showed them all the files on his computer .
" He gave a full explanation in interview , including of matters that the officers would not have found themselves .
Essentially , he cooperated to the fullest possible extent . "
In addition to his suspended prison sentence and the £ 12,472 he will have to repay , Moore was handed a 240 - hour unpaid work order and told to pay £ 510 costs .
Judge Hayward told a tearful - looking Moore : " You are a computer expert who had a good job but you struck upon the idea of using your skills to scan and then produce rail tickets between Brighton and London .
" You did this to save yourself a considerable amount of money . "
He went on : " It 's very sad that you should use your skills for a fraudulent purpose . "
Following the case , Detective Constable Rob Cager , who led the investigation for British Transport Police ( BTP ) , said : " The simple fact is that Moore abused his skills as an IT consultant to produce the phoney tickets , effectively allowing him to enjoy free travel on the railways to the tune of over £ 12,000 .
" We will continue to work closely with the rail companies to ensure that those who seek to make financial gain in this way are brought to justice and I hope that today 's sentencing sends out a clear message that the police and the courts will not tolerate this sort of fraudulent activity . "
Karen Boswell , customer services director at First Capital Connect , said : " The audacity of this fraud beggars belief and it is a tribute to our quick - witted staff that this thief was caught out .
" Fare - dodgers like Moore are robbing the rail industry of £ 400 million a year , money that could otherwise be invested in better services for the vast majority of law - abiding passengers who do pay for their rail ticket . "
Sigh .
Here we go again — maybe .
When certain facts or developments in a story do n’t support the line of reportage the MSM wants to pursue , too often , they simply resort to non journalism by omission , perhaps in the hope that their non coverage will make it go away .
It appears that Climategate may be the next big story receive the old MSM general cold shoulder .
From a story in today ’s AP , byline Arthur Max :
The U.S. and China have yet to address the critical issue of how to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars needed annually to rescue poor countries from storms , floods and drought that are expected to become more severe as greenhouse gases worsen ... Scientists say the industrial countries must slash carbon emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 below 1990 to prevent the Earth from adding two degrees Centigrade ( 3.6 F ) , the maximum considered safe .
In addition , developing countries need to lower their emissions growth by 15 to 30 percent from business as usual , according to the authoritative U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Some prominent climate scientists are calling for changes in the way research on global warming is conducted after a British university said thousands of private e-mail messages and documents had been stolen from its climate center .
The scientists say that the e-mail messages , which have circulated on the Internet and which disclose the inner workings of a small network of climatologists who chart the planet ’s temperature , have damaged the public ’s trust in the evidence that humans are dangerously warming the planet , just as many countries are poised to start reining in greenhouse gas emissions .
“ This whole concept of , ‘ We ’re the experts , trust us , ’ has clearly gone by the wayside with these e-mails , ” said Judith Curry , a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology .
She and other scientists are seeking more transparency in the way climate data is handled and in the methods used to analyze it .
And they argue that scientists should re-evaluate the selection procedures used by some scientific journals and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the panel that in 2007 concluded that humans were the dominant force driving warming and whose findings underpin international discussions over a new climate treaty .
None of this is settled science , as one would think reading the story in a vacuum .
Indeed , all knowledgeable climate scientists do not say that we must “ slash carbon [ dioxide ] emissions by that amount , as the term “ scientists say , ” implies .
Accuracy requires the story to say , “ some scientists , ” or perhaps even , “ many scientists , say ... ”
And thanks to Climategate , the IPPC is not so authoritative anymore ( if it ever really was ) .
Indeed , Climategate has called the entire field into significant question generally , and the IPCC opinion specifically .
Until the matter is fully investigated — not a quick hearing and a shove under the proverbial rug — climate change hysteria will remain under a cloud that all the media wishful thinking and malpractice will not disperse .
There was a time when the media prided itself on being a skeptical counter weight to the Establishment .
Now , they consider themselves part of the Establishment .
The entire field would be better off if reporters started practicing real journalism again .
And maybe , just maybe , they are starting to do just that .
Today ’s New York Times has a real story about the controversy that actually reports on the importance and meaning of Climategate .
From the story , byline Andrew C. Revkin , : But for alternative media ’s pressure , I doubt this story would be in the paper .
Still , the ice may , at last , be melting .
Real journalism sells papers .
Where the NYT goes , the rest of the MSM tend to follow .

The deadly foam that
has subsided and several hundred birds rescued from the slime are being released .
But the death toll worries conservationists .
More than 10,000 scoters , or seaducks , were killed by the first onslaught of algal foam that hit the Olympic Peninsula in mid-September , said
, marine biologist and seabird specialist at the University of Washington .
That toll -- mostly surf scoters and white - winged scoters -- amounts to 5 percent to 7 percent of their overall numbers on the West Coast , she said .
" That is a pretty significant bite into those species , " Parrish said .
" I do n't think it will knock the population back for years .
But at least with surf scoters -- a species that 's in decline -- conservation scientists are rather concerned about it . "
Parrish estimated that thousands more seabirds , including many red- throated loons , were killed in the second wave of foam off the Long Beach Peninsula about two weeks ago .
The foam was linked to the bloom of a single - cell phytoplankton , or algae , called Akashiwo sanguinea , that has n't posed a problem in the Northwest -- until now .
.
But they suspect that a combination of warm water and low salinity fueled a reproductive frenzy .
Winds blew the bloom towards shore where it was whipped by the surf into sticky foam which stripped vital waterproofing from the seabirds .
Not all the birds died of hypothermia , however .
In fact , about 200 have been released this week by the
north of San Francisco .
" To see them released and returned to the wild is a wonderful feeling for all the volunteers who 've worked so hard to make this happen , " said Paul Kelway , spokesman for the center .
The facility , which usually rescues birds from oil spills , took 450 seabirds off the hands of the
near Astoria , which was overwhelmed with birds from the Long Beach Peninsula .
Almost 100 went to
north of Seattle and another 75 stayed at the facility near Astoria .
" We kept the worst of the birds because they would n't have made it through the trip , " said Sharnelle Fee , director of the Wildlife Center of the North Coast .
Rehabilitating the seabirds has been a multi-step process involving more than 100 volunteers at the three centers .
Initially , they were given warm fluids and food .
Once they gained strength and were stabilized , they were washed in tubs of warm , soapy water .
That step lasts only about 15 minutes , Kelway said .
" The washing process is very stressful for them , " he said .
" Many of these birds have n't seen a human being before so it has to be thorough and quick . "
Once clean , the birds are put in plastic cages with netting on the bottom , giving them a soft surface not unlike the ocean .
Built to live at sea their whole lives , they develop sores and other injuries when forced to stand on hard surfaces .
To dry them , the cages are suspended under pet dryers that circulate warm air .
The birds are then placed in preening pools to finish their rehabilitation .
The Bay Area center could free more birds next week , and the center near Astoria could stage releases as well .
But everything depends on the weather .
The foam has subsided and a big bloom was pushed into the Strait of Juan de Fuca , Parrish said .

Happiness can be elusive when life is too complicated .
As daily commitments multiply , we find ourselves becoming conditioned to shifting between multiple tasks , creating lengthy to - do lists and juggling complicated schedules .
When we ’re not overwhelmed , we may feel proud that we can keep up with it all .
It ’s all part of making a living , but in the end it can stand in the way of making a life .
Does your schedule leave you time for things that bring true happiness ?
These things vary for each of us , but for most people true happiness consists of spending time with loved ones and engaging in activities that reveal the richness and beauty of the world around us .
To get the most out of these activities , you must approach them from a place of stillness , peace and calm .
A busy life can be personally fulfilling , but it may leave you feeling too frazzled to achieve the stillness and peace that will allow you to connect with deep happiness and the underlying beauty of life .
You ca n’t just walk away from the responsibilities that fracture your time , but you can simplify your life so that your mind is calmer and more open to the hidden treasures in life .
Here are 7 ways to get started with simplifying your life and working towards a more peaceful state of mind .
Question your dependence on material possessions .
Recognize the difference between things you need and things you want .
Our culture bombards us with messages about material things that will make our lives better .
The reality is that most of these things will clutter our lives without bringing true happiness .
Free yourself from the culture of excess and learn to be content with fewer possessions and greater simplicity .
Think for yourself .
If you spend your life playing out a role that society or someone else defines , you ’re missing out on the chance to follow your own desires .
Your inner life is diminished when you are limited by conformity .
Why give up your freedom and allow all of your decisions to be defined by what you think you “ should ” do ?
Become a non-conformist and think for yourself , letting your passions be your guide .
Rethink your commitments .
Life is full of opportunities to earn money , give service , learn new skills and make new friends .
Some of us want it all and fill up our calendars with activities and obligations .
Over - committing is the surest way to banish stillness and calm from your life .
Rushing from one activity to another leaves you with no time to slow down , observe and let things happen .
No matter how worthy you think your commitments are , rethink and prioritize them .
Keep the ones that are most important and eliminate the ones that are adding to the hectic pace of your life with little return .
Create more free time .
Once you ’ve balanced your commitments , find ways to increase your free time .
Eliminate time wasters and re-evaluate your chores .
If you spend hours each week cleaning house , see if you can do a little less and have more free time .
Eliminating clutter from your home will make it easier to clean .
Once you ’ve created more free time , fill it with activities that develop your inner self .
Spend some time alone and spend some with the people you care about most .
Focus on calming activities .
Savor the simple pleasures .
How often do you prepare a healthy and delicious meal and then savor every bite of it ?
Instead of rushing through meals , barely tasting what you ’re eating , take time to enjoy them .
Invest time in other simple pleasures – work in your garden , take a relaxing soak in a hot tub or bath , bike or hike through a nature preserve .
Unless you ’re retired , you probably can’t do these things every day , but fitting them into your schedule even once or twice a week will have a calming effect on your life .
Focus on the present moment .
When you ’re over - committed , you can end up rushing from one thing to the next without enjoying or even being very conscious of the world around you .
There ’s always the hope that when things slow down you ’ll have time to enjoy life .
Maybe you look forward to the weekend or an annual vacation , thinking that you ’ll be able to find a way to slow down .
Instead of looking to the future , learn to focus on the present moment .
Enjoy what you ’re doing in the here and now .
You can find serenity in even the most mundane task if you really give it your attention and do it mindfully .
Give up some control .
No matter how much we plan , we can never predict what the future will bring .
Trying to exercise too much control can just lead to frustration , in addition to frustrating the people around you .
Since you never know what the future will bring , it ’s futile to try to control events .
Instead of attempting to control the outcome of events , learn to relax and enjoy the journey .
Letting go of the need to control will give you more freedom to live in the moment .
By planning less , you ’ll be more open to unforeseen opportunities that come your way .
This does n’t mean you should n’t still have goals , but that your focus shifts from the ends to the means .
Remember that simplicity is a process , not a destination .
For most of us , there is no escaping the inherent complexity of our lives .
However , by deciding to simplify your life and spend more time seeking true happiness , you ’ve started on a road that can lead to profound changes in your life .
There is no final destination at the end of this road .
Because life is forever changing and evolving , and you are evolving along with it , you will never reach a point of perfect simplicity and endless happiness .
But each moment you spend on the path to simplicity does have the potential to bring more serenity and happiness into your life .
“ If you want happiness for an hour – take a nap .
If you want happiness for a day – go fishing .
If you want happiness for a month – get married .
If you want happiness for a year – inherit a fortune .
If you want happiness for a lifetime – help someone else . ” – Chinese Proverb

A ground - breaking census of 500 stars , 70 of which are known to host planets , has successfully linked the long - standing " lithium mystery " observed in the Sun to the presence of planetary systems .
Using ESO 's successful HARPS spectrograph , a team of astronomers has found that sun-like stars that host planets have destroyed their lithium much more efficiently than " planet - free " stars .
" For almost 10 years we have tried to find out what distinguishes stars with planetary systems from their barren cousins , " says Garik Israelian , lead author of a paper appearing this week in the journal Nature .
" We have now found that the amount of lithium in Sun - like stars depends on whether or not they have planets . "
Low levels of this chemical element have been noticed for decades in the Sun , as compared to other solar - like stars , and astronomers have been unable to explain the anomaly .
The discovery of a trend among planet - bearing stars provides a natural explanation to this long - standing mystery .
" The explanation of this 60 year - long puzzle is for us rather simple , " adds Israelian .
" The Sun lacks lithium because it has planets . "
This conclusion is based on the analysis of 500 stars , including 70 planet - hosting stars .
Most of these stars were monitored for several years with ESO 's High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher .
This spectrograph , better known as HARPS , is attached to ESO 's 3.6 - metre telescope and is the world 's foremost exoplanet hunter .
" This is the best possible sample available to date to understand what makes planet - bearing stars unique , " says co-author Michel Mayor .
The astronomers looked in particular at Sun - like stars , almost a quarter of the whole sample .
They found that the majority of stars hosting planets possess less than 1 % of the amount of lithium shown by most of the other stars .
" Like our Sun , these stars have been very efficient at destroying the lithium they inherited at birth , " says team member Nuno Santos .
" Using our unique , large sample , we can also prove that the reason for this lithium reduction is not related to any other property of the star , such as its age . "
Unlike most other elements lighter than iron , the light nuclei of lithium , beryllium and boron are not produced in significant amounts in stars .
Instead , it is thought that lithium , composed of just three protons and four neutrons , was mainly produced just after the Big Bang , 13.7 billion years ago .
Most stars will thus have the same amount of lithium , unless this element has been destroyed inside the star .
This result also provides the astronomers with a new , cost - effective way to search for planetary systems : by checking the amount of lithium present in a star astronomers can decide which stars are worthy of further significant observing efforts .
Now that a link between the presence of planets and curiously low levels of lithium has been established , the physical mechanism behind it has to be investigated .
" There are several ways in which a planet can disturb the internal motions of matter in its host star , thereby rearrange the distribution of the various chemical elements and possibly cause the destruction of lithium .
It is now up to the theoreticians to figure out which one is the most likely to happen , " concludes Mayor .
The team is composed of Garik Israelian , Elisa Delgado Mena , Carolina Domínguez Cerdeña , and Rafael Rebolo ( Instituto de Astrofisíca de Canarias , La Laguna , Tenerife , Spain ) , Nuno Santos and Sergio Sousa ( Centro de Astrofisica , Universidade de Porto , Portugal ) , Michel Mayor and Stéphane Udry ( Observatoire de Genève , Switzerland ) , and Sofia Randich ( INAF , Osservatorio di Arcetri , Firenze , Italy ) .
Pedicab driver Kate Altermatt still can't believe the driver of a Mercedes did n't see her pedaling down Northwest Fourth Avenue last Easter .
Altermatt , who is 6 feet tall , was wearing a bright orange bunny suit , and the Cascadia Pedicab was lit up with reflectors and a blinking red light .
" I was very visible , " she said .
The crash sent her flying and totaled the pedicab .
She lay stunned on the pavement for a minute , then walked over to the driver 's side window .
She said she smelled alcohol on his breath .
" He was like '$ 100 ! $ 100 and I leave , ' " Altermatt recalled .
" And I was like , no .
I started screaming .
I said ' You 're drunk !
You 're going to go to jail !
I do n't want your money ! ' "
Wednesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court , Altermatt finally got to confront the driver , who testified that he did n't see the pedicab because he was fumbling for a dropped cell phone .
After a daylong trial , Judge Karin Immergut found Edward Cespedes - Rodriguez guilty of hit - and - run driving for leaving the scene of the crash .
But Immergut cleared the 34 - year - old Southwest Portland man of recklessly endangering another person .
That disappointed Altermatt , who testified that Cespedes - Rodriguez looked her in the eye and intentionally hit her a second time as he sped away sometime after 2 a.m. April 12 .
Altermatt said a second pedicab operator tried to get Cespedes - Rodriguez to step out of his car .
Instead , Altermatt said , the driver jerked the car into reverse and backed half a block onto Davis Street .
She said she and the other pedicab driver , Damon Kelly , managed to step in front of the car , and that 's when Cespedes - Rodriguez stepped on the gas .
Altermatt testified that she rolled over the hood of the car , later suffering soreness to her head , shoulder and thigh and a jammed finger .
She also said that Kelly , who did n't appear in court to testify , rolled over the hood , too .
In the process , he must have cracked the windshield with the brass knuckles he was carrying for protection .
Defense attorney David Lesh tried to discredit Altermatt 's testimony by questioning why Kelly did n't appear in court to testify .
Portland police Officer Susan Abrahamson said she wrote in her report that Kelly told her he was n't struck by the car , but that he hit the car as it was leaving the scene .
Lesh accused Kelly of bashing Cespedes - Rodriguez 's car , causing $ 5,000 worth of damage .
Lesh argued that his client had to choose between two evils -- sticking around to exchange information or fleeing for his own safety .
In the end , the judge agreed , saying the dents and cracked windshield must have been caused by someone purposely striking the car .
But the judge said Cespedes - Rodriguez could still have stopped his car at a safe distance and notified the police .
He faces a penalty ranging from probation to up to one year in jail when sentenced next month .
Cespedes - Rodriguez was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in 2005 , but he entered a diversion program that required treatment , and a judge dismissed the case in 2006 .
Prosecutors did n't charge Cespedes - Rodriguez with drunken driving for the April 2009 crash .
Deputy district attorney Michael Schmidt said Cespedes - Rodriguez twice dodged the attempts of police to contact him later on the day of the crash , so no alcohol test could be taken .
Authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in June .
" He hit somebody .
He panicked because he was worried he was under the influence of alcohol , " Schmidt said .
Altermatt said pursuing criminal charges against Cespedes - Rodriguez has been a struggle from the beginning .
After the incident , when she ran to a nearby Portland police officer , she said , he dismissed her pleas for help .
Perhaps , she thinks , because she was wearing a bunny suit .
About 45 minutes after the incident , she found another cop , who took a report .
Altermatt said the reason she pressed for prosecution was because she felt that Cespedes - Rodriguez treated her like a piece of garbage -- something that could be run over without another thought .
" This is probably the worst thing that has happened to me - being intentionally run over by a car .
I felt like a Burger King bag . "

A Bangladeshi farmer shows the effects of arsenic poisoning
Man -made ponds may be responsible for widespread arsenic contamination of ground water affecting millions of people in Bangladesh , a new study says .
According to the journal " Nature Geoscience " , the ponds have become a dumping ground for debris which releases arsenic into ground water .
Around 25 m people in the country have been exposed to arsenic through water .
Experts have described the situation as the worst mass poisoning of a population in history .
Man -made ponds - often dug with the help of international aid agencies - were originally created to protect villagers from unclean water .
The arsenic enters water supplies from agricultural and industrial waste or from natural deposits in the ground .
Around two million people in Bangladesh suffer from arsenic poisoning .
Chronic ingestion of small doses has been linked to cancer of the bladder , kidney , lung or skin , while large doses can kill immediately .
Arsenic contamination of ground water is a global problem and has occurred in other countries such as Argentina , Chile , China , India , Mexico , Taiwan , Thailand and the United States .
But the gravity of the contamination in Bangladesh is unprecedented .
Millions of Bangladeshis knowingly poison themselves because there is often no alternative water source .
Harvard scientist and co-author of the study Rebecca Neumann said that arsenic contamination could be avoided by digging deeper drinking water wells below the ponds , AFP news reported .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev inspects a piece of equipment at a facility in Fryazino , outside Moscow , Wednesday , Oct. 28 , 2009 .
Medvedev urged his government to find resources for building a prospective nuclear - powered spaceship .
( AP Photo / RIA Novosti , Vladimir Rodionov , Presidential Press Service )
( AP ) -- Russia should build a new nuclear - powered spaceship for prospective manned missions to Mars and other planets , the nation 's space chief said Thursday .
Anatoly Perminov first proposed building the ship at a government meeting Wednesday but did n't explain its purpose .
President Dmitry Medvedev backed the project and urged the government to find the money .
In remarks posted Thursday on his agency 's Web site , Perminov said the nuclear spaceship should be used for human flights to Mars and other planets .
He said the project is challenging technologically , but could capitalize on the Soviet and Russian experience in the field .
Perminov said the preliminary design could be ready by 2012 , and then it would take nine more years and cost 17 billion rubles ( about $ 600 million , or euro400 million ) to build the ship .
" The project is aimed at implementing large - scale space exploration programs , including a manned mission to Mars , interplanetary travel , the creation and operation of planetary outposts , " Perminov 's Web statement said .
The ambitious plans contrast with Russia 's slow progress on building a replacement to its mainstay spacecraft - the Soyuz .
Russia is using Soyuz booster rockets and capsules , developed 40 years ago , to send crews to the International Space Station .
The development of a replacement rocket and a prospective spaceship with a conventional propellant has dragged on with no end in sight .
Despite its continuing reliance on the old technology , Russia stands to take a greater role in space exploration in the coming years .
NASA 's plan to retire its shuttle fleet next year will force the United States and other nations to rely on the Russian spacecraft to ferry their astronauts to and from the International Space Station until NASA 's new manned ship becomes available .
Perminov said the new nuclear - powered ship should have a megawatt - class nuclear reactor , as opposed to small nuclear reactors that powered some Soviet military satellites .
The Cold War-era Soviet spy satellites had reactors that produced just a few kilowatts of power and had a life span of about a year .
Igor Lisov , a Moscow - based expert on Russian space program , said the prospective ship would use a nuclear reactor to run an electric rocket engine .
" It will be quite efficient for flight to Mars , " he told The Associated Press on Thursday .
Lisov said Soviet work on a nuclear - powered electric rocket engine dates back to the 1960s when Soviet engineers began developing plans for a manned flight to Mars .
He said Russia 's experience in building nuclear - powered satellites would also help develop the new spaceship .
" It will require a significantly more powerful nuclear reactor , but the task is quite realistic , " Lisov said .
Stanley Borowski , a senior engineer at NASA specializing in nuclear rocket engines , said they have many advantages for deep space missions , such as to take astronauts and gear to Mars .
In deep space , nuclear rockets are twice as fuel - efficient as conventional rockets , he said .
NASA has used small amounts of plutonium in deep space probes , including those to Jupiter , Saturn , Pluto and heading out of the solar system .
The only planetary mission currently considered by Russia is a plan to send a probe to one of Mars ' twin moons , Phobos .
It was set to launch this year , but was delayed .

One of the City 's leading figures has suggested that inequality created by bankers ' huge salaries is a price worth paying for greater prosperity .
In remarks that will fuel the row around excessive pay , Lord Griffiths , vice - chairman of Goldman Sachs International and a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher , said banks should not be ashamed of rewarding their staff .
Speaking to an audience at St Paul 's Cathedral in London about morality in the marketplace last night , Griffiths said the British public should " tolerate the inequality as a way to achieve greater prosperity for all " .
He added that he knew what inequality felt like after spending his childhood in a mining town in Wales .
Both his grandfathers were miners who had to retire from work through injury .
With public anger mounting at the forecast of bumper bonuses for bankers only a year after the industry was rescued by the taxpayer , he said bankers ' bonuses should be seen as part of a longer - term investment in Britain 's economy .
" I believe that we should be thinking about the medium - term common good , not the short - term common good ...
We should not , therefore , be ashamed of offering compensation in an internationally competitive market which ensures the bank businesses here and employs British people , " he said .
Griffiths said that many banks would relocate abroad if the government cracked down on bonus culture .
" If we said we 're not going to have as big bonuses or the same bonuses as last year , I think then you 'd find that lots of City firms could easily hive off their operations to Switzerland or the far east , " he said .
Goldman Sachs is currently on track to pay the biggest ever bonuses to its 31,700 employees after raking in profits at a rate of $ 35 m ( £ 21 m ) a day .
The Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) said today that City bonuses could soar to £ 6bn this year .
The chairman of the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , Lord Turner , who was also present at the meeting , called once again for a global tax on financial transactions .
He said that such a so - called " Tobin tax " could redistribute bank profits to help fight world poverty and climate change .
" The role of regulation is to bring a concordance between private actions and beneficial results , " he said .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating how an international flight into Atlanta 's major airport landed on a taxiway instead of a runway early Monday .
The pilots of the plane that landed at the Atlanta airport have been relieved from flying duties pending probes .
FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Delta Flight 60 , from Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to Atlanta 's Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport , was cleared to land about 6:05 a.m. Monday on Runway 27 R but landed instead on Taxiway M , which runs parallel to the runway .
The flight had 194 passengers and crew aboard , according to CNN affiliate WXIA .
No other aircraft were on the taxiway , and there was no damage to either the taxiway or the plane , a Boeing 767 , Bergen said .
A runway or taxiway collision , particularly with one plane preparing to take off and carrying a full fuel load , would be catastrophic .
Bergen said she is n't sure whether or when other aircraft have ever landed on the taxiway at Hartsfield .
Both Runway 27 R and Taxiway M are 11,890 feet long , Bergen said , but the runway is marked with white lights while the taxiway is marked with blue lights .
Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the airline is cooperating with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board in their investigation , as well as conducting an internal investigation .
The pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations , Black said .
Bergen and Black said a medical emergency was reported on the plane , but neither offered any details .
The incursion came just two weeks after the FAA announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent from the year that ended September 30 , 2008 , over the year ending on the same date this year .
The FAA said there were 12 serious incursions in 2009 and 25 in 2008 .
Only two of the serious incursions involved commercial airliners in 2009 , compared with nine in 2008 .
The FAA defines a serious incursion as one in which a collision is narrowly avoided , or there was a significant potential for collision that resulted in the need to take quick corrective action .

Season Four of The Venture Bros . has been a time of amusing transition for most of the cast , and Number 21 has undergone arguably the funniest metamorphosis of the bunch .
Distraught over his longtime friend Number 24's violent death at the end of last season 's brilliant finale , he's now honed himself into the perfect henchmen , developing a rock hard physique and whipping the rest of the Monarch 's goons into a well disciplined army .
Or , as he describes to Hank and Dean in this latest episode , picture him " as if his bottom half is a horse , and on top he 's Sin-Eater , " or even " Wolverine with Batwings . "
Of course , he still has the crackling voice of an adolescent and some ridiculously geeky interests .
" Return to Malice " details Number 21 's transformation as well as his quest to kidnap the Venture boys and interrogate them about their roles in Number 24's death .
His main interrogation technique involves Chinese Water Torture , but as it turns out , that tactic is n't at all as effective as one would think .
His abduction of the boys also runs in the face of the League of Calamitous Intent 's strict regulations , which causes Sergeant Hatred and Dr. Venture to enlist Dr. / Mrs. Girlfriend to help them get the boys back safely .
Plenty of hilarity ensues from there .
But the episode 's biggest draw is definitely Number 21 , who has been a fan - favorite ever since he stepped into the series ' forefront alongside Number 24 .
We 've seen him in the periphery of most this season 's episodes , showing off his new physique , adventuring with his LARP club , " The Orchard Street Wolfpack , " and mourning the death of his friend .
" Return to Malice " is the episode that connects all those dots in hilarious fashion , and it's great to get a full picture of the character 's new status quo .
Whether he 's speaking to Number 24's skull like some henchmen Hamlet , plotting against the Ventures , podcasting his life story , turning himself into a fierce warrior or pushing around the rest of The Monarch 's goons , I found myself smiling whenever he was on the screen .
The character also delivered some big laughs , such as his discovery of Dean 's morning wood or his ill - conceived dart - gun salute to 24 .
After spending most of this season on the sidelines , The Monarch himself also enjoys some time in the spotlight .
With an upcoming feature spread and interview in Villain 's Monthly magazine right around the corner , The Monarch has an allergic reaction to a " fancy salad " and watches his face blow up to a hideous , swollen mess .
As always , watching the Monarch 's insecurities manifest themselves made for some great scenes , but I think I laughed the hardest during his interaction with Hank and Dean . " Return to Malice " is n't the season 's best episode by a long shot .
That distinction easily goes to last week 's " Perchance to Dean . "
However , the episode does make for a great character showcase and is packed with a number of highly amusing moments , such as Sergeant Hatred 's discovery of his ex-wife 's new kinky love life , the revelation of how he got the job as the Venture 's bodyguard , and all the aforementioned gems .
Though it does n't quite put everything together into a complete deranged masterpiece as the series has done so often in the past , I 'd still call " Return to Malice " a hit , even if it 's not one of the show 's greatest .

20 Things I Like About the Droid
by phil on Friday Nov 20 , 2009 3:31 AM
I 'm an iPhone developer based in Austin , TX who has had apps on the App Store since Day One .
With the mounting negative buzz about the iPhone ( like Joe Hewitt quitting the iPhone ) and the glowing reviews of the Droid ( like from Michael Arrington of TechCrunch ) , I decided to switch my main phone to a Droid .
It also helps that clients have been begging me to make Android apps .
I 'm still developing primarily for the iPhone , but I love the Droid ( and implicitly Android ) now .
I do n't see why Android can't be The Next Big Thing .
I 've been keeping track of the little things ( and sometimes big things ) that I like about it .
I 'm sure this list will keep expanding :
I like ...
( Droid - Specific )
the physical keyboard
the built - in sounds ... esp. the " Drrooid " sound .
that my camera has a flash
the little flashing light at the top when there 's a new notification
the rubber backing
the style of the hardware — more modern , more masculine .
the abundance of apps that modify fundamental phone behavior , like blocking / routing calls , upgrading voicemail
Google Sky ( Android only )
that when I plug in the USB , my computer does n't have a mini seizure ( instead I choose to mount the drive )
that my camera app has built - in digicam settings , like white balance , color effects , etc .
the " SD Card " file management , as opposed to the walled garden of iTunes
that my browser remembers my passwords ( w/o having to download a separate app )
having a separate Gmail app with tray notifications
the tray notification system ( a major improvement over apple 's icon number notifications )
widgets ( weather , calendar )
the clarity of surfing the web with bigger screen resolution
the white text on black background styling — seems more modern
that I have a free Car Nav system now
that everybody 's Google Talk icons are associated with my contacts
that everything " just works " with my Googlized digital life
Comments
In many ways , the things I like about the Droid are the same things you 'd like about having a jailbroken iPhone .
There 's , of course , many negative things about the Droid , but I 'm not trying to make a balanced review here .
Here 's my executive summary :
The Droid has next year 's tech , but lacks Apple 's polish .
Roger von Oech said on November 20 , 2009 6:37 PM :
21 . The opportunities for creating new apps for the Droid marketplace .
22 . Not having to deal with the iPhone approval process .
Christian said on November 23 , 2009 1:12 AM :
23 . Multi-tasking
24 . Higher - res videos thanks to the higher resolution
25 . Torrents
26 . No iTunes
Can Hulu , Twitter and porn destroy Wall Street ?
P2P traffic uses the most bandwidth
Policing the internet
Shutting down websites
( Natural News )
The US government has issued a new report that recommends blocking access to popular websites during a pandemic outbreak in order to preserve internet bandwidth for investors , day traders and securities clearing house operations .
The concern is that a pandemic would cause too many people to stay at home and download YouTube videos and porn , hogging all the internet bandwidth and blocking throughput for investment activities , thereby causing a stock market meltdown .
This is n't an April Fool 's joke .
It 's all based on a public report issued by the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) , available from their website at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d108.pdf
In this article , I 'm going to explain how a pandemic outbreak could theoretically bring down Wall Street .
But to get to that , you 'll first need to find out what the GAO said in its curious report ( see below ) .
Parts of this article are presented as satire , but the underlying facts quoted here are all true and verifiable ( links are provided to all sources ) .
This report in question is entitled , " GAO , INFLUENZA PANDEMIC " and includes this subtitle :
As the report explains : To translate this concern of the GAO , what they 're saying is that if too many people stay home and use the internet , Wall Street might not be able to function smoothly .
Therefore , in order to protect Wall Street ( because as you know , our government does everything possible to bail out Wall Street ) , the feds might need to shut down some popular websites .
But where , exactly , is all the bandwidth usage really coming from ?
Twitter uses virtually no bandwidth , given that it's a short , text - based messaging service .
Text articles also do n't use up much bandwidth .
In terms of clogging the internet 's " series of tubes " ( to use a hilarious term coined by a U.S. Senator ) , the real culprits are .
While a Twitter text message might be less than 1 k in size , a typical video is 350MB , or roughlythan a Twitter message .
So where , exactly , are people getting video downloads ?
The most popular non-porn video destinations today are MySpaceTV.com , YouTube.com , LiveLeak.com , Yahoo Video and Hulu.com .
But as it turns out , even these highly popular websites may not account for most internet traffic .
According to this TechRepublic post ( http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/tech-news/... ) , the majority of internet traffic is actually .
Anywhere from 49 to 89 percent of all internet traffic reportedly falls into this category .
P2P traffic means " peer to peer . "
It 's file - sharing traffic happening between two " peered " computers rather than from one central server to many individual computers .
YouTube , for example , is a centralized video site that serves videos directly to millions of computers .
The Pirate Bay , on the other hand ( www.ThePirateBay.org ) is a site that lists links to peer - to - peer sharing files so that individual computer users can share files amongst each other , bypassing centralized websites or file servers .
Peer - to - peer traffic carries the latest movies , music albums , television shows , ebooks , podcasts , graphic novels and even ... yes ... porn .
A search on The Pirate Bay today shows downloads for ( 350 MB ) , the new Bruce Willis movie ( 700 MB ) and even a bootleg version of the new Windows 7 operating system ( 3.5 GB ) .
These files are obviously not small .
When peered computers share these files , it requires a tremendous amount of bandwidth .
Porn represents a sizable percentage of all P2P traffic .
Although " official " statistics were difficult to find , according to TopTenReviews.com ( http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.... ) , internet pornography revenues in the U.S. were $ 2.8 billion ( 2006 ) .
There are 4.2 million porn websites on the 'net , and 25 % of all search engine requests are porn-related .
Importantly , this page claims that Where am I going with all this ?
Well , if you consider that roughly 50 % of all internet traffic is P2P , and that roughly one - third of all P2P traffic is porn , then it quickly becomes obvious that if the GAO 's pandemic clogging of the internet becomes a reality , What this also means , however , is that cutting off access to specific websites ( like YouTube ) will likely do very little to free up internet bandwidth .
To have any real impact on reducing bandwidth usage , the U.S. government would need to run public service ads begging internet users to The problem with that approach is that people who pirate porn are probably not the kind of people who obediently follow the advice of the feds .
When it comes to saving Wall Street during a pandemic , the feds will stop at nothing .
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) pulls out all the stops to make sure America 's legalized financial gambling centers ( Wall Street ) keep on churning out the scams .
This requires protecting the critical infrastructure of Wall Street .
As the GAO report explains :
The internet will be critical during a pandemic , the report goes on to say , because it will be an important vehicle for the government to distribute messages to the public ( such as " Go get your vaccines ... " or " Report to the nearest quarantine center " ) .
It will also be important because millions of people might need to continue their work at home rather than showing up at the office and sneezing all over their coworkers .
The solutions , says the GAO , is to tell companies to send workers home and hope they get something done there : " Furthermore , the government has recommended teleworking as an option for businesses to keep operations running during a pandemic .
" This part of the GAO report is particularly hilarious because , as every employer knows , when you give employees the ability to work from home , many of them spend the day at home goofing off and It 's true :
Most internet porn surfing activity occurs ( 9 to 5 ) , and all those corporate porn filters that people have at work do n't exist on their home computers .
By sending employees home , companies will only be adding to the congestion of the internet , creating an even larger problem for Wall Streeters who are trying to extort yet more taxpayer dollars from the federal government to cover their failed investment gambles .
Now here 's the kicker in all this : " According to a DHS study and Internet providers , this additional pandemic - related traffic is likely to exceed the capacity of Internet providers ' network infrastructure in metropolitan residential Internet access networks .
... During a pandemic , congestion is most likely to occur in the traffic to or from the aggregation devices that serve residential neighborhoods , interfering with teleworkers ' and others ' ability to use the Internet .
"
In other words , all that pandemic porn downloading will bring the internet to its knees .
The internet really begins to get jammed up at the " 40 % absenteeism " level , according to a 2007 DHS study mentioned in this GAO report :
" The study 's model predicted that at the 40 percent absenteeism level -- the level that health organizations have indicated is likely under a relatively serious pandemic -- the highest point of congestion across the entire Internet infrastructure could occur within residential Internet access networks .
"
Unfortunately for Wall Street , there is no way for anyone to tell the difference between the traffic of a porn downloader vs. the traffic of a Wall Street day trader .
On the internet , all packets are ( nearly ) the same priority .
So there 's no simple way to prioritize traffic from some users ( " important " Wall Street people ) over other users .
That means " porn packets " can't simply be rejected in favor of " Wall Street packets .
"
Even the GAO concedes that shutting down specific websites is a strategy fraught with problems , including potential lawsuits , technology limitations and the fact that blocking a few websites probably would n't result in much of an overall reduction in traffic anyway :
A better solution , it seems , would be to just urge people to stop using so much bandwidth .
As this GAO report suggests , " ... entities in these sectors consider advising employees to limit household use of streaming video or other bandwidth - intensive Internet activities .
" And that , of course , takes us back to those public service announcements :
Please stop downloading porn , you people !
You 're sucking up all the bandwidth and interfering with the important business of Wall Street ripping off America !
This brings me to the bizarre conclusion of this story :
If a pandemic actually does result in a 40 % absenteeism rate , and companies send people to work from home , and all public sporting events get cancelled , and people are sitting around on their home computers with nothing to do , by interfering with securities trades .
More importantly , .
" Porn terrorists " could leap on this pandemic - inspired internet vulnerability to cripple Wall Street by flooding the internet with pornographic digital bits that squeeze out all other traffic , causing financial trades to grind to a halt .
And this , in turn , could conceivably wreck the entire U.S. economy because , as we already know , the whole thing is being held together by the most fragile accounting illusions .
One big blip in the system , and the whole corrupt , dishonest Wall Street scam comes train - wrecking down .
And that , my friends , is the bizarre truth of how pornography combined with a pandemic might bring down Wall Street .

Never before has such attention been focused on the click of a mouse .
Yesterday , the click in question started up the biggest , most complicated machine in the world , the $ 10 bn Large Hadron Collider , which was put through its paces for the first time at Cern , the European nuclear research organisation in Geneva .
The man with his finger on the button was Lyn Evans , a Welsh engineer who has devoted 14 years of his life to the machine .
The moment came at 8.32 am UK time and was broadcast around the world , and via videolink to more than 300 journalists who had descended on the laboratory to witness the event .
The LHC lies 100 metres beneath fields and farmland , where it occupies a 17 - mile ( 27 km ) circular tunnel carved through rock and sandstone .
When it is working at full speed , it will be the most powerful particle collider on the planet .
Inside , it will crash subatomic particles together with enough energy to re-create the intense conditions that existed one trillionth of a second after the big bang .
Yesterday , the scientists ' ambitions were more modest .
Before the machine can be put to work , its makers had to take it for a test drive .
The goal was to send beams of protons around the collider 's hollow ring in both directions , to make sure there were no obstructions and to check that powerful superconducting magnets surrounding the ring can steer the beams with exquisite precision .
When Cern attempted this on an older , less powerful collider in 1996 , it found two beer bottles stuck inside the ring .
Yesterday , the tests went more smoothly than many scientists dared hope for .
At 9.28 am UK time , two spots flickered on to a screen in the control room , one spot caused by the beam on the way in , the other as it completed its first lap .
Cheering , relieved scientists clapped and slapped each other on the back .
The test had taken less than one hour .
" My first thought was one of relief .
I 'm too preoccupied at the moment to have emotions , " said Evans , who later confessed to laying a bet with fellow physicist Steve Meyers , head of Cern 's accelerator and beam operations , that he could get the beam to circulate within an hour .
Moments after the test was declared successful , scientists in the control room cracked open bottles of champagne .
Verena Kain , a physicist on the machine , said : " I did n't believe it , I had to see it a second time .
Everybody is just floating right now .
It 's a first step , but it 's fantastic it works so well . "
By 2 pm UK time , the scientists had sent a beam of protons around the machine in the opposite , anticlockwise direction to the first beam .
David Evans , a physicist from the University of Birmingham , who works on one of the machine 's giant detectors , said : " It 's gone so well I 'm optimistic we can probably do low - energy collisions within days .
We could be looking at high - energy collisions within weeks . "
Now the real work begins .
Scientists will spend the coming days and weeks fine - tuning the machine and testing the four huge detectors , which will sift through the subatomic debris of the collisions for evidence of new physics .
Tejinder Virdee , a physicist at Imperial College London and head of one of the LHC 's detector groups , said : " With the LHC , we will be able to look deeper into matter , and look further back in time than ever before .
" Particle physics is a modern name for the centuries - old effort to understand the laws of nature . "
Within weeks , the machine could produce particles of dark matter , a mysterious substance that stretches through the universe and clings around galaxies .
The discovery would be profound .
Astronomers know that normal matter , the stuff of stars and planets , makes up only 5 % of the observable universe .
Dark matter accounts for a further 25 % , with the remaining 70 % being the even more exotic dark energy , which drives the expansion of the cosmos .
By creating a microcosm of the big bang , scientists hope the machine will explain how the forces of nature became what they are today .
The machine will also hunt the famed Higgs boson , or " God particle " .
Named after Peter Higgs , an Edinburgh University physicist , the Higgs boson is crucial to understanding the origin of mass .
Cern thought it had caught a glimpse of the Higgs particle before with its previous particle collider in 2000 .
It will now race against scientists at the American Fermilab , near Chicago , which is working around the clock to discover the particle first .
" This is a unique machine and it will certainly advance the knowledge of mankind .
But we also know that pushing technology to the limit always has spinoffs .
We do n't know what the LHC will bring apart from wonderful science , but we 're already working on a far more powerful system than the internet .
Where we lead , others will follow , " said Evans .

Yes , you read the headline correctly , convenience store chain 7 - Eleven is rolling out their own wines , appropriately priced at $ 3.99 a bottle .
I wonder if it would be considered uncouth to drink 7 - Eleven brand wine with an extra-long Slurpee straw .
I also would like to know if it can be quaffed from a 64 ounce Super Big Gulp cup .

Selenium helps prevent cancer
( Natural News )
The CSPI is reportedly suing Bayer over the company 's claims that thein its " One - A - Day " multivitamin formula helps prevent prostate cancer ( http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/id... ) .
It 's rare to see NaturalNews actually siding with Bayer on anything , but in this case , I think it 's worth pointing out that selenium is , indeed , a very helpful nutrient for preventing cancer ( see below ) .
While I personally do n't consume or recommend anything from Bayer ( and certainly not their multivitamin formula ) , I think it 's important to bring you these quotes about the anti-cancer properties of selenium , a trace mineral lacking in the diets of many .
( By the way , one of the top sources for organic selenium is . )
Selenium inhibits cancer growth in animals .
Low soil levels of selenium ( probably associated with low dietary intake ) , have been associated with increased cancer incidence in humans .
Blood levels of selenium have been reported to be low in patients with many cancers , including lung cancer .
In preliminary reports , people with the lowest blood levels of selenium had between 3.8 and 5.8 times the risk of dying from cancer compared with those who had the highest selenium levels .
Larry Clark presented evidence that supplemental selenium could reduce cancer death rates by as much as 50 % .
1,312 patients were given 200 mcg. of selenium daily .
The patients receiving selenium had a rise of 67 % in their blood selenium level .
The patients receiving selenium had a 67 % decrease in cancer of the prostate , a 58 percent decrease in colon or rectal cancer and a 45 % decrease in lung cancer .
This suggests that possibly up to 100,000 lives a year might be saved in the USA by the simple addition of selenium to the diet .
Why Does This Happen ?
Selenium is needed by important immune system cells known as T cells .
Selenium helps the T cells produce cytokines , which are used as messengers between and inside the cells .
Adequate selenium may be needed to increase resistance to HIV infection .
Selenium is also needed by white blood cells to fight microorganisms .
Low dietary intakes of selenium may make people more vulnerable to Keshan disease .
Keshan disease can cause heart problems .
Excesses of selenium create methylated selenium in the body .
Taking 200 micrograms of selenium daily for about seven years reduced the occurrence of all cancers in a group of 1,300 older people by 42 percent and cancer deaths by nearly 50 percent compared with those on a sugar pill or placebo .
Selenium had the greatest impact on prostate cancer , slashing occurrence by 69 percent .
Selenium also decreased rates of colorectal cancer 64 percent and lung cancer 39 percent .
Recent large scale studies in Linxian , China found reduced risk of cancer when selenium supplements were given to those living in selenium - deficient areas .
Other studies have shown that selenium supplements protect against some types of cancer such as rectal , ovarian , colon , lung and cervical cancers .
However , there are also studies , including the Harvard Nurses Health Study which do not show a protective role for selenium against cancers at any major site .
Laboratory studies have shown that selenium can slow tumor cell growth .
People with AIDS tend to have low levels of selenium .
That shortage puts a stress on the immune system , because selenium is needed to avoid oxidative stress .
Selenium should be taken with other major antioxidants to optimize immune function .
Several studies have shown that low levels of selenium are associated with an increased risk of cancer .
This is especially true for stomach , esophageal , colon , rectal , and prostate cancers .
Interestingly , garlic , onions , broccoli , and whole grains are recommended to prevent cancer , and all of them are good sources of selenium .
Selenium has been studied to determine its role in both the causation and the prevention of cancer .
The epidemiological evidence is derived from a few geographical correlation studies , which have shown that the risk of cancer is inversely related to estimates of per capita selenium intake , selenium levels in blood specimens , or selenium concentrations in water supplies .
It is not clear whether this relationship applies to all types of cancer or only to cancer at specific sites such as the gastrointestinal tract .
Patients with malignant neoplasms had low selenium levels , whereas healthy controls and those with precancerous lesions both had higher selenium levels .
These results suggest the need for longer treatment periods with selenium .
Steady supplementation with selenium - enriched yeast may have allowed for a more rapid increase in maintenance of higher selenium levels .
I conclude that these are encouraging results demonstrating the effect of selenium therapy in the treatment of precancerous dysplastic lesions of the oral cavity .
Although most people get enough selenium from their diet , the soils in some areas of the country are low in this mineral .
Evidence suggests that selenium supplements may protect against some forms of cancer .
What is the Scientific Evidence for Selenium ?
Selenium in supplement form has been associated with a lower risk of cancers of the prostate , colorectal , and lung , as well as a substantial reduction in cancer deaths .
Dietary sources of selenium are associated with a lower risk for cancers of the esophagus and stomach .
In areas of China with high rates of hepatitis B and primary liver cancer , epidemiological surveys demonstrated that high levels of dietary selenium reduce liver cancer incidence and hepatitis B infection .
Animal studies showed that selenium supplementation reduced hepatitis B infection by 77.2 % and precancerous liver lesions by 75.8 % ( Yu et al. 1997 ) .
In an 8 - year follow - up trial in 130,471 Chinese , those who were given a selenium - spiked table salt showed a 35.1 % reduction in primary liver cancer , compared with the group given salt without the added selenium .
We know that when animals are given foods with selenium compounds added to them and then given a chemical that causes colon cancer , there are fewer polyps and pre-cancerous cells in the selenium - fed animals .
Adults with low blood plasma selenium levels are 3 - 4 times more likely to develop one or more adenomatous polyps .
Vitamin C appears to work synergistically with selenium in this regard .
Selenium , an essential trace mineral and vital antioxidant , works synergistically with vitamin E .
One study concludes that supplemental beta- carotene and selenium enhanced immune function in a healthy elderly group .
Dozens of animal and in vitro studies point to selenium in the prevention and treatment of cancer .
A review article cites many epidemiological studies showing a significant inverse relationship between selenium intake and human cancer risk .
Most recently , research has proven a role for selenium in the prevention of colon cancer .
Several studies have shown that selenium possesses definite anticancer characteristics .
Some suspect that among other things , selenium helps out by slowing down cancer at its very earliest stages , permitting cells to heal themselves before they are taken over by the cancer process .
In any event , several highly respected researchers have repeatedly shown that when laboratory animals are injected with cancer cells , supplementing their diet with a little extra selenium substantially lowers the subsequent tumor rate .
Epidemiological studies suggest that the risk of cancer is reduced in areas where the soil is high in selenium .
Blood samples taken from large groups of people also show that they are more likely to develop cancer if they have low blood levels of selenium and the antioxidant selenium - containing enzyme , glutathione peroxidase .
Low serum , dietary and soil selenium levels are particularly associated with lung , gastrointestinal tract and prostate cancers .
Selenium may be most effective when combined with vitamin E.Cancer rates drop as selenium is added to the diet .
Selenium stops all phases of the cancer cascade .
Selenium stops initiation by increasing adaptability at the cellular and humoral levels , protecting the DNA from disruption by chemical carcinogens , and by stopping viral oncogenesis .
Selenium disrupts cancer promotion by working as an antioxidant , an enzyme nourisher , and an immune system strengthener .
In addition , selenium has been shown to depress the growth rate of established tumors .
Organically grown foods have much more selenium than foods raised with chemical fertilizers .
Selenium has also induced " apoptosis " ( programmed cell death ) in cancer cells .
A recent double - blind study following over 1,300 people found that those given 200 mcg of yeast - based selenium per day for 7 years had a 50 % drop in the cancer death rate compared with the placebo group .
Another recent trial found that men exposed to the most dietary selenium ( as indirectly measured by toenail selenium levels ) developed 65 % less advanced prostate cancer than did men with the lowest levels of selenium .
Selenium is also essential for healthy immune functioning .
To lower the risk of developing liver cancer , take 150 micrograms of selenium ( any form except selenomethionine ) daily on an ongoing basis .
A clinical trial in China involving over 100,000 people found that taking supplemental selenium reduced the rate of liver cancer by 35 percent over an eight - year period .
When the selenium supplement was discontinued , liver cancer rates began to rise again .
Selenium is especially helpful for people infected with hepatitis B. Smoking , drinking , and inadequate vitamin A intake increase the risk of liver cancer in people infected with hepatitis B .
Since emerging from an era of colonialism under Italy and Britain , Somalia has passed through military dictatorship , famine , and civil war to regional fragmentation .
In the modern period , Americans best remember the loss of U.S. military personnel that followed attempts to secure order in the country as part of a United Nations operation .
More recently , the hijacking of ships by pirates operating from the Somali coast has attracted considerable attention globally .
But the biggest threat emanating from Somalia comes from a different source :
An ongoing lack of internal order has left the country vulnerable to the rise of hard - line Islamist groups , of which the latest is Al - Shabaab ( the youth ) , which rose from obscurity to international prominence in less than two years .
Al - Shabaab 's ideological commitment to global jihadism , its connections to Al - Qaeda , its military capabilities , and its ability to capture and control territory suggest that it will continue to pose a strategic challenge to both the U.S. and Somalia 's neighbors .
Aden Hashi Ayro , an Al - Shabaab leader , was believed to have a strong relationship with Al - Qaeda .
After his death by a U.S. airstrike , Al - Shabaab posted a biography of him , claiming " he fought under the supervision of Al - Qaeda , and with its logistical support and expertise . "
Since its emergence , Al - Shabaab has played a major role in the insurgency that pushed Ethiopian forces out of Somalia ; it also received the endorsement of Osama bin Laden and has seen large numbers of Somalis living in the West flock to its camps .
Somalia has become , like Pakistan , a significant Al - Qaeda safe haven . [ 1 ]
Due to the relatively large number of Americans who travel to Somalia for military training , individuals linked to Al - Shabaab are among the top U.S. domestic terrorist threats .
Al - Shabaab emerged from two previous Somali Islamist groups , The Islamic Union ( Al - Ittihad al - Islamiya , IU ) and the Islamic Courts Union ( Ittihad al - Mahakim al - Islamiya , ICU ) .
There are three strands of evolution from the IU to the ICU and finally to Al - Shabaab .
The first is ideological , in which the groups go through a funneling process and slowly become less ideologically diverse .
Though all three strove to implement Shari'a ( Islamic law ) , a significant faction of IU and ICU leaders had a vision that focused on the Somali nation itself — that is , inside the borders of Somalia and in neighboring territories where Somalis are the predominant ethnic group , such as Ethiopia 's Ogaden region .
In contrast , key Al - Shabaab leaders are committed to a global jihadist ideology .
They view the group 's regional activities as part of a broader struggle .
The second strand lies in the groups ' relations with Al - Qaeda .
Bin Laden 's organization has long had a presence in Somalia .
It dispatched trainers to liaise with the Islamic Union prior to the 1993 battle of Mogadishu when eighteen U.S. soldiers were killed .
[ 2 ]
Despite that connection , some scholars have questioned how deep the ties between Al - Qaeda and the IU really are . [ 3 ]
In contrast , after Al - Shabaab emerged as a distinct entity , its leaders reached out to Al - Qaeda 's senior leadership , and its chief military strategist openly declared his allegiance to bin Laden . [ 4 ]
The final strand is the groups ' opportunity and ability to govern .
Since all three have been dedicated to implementing Shari'a , they would ideally like a governing apparatus through which to apply Islamic law and mete out God 's justice .
The Islamic Union could not control any territory for a sustained period apart from the town of Luuq .
In contrast , the Islamic Courts and Al - Shabaab came to control broad swaths of Somalia , and the governing strategies they put in place indicate that both groups thought hard about how to maintain and expand their power .
Al - Shabaab's Origins
The practice of Islam in Somalia has traditionally been dominated by apolitical Sufi orders . [ 5 ]
Islamist movements did not emerge until the late 1960s when Somalis gained greater exposure to less moderate currents of Islam in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and elsewhere .
In 1969 , Gen . Mohamed Siad Barre executed a military coup that made him president of the young state , [ 6 ] which had won its independence nine years earlier .
Some of Barre 's draconian tactics for dealing with Somalia 's fledgling Islamist movements consolidated the groups and gave them momentum .
When Muslim leaders denounced reform of Somali family law , Barre executed ten prominent scholars and prosecuted hundreds more .
In response , " [ u ] nderground organisations proliferated in every region in defence of the faith against the ' Godless socialists , ' " writes Abdurahman M. Abdullahi . [ 7 ]
Though Barre ruled for more than twenty years , by the early 1990s he faced " widespread insurrection initiated by the tribes and powerbrokers . " [ 8 ]
Opponents forced him to flee the country , which collapsed into civil war and prolonged anarchy .
The Islamic Union .
In these lawless conditions , two Islamist groups that were the progenitors of Al - Shabaab became prominent .
The first was the Islamic Union .
Although there is no firm date for the IU 's birth , [ 9 ] most credible accounts date this to around 1983 .
Ken Menkhaus , an associate professor of political science at Davidson College , notes that the IU was originally " comprised mainly of educated , young men who had studied or worked in the Middle East . " [ 10 ]
It received significant funding and support from — and was in turn influenced by — the Salafi / Wahhabi movement and its Saudi - based charity organizations .
Members concluded that political Islam was the only way to rid their country of its corrupt leadership .
The group had two goals .
First , it sought to defeat Siad Barre 's regime and replace it with an Islamic state .
Second , it wanted to unify what it regarded as Greater Somalia — northeastern Kenya , Ethiopia 's Ogaden region , and Djibouti — and add them to the existing Somali state . [ 11 ]
In 1991 , after warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid 's rebel forces drove Barre into exile and destroyed his regime , the IU attempted to seize " targets of opportunity , " including " strategic sites such as seaports and commercial crossroads . " [ 12 ]
It managed to hold the seaports of Kismayo and Merka for almost a year but was quickly expelled from Bosaso .
Menkhaus notes that even with the prevailing lawlessness , Somalis were " suspicious of politically active Islam and remained attached to the clan as the sole source of protection . " [ 13 ]
The IU managed to control one location for a sustained period : the town of Luuq near the border with Ethiopia and Kenya .
Consonant with its original aspirations , the IU implemented strict Shari 'a there , meting out punishments that included amputations .
However , in a pattern that would later work to the advantage of Somali Islamists , rough justice in Luuq made it safer from crime than most other places . [ 14 ]
Luuq 's proximity to Ethiopia was significant because of the IU 's commitment to a Greater Somalia .
In particular , the group focused on Ethiopia 's Ogaden , a region inhabited by a majority of Somali speakers .
The IU stirred up separatist unrest , and from 1996 to 1997 , Ethiopia experienced a " string of assassination attempts and bombings by Al - Ittihad [ IU ] in Addis Ababa . " [ 15 ]
In response , Ethiopian forces intervened in Luuq and destroyed the IU 's safe haven .
Questions linger over the degree to which the IU was linked to Al - Qaeda during its heyday .
For example , an analysis published by West Point 's Combating Terrorism Center finds numerous alleged ties between the IU and Al - Qaeda . [ 16 ]
Against this , Menkhaus argues that there has never been a smoking gun regarding the relationship between the IU and Al - Qaeda since " no Somalis appear in al - Qaeda 's top leadership , and until 2003 , no Somali was involved in a terrorist plot against a Western target outside of Somalia . " [ 17 ]
Despite these divergent views , there are two important points about the IU - Al - Qaeda relationship .
First , Al - Qaeda 's leadership recognizes Somalia 's role in one of its first actions , the first time it successfully bloodied America 's nose .
Al - Qaeda dispatched a small team of military trainers to Somalia in 1993 , which liaised with the IU prior to the battle of Mogadishu . [ 18 ]
Since then , Al - Qaeda leaders have claimed that they — rather than the forces of Mohammed Farrah Aidid — were the real hand behind the U.S. defeat . [ 19 ]
Many scholars believe these claims are highly exaggerated . [ 20 ]
But the true facts behind the battle of Mogadishu are beside the point insofar as Al - Qaeda 's perceptions are concerned since the " rosecolored memoirs of Somalia have … come to embody the ' founding myths ' of the core Al - Qaida methodology . " [ 21 ]
Second , it is clear that certain key members of the IU had strong relationships with bin Laden 's group .
One was Aden Hashi Ayro , who went on to lead Al - Shabaab .
After Ayro 's death , Al - Shabaab posted a Somali - language biography of him , claiming the battle of Mogadishu was " the first time he fought under the supervision of Al - Qaeda , and with its logistical support and expertise . " [ 22 ]
The New York Times would report at the time of Ayro 's death that he was " long identified as one of Al Qaeda 's top operatives in East Africa . " [ 23 ]
Following the IU 's defeat in Luuq , the group declined in prominence .
By 2004 , it was regarded as " a spent force , marginal if not defunct as an organization . " [ 24 ]
The Islamic Courts Union .
The ICU was the next incarnation of the Islamic Union .
By the time it caught the attention of Westerners , it was more militarily adept than the old IU had been , more capable of governing , and had more leaders committed to a global jihadist ideology .
International attention came in June 2006 when the ICU seized Mogadishu and thereafter won a rapid series of strategic gains .
It took control of critical port cities such as Kismayo and met little resistance as it expanded . [ 25 ]
Typical of the ICU 's advance was its seizure of Beletuein on August 9 , 2006 .
The local governor fled to Ethiopia almost immediately after fighting broke out between his forces and ICU militiamen . [ 26 ]
There was international concern during the ICU 's rise .
Some centered on the ICU 's ideology .
Writing in the Jamestown Foundation 's Terrorism Monitor , Nairobi - based journalist Sunguta West noted that though the ICU 's immediate goal was to establish Islamic rule in Somalia , " media reports allege that the Islamic courts are eyeing a bigger Islamic state in the long term carved out of East Africa , similar to the old goals of the IU , which wanted to create an Islamic state out of Somalia and Ethiopia [ sic ] . " [ 27 ]
Other concerns focused on the ICU leadership .
Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys , the most prominent ICU leader as head of its consultative council , had previously been an IU leader .
West writes that Aweys " has a history of being connected to … al - Qaeda . " [ 28 ]
Indeed , Washington named Aweys a specially designated global terrorist in September 2001 . [ 29 ]
By late October 2006 , the ICU controlled most of Somalia 's key strategic points , was able to move supplies from south to north , and had effectively encircled the U.N. - recognized transitional federal government in the south - central city of Baidoa .
Somalia had some sixteen operational terrorist training camps ; [ 30 ] soon after the ICU rose to power , hundreds of terrorists from Afghanistan , Chechnya , Iraq , Pakistan , and the Arabian Peninsula arrived to train in or staff these camps .
In 2006 , the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia reported : " Foreign volunteers ( fighters ) have also been arriving in considerable numbers to give added military strength to the ICU .
…
Importantly , foreign volunteers also provide training in guerrilla warfare and special topics or techniques . " [ 31 ]
Because the presence of foreign fighters suggested the ICU had ambitions beyond Somalia , some ICU leaders , such as Sheikh Yusuf Indohaadde , publicly denied that any foreign fighters were in Somalia .
In a June 2006 press conference , he said , " We want to say in a loud voice that we have no enemies ; we have not enmity toward anyone .
There are no foreign terrorists here . " [ 32 ]
Weeks later , the Associated Press obtained a copy of an ICU recruitment videotape that showed Indohaadde north of Mogadishu alongside fighters from Arab Gulf states . [ 33 ]
Another ICU leader , Sheikh Hassan " Turki " Abdullah Hersi , proclaimed : " Brothers in Islam , we came from Mogadishu , and we have thousands of fighters , some are Somalis and others are from the Muslim world .
If Christian - led America brought its infidels , we now call to our Muslim holy fighters to come join us . " [ 34 ]
International jihadist leaders took note of the ICU 's rise .
In an audiotape released in June 2006 , Osama bin Laden stated , " We will continue , God willing , to fight you and your allies everywhere , in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Somalia and Sudan , until we waste all your money and kill your men , and you will return to your country in defeat as we defeated you before in Somalia " [ 35 ] — a clear nod to the rise of the Islamic Courts .
In July , he issued an even stronger statement : " We warn all the countries in the world from accepting a U.S. proposal to send international forces to Somalia .
We swear to God that we will fight their soldiers in Somalia , and we reserve our right to punish them on their lands and every accessible place at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner . " [ 36 ]
While the IU had little chance to rule beyond Luuq , the ICU imposed Shari'a on some of the key territory it controlled .
The rules it imposed were far - reaching .
It conducted mass arrests of citizens watching movies , abolished live music at weddings , [ 37 ] killed several people for watching soccer , [ 38 ] and arrested a karate instructor and his female students because the lessons constituted mixing of the sexes . [ 39 ]
Strict implementation of Shari'a often alienates locals , but as the ICU gained power , it was determined to win over the population .
Hassan Dahir Aweys sought to harness Islam , Somali nationalism , and distaste for the rule of the warlords . [ 40 ]
His emphasis on stability and the rule of law won the sympathy of the business community , which saw the ICU 's strict rule as a means to reduce security costs . [ 41 ]
There are no reliable estimates for security costs before the ICU 's rise , but the U.N. Monitoring Group 's 2006 study reported that checkpoints established by the warlords cost businesses several million dollars a year .
The ICU 's elimination of certain extortionate checkpoints reduced business expenses , often by up to 50 percent . [ 42 ]
Citizens who previously had to live under insecure , anarchic conditions also benefited from improved security under the Islamic Courts .
The Rise of Al - Shabaab
By late 2006 , Baidoa — the last stronghold of the transitional federal government — was under siege .
Many fighters defected from the government to the ICU ; all that prevented the government 's destruction were Ethiopian soldiers manning roadblocks around the city . [ 43 ]
But as the ICU launched an assault on Baidoa , Ethiopia responded with greater force than expected .
The Islamic Courts could not match Ethiopian airpower .
U.S. air and ground forces supported Ethiopia 's intervention by sending armaments and personnel including helicopter gunships and the elite Task Force 88 . [ 44 ]
The Ethiopians and the transitional government wrested Mogadishu from the ICU on December 28 , 2006 , and quickly reversed virtually all of its strategic gains . [ 45 ]
However , there was no coherent plan to stabilize the country and make the transitional government viable .
The head of the ICU 's executive council , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed — now the Somali president — called for an insurgency . [ 46 ]
Even before Ethiopia intervened , the U.N. 's Monitoring Group on Somalia had warned that the ICU " is fully capable of turning Somalia into what is currently an Iraq - type scenario , replete with roadside and suicide bombers , assassinations , and other forms of terrorist and insurgent - type activities . " [ 47 ]
Al - Shabaab emerged as a distinct force during the course of the insurgency .
The break between Al - Shabaab and other insurgent groups came in late 2007 .
That September , the ICU attended a conference of opposition factions in the Eritrean capital , Asmara , and reemerged as the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia ( ARS ) .
Al - Shabaab boycotted the conference , and its leaders launched vitriolic attacks on the ARS for failing to adopt a global jihadist ideology . [ 48 ]
In late February 2008 , fighting between supporters of the ARS and Al - Shabaab in Dhobley killed several people . [ 49 ]
As Ethiopian fighters left Somalia in early 2009 , fighters affiliated with Al - Shabaab took their place and implemented a strict version of Shari'a in areas they came to control .
Al - Shabaab's Ideology
Al - Shabaab represents a further step toward a global jihadist vision .
Like the Islamic Union and Islamic Courts , it believes that religious governance is the solution to Somalia 's ills .
When addressing a rally in the southern city of Marka , Sheikh Mukhtar Robow , an Al - Shabaab spokesman , emphasized the importance of complying with Islamic law . [ 50 ]
In an effort to show that Shari'a was equitable , Robow stated that " punishment would be meted out to anyone , " including mujahideen , citing a mujahid executed in Waajid as an example . [ 51 ]
One important document explaining Al - Shabaab 's outlook was written by the American mujahid Abu Mansoor al - Amriki .
He gained notoriety in the U.S. when he appeared in a sophisticated Al - Shabaab video dated April 2 , 2009 , " that employs hip - hop and looks more like an extreme version of ' Survivor . ' " [ 52 ]
In January 2008 , Amriki wrote a document entitled " A Message to the Mujaahideen in Particular and Muslims in General " that rapidly made its way around the jihadist web .
In it , he reiterated the need to establish Shari'a , citing as exemplars Sayyid Qutb , the leading theoretician of the Muslim Brotherhood , and Abu A'la Maududi , founder of the Islamist Jama ' at - i Islami in India and Pakistan , both of whom " refused to accept entering into the kaafir [ infidel ] governments as a solution . " [ 53 ]
He specified commitment to Islamic law as a means of distinguishing Al - Shabaab from the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia .
Amriki explained that Al - Shabaab had boycotted the Asmara conference because it refused to work with the non-Muslim Eritrean state . [ 54 ]
He argued that cooperation with " infidels " would corrupt the jihad because Eritrea would open " the door of politics in order for them to forget armed resistance , " leaving " members of the Courts in the lands of the Kuffaar , underneath their control , sitting in the road of politics which leads to the loss and defeat they were running from . " [ 55 ]
Indeed , Amriki 's screed underscores the gradations from the IU to the ICU and finally to Al - Shabaab .
His criticisms of the Islamic Courts emphasize Al - Shabaab 's global jihadist perspective .
He touts Al - Shabaab 's pan-Islamism in opposition to the ICU 's clan - backed politics , saying that " the Courts used to judge over each individual tribe , " whereas " Al - Shabaab were made up of many different tribes . " [ 56 ]
Though a non-Somali like Amriki may overlook the continuing importance of clan politics even within Al - Shabaab , other Al - Shabaab leaders have said that the group wants to undermine the country 's clan structure .
When Robow addressed the Marka rally , Kataaib reported that he " declared that from now on it is prohibited to say that so - and - so clan cannot control over there , or so - and - so clan can not govern so - and - so region .
He made it clear that this land belongs to Allah and anyone who imposes the Islamic law in it can govern it . " [ 57 ]
Amriki also attacked the Islamic Courts for having " a goal limited to the boundaries placed by the Taghoot [ a ruler who fails to implement the divine law ] " while " the Shabaab had a global goal including the establishment of the Islaamic [ sic ] Khilaafah [ caliphate ] in all parts of the world . " [ 58 ]
While this criticism is not entirely accurate ( " Greater Somalia " was not strictly limited by colonial borders ) , Amriki showed that key Al - Shabaab leaders now saw their efforts as part of a global struggle .
Amriki also provides an extended discussion of Al - Shabaab 's manhaj , or religious methodology .
He writes :
It is the same manhaj repeatedly heard from the mouth of the mujaahid shaykh Usaamah Bin Laden … the doctor Ayman ath - Thawaahiri [ bin Laden 's right - hand man ] … and the hero , Abu Mus'ab az - Zarqaawi [ leader of Al - Qaeda in Iraq ] . [ 59 ]
He thus makes clear that Al - Shabaab was aligned ideologically with Al - Qaeda .
Other Al - Shabaab leaders have said that they see the continuation of jihad beyond Somalia as a religious imperative .
In early 2009 , Kataaib reported that Sheikh Ali Muhammad Hussein , the group 's Banadir region governor , gave a media briefing on Ethiopia 's withdrawal .
He said that " the fact that the enemy has left Mogadishu does not mean that the mujahideen will not follow him to where he still remains , " adding that in compliance with the command of God , " he will be pursued everywhere and more traps will be laid for him . "
Hussein added that the idea that the jihad had ended with Ethiopia 's withdrawal was " in clear contradiction with the statement of Prophet Muhammad … that jihad will continue until Doomsday . " [ 60 ]
In early 2008 , when the U.S. designated Al - Shabaab a global terrorist entity , prominent members struck a celebratory tone .
Robow told the BBC that he welcomed the designation as an " honor " because " [ w ] e are good Muslims and the Americans are infidels .
We are on the right path . " [ 61 ]
Though Robow then denied a connection to Al - Qaeda , his position has since changed .
In August 2008 , he said that Al - Shabaab was " negotiating how we can unite into one " with Al - Qaeda . [ 62 ]
He continued , " We will take our orders from Sheikh Osama bin Laden because we are his students . " [ 63 ]
And Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , Al - Shabaab 's chief military strategist , formally reached out to Al - Qaeda 's senior leadership in a 24 - minute video entitled " March Forth , " which circuited the jihadi web on August 30 , 2008 . [ 64 ]
In it , Nabhan offers salutations to bin Laden and pledges allegiance to " the courageous commander and my honorable leader . " [ 65 ]
Al - Qaeda Reciprocates
Al - Qaeda has not ignored Al - Shabaab 's overtures .
They first took note of developments in Somalia in 2006 when the Islamic Courts captured Mogadishu .
When Ethiopia intervened to push back the ICU 's advance on Baidoa , Al - Qaeda leader Ayman al - Zawahiri soon appeared in a web - based video and called for Muslims to fight the Ethiopians :
I appeal to the lions of Islam in Yemen , the state of faith and wisdom .
I appeal to my brothers , the lions of Islam in the Arab Peninsula , the cradle of conquests .
And I also appeal to my brothers , the lions of Islam in Egypt , Sudan , the Arab Maghreb , and everywhere in the Muslim world to rise up to aid their Muslim brethren in Somalia . [ 66 ]
On July 5 , 2007 , he released a new video , describing Somalia as one of the three main theaters for Al - Qaeda 's mujahideen , along with Iraq and Afghanistan . [ 67 ]
The Al - Qaeda propagandist Abu Yahya al - Libi devoted an entire video to urging Muslims to join the Somali mujahideen . [ 68 ]
On November 19 , 2008 , Zawahiri responded to Nabhan 's video with one in which he called Al - Shabaab " my brothers , the lions of Islam in Somalia . "
He urged them to " hold tightly to the truth for which you have given your lives , and do n't put down your weapons before the mujahid state of Islam [ has been established ] and Tawheed has been set up in Somalia . " [ 69 ]
Bin Laden himself issued a video devoted to Al - Shabaab in March 2009 , entitled " Fight on , Champions of Somalia , " where he addresses " my patient , persevering Muslim brothers in mujahid Somalia . "
Here , bin Laden explicitly endorses Al - Shabaab and denounces the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia , saying that when NATO supported former president Abdullahi Yusuf , the mujahideen were not fooled .
" They replaced him and brought in a new , revised version , " says bin Laden , " similar to Sayyaf , Rabbani , and Ahmed Shah Massoud , who were leaders of the Afghan mujahideen before they turned back on their heels [ as apostates ] . " [ 70 ]
In bin Laden 's view , Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed — who had been an ICU official before becoming ARS 's leader — also falls into this category .
Bin Laden explains that in becoming the new president of Somalia , Sharif " agreed to partner infidel positive law with Islamic Shari'a to set up a government of national unity , " and in that way apostatized from Islam .
He asks , " How can intelligent people believe that yesterday 's enemies on the basis of religion can become today 's friends ?
This can only happen if one of the two parties abandons his religion .
So look and see which one of them is the one who has abandoned it : Sheikh Sharif or America ? " [ 71 ]
Al - Shabaab's Strategic Outlook
Today , Al - Shabaab is a capable fighting force that implements a strict version of Shari'a in key areas of Somalia .
Its range is enhanced by training camps from which many Western Muslims have graduated .
This has made Al - Shabaab a significant security concern to several countries , including the United States .
Terrorist training .
Given the relationship noted above between Al - Shabaab and Al - Qaeda , which includes ideological affinity and interlocking leadership , there are worries about Al - Shabaab 's connections to transnational terrorism .
These concerns are bolstered by Al - Shabaab 's operation of terrorist training camps , successors to the ICU camps .
One of the clearest signs that training camps have reopened in Somalia is an exodus of young Somali men from Minneapolis - St. Paul and elsewhere in the United States . [ 72 ]
There are further reports of young Somali men going missing from Canada , Europe , Australia , and Saudi Arabia . [ 73 ]
A senior U.S. military intelligence officer reports that simultaneous disappearances in several countries are best explained by the reopening of Somali training facilities such as those in Ras Kamboni . [ 74 ]
The biggest concern is not what these individuals do while in Somalia but what happens when they return to the countries from which they came .
It is a concern not only for the United States but also Britain : The Times of London reports that the British security services believe that " [ d] ozens of Islamic extremists have returned to Britain from terror training camps in Somalia . " [ 75 ]
British intelligence analysts are concerned about possible terror attacks in the U.K. , and British television has reported that an October 2007 suicide bombing in Somalia was thought to have been carried out by a U.K. - raised bomber . [ 76 ]
Peter Neumann of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King 's College , London , told Channel 4 News : " The numbers I hear ( going from Britain to Somalia ) are 50 , 60 or 70 , but in reality we do n't know .
You do n't need big numbers for terrorism . " [ 77 ]
Al - Shabaab 's training is both military and ideological .
In 2006 , Frederick Nzwili , a Nairobi - based journalist , reported that training camps run by Aweys and Al - Shabaab founder Aden Hashi Ayro " included indoctrination into fundamentalist ideology aimed at advocating jihad in Islamic states . " [ 78 ]
The Economist notes the fundamentalist environment in which Al - Shabaab 's training occurs , wherein recruits " are expected to disavow music , videos , cigarettes and qat , the leaf Somali men chew most afternoons to get mildly high . " [ 79 ]
Military capabilities .
It is difficult to say how many fighters make up Al - Shabaab 's militia .
Some estimates suggest between 6,000 and 7,000 . [ 80 ]
Al - Shabaab is battle - ready , given that Somalia 's history is replete with fighters who have experience with asymmetrical warfare , small unit tactics , and a wide array of weaponry .
One tactic that Al - Shabaab is said to have introduced to Somalia is suicide bombing .
They have also carried out assassination attempts against Somali government officials . [ 81 ]
Overall , Al - Shabaab fought competently against the Ethiopians .
In late 2008 , it made geographical gains and consolidated power in the Lower Juba region , allowing it to establish a Shari 'a - based administration there on September 5 .
It also showed itself able to strike Mogadishu .
In late October , Al - Shabaab carried out five suicide bombings in northern Somalia , killing twenty - eight people . [ 82 ]
One of the bombers , Shirwa Ahmed , was a naturalized American citizen , the United States ' first successful suicide bomber . [ 83 ]
By the end of 2008 , the Ethiopian government could no longer sustain its occupation .
In early January 2009 , trucks filled with Ethiopian soldiers left Mogadishu .
Large numbers of Somali parliament members also fled ; settling in Djibouti , they set up reconciliation talks that doubled the size of parliament to include Islamist members linked to the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia .
They also selected ARS leader Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed as their new president .
Though Sharif expressed optimism that he could " improve the situation in Somalia and establish genuine peace and reconciliation in my country , " [ 84 ] others were less sanguine .
" Where will this parliament go ? " asked Abdiweli Ali , a former adviser to the transitional government .
" The seat of government has already been captured by Al - Shabaab . " [ 85 ]
As Ethiopian forces left , Al - Shabaab had a substantial area of control , including Baidoa in south - central Somalia and Kismayo in the far south .
Moreover , its capabilities may have been magnified by the arrival of other Islamic fighters .
In late April 2009 , Associated Press reported that battle - hardened extremists from safe havens along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border were entering East Africa .
Part of the concern , according to U.S. officials , is that these extremists could " pass on sophisticated training and attack techniques gleaned from seven years at war against the U.S. and allies in Iraq and Afghanistan . " [ 86 ]
Implementation of Shari 'a law .
Al - Shabaab has imposed a strict version of Shari'a in the areas it has captured , normally forming an administration to oversee Shari'a and other matters relating to law and governance .
In September 2008 , it announced a new administration for Kismayo that included " several committees that will run the town , " a district commissioner , head of information , head of security , head of finance , and head of preaching . [ 87 ]
It later formed a similar administration in Marka . [ 88 ]
The strictness of Al - Shabaab 's Shari 'a rulings can be seen in the laws that it has implemented and the punishments it has meted out .
Amnesty International claims that a 13 - year - old rape victim was stoned to death in Kismayo last year for alleged adultery . [ 89 ]
In late 2008 , as Al - Shabaab seized Marka , leaders informed residents that cinema houses and music recording studios were banned .
[ 90 ]
It also warned that action would be taken against anyone found on the streets or opening their shop during prayer times .
In January 2009 , in the same city , Al - Shabaab executed a politician for apostasy , alleging his cooperation with Ethiopian forces . [ 91 ]
On January 28 , they amputated the hand of a Kismayo man convicted of stealing fishing nets .
In February , they sentenced a number of youths caught using narcotic drugs in Baidoa to public lashings . [ 92 ]
Al - Shabaab intends to continue expanding Shari'a .
In an audio message on January 2009 , the group 's emir Sheikh Mukhtar Abdirahman Abu Zubeyr said that democracy and communism had failed in Somalia because both political systems " were incongruent with the teachings of the Islamic religion . "
His message called for widespread implementation of Shari'a . [ 93 ]
In addition to Shari'a , Al - Shabaab has implemented other rules designed to help it maintain power .
It has implemented rules directed at journalists " requiring that no reports be disseminated of which the administration was unaware , that only ' factual ' news be presented , that nothing detrimental to the practice of Shari'a be reported , and that no music be played on the radio that encouraged ' sin . ' " [ 94 ]
Al - Shabaab 's rules have been enforced not only by administrative methods but also through intimidation .
In 2008 , London 's Sunday Times reported that Al - Shabaab was shutting down " objectionable " business sectors in Mogadishu by carrying out selective attacks and sending " night letter " warnings to other business owners . [ 95 ]
At times , Somalis have expressed violent displeasure with these new rules .
In January 2009 , for example , Kismayo residents rioted after Al - Shabaab transformed a soccer stadium into a market . [ 96 ]
But there are also signs that the group listens to public outcries and that there is a pragmatic side to its activities .
For example , Al - Shabaab has undertaken public works programs such as building a canal connecting Jannaale , Golweyn , and Buulo Mareer . [ 97 ]
Additionally , because Somalia has been mired in anarchy since the early 1990s , many Somalis find even Al - Shabaab 's strict version of Shari 'a preferable to lawlessness .
Conclusion
A number of governments now look upon Al - Shabaab 's rise as a major security concern .
Its commitment to global jihadism , joint leadership with Al - Qaeda , and military capabilities are likely to make it a problem for some time to come .
Al - Shabaab does face certain challenges from within Somalia .
For example , it has clashed with another Islamist group , Ahlu Sunna wa'l - Jama'a .
Despite Al - Shabaab 's military capabilities , Ahlu Sunna has been able to bloody its nose on more than one occasion .
In late December 2008 , Ahlu Sunna fighters killed more than ten Al - Shabaab mujahideen in a single weekend . [ 98 ]
In late January 2009 , Ahlu Sunna captured the Dhuusa Mareeb District in central Somalia . [ 99 ]
There is a doctrinal element to these skirmishes :
Though both groups are Islamist , favoring incorporating Islamic law into the laws of the state , Ahlu Sunna adheres to traditional Somali Sufi religious practice — something Al - Shabaab 's hard - line Salafi outlook staunchly opposes .
Though such internal challenges may be exploited by the United States , Somali political Islam will be with us for a long time .
As Menkhaus told The Washington Post , Somali leaders " are increasingly required to present themselves in some fashion as Islamist . " [ 100 ]
Against this backdrop , the top U.S. priority should be containment of the danger that Al - Shabaab and other Islamist groups pose outside Somalia 's borders .
The fact is that U.S. policies have left a legacy of mistakes and missed opportunities .
To move forward , policymakers will need to recognize past U.S. mistakes and understand the strategic challenges posed by groups such as Al - Shabaab .

My niece has been recently diagnosed with Celiac disease .
I thought I knew something about it but I did n’t know that what I was about to learn would change the course of my dad ’s Lymphoma .
One of the concepts I came across while researching her condition is that Celiac disease has a significant hereditary factor .
What I did n’t know is that the possibility of genetically transferring the disease was greater from grandparents to grandsons than from parents to sons .
I also learned that gluten in certain grains actually destroys the villi in the small intestine of Celiacs , which would eventually cause malabsorption of nutrients , resulting in conditions such anemia and low B12 , among others .
It was then that I connected the dots in respects of the symptoms my dad was having with the celiac diagnosis of my niece ( his granddaughter ) .
Could it be that my dad ’s continuous low ferritin levels and his low B12 had something to do to my niece ’s Celiac condition ?
I immediately started reading about Celiac Disease and I learned one big , crushing fact : Celiacs have a nine fold increase in the risk of having intestinal lymphomas , particularly Non-Hogdkin ’s Lymphoma , the cancer my dad has .
How come nobody told us anything about this ?
How come he has n’t been tested for gluten intolerance with so much evidence associating it with his cancer ?
The chain of events does n’t stop here .
My dad is getting tested this week to confirm or deny the possibility of Celiac Disease , almost at the same time his granddaughter is getting an endoscopy to find out the extent of the damage this disease caused in her small intestine .
The implications are tremendous .
My dad is 70 years old .
If he is in fact Celiac it would mean that all the gastric problems he has been dragging since childhood leading to his cancer have a reason to exist : the damage gluten has been causing over the years .
It would mean he can lower his risk of recurrence even further by stopping gluten intake altogether .
It would also mean we should fire our oncologist for being so incompetent , but then , I can imagine the amount of people that has this king of intestinal lymphoma who might be in the same situation .
If you are reading this or if you know anybody who has Non-Hodgkin ’s Lymphoma , please consider the role gluten might have in your condition .
You oncologist may be completely unaware of such role .
Maybe it ’s too late for my dad .
He may only be able to put his condition on hold for so long if he reverses his already low gluten intake .
I ’m grateful he started a macrobiotic diet but I realize that this diet , as good as it is to fight cancer , it is too focused on grains , including glutinous grains .
It ’s not the right diet for certain cancers .
I am grateful my niece got diagnosed so early , though , she has time to lower her risks of malignancies down the road .
But then I learned a more startling fact .
50 % of Celiacs are not able to stick to their diets even though they are aware of the devastating consequences of eating gluten .
Why ?
apparently there are certain protein fragments in gluten ( and casein , a milk protein ! ) called peptides that remain inactive in the grains ( and dairy products ) , until we eat them .
While we digest this kind of food , our stomach acids and pancreatic secretions are able to free these peptides from their larger protein structures .
Once they are freed , they become highly resistant to enzyme digestion in the intestine .
They are basically indigestible .
In the case of Celiacs they cause damage because they are attacked by the body ’s own immune system .
In case of lactose intolerant individuals , they cause inflammation .
But these wheat and dairy peptides do n’t just affect these population groups .
They have the capability to act as opioids in ALL of us , regarding if we are Celiac / lactose intolerant or not .
Their opioid effect is similar to morphine .
That ’s why they calm your body , they put babies to sleep , they make you drowsy behind the wheel .
Some views even suggest that they cause constipation because of the peptides ’ sedative effect on your colon .
The fact is that they highly influence endorphin receptors in the brain bringing all sorts of mood changes , depression , irritability , withdrawal syndrome , etc .
These gluten / lactose peptides are physically addictive , causing strong dependency and other psychological conditions .
Maybe that ’s why we are so addicted to bread and cheese , why it is so difficult to give them up .
They are in fact so addictive that some authors even suggest reading quit - smoking literature to help give up glutinous - grain dependency .
Can you believe it ?
There are even some authors that go even beyond that and expose the believe that mankind possibly started agriculture by cultivating grains and eating dairy because of the addictive effects of such foods .
And some conspiracy - theory authors suggest our food system today is filled with these addictive wheat / dairy peptides so we get hooked on buying all sort of products containing them .
You know what ?
They may all be right .
So what does this addiction have to do with cancer ?
Apparently opioids have the capability of reducing the activity of our immune system .
In other words , the more opiods you take , in whichever form ( even if it is smoking pot or drinking wine ) , the less your immune system is able to do its job : killing cancer cells .
Gluten / dairy might not cause cancer per se in the majority of us , but it does increase our risk to get it in all of us , because they deactivate our immune systems making us literally defenseless against cancer takeover .
If you have cancer , you know anybody who does , or you want to prevent it , stop eating glutinous grains and dairy products so your immune system remains at full potential , if you can break the addiction to them , that is …

Computer hacker Gary McKinnon , who has Asperger 's syndrome , is at serious risk of suicide , relatives said today , after the home secretary rejected a last - ditch attempt to prevent his extradition to the US .
In a letter today Alan Johnson ordered McKinnon 's removal to the US on charges of breaching US military and Nasa computers , despite claims by his lawyers that extradition would make the 43 - year - old 's death " virtually certain " .
" The secretary of state is of the firm view that McKinnon 's extradition would not be incompatible with his [ human ] rights , " said the letter , dated 26 November .
" His extradition to the United States must proceed forthwith . "
The decision , described by lawyers as " callous " , has prompted fresh fears about McKinnon 's well - being .
The letter rejected new expert medical evidence that McKinnon 's health had deteriorated dramatically since losing his case in the high court in July , and meant that extradition would violate his right to life .
" Gary is at risk of suicide , I 'm extremely worried about him , " said McKinnon 's mother , Janis Sharp .
" This government is terrified of speaking up to America , and now they are allowing vulnerable people to be pursued for non-violent crime when they should be going after terrorists . "
Mckinnon 's lawyer , Karen Todner , said she planned to start a judicial review of the home secretary 's decision .
" We can not give up because in some ways it 's like dealing with a death row case , and we genuinely believe Gary 's life is at stake here , " she said .
McKinnon , from north London , was accused in 2002 of using his home computer to hack into 97 American military and Nasa computers , causing damage that the US government claims will cost more than $ 700,000 ( £ 425,000 ) to repair .
This year the high court rejected arguments that the extradition would violate his rights , after lawyers argued the prospect of up to 60 years in a " supermax " jail would cause mental harm because he has Asperger 's and a depressive illness .
Johnson insisted that he had received a guarantee from the US government that McKinnon would be assessed by doctors and psychologists were he transferred to prison there , and that he would receive " appropriate medical care and treatment " , including counselling and medication .
The assurances were given in a letter this February from the US department of justice , which was seen by the court .
The home secretary also said that should McKinnon be convicted in the US and seek to serve his sentence in Britain , the UK government would " progress his application at the very earliest opportunity " .
Lawyers had also argued that McKinnon could be prosecuted in the UK on lesser charges of computer misuse , preventing his extradition .
" The CPS wanted to prosecute Gary , but they were told from the very top to stand aside and let America take him , " said Sharp .
Critics say an extradition treaty designed to speed up extradition between the two countries works in favour of Americans and fails to adequately protect Britons .
Geoffrey Robertson QC , one of Britain 's most eminent human rights lawyers , told the Guardian : " To send a British citizen to the US , without any right to bail , to face 10 years in prison for a crime for which he would be unlikely to receive any custodial sentence if tried here amounts to ' cruel and unusual ' punishment ' in breach of our 1689 Bill of Rights .
The home secretary should not hide behind the weasel words of the European Convention when he should be following the law laid down by our own historic bill of rights . "
McKinnon 's legal team had hoped to join his case to that of Ian Norris , a retired business chief facing extradition to the US on charges of obstructing justice through his alleged role in an illegal cartel .
His case will be heard in the supreme court on Monday .
It was argued unsuccessfully that McKinnon 's case raised similar legal issues and should be considered by the supreme court panel .
Attempts to be heard in the supreme court failed however , although McKinnon 's His legal team said they would be seeking a judicial review of yesterday 's decision .
Sharp said : " We thought with Obama it would be different .
Now the first person in the world to be extradited to the US for computer misuse is going to be a guy with Asperger's . "
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
It 's time to stop glorifying our economic doldrums with this " jobless recovery " nonsense .
Yes , the economy did grow in the third quarter , for the first time in a year .
Fewer Americans are filing new claims for unemployment insurance , and giant financial institutions appear less apt to collapse and send us into another stupor .
The stock market has recovered much of its winter decline .
But so far there is no sign of an employment turnaround -- and without one , and soon , all the other gains could prove fleeting .
The U.S. has lost jobs in 22 straight months , and Friday 's news that 10.2 % of the labor force is out of work -- the highest reading since 1983 -- shows just how far we have to go .
Without better job prospects , the consumers whose spending makes up the lion 's share of economic activity will remain tightfisted .
That will slow the healing of deep wounds in the housing and financial markets .
" To have a real recovery you need to put people to work , " said John Harrington , who runs Harrington Investments , a socially responsible asset management firm in Napa , Calif .
" Right now we are n't doing that . "
The term jobless recovery was used mostly as a pejorative when it came into circulation in the 1990s .
But in the wake of last year 's meltdown , it has taken on a new sense :
If you give it time , economic growth will come .
That has been the mantra throughout 2009 .
Yet Friday 's headline unemployment number was worse than economists expected , and it was n't the only bad news .
The average workweek remains short by historical standards -- suggesting many employed people are working fewer hours than they 'd like .
People are staying unemployed longer and losing their benefits , in spite of recent government action to extend them .
A short work week is n't just a sign of distress for cash - strapped workers .
It also says it will be some time before employers start hiring again .
" Particularly with future uncertainty as high as it is , firms are more likely to increase the hours of underemployed workers before hiring unemployed workers , " wrote Janney Montgomery Scott economist Guy LeBas in a note to clients Friday .
Because output fell so sharply following the oil shock and Lehman Brothers collapse of 2008 , some pundits are banking on a sharp rebound .
But job and wage growth have been weak for a decade .
Total private sector employment has dropped since the Yankees held their previous victory parade , in 2000 .
That means there has been no net private sector job growth over a nine - year span where the U.S. population expanded by 11 % , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Meanwhile , financial institutions remain unhealthy , with 140 banks having failed since the start of 2008 .
The few that seem to have avoided the worst hits , such as Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , have made a mint on their trading desks -- which thickens traders ' wallets but does n't do much for those seeking credit to start or expand a business .
" All that stuff just adds to the speculation and the market volatility , " said Harrington .
" I 'd like to see them do more things that actually add to the economy . "
Another sign that the pain is n't about to disappear comes from Sean Bisceglia , CEO of TalentDrive , a Chicago - based job search technology startup .
He says almost half of the companies he surveyed in August and September either had cut their hiring budget or did n't have one .
Bisceglia concedes that number is a " fungible " one and says he expects that hiring will pick up when the economic outlook improves .
But companies like Bisceglia 's may be a reason why it will take so much longer for job growth to return .
Better , more efficient technology is replacing workers in many industries .
That is one reason productivity has been rising -- and why jobs have been harder to come by .
" A lot of companies are using technology to streamline the hiring process , and that can hold down the headcount even when things get better , " said Bisceglia , whose company employs 16 people and hopes to add four positions next year .
" We 're just trying to ride that wave . "

The first , legal , citizens ' patrols have appeared on the streets of Italy .
Supporters say the patrols will enable ordinary people to help police carry out their role of protecting neighbourhoods .
But opponents have argued the groups are no more than vigilantes , many of which are being set up in areas with high immigrant populations .
National Guard citizens ' patrols walk the streets
The city of Messina is one place where they are thriving .
It is a landing point for the island of Sicily and starting point for the most controversial versions of these citizens ' patrols .
Here they are called the National Guard .
Others have different names .
The National Guard claims to have around 2,500 members across Italy .
Like the others , it does not have powers of arrest but the Guard does have a uniform , which is as striking as the group itself .
It consists of khaki shirts , black caps featuring an eagle insignia and an armband with a black sun wheel as a logo .
' Under investigation '
It is the clothing that has earned them comparisons with Mussolini 's infamous black shirt volunteer militia , which terrorised opponents in the 1930s , and helped the fascist dictator maintain power .
The new group 's uniforms are so provocative that at least one authority - in Milan - has placed them under investigation .
But the inquiry into whether their uniforms contravene Italy 's laws banning Nazi and fascist insignia , has not stopped them beginning their patrols .
Maria Antonietta Cannizzaro sees herself as a foot soldier in heels Maria Antonietta Cannizzaro is the Guard 's leader in Sicily .
With her fellow members , she marches around central Messina , eliciting from passers - by a flurry of looks that range from bemused indifference , to mild alarm .
During a break , Miss Cannizzaro volunteered her stark assessment of who is behind Italy 's crime wave .
" It 's immigrants , " she said .
" The majority of immigrants are drug dealers or prostitutes .
" It would be better for them to be in their country and helped there .
It 's useless for them to come here . "
The foot soldier in heels said : " The streets in Italy are not safe , especially in big cities like Rome where people going home are getting attacked and raped " .
Her views on black and Jewish people would be actionable , if printed here .
Reassuring or alarming ?
The Italian government insists these patrol groups are under control .
It says they cannot act on their own : they must call in the police if they see trouble .
Mobile phones , not jackboots , are supposed to be their weapon of choice .
Head of the National Guard Gaetano Saya denies being a fascist
One female shopper said : " I find them reassuring , I 'm more secure with them . "
But another woman said : " I prefer the police to maintain law and order . "
The National Guard is headed by Gaetano Saya , who , having promised to meet us in Messina , failed to show up .
The closest we came to him was his video posted on YouTube .
Wearing the now - familiar militia - style shirt , but this time adorned with a photo of the Italian hero Garibaldi pinned to his chest , he addresses the camera for several animated minutes .
It is , by turns , a combination of rage , finger pointing and calm , if simplistic , political and sociological analysis of life in Italy .
It amounts to an exaltation of Italy as a place fit only for Italians .
He is a patriot not a fascist , he insists .
Nazi - style salute
But in another video we saw , a more sinister side to this group is revealed .
A man at a National Guard meeting makes a Nazi - style salute on camera
It is a shaky , handheld recording of a meeting of the Guard .
Towards the end a man stands up .
Inexplicably , the camera turns sideways but there 's no mistaking what happens .
The man makes a Nazi - style salute .
His gesture is greeted with wild applause .
Opponents say entrusting security to citizens ' patrols like the National Guard is a direct challenge to the rule of law .
They include Jean Leonard Touadi , born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and now a member of Italy 's parliament who serves on its Justice committee .
" These patrols are an abdication of the responsibility of government , " he said .
" You can not privatise security ... that is a dangerous path which could destroy democracy . "
People patrol Italy's new citizens ' patrols do not all look like the National Guard .
Another branch , calling themselves Veneto Sicuro wear fluorescent jackets , for visibility , not effect , we 're told .
They see themselves as true " ronde " , a more benign Italian word for " patrol " .
The Veneto Sicuro wear very different outfits to the National Guard
The group look and feel unthreatening , a reassuring sight , even , in a country where crime levels genuinely worry many Italians .
Unlike some of the groups , this one does n't maintain official ties with some of Italy 's right - wing political parties , the kind that hold the most muscular views on immigration , like the Northern League .
The League is a vital coalition partner helping sustain Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in office , a role never more important than now , following Mr Berlusconi 's troubled summer of alleged sex scandals that have threatened to undermine his hold on power .
Some here believe Mr Berlusconi 's acquiescence in the citizens patrol legislation was a price he had to pay for continued League support .
Now he and Italy have got their citizens ' patrols .
And they are being viewed in one of two ways : either as an understandable reaction from a responsive government keen to do the publics bidding as it clamours for action on crime .
Or , as a more cynical search for popularity , even though the groups may play into the hands of some who are anti-assimilation bigots , energised by the corrosive allure of intolerance , rather than the progressive forces of integration .

“ Undermining those laws via their ordinance powers is counterproductive , and , quite frankly , we ’re ignoring them .
They are absolutely so irrelevant it ’s not funny , ” Cooley said .
On Monday , two council committees rejected the city attorney ’s advice and changed a provision in the proposed ordinance , allowing cash transactions as long as they complied with state law .
Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley said today he will prosecute dispensaries that sell medical marijuana even if the Los Angeles City Council adopts an ordinance that does not ban such sales .
He reiterated his view that most , if not all , dispensaries in the county were in violation of the law .
“ We do n’t know of one that ’s not engaging in just over - the - counter sales , ” he said .
The district attorney said his office was already prosecuting some dispensaries , and he promised to step up efforts next month .
Cooley said he decided to weigh in today because he was irritated that the council had ignored the advice of the city attorney , Carmen Trutanich .
“ What the City Council is doing is beyond meaningless and irrelevant , ” he said .
The district attorney ’s view could complicate the City Council ’s deliberations .
The council is scheduled to consider the ordinance Wednesday , more than four years after it first began to study the issue of dispensaries .
“ These guys over there , God love them , are four years into this , and they wo n’t listen to their good lawyer , ” Cooley said .
“ They ’re sort of doing their own thing . ”
[ Updated at 12:58 p.m. : Councilman Ed Reyes , who has overseen the development of the city ’s ordinance , said he did not think Cooley ’s comments would cause the council to rethink whether to allow sales .
“ This is not about Cooley versus Reyes , or Cooley versus the council .
This is about the quality of life .
We all have better things to do than to do this legal jousting , ” he said .
Reyes said the law was not clear on the issue .
“ We ’ll let the courts decide , ” he said .
“ We are trying our very best to work with a system that is very vague at this moment . ”
He also noted that Cooley and Trutanich were allies and that both spoke at a training session for narcotics officers focused on eradicating dispensaries .
“ We ’re here to serve the people , not to serve each other ’s political agenda , ” he said .
“ It makes no sense to play political football with people ’s lives . ”
Once the council acts on the issue , Reyes said , “ We expect the city attorney to vigorously defend our medical marijuana ordinance . ” ]

It is a time of crisis for the world 's amphibians , says Helen Meredith .
In this week 's Green Room she says we may be facing our last chance to save this important group of animals .
They consume huge quantities of invertebrates , including humanity 's most vilified pests and their crucial role in global ecosystems helps maintain healthy functioning environments
A third of all species of amphibian are threatened with extinction ; nearly half are in decline , and they are the most threatened of all the vertebrate groups .
If allowed to continue , the projected losses would constitute the largest mass extinction since the disappearance of the dinosaurs .
But first things first ; what are amphibians and why should we care about their decline ?
Amphibians are one of nature 's less familiar groups - an issue that presents major challenges to establishing the conservation action they so urgently require .
They have been around on the planet for about 360 million years , arising over 100 million years before the first mammal and 200 million years before the first bird .
Great survivors Modern amphibians comprise frogs , toads , salamanders , newts and caecilians ( limbless amphibians ) , and number in excess of 6,000 species to date .
More than 20 % are not understood well enough to be assigned any conservation status and it is estimated that up to 10,000 species may exist in total .
WHAT ARE AMPHIBIANS ?
First true amphibians evolved about 250 m years ago
There are three orders : frogs ( including toads ) , salamanders ( including newts ) and caecilians , which are limbless Adapted to many different aquatic and terrestrial habitats Present today on every continent except Antarctica Many undergo metamorphosis , from larvae to adults
They are found on every continent except Antarctica , ranging from the Arctic Circle to the tropical deserts .
Of all the vertebrates , amphibians lead some of the strangest lives .
Various species can survive partial freezing , 10 years without food , long droughts and temperatures of up to 40C ( 104F ) .
They are among life 's great survivors , enduring mass extinction events that have wiped out the dinosaurs and whole swathes of mammals and birds .
In this light , their current extinction crisis seems all the more troubling .
Although they may not seem to have an impact upon the daily lives of many cultures , they provide numerous essential services to mankind .
They consume huge quantities of invertebrates , including humanity 's most vilified pests .
Their crucial role in global ecosystems , both as predator and prey , helps maintain healthy functioning environments .
Frogs are an important protein source in many subsistence cultures and are traded in their millions as food and pets .
The skin secretions that protect amphibians against predation and infection have been found to contain important pharmaceutical compounds that show potential in treating a variety of illnesses from HIV to cancer .
The most famous case is that of the phantasmal poison frog ( Epipedobates tricolor ) .
Skin secretions from this frog yielded the compound epibatidine , which is a painkiller 200 times more effective than morphine .
The fight to save the world 's amphibians shouts into a howling gale of climate change , war , overpopulation , economic crises , and countless other global disasters
Amphibians are repositories of potentially life - saving chemicals and are key model organisms in scientific research .
Witnessing the precipitous decline of the amphibians is sobering .
Why now , after hundreds of millions of years of survival , are they bowing out ?
As always , the reasons are diverse and complex .
The usual suspects of habitat destruction , climate change , invasive species , environmental contaminants and overexploitation represent key interrelated factors .
Additionally , a disease called chytridiomycosis or " chytrid " ( caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ) infects a wide range of amphibians globally and is capable of driving species to extinction .
Exacerbated by the other issues impacting amphibians , chytrid has emerged as one of the major threats to their survival .
This disease can kill amphibians in otherwise pristine habitats or provide the final nail in the coffin for species already pushed to the brink of extinction .
The fight to save the world 's amphibians shouts into a howling gale of climate change , war , overpopulation , economic crises , and countless other global disasters , rendering their plight ( just like many other aspects of biodiversity ) somewhat low on the agenda of global priorities ; they are slipping away almost unnoticed .
What can be done ?
A recent IUCN amphibian conservation summit held at the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) highlighted plans to launch the Amphibian Survival Alliance , which will unite existing organisations and projects working on amphibian conservation ( like ZSL's EDGE Amphibians Project ) , creating a mutually supportive network .
This initiative is still woefully underfunded given the urgent need for action , but represents a major step towards consolidating worldwide conservation activities to protect as many species as possible .
Launch for amphibian ' life raft '
We hope this will improve and expand the movement to protect amphibians , boosting the fundraising and publicity drive necessary to raise concern over amphibian declines and put vital conservation strategies into practice .
To lend perspective , the original cost of the global Amphibian Conservation Action Plan was equivalent to about one and a half Boeing 747 aeroplanes .
The latest plans drawn up at the summit would cost just one tenth of this sum , and would at least make progress towards saving a third of the world 's amphibians .
Initially tackling the two main threats to amphibian survival , disease and habitat destruction , the Amphibian Survival Alliance will require major political backing and financial support if it is to achieve its objectives .
It represents the best hope for amphibians at this most critical and desperate time .
Amphibians are widely viewed as the " canaries in the coalmine " for environmental change .
Despite their glorious past , they simply cannot withstand the current onslaught .
Tellingly , the very same factors that threaten amphibians also endanger all other life on Earth , not least humans .
If we cannot rectify the amphibian extinction crisis , then what does this mean for the future of mankind ?
Saving the world 's amphibians is a crucial part of the puzzle in guaranteeing our own sustainable existence .
I hope we will act before it is too late for us all .
Helen Meredith is a conservation scientist from the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Helen Meredith ?
Should we take action to prevent the decline of amphibian species ?
Does their survival matter ?
Who should provide financial support for their conservation ?
It is our responsibility as a species to help the amphibians , as well as all animal and plant species , to recover as it is mostly our fault for their decline .
Joe Wright , Canterbury , England ' Of course amphibians need to be saved , we treat the world and its other inhabitants in such a cavalier fashion that we have destroyed much of its habitat and , inhabitants .
Sooner or later it will no longer be able to support the Human population due to our own greed , and lack of consideration for other life forms .
Who should pay to save the amphibians , we should through our governments and taxes .
Its about time we started putting things right not talking about it .
Big businesses should pay the most because they are the ones who have benefited most from the rape , and destruction of the world 's resources . '
Totally agreed .
Could n't have put it better myself !
And on top of amphibians , there 's such crisis in seemingly every animal group [ human AND natural ] right now .
It 's almost as if nature itself is taking back everything before we can deal the fatal blow , leaving us to die out alone [ which , we kind of deserve by now ] .
Globally , more money needs to actually go towards people and the environment , and not to war , weaponry , fossil fuels and government / bank 's pockets ...
Daniel Bevis , Fleet , Hampshire , UK
It 's still the same long term solution .
Too many people !
When will a politician have the guts to break rank and tell it like it is !
steve johnson , whitwick , leics Obviously , it is very essential to save amphibians in our planet .
As an civil engineer I am to count biodiversity while any development of infrastructure works .
In view of above contexts , we treat the world and its other inhabitants in such a cavalier fashion that we have destroyed much of its habitat and , inhabitants .
We should take action to prevent the decline of amphibian species .
Their survival in the world is vulnerable .
Richer countries are more responsible for their survival .
Its about time we begun putting things right not talking about it .
A government or a large business should provide financial support for their conservation .
Engr Salam , Kushtia , Bangladesh Mankind really is flying without a net .
The way we assume we know it all even when a whole class of life like the amphibians is in great distress .
Creatures we can hardly list let alone know how they interact and play their part in Nature facing extinction .
Dismissed with hardly a thought .
We talk a lot here in the US about security .
Health care security through medical insurance , security from terrorists by having a strong defense , economic security but how has that worked out ?
Has n't it in truth amounted to a failure of the highest order to think small like this and to continue to dump resources into propping up failed policy .
Our ability to fund important research and conservation efforts let alone start new businesses is gutted by seeking false security .
Investment should be shifted to helping protect nature itself .
It 's got to be better than having an insurance policy that 's hardly worth the paper it 's written on , a military that has smart bombs that wind up making enemies or a monetary policy that let derivatives trading run rampant so a few people could get rich .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado , USA it is important the amphibian [ all species ] be given the pretective knowledge required .
They were here first .
so there it is ,
gavin hall , wellington new zealand 100 % agreed , with the concerns of the Helen .
Funding amphibian protection efforts is quite necessary to enhance their numbers and to check their business in the commercial world .
It 's an important but a temporary solution .
Unless we do not protect the wells , ponds , rivers , oceans , fields , forests and atmosphere , we would not be able to give enough space to the amphibians , necessary for their survival .
If we allow our population and present form of activities to grow , with the current pace , there would n't be sufficient space and healthy environment left for these precious species .
It 's not an isolated challenge .
It is 100 % related with the human population and their anti-natural activities .
We are relaxed by believing there are different levels of the ' catastrophes ' .
Those species which have already extinct from the planet , catastrophe ' started and concluded ' .
For the endangered specie the catastrophe is ' going on ' and we are still busy in current trends by not acknowledging the catastrophe trends of the climate change .
If , we can sense danger for the amphibians and other species , then , there is absolute need of urgency for human beings too .
Sanjay Singh Thakur , Indore , India
It remains a mystery to me why it took so long for the scientific community to become aware of this catastrophe .
I am not a trained scientist , but I became aware of a severe crash in frog populations during the middle to late 1970's .
I only noticed that biologists began to mention this in print sometime in the late 1990's .
No matter how many resources , financial and otherwise , can now be brought to bear on the problem , I fail to see exactly what can be done ; especially in combating Chytrid fungus .
What specific suggestions are there ?
This is not to suggest that nothing should be done , but what ?
I hate to be the pessimist , but I fear that humanity has progressed past the point of rescue of our fellow biological travelers upon this earth , and that we are doomed to follow them into oblivion .
And it will be deservedly so .

We need to let the wilds become wild again , which means moving all human encroachment : summer homes , boating , vacation lodges .
We need to recognize the finiteness of our planet and live accordingly , by recognizing not one of us owns any of the space over anybody else .
When we go into the wilds we minimize our footprints , like when they climb Antarctic Mountains , even your excrement must return , and they all do this in hanging tents .
At the beginning of the wilderness , we may have structured camping , with walkin as opposed to drive - in .
We need an ecologically sustainable Global Societal model , where no one lives in destitution .

Of course amphibians need to be saved , we treat the world and its other inhabitants in such a cavalier fashion that we have destroyed much of its habitat and , inhabitants .
Sooner or later it will no longer be able to support the Human population due to our own greed , and lack of consideration for other life forms .
Who should pay to save the amphibians , we should through our governments and taxes .
Its about time we started putting things right not talking about it .
Big businesses should pay the most because they are the ones who have benefited most from the rape , and destruction of the world 's resources .
Arthur Griffiths , Capel Iwan , Carmarthenshire , Wales although I am very sympathetic to the plight of amphibians and quite passionate about our " own " newt here , the rough skinned newt , I really cannot see fromthe article how " a mutually suportive network " is going to make much of a difference in a direct sense .
It rather reminds me of the money - making " portal " idea of the great internet boom / bust period which was supposed to provide coordinated access to other individual and network sites but contributed very little by itself ( and largely became extinct during the bust ) .
More funding for amphibians , yes by all means .
But the irony is that , if we include time and effort by e.g. volunteers and concnerned citizens in the $ $ figure of money already expended on amphibian rescue , the bulk of it is used ( and quite effectively ) for amphibians in areas in what we used to call the developed world .
And I cannot see that changing through the proposed effort , even if it becomes fully funded .

To the Editor :
I noticed the following paragraph in the ' ' Topics ' ' section of the Sept. 29 editorial page :
Is no Washington name exempt from shorthand ?
One , maybe .
The Chief Magistrate responsible for executing the laws is sometimes called the POTUS .
The nine men who interpret them are often the SCOTUS .
The people who enact them are still , for better or worse , Congress .
According to the information available to me , and which I had assumed was generally available , for over two years now SCOTUS has not consisted of nine men .
If you have any contradictory information , I would be grateful if you would forward it as I am sure the POTUS , the SCOTUS and the undersigned ( the FWOTSC ) would be most interested in seeing it .

Subject : Ruby and Ocaml - my two favorite languages
From : " MikkelFJ " < mikkelfj - anti- spam@ g o c >

While being away from Ruby land , I did investigate the OCaml language further .
I 've earlier posted some information on OCaml in this group when I was just starting to look at the OCaml language .
This is a follow up after I have gaining more experience .
I can now confidently say that Ruby and OCaml are at the absolute top of programming languages .
I 'm a bit annoyed with the fact the OCaml is in fact so good the it steals ground from Ruby .
Its a bit like a Japanese sportsmotorcycle compared to a European ditto with the nationalities reversed .
OCaml with static linking with C object files is better suited for large system applications than Ruby both becuase its faster and due to distribution of runtime as exe rather than clear source files .
What really surprised me was that OCaml actually competeded with Ruby in the discipline of rapid prototyping and still managed to produce better code than carefully developed C++ code requiring significantly more development time .
Still many bright things are happening for Ruby and I am certainly not going to dismiss Ruby .
I 'm looking forward to see Ruby increasingly involved in building the future Web both via integration with Apache and the support of Web Services where Google have been kind enough to be a Ruby front runner .
And this is possible the best recognition you can get , because I can't think of a greater application the Google .
Ruby on the other hand is class example in OO development , but what is really great OO or not , is that you can actually write modules of 2 K size that does meaningful things and plugs seamlessly into the development environment .
Ruby initially impressed me with huge number of highly functional but redicously small library implementations in native Ruby .
I spend hours searching for what the rest of the a database interface because it could n't possibly all be in those 2.5 K .
You can also write suprisingly short programs in OCaml , but overall there is more fuzz with getting the source file dependencies right in the makefile which also complicates integrating third party tools not in the standard distribution .
While Ruby is a language with one of the easiest FFI 's ( foreign function interface ) , it is actually easier in OCaml .
In fact it is so easy that provided you stick to certain datatypes , it can be almost be neglected whether you write a function in C or OCaml : Instead of writing a C prototype in a .h file , you write a similar line in OCaml and use it as if it was a native OCaml function .
Accesing OCaml in the C function requires a macro on the argument to get the desired C type , not unlike Ruby .
Callbacks the other way around is also quite managable although not as trivial .
I once looked at an enormously complex JNI interface , only to discover that this was the new greatly simplified JNI interface ... go figure .
The OCaml syntax is not the best I 've seen , so I tried to imagine all kinds of improvements .
However , once I got used to it , I still did n't quite fancy it , but I was hard pressed coming up with anything better that would be equally efficient .
OCaml is as terse as is possible without becoming entirely unreadable .
I think you could actually mix some of Ruby 's syntax with OCamls functional concepts and get an even greater language .
Must do so one day :-)
It appears that you actually write shorter programs in OCaml than in Ruby , however , you also maintain separate interface files for larger programs .
I wrote a Ruby hack to convert Yacc grammar file into a Visual Parse ditto .
This included lineparsing and grabbing a name , making it upper case and add a counter for each alternative of the rule .
Ruby is a natural for these tasks .
I started out doing a manual conversion , but halfway down realized it was actually worthwhile to write a Rubyscript just to complete the other half .
And it actually was faster to write the Ruby program than the manual conversion I did on the first half of the file .
Later I tried to write the same conversion in OCaml both to see how it would work out , and also because I could then have an executable that did not require Ruby to be installed .
I turned out to be equally easy to write the program in OCaml .
Result was possibly slightly shorter .
Execution time was irrelevant but instant in both cases .
The write code then run a test cycle was very fast in both languages .
OCaml has a toplevel interpreter that makes it possible to execute code much like Ruby - but it still needs to link libraries .
For that purpose OCaml has a program that generates a new toplevel interpreter linked with the libraries you specify .
Once a new toplevel with the necessary string library was created , the development phase compared to Ruby .
OCaml requires very frequent tests because it is strongly type checked .
Like Ruby you do not actually write the type because it can figure it out .
However , you do not want to write a bunch of code and then figure out what you did wrong with a host of infered types being something you cannot guess what is .
Upside is that with early test this works well and it did help me avoid some tricky bugs I made in the Ruby version .
The slightly disappointing side of this is , from a Ruby perspective , is that OCaml seems to be strong also in those areas where Ruby were supposed to be uniquely strong .
Still Ruby is the more natural , elegant and accessible language .
Ruby has embedded regular expressions which is something OCaml does not have directly but through a regex type .
Next version of OCaml will include a preprocessor extension that will directly inject regular expressions into the language core , without doing anything to the core language .
This change will also make it possible to create entire lexers directly in the language .
The OCaml preprocessor is far from trivial to work with , but you can do some amazing things with it .
While OCaml do have support for Objects and it does have some kind of polymorphism , this is clearly an area where Ruby is better off thanks to the dynamic typing .
The price in Ruby is that you need more runtype type checks - which is something you 'd have to remember to do in order to avoid runtime errors .
But in the end you have to cover all possibilities somehow in either language .
If I could I 'd use Ruby as a scripting language for application automation language and develop large applications in OCaml .
With these two tools , there is only low - level C programming left and little space left for C++ development .
I can positively say that for certain types of applications OCaml is 5 to 10 times faster to implement than C++ ( for an experienced C++ developer and inexperienced OCaml developer ) because I did prototype in OCaml and subsequently implemented in C ++.
I 've no reason to believe this is different for Ruby , except Ruby does n't link into executables which kind of disqualified it for the purpose .
Runtime wise I have no data , but I 'm sure the runtime is faster in OCaml than C++ due to reduced ability to retain strong typing in C++ without using rather complex template programming .
I believe Ruby runtime would not have been significantly slower for the same reason .
Ruby deals with dynamic typing and handles memory management .
Why is it so much faster to write code in Ruby or OCaml ?
Fewer steps from concept to implementation means less work resulting and fewer errors and faster results increases motivation to see yet more results rather than falling asleep over the debugger .
While I do envy the garbage collection of Java and C# , and possibly the libraries , I still consider C++ a much more powerfull language but also much more difficult and unnecessarily complex .
You can then extrapolite this with what what I wrote above .
Obviously a global standard such as Java is worth much , but the courage to go you own way has a value of its own .
I do not agree with all the Paul Graham writes , but after all it was in the NG I was introduced to his article Beating the Averages .
http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html
Which somehow makes me think of beating the top dog ... [ after writing the above , I found the following article at Grahams site for his new arc language :
http://www.paulgraham.com/vanlfsp.html it mentions OCaml as a langauge for smart people and Java for the masses - your free to add Ruby to LFSM ]
In conclusion : obviously there are many and many good languages around and you can't say a language is the best for all purposes .
But I 've been searching for a successor to C++ and came up with two languages worth further investigation .
So since you already know Ruby , I 'd recommend you also take a look at OCaml .
The very great and huge book developing applications with OCaml was recently published in a preview english translation online : http://www.ocaml.org/
http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/
I feel it has been a long journey to find a new useful language , and I feel compelled to to repeat Doug Baglays editorial because I tend to agree .
Both Ruby and OCaml gets good mention http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/editorial.shtml
But while Ruby and OCaml may be my favorite languages , it is only because C for all its quirks has lifted itself out of the ordinary and become the atmosphere that makes programming possible .
Finally , Ruby cannot too soon get better closure integration as first class values and partial evaluation support .
This is an absolute killer feature of OCaml .
Most of what Ruby does great is thanks to its use of closures and most of what Ocaml does better is thanks to its improved use of closures .
