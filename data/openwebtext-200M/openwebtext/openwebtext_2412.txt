Booed on the ice
It 's hard to blame Sarah Palin for her booing on the ice in Philadelphia this evening .
It 's almost a truism of politics that if you send a pol to a sporting event , he 's going to get booed .
Politicians , as a class , are n't all that popular , and it's what sports fans do .
According to legend , Eagles fans once booed Santa Claus .
Still , not a great moment .
The Times hockey blog says the boos were " resounding . "
The Wilmington paper says it was an " avalanche . "
The booing of Palin ( and her young daughter ) was also predicted by sports types who spoke to my colleague Ken Vogel before the game .
“ I am surprised that the candidate would go on the ice in Philly — Philly fans threw snowballs at Santa Claus and booed Beyonce ( * ) because she was wearing a Michael Jordan dress , " said Ted Leonsis , owner of the Washington Capitals , a conference rival of the Flyers .
" This is dangerous territory . ”
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , a former Philly mayor and big fan of the town ’s sports teams , also said before the game he did n’t think the puck - drop was a good idea .
“ Sports and politics , I believe , never mix , ” Rendell told Politico after introducing Barack Obama at a North Philadelphia rally .
“ But the mayor threw out the first pitch at the Phillies game and he got a standing ovation , ” Rendell said of Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter , who also attended the rally and was standing beside Rendell .
“ It was a strike , ” Nutter deadpanned .
Video of Palin 's turn on the ice is here .
Crude oil prices tumbled below $ 50 Thursday for the first time since May 2005 as jobless claims hit a 16 - year record and financial markets sank .
But oil refiners , the chief buyers of crude , are n't celebrating .
Gasoline prices are falling even harder and faster , so U.S. refiners are losing money on every gallon of gasoline they sell .
Light sweet crude plunged 7 % to $ 49.62 a barrel .
Wholesale gasoline in the Gulf : $ 40.74 a barrel .
Such topsy - turvy economics have happened on occasion for a few days .
But the current pricing turnabout has lasted seven weeks and could persist a few more months , says Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst with the Oil Price Information Service .
" It 's unprecedented , " Kloza says .
Although refiners offset their gasoline losses with profits on diesel fuel , " if your feedstock costs more than your marquee product , you 've got a problem . "
The average retail price of a gallon of regular gas fell 2.7 cents to $ 2.02 and OPIS expects it to dip below $ 2 Friday .
Both crude oil and pump prices have plunged since July .
But while crude is linked to a weak global energy market , wholesale gasoline has been hammered by a sharper drop in U.S. demand .
Do n't start sending oil companies your extra pennies — yet .
Many independent refiners notched healthy profits in the third quarter , largely because Hurricanes Ike and Gustav knocked out capacity and raised prices , and they 're making lots of money on diesel .
Diesel demand has soared worldwide on heavy consumption by European motorists and Asian power plants and factories .
That 's pushed diesel prices nearly $ 1 higher than gasoline vs. an average 30 - cent spread .
But the global recession is dampening diesel demand just as refining capacity is growing .
Next year , 2.5 million barrels a day of capacity is to be installed overseas , with the U.S. adding 250,000 barrels a day , says Credit Suisse analyst Mark Flannery .
That 's sure to narrow fat diesel margins of $ 20 a barrel .
Flannery predicts a shakeout in which small , inefficient refineries — and those that can't process cheaper , heavier crudes — shut down .
Francisco Blanch , head of commodities research at Merrill Lynch , says at least 10 % of U.S. refiners will close .
Shares of refiners such as No. 1 Valero , Tesoro and Western Refining have swooned 80 % to 90 % the past year .
To make do , refiners are trimming gasoline production , but they can't just stop making the stuff .
Every barrel of oil yields about 50 % gasoline and 30 % diesel and heating oil .
" None of us likes selling product at a loss , but you can't turn a refinery on and off " daily , says Mark Cox , senior vice president and treasurer of Western Refining .
" Markets are extremely dynamic . "

Now that the 2008 election is over , reporters are spilling all the juiciest , and previously off the record , gossip from the campaign trail .
Much of it is about the infighting between Palin and McCain ’s staff , as Newsweek ’s treasure trove of post- election gossip reveals .
However , perhaps one of the most astounding and previously unknown tidbits about Sarah Palin has to do with her already dubious grasp of geography .
According to Fox News Chief White House Correspondent Carl Cameron , there was great concern within the McCain campaign that Palin lacked “ a degree of knowledgeability necessary to be a running mate , a vice president , a heartbeat away from the presidency , ” in part because she did n’t know which countries were in NAFTA , and she “ did n’t understand that Africa was a continent , rather than a series , a country just in itself . ”

After Brendan
Hart left the Marine Corps in 2005 , he wanted to reconnect with other veterans , people who would understand what he went through and what support he might need .
Plenty of services exist , says Hart , 26 , who is on medical leave from Dartmouth College because of a contaminated smallpox vaccine he was given while serving .
But finding them was another matter .
BETTER LIFE :
More on mental health
Hart launched Student Veterans of America , and now he is applauding a service launching today in honor of Veterans Day : MyVetwork .
It is a non-profit social Web community that seeks to bring together veterans , their families and their supporters .
" When I was making a transition out of the military , I had a ton of questions that I could not find thorough and honest answers for , " says Hart , who lives in New York City .
Sometimes , veterans are reluctant to seek out services , says Jaine Darwin , a psychologist who directs Strategic Outreach to Families of All Reservists , a non-profit providing free mental health support to extended family of those in the Reserve and National Guard who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Based in Cambridge , Mass. , the group has expanded to Michigan and soon will offer services to New York and southeastern Florida .
" So much of what soldiers are concerned about feels shameful to them , " Darwin says .
" Soldiers are not supposed to be fearful .
Soldiers are not supposed to be scared .
They 're not supposed to be upset by things they did . "
That 's why they need support .
" Soldiers have two families : a family they fight alongside and the family they come home to , " Darwin says .
" And when you have been fighting , you forge very important bonds .
" Veterans who come home often feel the only people who can understand them and their experience is someone else who has served . "
The Web can make veterans feel safer because they do n't face the people to whom they are talking , she says .
New veterans who have been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan also are more technologically inclined than their predecessors , she adds .
MyVetwork is meant to serve an entire community of veterans and their supporters , says John Campbell , a Vietnam veteran who is founder and CEO .
When Campbell came home from Vietnam , there was little information on getting support for either himself or his family , he says .
" I remember just how difficult that was for ( his family ) , and I also remember the sense of survivor guilt when one leaves the battlefield and your comrades are there . "
Members of the military and veterans community belong to many social networks , such as MySpace and Facebook .
Other sites are aimed at veterans , including USVetSpace , NavyVets and one that launched Monday , CommunityofVeterans.org .
It is backed by Afghanistan Veterans of America and the Ad Council in conjunction with a national multimedia public service advertising campaign .
Campbell welcomes sites that help veterans .
" This is a population that has been underserved for years , " he says .
" We 're thrilled that everyone is finally stepping up .
The launch of MyVetwork is n't about fighting for a piece of the pie .
This is about growing the pie .
The more resources the better . "
MyVetwork is non-partisan .
People connect by stating their interests or by searching out individuals .
Campbell envisions mothers of veterans finding each other in times of need and more experienced veterans helping those who are just emerging from service .
Maura Sullivan , a Marine Corps second lieutenant who was fortunate to find a community with people at Harvard , where she is earning joint business and public policy degrees , hopes MyVetwork gives others the same kind of opportunity to connect .
The community , where she is volunteering her time , could provide everything from résumé help to moral support .
" I 've seen some of my friends really struggle when they got out of the Marine Corps and went into the civilian world . "
Those people would be well served by a comprehensive social network , Sullivan says .

They kicked open the door and unlawfully entered in to the private space .
Joaquin Cienfuegos , a member of RAC and Copwatch LA Guerrilla chapter was targeted by the police and pulled out from the space .
When folks inside the space heard what was going on in front they went over to observe and document what was going on .
Joaquin asked why he was being detained and they told him to " Shut up " and " Do as he 's told " .
He was handcuffed and searched without his permission .
While he was being searched Joaquin stated loud and clear that he did not consent to their search and once again asked to please be told why he was being detained .
While i was at the door way observing what they were doing to the comrade outside i could see the the street was blocked off and there were about 12 police cars on 6th street and about 30 or more Deputies / Depupigs .
As we tried to get cameras to document what was going on the police rushed the door again and i was pulled outside by 4 police officers .
They pushed me against the wall and made me place my hands on top of my head and searched me .
I asked the Officer why i was being detained and he said , " A crime had been committed a few blocks away and they were going to bring the victim to identify the person . "
As i was pulled out , the folks inside closed the door to prevent the rush of pigs into the property .
They began to kick the door and yell at the folks inside to get out .
Not once did they announce themselves as the Police Department or why they were there or wanted folks to exit the show .
Police officers were outside making joke ; " Do you smell that ?
i think its weed , we should go inside and find out " , and " This is some kind of illegal rave or show or what do we call it ? " .
Clearly unable to choose a reason why they were trying to raid the space they made up whatever we want .
After i had been searched , a female officer came over and i asked once again why i was being detained .
She stated that this was an illegal gathering and they wanted to figure it all out .
Officers were walking all over the front in very confused manner having to be told by other officers to move out of the way .
I could see the shadows on the officers behind me and Joaquin who continued to hold their hands on their weapons while we were handcuffed with our hands behind our backs .
After the police ignored the request by the owner of the space to present a search warrant or leave the private property , the comrades from the Black Liberation Party that were there in part to perform for the fundraiser exited the building and were immediately detained and sister Nadia and Kambui were placed in handcuffs and the rest of the the Black Riders where made to face the wall .
The police then rushed inside and pulled everyone out .
They had us right in front of the space and then made me walk down the blocked as they lined everyone up against the wall .
They pull more than 60 people out from the space and had them with their hands against their back facing the wall .
They separted the women from the men and began to search everyone .
A police officer that searched me came and asked for my ID .
They said they were going to check me for warrants or any priors .
He pulled out my ID and pulled out a card that he began to fill in with all my personal information .
I asked what that card was for but i was not given an answer .
My ID was returned but the card with my information was kept by them .
After they searched everyone 's belongings they lined up all the males and females and said that this was going to be a line - up and they were going to bring the the victim of the crime to identify the perpetrator .
When asked what crime ( had been committed ) an officer told another brother that they had had a crime committed a few blocks away and some beer was stolen from a liquor store .
When asked why so many officers where there for stolen beer the officer said , " He didnt know " , that they just felt that whoever committed the crime was in the space .
A police helicopter was circling and made the announcement after everyone was removed that they were the LAPD .
2 folks from Food Not Bombs who were in the premise were pulled out and placed in handcuffs .
A police car with 2 Officers in the front and a woman in the back seat drove by slowly .
The officers proceeded to tell people to look into the light and not look at the car .
Everyone said they could n't look at the light because it hurt their eyes but the officers from inside continued to shine the light into people 's eyes .
As this was going on , officers continued to line up and make jokes about " overtime " and the way different folks were dressed .
For one officer in particular he lamented his rookie friend , " was off tonight because he would have loved to have been a part of this ! "
As the police car made its way down the street they stopped and singled out one youth .
He was immediately arrested .
They drove back again slowly and continued to point the light in people 's face .
My handcuffs were removed but i was not allowed to leave .
i was made to remain facing the fence with my hands behind my back .
After a police officer from some other car came with a pience of paper and pointed to Nadia and Kambui from the black Riders Liberation Part and said they were being detained for " 148 " - interfering with a police officer .
When people asked why they were being detained or singled out police officers told them to shut up .
They placed them both in cuffs and removed all their belongings and put them into plastic bags .
They were then placed into the backseat of a police car .
Another police officer came and then annonced that the party was over and people needed to leave .
People still had equipment inside and were made to line up and escorted inside to get thier belongings .
While inside i noticed that money from the fundraiser was missing and according to folks inside the money was there before the police ran inside to pull everyone out .
We got out all the groups ' equipment and waited for someone to come close the space .
They continued to harass people and tried to intimidate many of the youth to leave and to learn their lesson .
Besides the one youth that was arrested for supposedly stealing beer , everyone was arrested for interfering with a police officer when all they asked was why they were being detained .
The officers were congragulating themselves and laughing at everyone .
Many of the officers were staring down many of the sisters that were there and making sexist jokes about he'd rather be home with his wife than here .
Then he proceeded to make a hand gesture to 2 sisters who were standing near by .
No one but the other officers were amused by these pigs but they continued to talk shit and tell people to leave .
The majority officers left smiling and staring at folks in attempts to instigate some incident to lead to further arrest .
While we were waiting the final officer drove by and rolled down his window .
He stated "
Im sorry we had to shut down your party but you have to keep the youngsters in check and can't be letting them go anywhere stealing beer .
If they had n't stolen the beer we wouldnt have canceled your show "
Everyone was pissed as this provacateur behavior which is being utilized as the excuse to enter into private property and raid a peaceful gathering .
The police looked for whatever excuse to shut the show down .
Joaquin is currently being held for misdemeanor .
He has not been taken to jail and is still being held by Central Division .
He will probably be going to court tomorrow or Wednesday .
Please spread the word .
Help support Joaquin and the Black Riders Liberation Party and Food Not Bombs folks to get out .
This is a quick report trying to include as many of the important details as possible but i'm sure i might have overlooked other important details from last night that other folks who were also there can maybe share and i will try and write more about last night later tonight and will follow up with more details .

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER , Florida ( CNN ) -- NASA said Saturday that the day - old mission of space shuttle Endeavour , which is carrying seven astronauts to the international space station , is going smoothly despite problems with a lost thermal blanket and a malfunctioning antenna .
Space shuttle Endeavour lifted off at 7:55 p.m. ET on Friday , en route to the international space station .
Launch director Mike Leinbach said that , on Day 2 , the mission is going " extremely well " after a flawless takeoff and ascent during a rare nighttime launch Friday .
A piece of thermal blanket came loose from the shuttle shortly after launch , mission managers say .
The blanket was about 4 inches wide and 12 to 18 inches long , and managers say it came from an area that is " not of great concern " in terms of protecting the shuttle during the intense heat of takeoff and re-entry into Earth 's atmosphere .
Aboard Endeavour on Saturday , astronauts Eric Boe , Don Pettit and Shane Kimbrough were using the shuttle 's robotic arm to look at its wings and nosecap to check for damage to the thermal - protection system .
Those areas are the most vulnerable to heat damage .
It was a gash on the wing of space shuttle Columbia that caused its destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts during re-entry February 1 , 2003 .

The shuttle 's other problem involves a balky antenna that could affect radar and communications .
NASA 's Leroy Cain said that the problem would affect the mission 's ground crew more than the astronauts and that it most likely came from problems with a software upgrade .
If the radar is affected , the crew will have to use a different method of rendezvous with the space station .
While there , the astronauts will increase the station 's living space with room for six instead of the current three .
They 'll install more places to sleep , another bathroom , a better water system , more exercise equipment and a bigger refrigerator .
The population on board the space station is to grow to six next spring .
Also on tap are four space walks focusing on the station 's two Solar Alpha Rotary Joints , which allow the solar panels to track the sun .
The shuttle is also bringing Thanksgiving dinner , with irradiated turkey , candied yams , stuffing and dessert , because it wo n't be returning to earth until November 29 .
Flight engineer Greg Chamitoff will return to earth from the station when Endeavour returns at the end of the month , leaving mission specialist Sandra Magnus to take his place .
Other members of the crew are commander Chris Ferguson , mission specialist Heidemarie Stefanyshyn - Piper and mission specialist Steve Bowen .
CNN 's Marsha Walton contributed to this report .
All About Space Shuttle Endeavour
CHARLOTTE , N.C. --
The Detroit Pistons overcame a wild , emotional day to crush their old coach 's new team .
It did n't mean they were easily coming to grips with the blockbuster deal that shook the foundation of their core .
It was clear after their 101- 83 rout of the Charlotte Bobcats on Monday night that it 's going to take the Pistons time to warm to the idea that Allen Iverson is now their teammate -- and Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyess are headed to Denver .
" Do we like the trade ?
Maybe not .
Ain't no telling , " forward Rasheed Wallace said .
Added Tayshaun Prince : " When you have six straight years with somebody , you 've got that bond , that connection .
Now all of a sudden it 's gone . "
Richard Hamilton scored 19 points and the Pistons toyed with Larry Brown 's Bobcats , improving to 3 - 0 and perhaps showing Iverson that he 'll have plenty of scoring options when he takes over at point guard .
But from the tone of the subdued locker room , Iverson will have to win over his new teammates as he joins a team used to being among the Eastern Conference powers .
" Obviously we 're all shocked by the situation , " Prince said .
" We 're going to go out and play .
Under the circumstances I thought it was a good win .
No matter who you play , when something happens like this it's tough for the team to go out and play .
We were able to come out with a win . "
Wallace added 15 points and four other players scored in double figures .
Rodney Stuckey replaced the departed Billups at point guard and had nine points and three assists as Detroit shot 50 percent .
" It was a tough game , " coach Michael Curry said .
" When your captain gets traded and Dice , who 's not a captain , but is one of the emotional leaders of this team , it 's a tough day for the guys . "
Shannon Brown came off the bench to score 16 points , and Gerald Wallace had 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte , which could n't build off Saturday 's win over Miami in the beginning of a week of reunions for the well - traveled Brown , who has his own problems .
Brown , who has lamented managing partner Michael Jordan 's inability to bring in more depth up front , was clearly frustrated after being overmatched by the team Brown led to the NBA title in 2004 .
" I 've known our problems since May .
We 've got to address them somehow , " Brown said .
The beginning of Brown 's reunion week -- he visits New York on Wednesday , where he spent one ugly 23 - win season in 2005 - 06 -- was overshadowed by Detroit 's makeover .
The Pistons arrived in Charlotte on Sunday while president of basketball operations Joe Dumars worked into the night on a trade he felt would give his team a different way to win games " other than the same predictable way we 've been doing it for quite some time . "
Informed they were headed to Denver early Monday , Billups , McDyess and project Cheikh Samb left town before the morning shootaround .
It left Detroit with 12 players -- and Stuckey starting at point guard -- against their former coach .
Stuckey , wearing No. 3 in perhaps a precursor to the Iverson era , had only one turnover and Detroit showed its depth , inside play , rebounding prowess and steady outside shooting to overwhelm Browns ' ninth NBA team .
Hamilton , who reportedly agreed to a three - year contract extension Monday in the midst of the Iverson trade , scored 11 points in the third quarter when the Pistons pulled away .
His 3 - pointer and mid-range jumper on consecutive possessions made it 76 - 60 .
Playing again without forward Sean May , who is struggling with his weight and conditioning following knee surgery , the Bobcats could n't recover with their undersized lineup that included 6 - foot - 7 Jared Dudley at power forward .
Held most of the time to one shot , the Bobcats were outrebounded 42 - 31 .
" You can get away with it against Miami , " Brown said of Saturday 's win against the undersized Heat .
" You 're not going to get away with it against 6 - 10 , 6 - 11 , 6 - 10 frontline , all athletic .
It just does n't happen . "
Charlotte did recover from a 12 - point first - half deficit , but faded in the second half as Jason Richardson was held to four points on 2 - of - 10 shooting .
The Pistons were headed to Toronto for Wednesday 's game , where Iverson was expected to join them .
" I ca n't talk about it until we see it happen , " Rasheed Wallace said .
" Who knows ? "
Game notes
Stuckey would n't say whether he 'll give up his No. 3 jersey to Iverson .
" We 're going to have to talk about that , I guess , " Stuckey said .
...
More than 2 ½ hours before tipoff , May was on the floor doing conditioning drills .
Brown said May will remain on the inactive list until he gets into game shape following microfracture knee surgery .
" It 's not any punishment , " Brown said .
" It 's what 's best for him right now . " ... Referee Bennett Salvatore hit Rasheed Wallace with a technical foul in the third quarter .
Texas Prison Rodeo History
The Texas Prison Rodeo was launched in 1931 during the depression years , being first held at the baseball park outside the " Walls " Unit .
The baseball park , located on the east side of the prison , was normally home to the Walls Tigers baseball team .
The rodeo was the brainchild of Lee Simmons , General Manager of the Texas Prison System .
Simmons envisioned it as entertainment for employees and inmates .
Welfare Director Albert Moore headed up the organization and planning for the early rodeos along with Warden Walter Waid and livestock supervisor , R. O. McFarland .
The attendants included a small crowd of local citizens and prison .
Simmons realized he had a winner on his hands .
Two years later , over l5,000 fans traveled to Huntsville for the show .
Soon , the Texas Prison Rodeo was drawing the largest crowds for a sporting event in the state of Texas .
With a lifespan of more than 50 years , the Prison Rodeo became a Texas tradition , held every Sunday in October .
Crowds grew to exceed 100,000 in some years .
Hard Money , Any Way You Look at It Rodeo events included wild cow milking , calf belling , goat roping , wild mare milking and bull dogging as well as the standard rodeo events such as bull riding , saddle bronc and bareback bronc .
Wild horse racing was added to the list in the early 1940's .
A favorite event unique to the Texas Prison Rodeo was the Hard Money Event .
Forty Inmates with red shirts were turned into the arena with a raging wild bull with a Bull Durham tobacco sack tied between its horns .
The object was for some brave inmate to get the sack and take it to the Judge .
Fifty dollars had been placed in the sack but donations often ran the pay up , sometimes to $ 1500 .
This became a very popular event for the inmates due to the amount of money involved and was one of the most dangerous ones as well .
The fast action kept fans on the edge of their seats throughout the event .
An inmate tries his luck in the " Hard Money " event .
No Rodeo , Not All on Sunday , Not All in Huntsville
The rodeo was not held in 1943 due to the war but when it returned in1944 , all profits from the " Victory " rodeo were invested in war bonds to contribute to the war effort .
1950 was the first and only time the show made a road appearance .
It was held in Dallas in the early summer .
A new structure made of concrete , steel , and brick was built to replace the old baseball stadium .
Weekday rodeos were added to the regularly scheduled Sunday performances in some years and in one year , 1942 , the rodeos were all held on Thursdays .
Several inmates ride bulls during the " Mad Cow Scramble " event .
Stars and Barrs Guest stars appeared in the 1951 rodeo including : Eddie Arnold , Guy Willis , Curley Fox and Texas Ruby .
This started a yearly tradition which attracted such stars as Johnny Cash , Ernest Tubb , Johnny Rodriguez , Willie Nelson , Dolly Parton , George Strait , Tom T. Hall and the list goes on ...
Of course , inmate bands also provided a variety of musical entertainment at the rodeo .
The most famous inmate performer and one who sometimes stole the show from the paid entertainers was inmate Juanita Phillips .
She was better known in the " free world ” as Candy Barr .
The cowboys , clowns and entertainers of the Texas Prison Rodeo were composed of all types of inmates from all of the units within the Texas Department of Corrections .
Some of these men had never been in a rodeo or ridden on an animal in their lives .
But it was an honor and a status symbol to be among the cowboys selected to compete in the rodeo .
The last rodeo was held on October 26 , 1986 .
The fans , including several hundred inmates were entertained by the mother and daughter duo , The Judds .
Following the day ’s performances , the chute gates were closed for good .
Due to costly renovations that the prison system said were necessary to the arena stands , the rodeo was shut down after 1986 .
There have been discussions of resurrecting this event .
However , it will most likely remain only a fond memory for those who participated in , attended , or worked at The Wildest Show Behind Bars ...

World Demand collapsing By Chris Laird
Nov 20 2008 10:42 AM www.prudentsquirrel.com
World economic demand is now collapsing along with the yearlong credit collapse .
Recent news is full of stories about how world economic demand fell off a cliff in October , 08 .
Every sector is being hit , from new cars to recycled cardboard .
In each case , October is pointed to where economic demand fell off a cliff …
Cars with nowhere to go in Long Beach harbor , California .
Japanese ones !
NYTimes.com
“ The ships keep coming , but there ’s nowhere for the cars to go , ” Mr. Golledge said .
“ Not far away , metal , cardboard , paper and plastic are piling up in the lot of Corridor Recycling .
The company takes in refuse from around the country , then bales it for shipment to China .
The cardboard is used to make new boxes while used shrink wrap is turned into shoe soles and insulation for sleeping bags and coats .
For much of this year , the company shipped about 25 containers a day , each filled with 23 tons of refuse to be recycled .
But after the Olympics , demand slowed for recycled metal .
In October , demand for everything else took a sharp downturn , and for the last two weeks the company has not shipped a single container .
“ It just came to a complete stop .
Absolutely a stop , ” said Gilbert Dodson , the recycling company ’s co-owner .
“ I ’ve seen it slow over the last 25 years , but this is the worst , ” he said of the current downturn ... ”
NYTimes.com
There are stories about ships all over the world stacking up in exporting countries , anchored , and not able to sail because they can not get letters of credit for the shipments .
Hong Kong was mentioned as having rows and rows of loaded but idled ships stuck there .
The same goes for oil tankers , lines of them anchored even though they are full , with no buyers .
There has been a screeching halt of shipping worldwide .
Products are backing up in Asia .
Many of you have heard about the collapse of the Baltic Dry index , a shipping index for containers .
It has fallen from over 11,000 in July to around 800 , in only a couple of months !
Panicky China
Over 100,000 factories in China are to close by the end of the year .
Chinese plant owners are abandoning their plants , unable to pay their bills , and abandoning workers with months of back pay unpaid .
That is so serious that riots are breaking out in Chinese cities , and even now there is 10 Pct unemployment in some of the biggest exporting cities in provinces like Guangdong .
Unemployment in the cities is one thing that scares China .
That ’s why they came up with that $ 500 billion stimulus plan .
Compared to the size of the Chinese economy , that ’s like the US coming up with a $ 2 trillion economic stimulus .
Such a sudden and immense move is unheard of in China .
It ’s said that China is actually buying some of their own inventory that is stacking up .
GM bankruptcy
With the prospects of a US auto bailout shrinking , GM will go bankrupt in a couple of months , they say .
If that happens , the commodity complex will take that as a big sell .
It ’s said that a car uses up to 40 pounds of copper , and a house in the US uses 400 pounds or more .
Copper has fallen drastically in the last two months .
Copper is considered a barometer of economic demand .
There are calls for GM to go ahead and declare bankruptcy while they still have some cash .
We just might see that happen right after Congress adjourns for the year , if there is no bailout .
The stock crash Tuesday at the end of the day reflected that sentiment .
Will we see a GM BK filing sooner than we think ?
Credit has not improved Credit spreads have not improved .
There is flight out of any and all bonds into US Treasuries of all stripes .
Now even 30 year US Treasuries have fallen below 4 % , while the 3 months short term USTs are below a half percent , nearing zero .
There is literally no money going into new credit of all stripes , and this is worldwide too .
Businesses cannot roll over their short term credit facilities .
That means they have to operate on a cash basis .
This has worsened in the last two months , not improved .
What that means is that when the cash runs out , they have to shut down , and layoffs come .
Get ready for a horrific next few months of layoff news around the world .
Shortages ?
We already mentioned how the literal total absence of credit is stalling ships at the docks .
I am starting to get concerned that , with the supply chain so tight ( typically 3 days worth in pipeline ) we may see shortages of many things if this credit meltdown and its resultant freeze on exports continues .
Japanese exports have fallen almost 8 % year over year , and exports to the EU have fallen an astounding 17 % .
Japanese auto exports have fallen 15 % .
I know we focused here on autos , but since most everything is manufactured and shipped overseas it ’s very possible that we will run out of many things , and so will our trade partners .
Right now there is surplus backing up in some things like cars , but after factories worldwide shut down , scarcity will start to appear .
That will take some time , but it ’s probably coming later .
There wo n’t be any money out there for new production demand by then either .
Everybody is over leveraged .
Layoffs have only just begun
In the mean time , since inventories are piling up , manufacturers will be shutting down plants worldwide .
Big layoffs are coming everywhere .
The end of 08 , and 09 are going to be the worst layoffs worldwide we have seen since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
Another Great Depression ?
So , since world demand is literally falling off a cliff since October , and businesses are running out of cash ( there is no credit at all out there for the companies or their customers ) , it appears we are indeed in the beginning stages of a real world economic depression , what ’s next ?
USD prospects
First , as far as the USD goes , things do n’t look good .
The USD already had big problems with the US fiscal and trade deficits totaling $ 1 trillion a year for the last 5 years .
Now , the fiscal deficit alone will be over $ 1 trillion and growing .
Sure , a slowing economy will bring down the US trade deficit , but the pressures on the USD are becoming big enough to cause real trouble .
Another thing is that the USD has been held up for decades by the US appetite for imports .
As the US economy falls into depression , the incentive for our trade partners to keep buying US bonds to fund our fiscal deficits dwindles .
Right now , there is seemingly unlimited demand for US treasuries .
But , that will change .
Right now , there is flight to safety of any kind .
Since every government on the planet is carrying a huge public debt , the US seems one of the best bets – for now .
But , at a $ trillion a year US fiscal deficit , and with other governments now needing to use their excess dollars to support their own fiscal deficits and try to prop up their economies ( China for example ) , the appetite for US treasuries will fall dramatically at some point .
Again , this is guaranteed by a big drop in US import demand .
Currency crises , USD
As we mentioned in the last public article , there are ongoing currency crises brewing right now .
Russia is literally chewing through those foreign reserves they built up in the last 5 years commodity boom to defend the Ruble .
They have been forced to give up .
Korea has big trouble with the Won .
They also have chewed through a lot of their foreign reserves defending it .
And it ’s doubtful they have enough foreign reserves to handle a lot of short term commercial credit that is not rolling over , and their businesses are in big trouble from that , and that is building to a head in the next month .
Russia has the same issues with having to roll over hundreds of billions of short term credit in the next month , aside from trying to defend the Ruble .
The USD has strengthened from all this in several ways .
It is in demand as the main settlement currency worldwide .
That is why the US Fed has had to make unprecedented amounts of currency swaps with the world ’s central banks recently ( currency swaps are where central banks trade currencies to get dollars or whatever between themselves ) .
And then , as we mentioned before , the US treasury bonds are regarded as safe , for now .
But the USD is reaching a tipping point .
What ’s keeping it alive now is the flight to cash and safety .
But that process will peter out , and then the $ trillion dollar US fiscal deficits , combined with the pullback of trade partner interest in US treasury bonds will end up killing the dollar .
How far off is that stage ?
Maybe 2 to 4 years .
Frankly , I think it ’s nearer than we all might think .
It certainly is now an imminent concern , not a thing far out in the future .
It ’s even possible the USD could have a drastic fall in 09 .
World currency turmoil , not just the USD
And , the currency turmoil in general is going to worsen all over the world , not just for the US .
The EU political and fiscal situation is not a lot better than the US .
The Euro is saddled with big fiscal deficits throughout the EU that are getting worse .
The dissention between the weaker economies like France vs stronger Germany is hitting the creditability of the Euro .
That ’s one reason it ’s dropping .
Then , consider that , politically , the EU is not stable at all .
Remember , this whole EU Euro experiment is barely 10 years old .
Other currencies such as our trade partners ’ are in doubt .
Again , consider Russia and Korea , and many others we are n’t mentioning .
Since these economies are still predicated on trade with the West , especially the US and the EU , if the USD goes down , so do their economies and their currencies .
There will definitely be a big world currency domino effect if the USD has a devaluation or confidence crisis .
This is one reason that we suggest some currency diversification , to include precious metals of course .
Of course the hard question is which ones ?
None are sure havens alone .
Gold prices
And as we mentioned before , gold and precious metal prices are dropping in the paper markets , since everything is being sold to get cash .
Gold is one of the ones that will remain standing .
It ’s cash par excellence and a central bank reserve asset .
Of course the gold stocks and metal stocks are getting hit too .
But this is all general liquidation from the funds … whew a lot is going on is n’t it .
401 ks etc
We continue to be concerned about tax deferred retirements .
First , the tax deferral is something that is a red herring .
Since the US is running ruinous fiscal deficits , taxes on ‘ tax deferred ’ retirements will be raised dramatically as the US starts to enter a USD crisis .
Second , we view most of the tax deferred retirement plans as only serving the brokerages ( who pushed the whole idea when it was invented decades ago ) and mainly a big savings account for the governments .
If that grows , the governments have more taxes to collect , do n’t they ?
And then , a huge drawback of tax deferred accounts is that it deters people from getting liquid and cashing out .
The money is kind of locked in there since people do n’t want to take the tax hit .
These concerns about tax deferred accounts apply to pretty much any country too .
And then , by being sort of frozen , people end up riding bear markets down with these tax deferred accounts , instead of doing something that really puts meat on their monthly budget table – like paying off the house .
A paid off residence puts a roof over your head .
And you ca n’t live inside a 401k , now can you .
The other thing is a paid off residence is the single greatest defense against an economic depression and a USD collapse .
Gold is for some cash type protection from a USD collapse … .

We alerted our subscribers April 20 that the USD was bottoming and that a general commodity correction was coming .
The USD has strengthened significantly since .
The alerts include quick notification of important financial news developments by email .
Subscribers tell us that the alerts alone are worth subscribing for .
I had one potential subscriber ask me if the newsletter has much more content than these public articles , ie , if it was worth subscribing .
The answer is that the public articles have less than 10 % of our research and conclusions that subscribers see , not to mention the subscriber email alerts of important breaking financial news .
We have anticipated many significant market moves in the last year , such as imminent drops in world stock markets within days of them happening , and big swings in the gold markets within days of them occurring .
We have also made a number of good calls on big currency swings , such as with the USD , the Euro and the Yen .

Wow …
There ARE things people wo n’t say or do for money ..
Refreshing .
TPM :
Some three dozen workers at a telemarketing call center in Indiana walked off the job rather than read an incendiary McCain campaign script attacking Barack Obama , according to two workers at the center and one of their parents .
Nina Williams , a stay - at - home mom in Lake County , Indiana , tells us that her daughter recently called her from her job at the center , upset that she had been asked to read a script attacking Obama for being “ dangerously weak on crime , ” “ coddling criminals , ” and for voting against “ protecting children from danger . ”
Williams ’ daughter told her that up to 40 of her co-workers had refused to read the script , and had left the call center after supervisors told them that they would have to either read the call or leave , Williams says .
The call center is called Americall , and it ’s located in Hobart , IN .
“ They walked out , ” Williams says of her daughter and her co-workers , adding that they were n’t fired but willingly sacrificed pay rather than read the lines .
“ They were told [ by supervisors ] , ` If you all leave , you ’re not gonna get paid for the rest of the day . ”

The billing application was slow .
And not slow in the taking - 30 - seconds - to - start - up sense , but slow in the ridiculously - freaking - slow sense .
Loading an invoice took between ten and fifteen minutes .
Updating a line item on an invoice took up to a minute .
And saving the invoice back to the database took even longer than loading it in the first place .
Clearly , things could n't stay this way – a minimum of 25 minutes to update a single invoice was completely unacceptable .
They needed an expert .
They needed ...
The Optimizer .
Kent had earned his reputation by making a simple but dramatic improvement in another application 's performance .
A database server had been set up with the default cache size , 64KB .
Seeing that it could have been using a full 16MB , he changed the setting and performance improved considerably .
Simple as it was , he was immediately hailed as a hero , and because of that , the powers that be wanted to put him on the billing application .
For Kent , this was going to be a much bigger challenge .
The billing system was not only known for its slowness , but for its bugginess .
Throwing more hardware at the problem would only take them so far , and some invoices loaded quicker than others .
Furthermore , and even more troubling , some of the prices just did n't work .
Most of the prices were " marketing rounded " ( $ 599.99 as opposed to $ 600.00 ) , but for certain numbers that did n't work , they had workarounds .
For $ 700 , for example , they used $ 699.95 because $ 699.99 did n't work right .
The highest price they could have was $ 999.99 , because as the previous developer had told them , the hardware was n't powerful enough for a thousands digit .
Kent knew where to start – in the database .
Searching by variable name in the application code was usually an exercise in how soon he'd be reaching for some aspirin ; the database is where the answers are .
It did n't take him long to find the columns DOLLARS and SENSE [ sic ] .
OK , sure , using floating point numbers can occasionally have its pitfalls , so maybe this was an intentional choice .
The data certainly looked ok .
Nothing in DOLLARS was above 999 , and nothing in SENSE was above 99 .
Now that he had his column names , Kent could start looking at the actual code .
His search led him to some scary code comments .
" Some prices are wrong , I do n't know why , " " Fix this " and " OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE . "
OK , the last one was an exagerration , but the comments were very troubling , and worse , Kent could n't make heads or tails of the code that accompanied the comments .
His descent took him further and further into the twisty passages of the codebase which , as it happened , was written in assembly .
To make the whole system run fast , of course .
Kent eventually stumbled upon a file that stored basically a giant two dimensional array .
In pseudocode ( as the original assembler would be too painful ) , the file would 've looked like so :
decimal [ 1000 , 100 ] prices = {{ 0.00 , 0.01 , ... , 0.98 , 0.99 } , { 1.00 , 1.01 , ... , 1.98 , 1.99 } , { 2.00 , 2.01 , ... , 2.98 , 2.99 } , { 3.00 , 3.01 , ... , 3.98 , 3.99 } , { 4.00 , 4.01 , ... , 4.98 , 4.99 } , ... { 999.00 , 999.01 , ... , 999.98 , 999.99}} ;
OK , Kent thought , scratching his head .
Why would every valid price be in a giant array ?
The array took nearly 80 KB of memory , which partly explained why the binary was so large , but still it seemed like it was much larger than it should be ...
Kent peeked at the last assembler log and learned that the array is n't declared once and used repeatedly – it 's included everywhere it 's used .
Which was over 100 times .
As for how this price lookup was used , following is some more pseudocode :
pointer=&array ; // Location of the start of the array offset=0 ; price_offset=price_in_dollars + price_in_cents ; price_offset=(price_in_dollars * 100 ) + price_in_cents ; for ( x=0 ; x< price_offset ; x++ ) { offset ++ ; } return *( pointer + offset ) ;
As far as I 'm concerned , the ability to write assembly code requires some kind of superhuman intelligence .
Reading this code , however , leads me to believe otherwise .
Kent 's predecessor seemed to struggle with it , as he had apparently never heard of labels ( which allow you to give a name to a memory address ) and instead tracked memory locations of each line of code .
This , in turn , lead to lots of dupilicate and nonsensical lines .
For example , in the snippet above " offset " is set twice .
The reason that " offset=price_in_dollars + price_in_cents " was left in was because Kent 's predecessor could n't always delete code .
Removing an instruction would shift the memory addresses of all subsequent instructions , which would obviously have an impact on those hard - coded addresses .
In some cases — specifically , when the length of the instruction (s ) he wanted to remove was divisible by two — he was able to effectively perform no operation yet still take up two bytes : he could simply jump to the address of the next instruction .
But for those pesky instructions that would leave a remainder of one byte , the programmer just could n't figure out a no-operation instruction that took up a single byte .
Apparently , he never bothered to look up NO - OP , a one byte instruction that does just that .
As it turned out , it never occurred to the original programmer that the two - byte no-op he used ( relative jump of one byte ) could also be used to jump any number of bytes forward .
And this is where the loop in the preceding code comes in .
To convert two integers ( one for dollars , one for * ahem * cents ) into a single decimal — or , more specifically , a pointer to the decimal number stored in the aforementioned array — the programmer incremented once for each penny .
So , the second - worst - case scenario of $ 999.99 would result in nearly 1,000,000 increment instructions .
Plus all the other nearby instructions .
Plus the overhead of incrementing a pointer not stored in a register .
Even in assembler , this is damn slow .
What 's the worst case scenario , you may be wondering ?
A price that is " invalid . "
For instance , as mentioned earlier , $ 699.99 is invalid .
Some prices did n't work because the array 's values had been entered by hand and some had been missed .
That 's right , all 100,000 ( 0-999 dollars , 0 - 99 cents ) entries in the array were entered manually by the previous developer .
Saving prices back was done in a way similar to the lookups .
It 'd again loop over every cent trying to find a match in the huge array of prices , then split it into DOLLARS and SENSE .
And if it was an invalid / missing number , it 'd enter an infinite loop .
Because of this , the employees guarded their " bad prices " list fiercely .
With an understanding of how it worked , it took all of an afternoon to fix the slowdown .
It now ran dramatically faster , supported prices up to $ 999,999,999.99 ( which would be ideal if they started selling yachts ) , and did n't even have any " bad " prices that would cause infinite loops .
Oh , and the binary dropped to less than 50 KB in size as a result of the changes as well .
Looking back , Kent is proud of the work he 'd done .
After over three months turning his predecessor 's code into something sane , the only negative side effect is the occasional recurring nightmare in which Kent is hired at another place where his predecessor had built the application he'd be maintaining .

In a sign of consumer desperation amid a bleak economy , the annual rite of retailing known as Black Friday turned chaotic and even deadly , as predawn shoppers scrambled for holiday bargains .
A Wal - Mart worker on Long Island died after being trampled by customers who broke through the doors early Friday .
And fights and injuries occurred around the country at some other stores operated by Wal - Mart , the nation ’s leading discount chain , which is one of the few retailers thriving in the current economy .
Despite those outbreaks , many other retailers appeared to have fewer customers than usual the day after Thanksgiving , which is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year .
Merchants call it Black Friday because in the past , it was when many retailers went into the black , or turned profitable , for the year .
But longtime analysts , industry consultants and customers at malls and stores across the country said this year there were more shoppers than shopping bags .
Even many die - hard Black Friday shoppers  the ones who camp out on sidewalks overnight to be first through the doors  said they were cutting back .
Because we are so interested in ourselves , the first two resurrected species might be the two close cousins whom our ancestors drove to extinction :
THE NEANDERTHAL .
This species and modern humans split apart some 500,000 years ago , and the Neanderthal adapted to the ice age climate that gripped its European homeland .
Scientists in Germany are expected to report soon that they have decoded the full genome .
No one knows if Neanderthals could speak .
A living one would answer that question and many others .

THE ‘ HOBBIT . ’
Remains of these downsized humans , more correctly known as Homo floresiensis , were found on the island of Flores four years ago .
Paleoanthropologists have been at each other ’s throats ever since as to whether the pint - size people with sophisticated stone tools were a new human species or a pathological form of modern humans .
Let the little floresians speak for themselves , though first we must find some of their hair .

DNA lasts only 50,000 years or so , an eyeblink of evolutionary time , but genome engineers will eventually get so good at their job , one can surely assume , that they wo n’t need actual DNA ; they will be able to calculate the DNA sequence of any known species by working backward from the genomes of their living descendants .
Birds , for instance , evolved from dinosaurs .
So put a few nips and tucks in a falcon ’s genome and you could doubtless re-create that of a velociraptor .
Let ’s try resummoning these creatures from their rest in the fossil beds of extinction :
THE SEA SCORPION .
These huge arthropods lived in shallow seas 450 million to 250 million years ago and grew to six feet long and more .
Their champion , Jaekelopterus rhenaniae , was a monster of up to eight feet ( a gigantic claw was found last year ) .
We are used to insects and spiders being tiny creatures , confined by their breathing system to a small volume .
Having a few sea scorpions around would help us understand just how big insects could grow .

Utopian visions of a technological singularity occupy the individual minds of tens of thousands of Earthers .
At the recent Singularity conference in San Jose , attendees were reminded that the human mind remains far and away the most capable cognitive machine in the known universe .
But that did not stop them from dreaming utopian visions of all - powerful artifical intelligences , and machines capable of " storing " human consciousness , simulating a full - sensory paradise for its uploaded minds .
From there , the idea of a collective mind , a mental " super - organism " of global proportions , arises easily .
Particularly for anyone who has been exposed to the Star Trekkian vision of " The Borg . "
Kevin Kelly 's essay on the Superorganism elaborates on the concept of consciousness evolving out of the growing internetwork of networked co-evolving humans - machines .
An interesting web attempt at creating an evolving future - oriented collective intelligence , is The Space Collective .
Combining clear speculative thinking with crisp visual artistic values , TSC is a future oriented website worth visiting more than once .
Our own brain - minds are an example of a hive mind of sorts , at least a modular consciousness .
Humans spontaneously organise socially as families , clans , tribes , guilds , militias , hunting parties , religions , etc .
Further , had any ancient astronaut observers of human civilisation taken the time to film time - lapse documentaries of the rise and fall of human city - states and cultures , a definite social insect - like quality of the onset and decay of culture would be clear .
Humans are desperately in need of an " organising principle " to lead them to a more enlightened and sustainable era of safe - branching futures .
While socialist economics is known to be a destructive dead - end , it continues to attract more blindly utopian and less mentally endowed humans like moths to a flame .
And while capitalist economics combined with libertarian politics provides the excess wealth needed to finance evolutionary projects , the deeper level of guidance needed to help choose workable long - term directions of effort is lacking .
Hives too often degenerate into mobs , as more personally powerful individual interests assert themselves in counter - productive directions , assuming amplitudes strong enough to skew the crowd away from ordinary and more productive activities .
Religions have always failed in the end , as have philosophies and ideologies .
Whatever guiding principle an enlightened group mind may adopt , it should be simple , subject to test by reality , and resistant to co-option by charismatic or ruthlessly powerful individuals .

We have compiled a list of the top 10 National Parks and why they are the best .
Read on to choose which one is right for you !
Yosemite National Park , California
Yosemite boasts the distinction of being one of the United States ’ first wilderness parks .
It is made up of almost 1200 square miles with ancient sequoias , magnificent meadows , valleys that run deep and cascading waterfalls .
There are thirteen campgrounds in the park .
Seven of them need reservations from April until September and the rest are on a first come , first serve basis .
Acadia National Park , Maine
Acadia is one of the most beautiful of the U.S. ’s National Parks .
It was the first National Park to be established east of the mighty Mississippi .
Campers can combine the beauty of evergreen forest with the rugged , majestic coast of Maine known as Down East .
There are carriage roads to bike , hiking paths along the shore and forest land or just relaxing at your campsite listening to the waves pound the rocks .
Campers can set up their tents from December to March for free while in other months a modest fee must be paid .
Assateague Island National Seashore , Maryland & Virginia
Coastal bays , salt marshes , sandy beaches and maritime forests greet the camper when they visit Assateague Island .
It is only in Maryland that camping is available .
There are no hook - ups but most sites have grills and picnic tables .
Camp either Oceanside or along the bay and go to sleep lulled by waves crashing the shore and wake to the tang of the salt , sea air .
Assateague Island is unique in that you can live among the wild horses that make the island their home .
Pony Penning week is typically held in July .
Call for dates and details .

The number of winter deaths rose last year Soaring energy prices could mean more deaths among elderly people this winter , a charity says .
An Age Concern poll of 2,300 people found many over 60s were worried about being able to heat their homes .
And with one of the coldest winters for some years predicted , the charity said that could lead to more people dying .
The warning comes after figures for England and Wales suggested there was a 7 % jump in extra deaths last year despite a relatively mild winter .
The Office for National Statistics said that from December 2007 to March 2008 there were an extra 25,300 deaths in England and Wales compared with the average for non-winter months .
With this winter set to be colder than last , the numbers are likely to rise
Gordon Lishman , Age Concern
However , the figure was still some way short of the increase in deaths seen in the winters of the late 1990s when totals hit nearly 50,000 as flu swept around the country .
Nonetheless , the figures still indicate one of the highest rates of winter deaths - ahead of the likes of Finland and Denmark which generally have colder winters .
Gordon Lishman , director general of Age Concern , said this was a scandal .
He added : " With this winter set to be colder than last , the numbers are likely to rise .
Pensioners are clearly more worried about staying warm and well this year .
" Yet , the impact of increased energy bills is causing thousands to risk their health by cutting back on heating . "
The poll showed nearly two - thirds were worried about their ability to stay warm , with half of older people already cutting back .
Mr Lishman urged the elderly to take several key steps to help protect themsleves this winter , including claiming benefits and getting the annual flu jab .
And despite the rise in the winter fuel allowance , he also urged ministers to do more to keep energy prices low for the most vulnerable , pointing out most people were in favour of some kind of market intervention .
A Department of Health spokeswoman also urged people to get the flu jab .
She added : " Cold weather and winter illnesses can have a very big impact on peoples health , but many winter deaths are preventable . "

Teddy at FDL reports that Rep. Danny Davis is in line to replace Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate .
But if Davis really wants that seat , then he really needs to finally answer exactly why he took part in that bizarre coronation ceremony for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon back in 2002 .
Davis not only took a leading part in the ceremony , he 's been unapologetic about it since .
All of which raises serious questions about Davis ' judgment :
If he so readily succumbs to the ministrations of one of the world 's craziest right - wing ideologues , who else will he sucker for ?
Eric Zorn at the Chicago Tribune is wondering the same thing .
Back when this story first emerged , Zorn contacted Davis and asked if he had made a mistake .
" A mistake ? " he asked , chuckling in that distinctive , friendly baritone .
" No , not a mistake .
This was about the promotion of peace .
That 's all .
We were recognizing Rev. and Mrs. Moon as parents .
I find it difficult to see that as far out in any way . "
Yeah , except that Rev. and Mrs. Moon see themselves as the parents of the entire world .
That ceremony was about crowning them as the world 's rulers .
Read John Gorenfeld 's book , Bad Moon Rising , for the complete details .
Surely Illinois can do better than this .

While working on Eros , I encountered a function programming pattern I had n’t known .
I was struck by the simplicity and power of this pattern , and I wondered why I had n’t run into it before .
I call this idea “ semantic editor combinators ” , because it ’s a composable way to create transformations on rich values .
I ’m writing this post in order to share this simple idea , which is perhaps “ almost obvious ” , but not quite , due to two interfering habits :
thinking of function composition as binary instead of unary , and
seeing the functions first and second as about arrows , and therefore esoteric .
What I enjoy most about these ( semantic ) editor combinators is that their use is type - directed and so does n’t require much imagination .
When I have the type of a complex value , and I want to edit some piece buried inside , I just read off the path in the containing type , on the way to the buried value .
I started writing this post last year and put it aside .
Recent threads on the Reactive mailing list ( including a dandy explanation by Peter Verswyvelen ) and on David Sankel ’s blog reminded me of my unfinished post , so I picked it up again .
Edits :
2008 - 11 - 29 : added type of v6 example .
Tweaked in O2 alignment .
Example
Suppose we have a value defined as follows .
v0 :: ( Int , Char -> ( String , Bool ) ) v0 = ( 3 , c -> ( [ c , 'q ' , c , 'r ' ] , isDigit c ) )
Now , how can one edit this value ?
By “ edit ” , I simply mean to produce a value that resembles v0 but has alterations made .
For concreteness , let ’s say I want to reverse the string .
A programmer might answer by firing up vim , Emacs , or yi ( whee ! ) , and change the definition to
v0 = ( 3 , c -> ( [ 'r ' , c , 'q ' , c ] , is Digit c ) )
But this answer does n’t really fit the question , which was to edit the value .
I want a way to edit the semantics , not the syntax , i.e. , the value rather than the expression .
Similarly , I might want to
negate the boolean ,
double the Int ,
swap the inner pair , or
swap the outer pair .
Semantic editor combinators makes these tasks easy , using the following recipe , writing from left to right :
Read out the path in the type of the value being edited ( v0 here ) , from the outside to the part to edit , naming each step , according to part of the type being entered , using the names “ first ” and “ second ” for pairs , and “ result ” for functions .
here ) , from the outside to the part to edit , naming each step , according to part of the type being entered , using the names “ first ” and “ second ” for pairs , and “ result ” for functions .
Write down that path as its part names , separated by periods .
If the path has at least two components , surrounded by parentheses .
Next write the alteration function to be applied .
Finally , the value being edited .
In our string - reversal example , these steps look like
( second.result.first ) — second of the pair , result of that function , and first of that pair
— second of the pair , result of that function , and first of that pair reverse
v0
So the value editing is accomplished by
v1 = ( second.result.first ) reverse v0
Let ’s see if the editing worked .
First , inspect v0 , using GHCi :
> fst v0 3 > ( snd v0 ) 'z ' ( " zqzr " , False )
and then v1 :
> :ty v1 v1 :: ( Int , Char -> ( String , Bool ) ) > fst v1 3 > ( snd v1 ) 'z ' ( " rzqz " , False )
The other four editings listed above are just as easy
double x = x+x swap ( x , y ) = ( y , x ) -- negate the boolean , v2 = ( second.result.second ) not v0 -- double the Int , v3 = first double v0 -- swap the inner pair , or v4 = ( second.result ) swap v0 -- swap the outer pair v5 = swap v0
Testing in GHCi :
> :ty v2 v2 :: ( Int , Char -> ( String , Bool ) ) > fst v2 3 > ( snd v2 ) 'z ' ( " zqzr " , True ) > :ty v3 v3 :: ( Int , Char -> ( String , Bool ) ) > fst v3 6 > ( snd v3 ) 'z ' ( " zqzr " , False ) > :ty v4 v4 :: ( Int , Char -> ( Bool , String ) ) > fst v4 3 > ( snd v4 ) ' z ' ( False , " zqzr " ) > :ty v5 v5 :: ( Char -> ( String , Bool ) , Int ) > fst v5 < interactive >: 1:0 : No instance for ( Show ( Char -> ( String , Bool ) ) ) ... > snd v5 3 > fst v5 'z ' ( " zqzr " , False )
Since String is a synonym for [ Char ] , the type of v0 has even more structure we can delve into :
v0 :: ( Int , Char -> ( [ Char ] , Bool ) )
Add a fourth path component , element , for entering elements of lists .
Now we can edit the characters :
-- previous character v6 = ( second.result.first.element ) pred v0 -- character value v7 = ( second.result.first.element ) ord v0
Testing :
> :ty v6 v6 :: ( Int , Char -> ( [ Char ] , Bool ) ) > fst v6 3 > ( snd v6 ) 'z ' ( " ypyq " , False ) > :ty v7 v7 :: ( Int , Char -> ( [ Int ] , Bool ) ) > fst v7 3 > ( snd v7 ) 'z ' ( [ 122,113,122,114 ] , False )
What ’s going on here ?
You may be familiar with the functions first and second .
They ’re methods on the Arrow class , so they ’re pretty general .
When operating on functions , they have the following types and definitions :
first :: ( a -> a ' ) -> ( ( a , b ) -> ( a ' , b ) ) second :: ( b -> b' ) -> ( ( a , b ) -> ( a , b' ) ) first f = ( a , b ) -> ( f a , b ) second g = ( a , b ) -> ( a , g b )
Note that , as needed , first and second apply given functions to part of a pair value , carrying along the other half of the pair .
When working syntactically , we often apply functions under lambdas .
The corresponding value - level , embedding combinator is just function composition .
I ’ll use the name result as a synonym for (. ) , for consistency with first and second and , more importantly , for later generalization .
result :: ( b -> b' ) -> (( a -> b ) -> ( a -> b' ) ) result = (. )
As with first and second , I ’ve used parentheses in the type signatures to emphasize the path components as being unary , not binary .
It ’s this unusual unary view that makes first , second , and result ( or (. ) ) composable and guides us toward composable generalizations .
Similarly , the element component is synonym for fmap :
element :: ( a -> b ) -> ( [ a ] -> [ b ] ) element = fmap
However , using fmap directly is very useful , since it encompasses all Functor types .
Since functions from any given type is a functor , I often use fmap in place of result , just to avoid having to define result .
Thanks to the Functor instance of pairing , we can also use fmap in place second .
( The two , however , are not quite the same . )
An advantage of names like result , element and second is that they ’re more specifically descriptive .
Hence they are easier for people to read , and they lead to more helpful error messages .
Found in the wild
The examples above are toys I contrived to give you the basic idea .
Now I ’d like to show you how very useful this technique can be in practice .
Reactive represents events via two types , Future and Reactive :
newtype EventG t a = Event ( FutureG t ( ReactiveG t a ) )
The Functor instance uses the functor instances of FutureG and ReactiveG :
instance Functor ( EventG t ) where fmap = inEvent.fmap.fmap
The inEvent functional is also a semantic editor combinator , though not so obvious from the types .
It applies a given function inside the representation of an event .
One pattern I use quite a lot is applying a function to the result of a curried - style multi-argument function .
For instance , Reactive has a countE function to count event occurrences .
Each occurrence value get paired with the number of occurrences so far .
countE :: Num n => Event b ->
Event ( b , n ) countE = stateE 0 ( +1 )
Quite often , I use a forgetful form , countE_ , which discards the original values .
Looking at the type of countE , I know to direct snd into the result and then into the values of the event .
The definition follows robomatically from the type .
countE_ :: Num n => Event b ->
Event n countE_ = ( result.fmap ) snd countE
You can play this game with any number of arguments .
For instance , Reactive has a function for snaphotting behaviors on each occurrence of an event , taking an initial state , state transition function , and an input event .
snapshot :: Event a -> Reactive b -> Event ( a , b )
The forgetful version descends into two results and one event , to edit the pair found there :
snapshot_ :: Event a -> Reactive b ->
Event b snapshot_ = ( result.result.fmap ) snd snapshot
I could have written the following pointful version instead :
snapshot_ e b = fmap snd ( snapshot e b )
As a more varied example , consider these two functions :
withRestE :: Event a ->
Event ( a , Event a ) firstE :: Event a -> a
The function withNextE directs firstE into the inner event of withRestE .
withNextE :: Event a -> Event ( a , a ) withNextE = ( result.fmap.second ) firstE withRestE
Who ’s missing ?
We have first second to edit the first and second part of a pair .
We also have result to edit result part of a function .
We can also edit the argument part :
argument :: ( a ' -> a ) -> (( a -> b ) -> ( a ' -> b ) )
This editor combinator has a different flavor from the others , in that it is contravariant .
( Note the primes . )
Its definition is simple :
argument = flip (. )
Higher arity
The combinators above direct unary functions into single structures .
A similar game works for n-ary functions , using the applicative functor lifters .
For instance ,
liftA2 :: ( Applicative f ) => ( a -> b -> c ) -> ( f a -> f b -> f c )
Since lift A2 promotes arbitrary binary functions to binary functions , it can be applied again & again .
* Main Control .
Applicative > :ty liftA2.liftA2.liftA2 liftA2.liftA2.liftA2 :: ( Applicative f , Applicative g , Applicative h ) => ( a -> b -> c ) -> f ( g ( h a ) ) -> f ( g ( h b ) ) -> f ( g ( h c ) )
Similarly for lift A3 etc .
Now an in - the - wild higher - arity example , taken from the TypeCompose library .
Here ’s a very handy way to compose two type constructors :
newtype ( g :. f ) a = O { unO :: g ( f a ) }
We can apply n-ary function within O constructors :
inO :: ( g ( f a ) -> g ' ( f ' a ' ) ) -> ( ( g :. f ) a -> ( g ' :. f ' ) a ' ) inO h ( O gfa ) = O ( h gfa ) in O2 :: ( g ( f a ) -> g ' ( f ' a ' ) -> g '' ( f '' a '' ) ) -> ( ( g :. f ) a -> ( g ' :. f ' ) a ' -> ( g ' ' :. f '' ) a '' ) in O2 h ( O gfa ) ( O gfa ' ) = O ( h gfa gfa ' ) ...
Less pointedly ,
inO = ( O . ) . (. unO ) in O2 = ( inO . ) . (. unO ) inO3 = ( inO2 . ) . (. unO ) ...
Functors compose into functors , and applicatives compose into applicatives .
( See Applicative Programming with Effects . )
The semantic - editor - combinator programming style makes these for very simple instance definitions :
instance ( Functor g , Functor f ) => Functor ( g :. f ) where fmap = inO.fmap.fmap instance ( Applicative g , Applicative f ) =>
Applicative ( g :. f ) where pure = O . pure . pure ( <*>) = ( inO2.liftA2 ) ( <*>)
What ’s ahead ?
Two of our semantic editor combinators ( path components ) have more general types than we ’ve used so far :
first :: Arrow ( ~ > ) => ( a ~> a' ) -> ( ( a , b ) ~> ( a ' , b ) ) second :: Arrow ( ~ > ) => ( b ~> b' ) -> ( ( a , b ) ~> ( a , b ' ) )
I ’ve simply replaced some of the ( -> ) ‘s in the function - specific types with an arbitrary arrow type ( ~ > ) .
Another post will similarly generalize result and then will give some nifty uses of this generalization for applying combinator - based semantic editing beyond simple values to
Type representations
Code
Graphical user interfaces
Combinations of all of the above ( including values )

The cooperation of tribal fighters in the raid was described as a crucial breakthrough .
The tribal fighters are mostly former insurgents who fought US and Iraqi forces after dictator Saddam Hussein 's fall in 2003 , but have helped curb violence since late 2006 when they started helping the Americans to battle al - Qaeda .
Italy and Spain have both been hit hard by the global economic slowdown .
Spain and Italy have announced plans worth billions of euros to kick - start their economies .
Italy approved an 80bn euro ( $ 102 bn ; £ 66 bn ) emergency package that included tax breaks for poorer families , public works projects and mortgage relief .
Spain unveiled an 11bn euro plan aimed at creating 300,000 jobs .
The announcements are the latest in a series of attempts by EU governments to shore up their economies as the financial crisis bites .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called on to Italians to keep on spending .
" We have helped citizens , the less well off , so that they can continue to consume , " he said .
" The intensity and duration of the crisis depends on all of us . "
Spain 's Prime Minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , said the money will be mainly invested in infrastructure and public works .
Spain 's unemployment reached 12.8 % in October - the highest in the eurozone .
Construction crisis
The Spanish government said it would invest 0.8bn euros in the ailing car industry , which has been through a severe downturn and seen sales plummet 54.6 % since the beginning of the year .
The construction industry has also been severely hit by the financial crisis , with property prices falling and companies slashing thousands of jobs .
The Spanish economy shrank by 0.2 % in the third quarter , putting an end to 15 years of continuous growth .
The European Commission has demanded that each EU member must spend about 1.2 % of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , or economic output , to fight the economic slowdown .
Spain 's plan is worth 1.1 % of its GDP .
Germany launched a similar 50bn euro package , while next week France is expected to unveil economic measures worth 20bn euros .

For months , the nation ’s largest banks have struggled to regain investors ’ trust .
In the center of the vortex is Citigroup , whose precipitous stock - market plunge accelerated on Thursday , sending shock waves through the financial world .
The shares slumped 26 percent Thursday ; the bank has lost half its value in just four days .
The chief executive , Vikram S. Pandit , will hold a meeting for senior managers Friday to update them on the bank ’s condition .
Investors and analysts have long pressured the bank to consider ways to lift its stock price , including splitting the company or selling pieces .
While a few also say the company should consider selling itself outright , there is no certainty that any change would happen soon .
Senior executives say the company is financially strong and has ample financing options .
Moreover , there are few buyers who would be willing to pay a price that Citigroup would want for its most valuable assets .
Citigroup executives are seeking to stabilize the stock price , but at this point they are not actively exploring selling or splitting up the company , according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions .
Report : Two degree temp .
increase could melt Greenland ice Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday November 27 , 2008
Print This Email This GENEVA ( AFP ) 
A less than two degree Celsius rise in global temperatures might be sufficient to spark a meltdown of the Greenland Ice Sheet and Arctic sea ice , the WWF warned in a new study released Thursday .
" Scientists now suggest that even warming of less than 2 degree Celsius might be enough to trigger the loss of Arctic sea ice and the meltdown of the Greeland Ice Sheet , " the WWF said in a statement to accompany the findings .
" As a result , global sea levels would rise by several metres , threatening tens of millions of people worldwide . "
The melting of Arctic sea ice could affect ecosystems , while a meltdown of the Greenland Ice Sheet could lead to a sea level rise of up to seven metres , with a devastating impact for the rest of the world .
The WWF urged governments meeting for UN climate talks in Poland starting Monday to " develop a strong negotiation text for a new climate treaty " due at the end of next year .
Kim Carstensen , WWF Global Climate Initiative leader said : " The early meltdown of ice in the Arctic and Greenland may soon prompt further dangerous climate feedbacks accelerating warming faster and stronger than forecast .
" Responsible politicians cannot dare to waste another second on delaying tactics in the face of these urgent warnings from nature . "

Tony Blair has urged Barack Obama to take the initiative on issues from climate change to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as a way to heal the divisions between America and Europe .
In an interview with the Guardian during a visit to Rwanda , the former prime minister said Obama 's election as US president opened up " an era of real possibility " .
" I think he can say to Europe , look I 'm going to champion a global deal on climate change , I 'm going to take the Middle East peace process seriously , I 'm going to make sure that poverty in Africa is right at the top of the agenda , I 'm going to listen to your concerns and get a shared agenda with you . "
But while Blair , who now serves as Middle East special envoy of the Quartet of the US , EU , Russia and the United Nations , welcomed Obama 's election , he also warned that the new president would make demands on Europe and defend US interests .
" I 'm not going to get into comparing presidents , because I think that would be , er , not very fruitful .
But there 's a tremendous possibility for Obama to reach out and create a unifying agenda , " Blair said .
" People should also understand that [ Obama 's ] agenda will encompass American interests and demands too , and once the euphoria subsides a little , as it always does in these situations , there are tough choices all round . "
Blair said European governments could expect Obama to look to them for support on ensuring victory in Afghanistan , on measures to block Iran from developing nuclear weapons , and on " a set of measures on the global economic crisis that are going to work for America as well as for [ Europe ] " .
" People have got to understand that if we really want America to be in partnership with us , and that 's a good and right ambition , America will be up there making demands as well as listening to ours . "
Obama faces inflated expectations , as Blair did in 1997 — in part born out of antipathy to the outgoing administration — that the president - elect 's staff are already trying to dampen .
" There 's enormous expectation , " said Blair .
" But I think he 's a very smart guy and the only thing you can do in these circumstances is to try and meet the reasonable expectations . "
Although unwilling to criticise President George Bush , Blair indicated that he wants to see the incoming US administration to take resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict more seriously .
" I personally think that one of the essential things both for the next American president and for the world is to regard this region [ the Middle East ] , and broader than this region , as one problem because you face the same issue everywhere , which is a battle between those who want a modern and progressive future and those who are reactionary extreme , " he said .
" Whether it 's in Iraq or in Palestine or what 's happening in all the different parts of Afghanistan or Pakistan , it 's the same issue . "
He questioned the established approach to the peace process which is driven , or not , by a US president backed by other foreign leaders .
He said his experience in Jerusalem and the occupied territories since he left Downing Street had made him aware of the constraints of political intervention by foreign leaders .
" I do think what 's very interesting about these international situations — and I found this quite shocking in a way — is how much more comprehensive my understanding of the Israel - Palestine situation is now than when I was in office , " he said .
" The error in international policy , in a way , up to now on this dispute , is to think that if you get a political agreement you can then change the reality on the ground .
Whereas in fact unless you are evolving the reality on the ground in a positive way you will never create the context in which a political agreement is possible , because the Israelis will never think that a Palestinian state is permissible in terms of their security and the Palestinians will never think that a state is possible because of the occupation .
" So until the Palestinians see that lifting the occupation is a genuine possibility and the Israelis see Palestinian security capability under one authority is a genuine possibility they 're not actually going to make the compromises to agree . "
The Palestinians say the Oslo peace process collapsed because it moved too slowly .
The Israeli president and former prime minister , Shimon Peres , has said it failed because it attempted to achieve too much at once .
Blair leans toward the Israeli view , saying that what has become clear to him is that it is a mistake to pursue peace agreements on paper without the painstaking work of gradually changing the reality on the ground .
He said that had he known when he was prime minister what he knows now , it would not so much have led him to change policy as to recognise the limitations of what he could achieve as prime minister .
" More what I 've learned is this : it 's rather than I could have done something as British prime minister , I realised I probably could n't because I was busy being British prime minister , " he said .
Blair said that what is required is a shift away from perpetual initiatives by foreign leaders to devolving real power to international envoys committed full time .
" The interesting thing is how the international community delegates authority to make up for the limited knowledge that these leaders can have nowadays when they 're dealing with a multiplicity of problems in their own domestic situation , " he said .
" I think , for example , there 's no way the Middle East is going to be resolved unless there are empowered senior people from the international community able to do it .
Because , as I say , I now have a far better understanding of what needs to happen than I did when I was British prime minister .
And yet in one sense when I was British prime minister I obviously had greater power over the situation . "
" One realises he has a day job , but we cannot have the Government being defeated so often at a time like this .
Also , having just entered the Lords , you would imagine he would have a little more enthusiasm for the place . "
The four defeats that the Business Secretary missed were two divisions on the Counter - terrorism Bill ( the second of which the Government lost by just three votes ) and two others on the Planning Bill , one of which the Government lost by four votes .

Why you should n’t be using S3 or Google App Engine
Recently a new ‘ hype ’ has been popping up , namely Amazon ’s S3 and Google App Engine .
For those who do n’t know , S3 and App Engine are basically hosting facilities for web applications which run , and data that ’s stored , remotely on Amazon or Google ’s infrastructure .
This allows you to benefit from the huge and reasonably super - scaling architectures that these companies have built .
While this may seem nice , I ’ve had my doubt about the usefulness of such services .
For one , it fosters vendor lock - in .
Your application with an Amazon S3 database back - end wo n’t be able to run anywhere else .
Neither will your Google App Engine application .
Sure , some of the software is released as Open Source , but the software is just icing on the cake .
It ’s the architecture that really counts , and it wo n’t be easy to reproduce Google or Amazon ’s architecture .
And when you build your application against those architectures , it ’s bound to become limited to them , in the same way ( and probably even beyond that ) that SQL queries you write for one database will perform badly on a different database .
And I am now seeing the first proof of these problems , as well as entirely different problem : debugging .
You see , beyond the tools provided by the service , you are out of options when it comes to debugging .
When hosting your own data storage or application platform , you can sink your teeth into it when problems arise .
Even when most of the stuff you ’re using is n’t Open Source , you ’ll still be able to sick a whole range of diagnostic tools at the problem .
No such luck with remote application hosting services .
They ’re black - box beyond the most common debugging situations .
That ’s what the people on a thread at Amazon ’s Web Services Forum are experiencing right now , if you ask me .
I ’ll quote the gist of the conversation :
all data we store on S3 has gone through the same code path for months .
starting a couple days ago a small percentage of the objects we are retrieving are not checksumming to the correct values .
we hash and store objects by checksum and rehash the objects when we retrieve to ensure there is no data corruption .
all the objects we ’re having issues with were uploaded at approximately the same time period a few days ago .
we ’ve stored 10 ’s of millions of objects in S3 and never encountered such problems .
please let me know ASAP if you have any idea what could be going on here .
thanks .
I ’m having similiar problems . [… ]
I ’ve been investigating our end to find the problem , and it was just suggested that I should check the forums to see if anyone else was having problems . [… ]
This is super - high priority for us ( both corporately and personally , since lack of sleep dealing with this is killing me
The first post was made on June 22 , 2008 5:05 PM .
An Amazon support engineer ( I assume ) is working on it , but at June 23 , 2008 11:12 AM there is still no answer .
And this shows exactly my objections with such remotely hosted application services .
It ’s out of your control .
That ’s something I could n’t live with , and I think most companies should n’t want to either .
As one user comments : “ This is super - high priority for us ( both corporately and personally “ .
Staking your entire business on some black - box remote service seems like a silly idea to me .
Most service providing software I ( and the company I work at ) use are Free or otherwise Open Software , which means we ’ll always have the source to dive into when we run into problems .
And even if the source is n’t there , at least you ’ll get to look at the problem from both sides .
When it comes to database problems , you ’ll be able to view the logs , turn on debugging , inspect the entire environment the service is running in , from software to hardware .
That ’s something you ca n’t do with a remote service .
Yes , there will always be problems for which a fix is hard to find or for which there simply is n’t a fix .
If you ’re not willing to run that risk , you can pay a company a lot of money for support , and let them handle the hard problems ( or for some even the easy problems ) .
Naturally , Amazon and Google both offer that support too , but that ’s still different .
You see , when you run into a really unfixable problem in your own architecture , you can always swap any part of the software or hardware and try again .
Or at least , that ’s what most developers try to achieve anyway : interchangeable software ( databases , application servers , programming libraries ) and hardware .
But with a remote service such as S3 or App Engine , you ’ve already committed your entire application to one , huge , non-interchangeable component from which you can never escape .
Hence the vendor lock - in .
But who knows what the future brings ?
This may all turn out to be a non-issue , and companies and developers may all flock to such general service providers in the future without any difficulties whatsoever .
I guess I ’m a conservative person when it comes to these kinds of changes .
I ’d rather wait and see .
Spread the love

Tomorrow the 4th of November 2008 , Obama will be elected the 44th President of the United States .
Some say this makes him the first Black President of the United States others say no .
Obama Would n’t Be First Black President [ EDITOR ’S NOTE ]
The Black Presidents
………………………………………………………………………..
Were there other “ black ” presidents ?
Some historians have reason to believe people do n’t really understand the genealogy of past U.S. Presidents .
Research shows at least five U.S. presidents had black ancestors and Thomas Jefferson , the nation ’s third president , was considered the first black president , according to historian Leroy Vaughn , author of Black People and Their Place in World History .
Vaughn ’s research shows Jefferson was not the only former black U.S. president .
Who were the others ?
Andrew Jackson , Abraham Lincoln , Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge .
But why was this unknown ?
How were they elected president ?
All five of these presidents never acknowledged their black ancestry .
Jefferson , who served two terms between 1801 and 1809 , was described as the “ son of a half - breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father , ” as stated in Vaughn ’s findings .
Jefferson also was said to have destroyed all documentation attached to his mother , even going to extremes to seize letters written by his mother to other people .
President Andrew Jackson , the nation ’s seventh president , was in office between 1829 and 1837 .
Vaughn cites an article written in The Virginia Magazine of History that Jackson was the son of an Irish woman who married a black man .
The magazine also stated that Jackson ’s oldest brother had been sold as a slave .
Lincoln , the nation ’s 16th president , served between 1861 and 1865 .
Lincoln was said to have been the illegitimate son of an African man , according to Leroy ’s findings .
Lincoln had very dark skin and coarse hair and his mother allegedly came from an Ethiopian tribe .
His heritage fueled so much controversy that Lincoln was nicknamed “ Abraham Africanus the First ” by his opponents .
President Warren Harding , the 29th president , in office between 1921 and 1923 , apparently never denied his ancestry .
According to Vaughn , William Chancellor , a professor of economics and politics at Wooster College in Ohio , wrote a book on the Harding family genealogy .
Evidently , Harding had black ancestors between both sets of parents .
Chancellor also said that Harding attended Iberia College , a school founded to educate fugitive slaves .
Coolidge , the nation ’s 30th president , served between 1923 and 1929 and supposedly was proud of his heritage .
He claimed his mother was dark because of mixed Indian ancestry .
Coolidge ’s mother ’s maiden name was “ Moor ” and in Europe the name “ Moor ” was given to all blacks just as “ Negro ” was used in America .
It later was concluded that Coolidge was part black .
The only difference between Obama and these former presidents is that none of their family histories were fully acknowledged by others .

Microsoft : 60 % of Wii Fit Purchases Go Unplayed
" We 've seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a Wii Fit play it once and do n't play it again .
So we have to get the balance right , because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes — and we have to treat them with respect , " Gosen told attendees .
The executive later expanded on his comments , telling Develop that " what Nintendo have done with the Wii is truly fantastic — there is no question about it .
But I think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay . "
The runaway success of Nintendo 's motion - centric Wii console has prompted many software and hardware developers to look into motion - sensing control schemes .
Earlier this year , rumors that Microsoft was planning a Wii Remote - like peripheral of its own were heavily circulated , though the device did not appear at following trade shows .
Gosen added in his keynote address that new user interfaces were important to the industry , but stressed that peripherals had to be designed with utility and longevity in mind .
" At the end of the day that comes back down to creativity ...
They are not good if they are gimmicks .
There is a challenge for us to make sure that all new user interfaces are deep and are rewarding to the end user , " he stated .
E3 2008 did n't pass without a new peripheral announcement from Microsoft , however .
At the conference the company officially unveiled Lips , a karaoke - dancing hybrid title which comes packed with a pair of light - equipped , motion - sensitive wireless microphones .
Gosen believes that the title fills a vacant niche .
" If you look a what people do n't like about existing karaoke games it's that you 've got wired microphones which look like they 've come out of a toy shop and a fairly restricted song base , " he said .
Developed in cooperation with Elite Beat Agents ( NDS ) developer iNiS , Lips is expected to hit retailers this coming holiday .
Wii Fit , meanwhile , has sold more than five million copies worldwide since its debut earlier this year .

CNN LARRY KING LIVE
Day 2 of the Republican National Convention
Aired September 2 , 2008 - 23:59 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
LARRY KING , CNN ANCHOR ( voice over ) : Tonight it 's John McCain 's party as the guests honor his service .
GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain 's resolve to do what is best for this country , you can be sure the angry left never will .
KING : What everybody 's talking about is vice presidential pick -- Sarah Palin .
What 's going on ?
Jesse Ventura sounds off on the running mate who 's running away with all the attention .
Plus , the Democrats are going to way in on what it means for the GOP and the country .
It 's right now on LARRY KING LIVE .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
KING : As we did all last week , we 'll present the loyal opposition all this week in this late hour , 12:00 midnight , 9:00 Pacific , edition of LARRY KING LIVE .
We always begin with a " King Convention " clip and this one highlights President Bush 's speech from the White House .
Watch .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BUSH : I know the hard choices that fall solely to a president .
John McCain 's life has prepared you to make those choices .
He is ready to lead this nation .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : We welcome Robert Gibbs to LARRY KING LIVE .
He 's in Minneapolis .
He 's an Obama campaign senior adviser .
Robert , what did you make of President Bush 's address tonight ?
ROBERT GIBBS , SENIOR ADVISER , OBAMA CAMPAIGN : Well , Larry , I think it was a passionate endorsement for his candidate , John McCain .
I 'm not sure John McCain wants the endorsement , but he certainly has it .
And I think it 's illuminating for the American people to know that George Bush has picked the person he wants to lead this country in the same direction he 's led it for the past eight years and he 's tapped John McCain to do it .
KING : And yet , Bush has a popularity rating of 33 percent .
In a recent poll , only 26 percent rate him the worse president ever .
So why is the poll so close ?
GIBBS : Well , look , I think this is going to be a close election because the American people are pretty divided in this country .
But , look , I think what we saw tonight and what the American people got to see tonight was very illuminating .
George Bush picked his man and it's John McCain for four more years of the same .
But what you also did n't hear a lot of tonight was how we 're going to solve the problems that the Bush economy has created , how it shipped job -- jobs overseas , given tax breaks for companies to do that , how are we going to turn around our foreign policy .
You did n't hear a lot about that tonight because , my guess is , they do n't have plans to fix this .
George Bush has tapped his man but he does n't do n't know how to fix the economy or the foreign policy and the direction that this country is going .
KING : Take me inside the Obama camp and tell me what the thinking is about Governor Palin .
GIBBS : Well , look , you know , she 's got a compelling personal story that , I think , America will hear tomorrow .
You know , we -- we 're not real focused on who the vice presidential nominee is .
We 're focused on John McCain and how he 'll bring four more years of the same .
That 's what we 're focused on -- whether or not we 're going too have change in this country , whether we 're going to turn this country around , whether we 're going to create jobs , whether we 're going to make health care and energy more affordable .
That 's what we 're focused on , not on the vice presidential nominee .
KING : All right , though , one other comment in that regard .
From what you 've learned do you think she was well vetted ?
GIBBS : Well , you know , look .
I 'm going to let them decide their procedures and processes .
I definitely think that how one picks a vice presidential nominee says a lot about the leader that that person is going to be .
By all accounts they met her -- they met one time before he tapped her to be the vice presidential nominee .
We feel comfortable with Senator Biden who 's Senator Obama 's vice presidential nominee , that he brings real - world experience , that he has n't forgotten where he comes from .
That -- type of character and value is exactly what we want in a vice president and we 're thrilled to death .
KING : Kind of a weird turnabout , eight years ago , the Democrats nominated Joe Lieberman and he spoke tonight .
Joe Lieberman speaks in support of the Republican nominee .
Here 's a little clip of what he said .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
JOE LIEBERMAN ( I ) , CONNECTICUT , SUPPORTS MCCAIN : Before I conclude , I want to ask the indulgence of all of you here in this hall tonight .
Because I want to speak directly to my fellow Democrats and independents who are watching -- watching or listening tonight .
I want to speak directly to you out there .
I know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics today and for good reason .
You may be thinking of voting for John McCain but you 're not sure yet .
Some of you may never have voted for a Republican before .
And frankly , in an ordinary election , you probably never would .
But I want you to believe with me this is no ordinary election .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Yes .
LIEBERMAN : Because -- and it's no ordinary election because these are not ordinary times .
And trust me , John McCain is no ordinary candidate .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : What do you make of that , Robert ?
GIBBS : Well , Larry , I think I know why most people are cynical about politics is because they hear people -- they come on their television -- people like Joe Lieberman -- and I hate to say this , it 's a tough word , but they flat out lie about Barack Obama .
The Joe Lieberman you heard tonight was n't the same Joe Lieberman that called Barack Obama in 2006 and asked him desperately to come to Connecticut and campaign for him .
And you know , tonight the big lie that Senator Lieberman said which , I got to tell you , is just really disappointing to hear from anybody -- you know , he -- he said that Barack Obama did n't have a record of real accomplishment reaching across -- reaching across the party lines to get things done .
Barack Obama 's reached across party lines to work with Dick Lugar of Indiana to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists .
He 's worked with Senator Tom Coburn to open up our budget process and to end no -bid contracts that dominated after Katrina hit New Orleans when the Bush administration was busy handing out contracts to their political contributors .
And he worked across party lines to make sure that lobbyists could n't give senators gifts and hand out free meals like they 've been doing for many , many years .
So , you know , Joe Lieberman ought to be ashamed for himself for some of the things that he said tonight , not as a Democrat but as an American .
We expect you to go to up there -- you can say what you want .
You can pick the person you want .
But you know what ?
I think he owes it to the American people to actually look into the camera and tell them the truth .
KING : Thanks , Robert .
I 'll see you again tomorrow night .
GIBBS : Thank you , Larry .
KING : Robert Gibbs is our point man for the Democrats in Minneapolis .
He 's an Obama campaign senior adviser .
Stay right where you are .
Jesse Ventura is next .
ANNOUNCER : Coverage of the Republican National Convention is sponsored by ...
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : I guess you could define loyal opposition with a picture of Jesse Ventura , the former governor of Minnesota , independent as they come .
A " New York Times " best selling author , his latest book is , " Do n't Start the Revolution Without Me . "
He has endorsed anyone for president in this 2008 race .
But his role tonight is to take a look at the Republican convention .
What did you make of day one ?
JESSE VENTURA , FORMER GOVERNOR , MINNESOTA : Of what ?
The Republican convention ?
KING : Yes .
VENTURA : Oh , Larry , you 're asking me the wrong questions .
I did n't watch the Democratic convention and you know what ?
They virtually canceled the Republican convention because of the hurricane down in New Orleans .
So -- and I spent all day today with the Ron Paul convention .
I guess you 'd call it the counter or the anti-convention or the convention for the constitution .
KING : So you did n't see any of the speeches of Mr. Lieberman or Senator Lieberman or Fred Thompson or anybody -- George Bush ?
VENTURA : No .
Did n't want to .
Do n't need to .
Already know they 'll promise everything and deliver nothing .
KING : I 'm going to show you a clip of Fred Thompson , the actor , former U.S. senator , unsuccessful candidate .
There was a strong defense of the vice - presidential nominee , Sarah Palin .
Watch , and then I want your comment .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
FRED THOMPSON , FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE , SUPPORTS MCCAIN : Some Washington pundits and media big shots are at a frenzy over the selection of a woman who has actually governed rather than just talked a good game on the Sunday talk shows and hit the Washington cocktail circuits .
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THOMPSON : I 'll say -- I say , give me a tough Alaskan governor who has taken on the political establishment and the largest State of the Union and won over the beltway business as usual crowd any day of the week .
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : All right .
Jesse Ventura , what do you make of the selection of the governor of Alaska ?
VENTURA : Well , naturally , she 's new and fresh , but I guess the counter to that would be is n't John McCain part of the beltway crowd of Washington ?
I mean , how can they have it both ways ?
They have a presidential candidate that is entrenched in the beltway and now they get a candidate that 's a virtual unknown .
And I found it very peculiar , Larry , in the fact that that was the main thing they 've attacked Barack Obama is the fact that he has no experience and then they turn right around and make a selection that really disarms that now as any type of attack during the campaign .
Because how can they call Mr. Obama inexperienced when they , themselves , picked someone who is quite inexperienced ?
KING : Why do you think they picked her ?
VENTURA : I have no idea , Larry .
You 'd have to ask them .
I -- you know , I certainly do n't keep track of the Republicans and the choices they make .
You 'd have to ask John McCain and , you know , the inner circle of the Republicans , that decision .
I guess I could speculate and say maybe they think they 'll steal Hillary votes by putting a woman on the ticket .
But I find it peculiar when , you know , McCain can support Viagra for men's health but yet , not birth control for women's .
I guess that 's to shore that up by putting a woman on the ticket maybe ?
KING : Do you know Sarah Palin ?
VENTURA : No , I do not .
She 's a new governor .
I got out of office in '03 .
I know nothing about her whatsoever .
KING : Do you make anything of the fact that her daughter is pregnant ?
VENTURA : Well , you know , first of all , I think it 's a non-issue because in -- on a personal side of it , you know , I guess it makes the case for sex education and birth control .
Well -- because ...
KING : Did John McCain ...
VENTURA : Because I believe abstinence does n't work and they can preach it all they want .
I think you 're far better off confronting it .
We were that way with my children .
We were very open with them and I can say that I 'm quite certain that it worked out pretty well .
They 're both adults and , you know , we never had any problems during their youth at all .
But , you know , that 's a personal matter .
And it happens every day in families throughout America .
It 's something that you have to deal with and it happened to happen in her family .
And I 'm sure they 'll do a good job handling the situation .
KING : One would think , Jesse , that you would be inclined towards Senator McCain in that you were a Navy SEAL .
VENTURA : Yes .
KING : He was a war hero .
You endured some tough times .
He endured some -- that you would have more of an attraction for him than his opponent .
VENTURA : Well , I do n't have an attraction , Larry , to either of them because I opposed the war from the start .
And just because I served in the military and served during the Vietnam War , it does n't mean that if you 're in the military you automatically endorse war .
In fact , to me , the opposite should take place .
Also ...
KING : Well , Senator Obama opposed the war .
VENTURA : Yes , absolutely .
But I can't support Senator Obama because he 's going raise my taxes and I already pay 50 percent and I think it 's ridiculous when you have to pay half of the fruits of your labor to the government .
I would rather talk about Ron Paul and the position he takes of less government .
That 's why I chose to participate in that convention today .
And I gave the keynote speech in the afternoon because I believe in less government .
We have a $ 9 trillion deficit , Larry , that nobody seems to want to talk about out there .
KING : So you 're voting for Ron Paul ?
VENTURA : I do n't know if Ron Paul will be on the ballot .
You know ?
Under what ?
He 's still a Republican .
I think he 's more of a protest as far as I can tell .
I wo n't really know who I 'm going to vote for until I actually see the ballot .
But I can assure you that I 'm not voting for a Democrat or Republican .
I want the revolution in this country like my book said , and you know , Dr. Paul wrote a book and used the same term , revolution .
KING : Yes .
VENTURA : Revolution was a powerful word used today in front of 15,000 people at the Target Center in Minneapolis .
KING : Who are you voting for in the Senate race in Minnesota ?
VENTURA : I 'm voting for Dean Barkley , the man I appointed to the Senate to fill Senator Wellstone 's term .
Dean is running .
He 's the best qualified to do the job .
Will he get elected ?
I do n't know .
But I certainly will vote for Dean Barkley over Norm Coleman and Al Franken any day of the week .
KING : We 'll take a day .
Jesse Ventura will remain with us .
And Dee Dee Myers will join us and so will D.L.
Hughley will join us as well with maybe a little humor to the proceedings .
Do n't go away .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
KING : Remaining with us from Minneapolis is the former governor of Minnesota , Jesse Ventura .
Joining us from Washington , Dee Dee Myers , political analyst , contributing editor for " Vanity Fair . "
She was White House press secretary during the Clinton administration , " New York Times " best - selling author of " Why Women Should Rule the World , " and she supports Senator Barack Obama .
And in New York is the very funny D.L.
Hughley , the actor and standup comic , one of the original kings of comedy .
He is a Democrat but has not endorsed a presidential candidate .
Why not , D.L. ?
D.L. HUGHLEY , ACTOR , NOT ENDORSING CANDIDATE :
Well , no , that is n't true .
I 'm going to vote for Barack .
I think that ...
KING : Oh OK .
HUGHLEY : I 'm going to vote for Barack .
But to me , I 'm just a -- I 'm a very cynical guy .
I think all politicians lie .
And it 's a choice between the dude who 's half black and a dude who 's half alive .
So -- to me , I have always been very cynical of politician .
I think that I 've heard pretty much the same things coming out of everybody 's camp .
And I think that Obama , at least , appears to be , at least , interested in doing things differently .
KING : Dee Dee , what do you make of the second night -- well , it 's the second half night of the Republican convention ?
Their first night did n't amount to much because of the hurricane .
DEE DEE MYERS , FORMER PRESS SECRETARY , PRESIDENT CLINTON , SUPPORTS OBAMA : Right .
Well , I found it a little confusing , actually .
You know , certainly , Senator Fred Thompson gave those delegates a lot of red meat which they really seemed to respond to .
But - and the whole theme of the evening - " Country First " -- was a very exclusive message .
It was basically either you 're a Republican or you do n't love your country .
As a Democrat , I found that pretty ( INAUDIBLE ) .
But then we switched right from that into Senator Joe Lieberman saying , no , we need a bipartisan approach .
We all need to come together , and hey , Democrats , if you love your country you 'll vote for John McCain , too .
So I thought it was a very an exclusive kind of message and a little bit confused on what it was trying to say .
Is John McCain an outsider and Barack Obama an insider ?
No , John McCain has been in the Congress for more than 20 years and Barack Obama has been there four years , which is one of the arguments against him ?
Or is that argument for him ?
So at the end of the evening I found myself both confused and a bit alienated .
I do n't understand why any independent or Democrat would consider voting for the McCain / Palin ticket after being called all night that only Republicans put their country first .
KING : Yes , was n't that surprising , Jesse , even though you did n't see it , that the theme was " we 're the patriots " ?
VENTURA : Well , you know , the Republicans have been pushing really Hermann Goering on us , the Nazi , since 2001 .
I mean , you know ...
KING : Hermann Goering ?
VENTURA : Yes .
He said that it 's easy to take a country to war .
You have to convince them they 're under attack .
Denounce the pacifist for being unpatriotic and also for putting the country into danger .
And yet , Thomas Jefferson said dissension is the greatest form of patriotism .
I like to follow the teachings of Thomas Jefferson a little bit more than Herman Goering .
KING : D.L. , are you ...
HUGHLEY : To follow ...
KING : I 'm sorry .
HUGHLEY : To follow up on what Jesse was saying , it did remind me -- I promise you , the first thing I thought when I saw those " Country First " signs , it reminded me of Nazis .
It really -- I mean they just seemed so , you know -- that seemed to be a country that I do n't recognize .
It seemed to be -- it did n't look that way .
It looks very exclusionary .
It looked very specific .
I did n't see anything that looked -- you know everybody looked like they were -- had the same experience , had the same kind of process .
It seemed like that -- I felt more like I was looking -- I mean , peering into something that was n't necessarily invited to .
So I did n't -- I can't see anybody would watch them and think that those people would be , you know , open to anybody with a different experience .
KING : Dee Dee Myers described Fred Thompson 's address as kind of red meat .
He slammed the Democratic nominee without uttering his name .
Watch a little of Senator Thompson .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
THOMPSON : To deal with these challenge , the Democrats present a history making nominee for president .
History making in that he 's the most liberal , most inexperienced nominee to ever run for president .
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THOMPSON : Apparently -- apparently they believe that he would match up well with the history - making Democrat - controlled Congress .
History making because it's the least accomplished and most unpopular Congress in our nation 's history .
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Of course , Dee Dee , he did n't add about the president .
Were you offended by that speech ?
MYERS : Yes .
I mean , I 'm a Democrat .
So I guess it 's not going to shock anybody at the convention hall .
But I thought the mood of the evening was unnecessarily exclusive .
Look , I love my country .
And I 'm going to vote for the candidate who I think is best to help end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home with honor , who 's going to help restore this economy , who 's going to help restore our reputation , our standing , and our moral standing around the world .
And I believe with all my heart that candidate is Barack Obama .
Are you going to tell me that I 'm not a patriot because I disagree with you on tax policy and national security policy ?
I think that 's , you know , that 's not the kind of -- sort of bipartisanship that , you know , people were bragging on Senator McCain for tonight .
I mean one of the things that Joe Lieberman said was this is a man who has reached across the aisle , who works with Democrats .
So I thought the message was not only a little offensive to me , which is n't going to upset anybody in the Republican headquarters probably , but it was at odds with the message that they were trying to send tonight .
Was it , you know , an exclusive " Country First " get with us or , you know , get out of the way ?
Or was it , no , we really want a candidate who can reach across the aisle and bring people together ?
Because that was n't a convention message .
in the first part of the night , that was going to bring anybody together , I 'll tell you that much .
KING : D.L. , what did you think of the vice - presidential choice ?
HUGHLEY : I think it was very trite .
I think it was more or less a textbook .
I mean I think that came clearly in response to whatever the Democrats did when they did n't nominate Hillary Clinton .
But even more importantly , I just think that you have to be consistent .
If the argument from the Republicans was that Barack Obama does n't have experience , this woman does n't either .
And I think that we should stop throwing around words like experience , because that has n't mattered in several elections .
I think this is a popularity contest .
And everybody is trying to win which I certainly understand .
But to -- you know I think this country has selective amnesia , like one side forgets what the other side did , then turns around and does it .
To me , there 's clearly what -- this -- I was trying to be basically as objective as I could .
Watching the Democrats and Obama speech , you know , from Clinton to Obama to , you know , Bill , you know -- to watching all the Democrats , it seemed more life and more hopeful and a little more transcendent .
This seemed more -- it seemed like I was watching a trailer for a scary movie .
It seemed like I was supposed be frightened and to believing that these were my saviors .
And they just -- it just -- I just did n't respond to it .
And I honestly tried to .
I honestly tried to have an open mind .
It just -- it just did n't -- it did n't appeal to me .
KING : Jesse , one would think that taxes aside you'd be more inclined to lean toward Obama .
VENTURA : Not really , because , again , Obama 's for bigger government .
And I 'm for smaller government .
You know , the Democrats traditionally have always said government is there to respond to everyone 's need and they shy away many times to personal responsibility , which is very important to me .
The problem is Obama 's making thousands of promises he 's going to raise taxes , and in which -- you know , at this point in time , to get the deficit down you 've got to cut down government , not make it larger .
At a time when the economy is on the brink of disaster , Obama wants to take more money from the private sector and give it to the government .
HUGHLEY : But ...
VENTURA : Well , that 's the worse thing you can do , in my opinion , is for the government to take more money from people at a time when the economy is in the situation that it 's in today .
HUGHLEY : In all fairness ...
KING : We 'll take a break -- hold it , we 'll take a break and pick right up and we 'll get Dee Dee 's thoughts about Governor Palin as well .
Is the Sarah Palin drama all played out ?
Or is another shoe about to drop ?
We 'll be right back .

MICHELE BACHMANN ( R ) , MINNESOTA : I am delighted to welcome you to the land of Minnesota Nice .
LAURA BUSH , FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES : I 'm proud that America 's first female vice president will be a Republican woman .
BUSH : If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain 's resolve to do what is best for his country , you can be sure the angry left never will .
THOMPSON : And we need a president who does n't think that the protection of the unborn or a newly born baby is above his pay grade .
LIEBERMAN : What , after all , is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this ?
I 'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party .

SEN .
JOE LIEBERMAN , ( I ) , CONNECTICUT :
What , after all , is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this ?
I 'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party .
KING : By the way , does is matter to you that Sarah Palin 's 17 - year - old daughter is pregnant ?
That 's our question of the night .
Go to CNN.com / larryking and tell us what you think .
Quick note about our show .
Last week we invited Republicans and supporters of John McCain to respond to the Democratic convention .
Tonight , and for the next two nights , we 'll find out what Democrats , critics and Barack Obama supporters think of the GOP convention .
Dee Dee , what do you think of the Sarah Palin selection ?
DEE DEE MYERS , FORMER CLINTON PRESS SECRETARY :
It was certainly surprising .
She has a compelling personal story to tell .
She has a winning personality .
She 's won over John McCain in a single face - to- face meeting .
She persuaded Senator Lieberman in a meeting or two she was a great choice .
But I think , you know , her personal political views are a little troubling to me as a Democrat .
She 's against -- she 's anti-choice in all circumstances including incest and rape .
There 's some interesting questions about whether she was part of a separatist movement in Alaska , an independent movement that was interested in separating Alaska from the rest of the country .
There 's a lot we do n't know about here .
The McCain campaign said they vetted her thoroughly .
I do n't think we know everything there is to know about Sarah Palin the way we know , say , about Joe Biden .
I also find it a little curious that Senator McCain spent the first year - plus of his campaign saying he was going to choose a running mate who was ready to be president .
Putting country first required him to do that .
The Constitution only requires two things of the vice president .
Step in shall the president not be able to fulfill his or her duties and vote in the Senate if there 's a tie .
I find it curious that he has a different explanation for why he chose Governor Palin .
So , again , I 'm confused .
I hear the McCain campaign is talking out of two sides of its convention .
I 'm not sure what to make of it .
KING : D.L. , I want you to watch this next clip and give me a comment .
The McCain campaign seems to be retooling its image a bit and playing up the candidates ' image as a maverick and reformer .
Here 's how Senator Lieberman put it .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
JOE LIEBERMAN , ( I ) , CONNECTICUT :
Let me share something with you that I 'm in a unique position to do as a Democrat .
My Democratic friends know all about John 's record of independence and accomplishment .
And you see that 's why I think some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince the American people that John McCain is someone else .
I am here to tell you what I think you know , but I want to speak to the people out there .
Do n't be fooled by some of these political statements and advertisements .
Trust me .
God only made one John McCain and he is his own man .
EVT
D.L. HUGHLEY , ACTOR : I think that it 's obvious that John McCain has a compelling personal story .
And it is obvious that he 's a different man , you know , in several aspects than George Bush is .
He has voted for him 97 percent of the time .
But that 's different .
But to respond to what Jesse was saying , how he was in favor of smaller government and lower taxes -- look , listen , the government for the last eight years has never been more cumbersome , more in effect less as evidence by the fact that Gustav , the specter of Katrina , was raised up and everybody had to tone everybody down because they knew it would remind people how ineffective they were .
I think John McCain is a -- obviously , is a good man .
I 'll take him at his word that he is .
But I think the policies he 's endorsed and the policies that Republicans have endorsed -- you do n't have to say , listen -- George Bush is such a bad president that the country is going -- we 're going to vote for the black guy .
That should tell you how bad of the last eight years have been .
It has not worked .
It 's been ineffective .
Anybody -- the fact they chose George Bush and wiped the specter of George Bush away with a picture of Ronald Reagan tells you everything that you need to know about how this presidency and how this country 's been run for the last eight years .
KING : Jesse , sadly , do you think race is going to play a big issue in this race .
JESSE VENTURA , FORMER MINNESOTA MAYOR : I certainly hope not .
Getting back a minute , Larry , I 'd like to say this .
Is n't it interesting that the last election , the Republicans trashed Vietnam War veterans .
And now this election , they 've changed completely and it's about being a Vietnam War veteran .
I find the hypocrisy unbelievable .
That 's , again , why I refuse to be a Democrat or Republican .
HUGHLEY : I have to agree with you .
KING : Dee Dee , do you think race is going to play a big part ?
MYERS : Well , race has long been , you know , an undercurrent in our politics .
I do n't think it 's been completely eliminated .
Certainly among young people you see it less and less of a factor .
There 's an encouraging sign .
But , of course it 's going to be a factor .
The question is how big a factor ?
The question is how subtly will -- certainly not John McCain , but some of the people around him try to make that a deciding factor .
I think D.L. makes a point .
Maybe we 'll have something to thank George Bush for .
We may elect the first African - American president of the United States .
What a fantastic outcome after eight long years of suffering .
VENTURA : Hey , Larry , Larry .
KING : Jesse ?
VENTURA : I 'm trying to figure out , though , what about the sexism of the moms here .
Barack 's mom is white and you never hear about that .
The other great black athlete , Tiger Woods , his mother 's Asian .
And yet all we hear about is their fathers .
How come the mother do n't count in the hereditary factor ?
KING : They count , Jesse .
You know about them .
HUGHLEY : That 's kind of historically a misnomer .
In this country , if you had any percentage of black blood in your , historically you were considered black .
That 's not me saying it .
That 's , you know , historically .
VENTURA : I 'm just confused over that , D.L. , because it seems everybody goes with whatever your father was as opposed to what your mother was .
HUGHLEY : I think they go with the next compelling story .
It is obviously more compelling to have a black president break history .
Anybody who believes race wo n't play a part in this country , a part in this election is being disingenuous .
I think you can go to several aspects , areas in this country -- I was talking to John Zogby after the Pennsylvania primary and the exhibit polls that came back were astounding .
37 percent of the white Catholic vote , 20 percent at that time said they would vote for another candidate and vote for John McCain.
17 percent said they would stay home .
They did n't have a problem saying it was because of race .
The exit polls in West Virginia said race is a component in it .
I think the country -- you know , for us to pretend like it wo n't play a factor -- to what degree I certainly can't say .
I think it plays , it permeates every aspect of our society .
KING : Let me get a break .
We 'll be right back .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BVT
BUSH : John will have an outstanding leader at his side .
America will have a strong and principled vice president in the governor of the great state of Alaska , Sarah Palin .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : That was George W. Bush .
He 's not running for re- election .
And John McCain would like to distance himself from him .
And a new ad from the Obama campaign has different ideas .
Take a look .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
AD NARRATOR : Well , he 's made his choice .
But for the rest of us , there 's still no change .
McCain does n't get it , calling this broken economy strong .
He wants to keep spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq and votes with George Bush 90 percent of the time .
While this may be his running mate , America knows this is John McCain 's agenda .
And we can't afford two more years of the same .
SEN .
BARACK OBAMA , ( D ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : I'm Barack Obama , and I approve this message .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Let 's take a call for our panel .
Mesa , California , hello .
CALLER : I wanted to comment on something that D.L. said and see his opinion on the lack of color represented at the GOP convention .
Does he think there are any way , perhaps , that the Republican Party can transcend that ?
Because , again , there was not a lot of colorful faces at the GOP convention .
HUGHLEY : I do n't see how .
Like , even -- I 'm , to me , like I said earlier , I think I try to think as independently as possible .
I can see we 're damaging -- one thing I will say about the Republicans is torpedoes be damned .
They believe what they believe and will say it out loud .
One thing I have always hated about what I saw recently with Barack Obama when he went to the Saddleback Church and they asked him his opinion on abortion .
There 's a problem .
He could n't clearly say he was against the government 's involvement in it .
I think that 's a problem .
I think since FDR , there has been readiness on this country 's part to nominate a Democratic president .
When they have nominated them , there had to be extenuating circumstances , whether it was Kennedy and the shenanigans that happened there .
KING : The question is , blacks at the Republicans party ?
HUGHLEY : I think blacks at the Republican party -- the Republicans , up until the '60s , they 've all of a sudden -- I 've never heard a Republican say anything -- to be specific , the party in general , say anything that seemed to be welcoming to me or seemed to include me at all .
KING : Our panelists , panel will be leaving us , except Jesse will remain for our remaining moments with Nancy Giles and Representative Artur Davis .
But we want to thank you and we look forward to having you back a lot , that 's Dee Dee Myers and D.L. Hughley .
Jesse Ventura remains and we 'll be back with more after this .

LIBERMAN : What after all is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican Convention like this ?
Well , I 'll tell you what , I 'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : We 're back .
Jesse Ventura remains .
Joining us from New York , Nancy Giles , social commentator .
She 's also an actress and contributor to CBS 's " News Sunday Morning , " supports Barack Obama .
And in Birmingham , Alabama , Congressman Artur Davis , democrat of Alabama , supports Obama , in fact , has known them since their days together at Harvard Law School .
He 's one of those who seconded Obama 's nomination at the convention .
Congressman Davis , first with you , does anything about Obama 's growth surprise you ?
REP .
ARTUR DAVIS , ( D ) , ALABAMA : Well , Larry , good night , first of all .
You know , you asked me if anything surprises me about his growth and in some ways the answer is I 'm not at all surprised by his growth .
I have known Barack Obama off and on for about 17 years .
He 's always been a phenomenally impressive individual .
He 's one of those people when you first meet him you come away with a sense he 's destined for great things .
I think the American people have seen that growth in the last four years .
and even in the course of this president campaign , the Barack Obama who 's campaigning around this country and the Barack Obama who has opened up a seven or eight point lead in this race is frankly now the same Barack Obama who entered this race .
He 's stronger .
He 's had to get tougher .
I look forward to continuing to see his growth .
KING : Nancy Giles , what do you make of what you 're seeing from the Republicans so far ?
NANCY GILES , COMMENTATOR : I have to echo what your caller just said .
It 's been weird for me to look into the audience and see , for lack of a better way of putting it , a sea of white people with a few little flecks of color .
It 's almost like going back in time and it makes me like a little uneasy .
I find it off - putting when people keep repeating over and over that Barack Obama has to appeal to the white working class vote .
I never hear anybody really , really challenge John McCain on appealing to the African - American working class voter , anything other than his comfort zone .
We 're part of this country as well and it makes me uneasy to see a group that 's so non-diverse .
KING : Does it bother you , Jesse ?
VENTURA : I 'm not the guy to ask on that .
I would n't show up to the Republican convention and I 'm white .
You know , I 'm not the person to ask about that .
I mean , sure it 's troubling .
You know , I can't believe that -- why -- if there are n't enough blacks surely there 's got to be black people who are conservative .
Surely , there has to be -- I would like to think someone who could fit under their supposed tent .
In a way , it does n't surprise me .
They always seem to have the attitude of my way or the highway .
GILES : I agree .
VENTURA : There 's no flexibility to them .
You know , I would never be a Republican because of social issues .
But then again , I would never be a Democrat because of economic issues .
KING : George W. Bush , I guess , relegated to a minor role , a shortened speech tonight .
Here 's a little clip of it .
then we 'll ask the guests ' opinion .
Watch .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BUSH : Last year John McCain 's independence and character helped change history .
The Democrats had taken control of Congress and were threatening to cut off funds for our troops .
In the face of call for retreat I ordered a summer of forces into Iraq .
Many in Congress said it had no chance of working .
One Senator above all had faith in our troops and the importance of their mission and that was John McCain .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Congressman Davis , is that going to play ?
DAVIS : Well , Larry , I think it will not play for a very simple reason .
President Bush is not popular anywhere in any sector of the United States except in the hard right of the Republican Party .
I kept asking myself over and over tonight , Fred Thompson made a good , partisan speech .
Joe Lieberman is always a thoughtful guy .
I think his thoughts have been more wrong than right the last few years .
I kept asking myself over and over , how is John McCain going to be different from George Bush ?
I keep hearing that John McCain is a maverick .
Well , mavericks disagree with the establishment .
I want to hear where is John McCain going to take us that is different from where a third Bush term would takes us .
And I think it's what most of the American people want to hear .
I did n't hear that tonight .
KING : Nancy ?
GILES : Yes ?
KING : Nancy , are you very disappointed in Joe Lieberman ?
GILES : I never knew what to make of Joe Lieberman .
I watch him talk and sometimes , if I squint my eyes , his mouth looks like Jack Nicholson as the Joker .
I do n't know what 's going to come out .
You know ?
Again , just to echo what Representative Davis was saying , what amazes me about John McCain and the maverick label that he 's been given and the blanket , oh , he supports our vets thing , it 's like Harold Hill and the music man , just because he says he 's a music man does n't really mean he knows how to lead the band .
Paul Rieckhoff , who heads a group called Iraq and Afghani Vets , he was talking about how John McCain , of all people , is in a position to talk about veterans issues like what it 's like to be tortured .
He even admitted while he was tortured that he gave false information .
Why has n't he come out against torture ?
Why has n't he really supported veterans ' issues like mental health care and post traumatic stress funding and housing for veterans ?
He says he supports vets .
But if people take the time and look at his record , they 're going to see he 's not really been supportive of veterans .
That hurts my heart .
You would think his experiences in Vietnam could mean something if he brings that experience back and follows it up with the kind of votes he takes as a Senator .
KING : We 'll be back with more moments with Jesse Ventura , Nancy Giles and Congressman Artur Davis .
Do n't go away .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
LIEBERMAN : Senator Barack Obama is a gifted and elegant young man who I think can do great things for our country in the years ahead .
But , my friends , eloquence is no substitute for a record , not in these tough times for America .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
KING : Let 's take a call .
Richmond , Virginia , hello .
CALLER : Hi , good evening .
I want to know , as we all know , John McCain is running as the maverick reformer .
As we all know , he was largely rejected by the conservative base of the Republican Party .
Do any of you think Sarah Palin is a token pick to appeal to the base of the party ?
And if so , what is going to happen , what is he going to do , John McCain going to do , to appeal to the base once he makes if into office ?
KING : Nancy ?
GILES : Well , I think clearly she 's a pick to appeal to that part of the party .
I am stumped as to why else he would choose her .
There 's a big , important decision for him to make , a very presidential type of decision .
And to basically choose someone for her appeal to a special interest group with a very thin resume and all kinds of other problems , I think nothing short of bizarre .
There 's another part of the party that was more moderate that McCain used to be a part of that cemented his maverick status , and he 's run completely away from them and completely towards this one little part of the party that demands a constitutional ban on abortion and , you know , across the lines these very extremist views .
So I , you know , I 'm really very worried about all of that .
KING : Jesse , " The New York Times " reported he really wanted to pick Senator Lieberman but the pressure from the far right forced him into the corner into taking someone more to their liking .
His own opinion was for Lieberman .
VENTURA : I do n't know that because I 'm not an insider naturally .
I can see that happening within these two parties .
That 's why I 'm not a part of them and that 's why I distinctly do n't like them .
And another quick subject , I 'm glad it's an election year because the administration paid attention to Hurricane Gustav .
GILES : Is n't that the truth ?
VENTURA : And hopefully they 've done a good job this time .
You can rest assured , had it not been an election year , they would have yawned it off probably again .
GILES : And , Larry , if McCain wanted Lieberman , why did n't he get Lieberman ?
Who is running his campaign ?
His he running it or someone else ?
KING : Because , I guess , they told him they would all sit at home .
GILES : So he 's not allowed ?
KING : I 'm just reporting what " The New York Times " said .
GILES : He should stick to his guns and be in charge .
Who 's running him ?
Is it him or is it -- you know ?
KING : Congressman ?
DAVIS : Larry , let me jump in on this note .
What I guess is mystifying to me is that I 've listened to John McCain these last several months .
I 've heard him say over and over again he thinks the dominate issue facing the country is the war in Iraq , dealing with radical Islamic fundamentalism .
He wants a vice president who can be a partner to him .
I just have to ask the question , it 's hard to make the case of whatever Governor Palin 's merits will be , and she has , as many people in politics do , an estimatable life story .
But basic question , can we make the argument that Sarah Palin after a year and a half as governor of Alaska , is the best qualified person to give John McCain advice on the war against radical Islamic fundamentalism or the narrow war in Iraq ?
I think it 's hard for the most devout Republican or the most devout conservative to argue Governor Palin is the best answer to that question .
It raises another question , does Senator McCain mean it -- did Senator McCain mean it when he said it was the dominant issue ?
Does he mean it when he says Senator Obama does n't have the experience , Senator Obama 's not qualified ?
Well , Senator Obama 's been dealing with the national issues the last four years a lot more than Governor Palin 's been dealing with them .
KING : Jesse , I guess this is the reason you do n't like either party , right ?
VENTURA : Me , the reason ?
Well , I do n't like them because , again , you do n't hear one word said about the debt , the over $ 9 trillion that they 've put us in debt .
Larry , if they behaved this way in the private sector , these people would be put in jail .
Have you heard of Enron and WorldCom ?
They 've run our country so far into debt now and you do n't hear one word about solving $ 9 trillion of debt .
KING : Congressman ?
GILES : And why would you ?
Bush was friends be the heads of Enron and WorldCom .
So there you are .
KING : Congressman , you 're a part of that .
( CROSTALK )
VENTURA : ... Congress , do n't you , man ?
( CROSSTALK )
DAVIS : Let me jump in on that .
I listened to Fred Thompson and I listened to Fred Thompson paint a picture tonight where the conservatives have all the right answers and liberals and Democrats have all the wrong answers .
I would love to ask Fred Thompson , this large debt that we have -- this deficit we have is a function of the last eight years .
Bill Clinton handed us a surplus .
VENTURA : No , he did not .
No , he did not .
DAVIS : And reduced that .
Jesse , I think you may have missed the record in 2001 .
VENTURA : We had a deficit -- we had a deficit .
DAVIS : $ 122 billion surplus .
VENTURA : He might have put a balance budget forward but we were in still hugely in debt .
DAVIS : $ 122 billion surplus .
GILES : Jesse , I do n't think so .
DAVIS : $ 122 billion surplus .
KING : OK , guys , we 'll have to pick this up another time .
VENTURA : You 're saying $ 9 trillion happened in the last eight years ?
( CROSSTALK )
KING : Jesse Ventura , Nancy Giles , Congressman Artur Davis , we 'll take up the debt another time .
VENTURA : Wow .
KING : Thanks , guys .
I would like to take a minute to honor the memory of one of journalism 's giants .
Ed Guttmann died Sunday .
He was a Pulitzer Prize winner , press secretary for Robert F. Kennedy , a decorated veteran .
After a distinguished newspaper career he taught at the University of California for two decades , passing on what he knew about how to be a reporter .
He influenced a number of people who work on this show and at TV networks and newspapers across the country .
Ed Guttmann , the gold standard of journalism .
Long life , he was 89 .
Tomorrow night on " LARRY KING LIVE , " high drama in St. Paul .
Is Sarah Palin ready for prime time ?
She 's going to address the GOP convention Wednesday night .
We 'll have reaction from the Democrats .

MEDICAL CANNABIS
A SHORT GRAPHICAL HISTORY Chapter 1
THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL CANNABIS
One of over 600 Pre-1937 Medical Products that the Museum has Documented
1.0 - MEDICAL CANNABIS , A SHORT GRAPHICAL HISTORY
This is a short ( graphical ) history of Medical Cannabis ( the traditional and scientific name for Medical Marihuana ) , from the Neanderthals to the Reefer Madness era .
This site was created for use mostly by newspaper reporters and others who want a short but well documented history of the subject .
As such we have endeavor to ( A ) keep it short and ( B ) to document as much as possible for ready reference .
Example ; we all know that the ancient Assyrians made use of Medical Marihuana , but have you ever seen a clay table that actually says so ?
You will here .
However , because the idea is to provide the reader with a " short " overall of history , many sections had to be left out .
Example , very little is said about Hindu or Mohammedan medicine , NOT because it is not important , but just because it does n't fit into the time line very well .
If needed the museum can provide more detail / complete pictures in either " jpg or gif " formats .
1.1 - The Neanderthals : --- 40,000 BC :
THE NEANDERTHALS :
The thought of having a medicine that was in use long before the first humans had even walked on this planet is interesting indeed ; one might say it is the stuff of science fiction writers .
But unfortunately , while many web sites " hint " at the possibility , there is no . . . [ MORE ]
1.2 - Pre-Recorded ( Human ) History :
PRE - RECORDED ( Human ) HISTORY :
The earliest known surviving Afro-Eurasian medical texts , whether ancient Egyptian papyrus scrolls , Mesopotamian clay tablets , Chinese tables etc .
All of them speak of its use in the past tense , as if Cannabis had already been in medical use long before . . . [ MORE ]
1.3 - Ancient Egypt :
ANCIENT EGYPT : By far the very vast majority of modern day Egyptologists agree that Medical Cannabis ( Medical Marihuana ) was used by the ancient Egyptians in their medicines .
This is in contradiction to what was thought to be the case right up until the early 1930 's . . . . [ MORE ]
1.4 - Mesopotamia + Assyria -- 3,000 BC :
MESOPOTAMIA & ASSYRIA : Without Question the ancient Assyrians ( today central Iraq ) made use of Medical Cannabis and it is specifically mentioned on clay tablets found at the library of Assurbanipal , an Assyrian ruler , who lived around 650 BC .
It along with another 400 other drugs comprised the whole of the Assyrian pharmacopoeia of its day .
. . . [ MORE ]
1.5 - Chinese Herbal -- 2000 BC :
Chinese Herbal :
The origin of the Chinese pharmacological book " The Herbal " ( also known by various other names ) has been lost in history and is now the subject of numerous myths and legends .
The most colorful one is that in 2000 BC the Yellow Emperor himself ordered that the sum total of all the other medical works written or known previously before that time be put together into one volume .

1.6 - Western Medical 50 - AD :
Western Medical : If West began with the Roman Empire than medical Cannabis can be said to have been there right from the very beginning .
Both Galen ( the Roman physician whose textbooks on medicine were used throughout the Middle Ages ) and Dioscorides ( author of the Greek Herbal 50 AD ) made references to its medical usage .

1.7 - BURN THE WITCH :

Automata via Macros

Journal of Functional Programming , 2006
Abstract
Lisp programmers have long used macros to extend their language .
Indeed , their success has inspired macro notations for a variety of other languages , such as C and Java .
There is , however , a paucity of effective pedagogic examples of macro use .
This paper presents a short , non-trivial example that implements a construct not already found in mainstream languages .
Furthermore , it motivates the need for tail - calls , as opposed to mere tail - recursion , and illustrates how support for tail - call optimization is crucial to support a natural style of macro - based language extension .

McDonald 's has so far refused to comment on the case
A US couple is suing McDonald 's for $ 3 m ( £ 2 m ) after nude photos of the woman , which were on her husband 's mobile phone , ended up on the internet .
Phillip Sherman says he accidentally left his phone , with the photos , at a McDonald 's in Fayetteville , Arkansas .
He says staff promised to secure the phone until he could retrieve it .
The Shermans claim they had to move to a new home after the woman 's name , address , and phone number appeared online along with the photos .
Tina Sherman says she began receiving offensive calls and text messages about the pictures from her husband 's mobile phone after he left it at the McDonald 's on 5 July .
The couple then discovered that the nude pictures she had sent to her husband 's phone had been posted online .
The Shermans are suing McDonald 's Corporation , the owner of the franchise involved and the restaurant 's manager , saying they have suffered emotional distress , embarrassment and damage to their reputations .
They also allege loss of earnings and want to recover the cost of moving to a new home .
McDonald 's Corp , the franchise owner and the manager have so far refused to comment on the case .
The nude pictures have been removed from the website that had posted them .
“ The Day the Earth Stood Still ” is 20th Century Fox ’s contemporary reinvention of its 1951 classic .
Keanu Reeves portrays Klaatu , an alien whose arrival on our planet triggers a global upheaval .
As governments and scientists race to unravel the mystery behind the visitor ’s appearance , a woman ( Jennifer Connelly ) and her young stepson get caught up in his mission – and come to understand the ramifications of his being a self - described “ friend to the Earth . ”
Check out one more international poster ( French ) for one of the most anticipated movies of the year – “ . ”
Take a look also at two latest TV spot for the movie .
The directortalks about original movie and its remake : “ It was intentional .
I certainly took a lot of time to explore other possibilities .
It was n’t just a foregone conclusion in my mind that we would be sticking to the original .
I tried looking at a lot of different possibilities , worked on a lot of different ideas with artists and just always a nagging sense that there was something right about the way the original , that there was something about this alien entity choosing a human form or being in a human form that had value even by modern standards , not by 1950 standards .
I also am such a fan of the original film .
You have to also just have some respect for Gort .
Gort is Gort .
There ’s no question what we designed pays homage to the original .
” In an interview with MTV News , told that Klaatu ’s message to Earth was very different from the one in the original , that he was bringing with him a warning to stop destroying the environment .
“ It ’s both and even more , ” Derrickson explained .
“ I think that this film in some ways is an attempt to address a number of issues that are amongst the most pressing issues for the human race .
The original being a Cold War film was addressing what was clearly the greatest threat for the human race at that time , mutual nuclear destruction , and that ’s not the most pressing threat that we face now .
It ’s also man vs. man .
We are destroying each other as well .
Our country ’s at war right now .
There is certainly the issue being addressed in the movie of our treatment of one another on the planet .
I think it ’s a movie about human nature as much as anything else and how human nature is acting itself out in the world right now .
”
In the original , Klaatu finds the character of Helen after he escapes from custody .
Here , she goes to him .
“ She ’s actually a professor at Princeton University and she ’s a microbiologist and she ’s recruited early in the movie for an event that ’s clearly occurring .
She ’s recruited by the government whether she likes it or not , really , ” Derrickson said .
“ Helen is probably an expanded role from the original film . , of course , is a fantastic actress .
She was always my first choice for the role so I ’m elated that she ’s in it . ”
“ The Day the Earth Stood Still ” which also stars Kathy Bates , Jaden Smith , Jon Hamm and Kyle Chandler is scheduled to hit theaters on December 12th 2008 .

As scientific ambitions go , it 's a big one : no less than the creation of an artificial life form .
Since the early 1980s , scientists have been attempting to create synthetic cells .
And apparently the final breakthrough is expected very soon .
" This is a critical time for artificial life , " says Dr Seth Bullock , who chaired the ALife XI conference - a gathering of more than 400 scientists , philosophers and engineers at the University of Winchester last month .
" The field is on the verge of synthesising living cells . "
Artificial life , often referred to as alife , is a very diverse field of study , encompassing simulations , computer models , robotics and biochemistry .
Researchers concern themselves with the reconstruction or simulation of living processes in a variety of media - including robotics and chemical systems , as well as computational modelling .
It 's also a very esoteric community , but their work has proven , despite much controversy , to have many practical applications .
Pieces of the jigsaw
" There are many aspects to what makes up a living organism , " says Alex Penn of the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton .
" The key aspects are production of a self - sustaining metabolism , a membrane to separate this metabolic system from its environment and an informational system , such as DNA , to support replication and heredity . "
Penn argues that although there has been no single breakthrough , different groups are approaching the problem of making a whole cell from different angles .
" Although we are not yet at the stage of creating a totally self - producing , self - reproducing , autonomous living cell , considerable advances have been made on individual aspects . "
At the forefront of the artificial life movement is a research group led by Craig Venter , the American biologist who founded the Institute for Genomic Research and who is a leading cartographer of the human genome .
Venter has recently managed to insert artificially constructed chromosomes into existing living cells : not quite artificial life , but something approaching a synthesis of it .
Rival research institutions are also close to fitting other pieces of the jigsaw in to place .
Mark Bedau at the European Centre for Living Technology in Venice has manufactured artificial vesicles - in effect , artificial cell walls - thought to be a key step in the origin of proto - cellular life .
Although the creation of a synthetic life form is a mainly a practice of biologists , the results are of keen interest to any scientist interested in understanding living systems and their origins .
" One route to understanding a system and its origins is to attempt to reconstruct it , " says Penn .
Since the movement 's rise , it has often been perceived as an endeavour perused by maverick scientists operating on the edge of mainstream science .
" The alife community has always been a place where [ scientific ] outsiders could gather , " says Mark Bedau , editor of the Artificial Life Journal .
" It 's been seen as something of an amateur science and yet the robot being used to explore Mars uses principles that have come out of the alife community . "
Moreover , artificial life has produced many practical achievements much closer to home .
Its ideas and principles have helped inspire a range of innovations , ranging from the development of household robotics such as Rod Brooks '
iRobot vacuum cleaner through to computer games that use evolutionary artificial intelligence approaches , to the special effects in Hollywood blockbusters .
The battle scenes in the film Troy , for example , were produced with software developed by Torsten Reil 's Natural Motion company , which in turn was based on principles spun out of the alife movement .
Elsewhere , financial systems modelling biologically - inspired evolutionary algorithms are used to analyse complex financial portfolios by companies such as CodeFarm and Icosystem , while BT is investing in alife approaches as a means for understanding and manipulating the behaviour of large , complicated , open socio - technological systems such as wireless networks .
The idea is that the BT could build telecommunications networks that could self - regulate and repair .
" Cells are constantly processing information .
Everything that is alive is a fantastic information processor , " says Klaus Peter Zauner of the University of Southampton .
Just as 19th - century engineers studied the flight of birds and dreamed of being airborne , he says , so today 's computer engineers marvel at the intelligence in all forms of life and contemplate the potential of more efficient computation .
Great leaps forward
There are , however , major conceptual challenges that need to be overcome before the synthetic cells are possible .
First , the coupling of the three essential components of a living cell : metabolism ; membrane and inheritance system is not yet fully understood .
" Second , and more generally , " says Penn , " we need to better understand the respective roles of evolution and self - organisation and how they combine to produce living systems . "
A decade ago , artificial life was criticised by the evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith as being a " fact - free science " , but the recent leaps forward mean that it is belatedly being accepted into the scientific mainstream .
For Obama , a green White House Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday November 27 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US president - elect Barack Obama has said in an interview that he hopes to make the White House environmentally friendly , and encouraged fellow Americans to follow suit .
" Part of what I want to do is to show the American people that it's not that hard , " Obama told ABC television on Wednesday .
Obama identified a couple of easy , everyday ways people can help make their home a greener place -- turning off lights , unplugging chargers for electrical devices when not in use .
Showing he may be the first US president to embrace the green movement at home since Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the White House roof , Obama said he intends to confer with the chief usher about the building 's energy efficiency .
Asked whether he would be tiptoeing around at night turning off the lights , Obama admitted although he does just that in his current Chicago residence , he was " not going to be obsessive about it . "
Obama , who spoke with ABC's Barbara Walters alongside his wife Michelle , also acknowledged the overwhelming interest in the dog he intends to get for his daughters .
The subject has been a hot topic ever since Obama mentioned in his triumphant election night speech that his daughters " deserve the new puppy " the family will get when they move to the White House .
Obama said he was getting more canine - related advice " than my economic policies , no doubt about it . "
He also said the children will have to deal with the messy side of owning a pet .
" Scoop the poop .
We 've been talking to them about that , " he said .
" We do n't want litter on the White House lawns .
They 're going to have to do their job . "
Mr Bin Laden says he has not spoken to his father for eight years
One of Osama Bin Laden 's sons is in Qatar after being deported from Egypt and Spain following failed asylum bids .
Omar Bin Laden , 27 , has said he does not share his father 's views and has not seen him since 2000 .
His British wife , Zaina Alsabah Bin Laden ( formerly Jane Felix - Browne ) said their condemnation of al - Qaeda had put their lives in danger in the Mid-East .
Their legal status in Qatar was not known .
They have also been unsuccessful in securing British visas .
Mr Bin Laden , one of the al - Qaeda leader 's 19 sons , made his claim for asylum in Madrid during a stopover on a flight from Egypt to Morocco with his 52 - year - old wife .
We have finally found somewhere where we can stay and we thank the government - we cannot thank them enough
Zaina Alsabah Bin Laden
He said the petition was rejected due to " insufficient evidence of danger or threat to [ his ] life " .
An appeal against the ruling is also believed to have been rejected .
The couple were then barred from entering Egypt , where they have lived for the past year .
It was not known why Egypt denied them entry .
Officials at Cairo airport said the pair were deported to Qatar , where Mr Bin Laden , who has Saudi nationality , should normally have the right to live .
" We have finally found somewhere where we can stay and we thank the government .
We cannot thank them enough , " Mr Bin Laden 's wife was quoted by AFP news agency as saying .
Omar Bin Laden , a metals trader , says he has urged his father to give up violence and has not seen him for eight years .
Mrs Bin Laden says his life is in danger because he " stands up and asks for peace " .

Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans join the homeless
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans join the homeless 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Ethan Kreutzer joined the Army at the age of 17 and fought with the 19th Airborne in Jalalabad , Afghanistan .
When he retuned home , he had no money , no education and no civilian job experience .
He soon became homeless .
He slept in an alley off Haight Street , behind two trash cans .
June Moss drove from Kuwait to Iraq as an Army engineer in a truck convoy .
When she returned to the United States , she lost her home , and drove her two young children from hotel to hotel across Northern California .
Sean McKeen , a hardy , broad - shouldered 21 - year - old with a wide smile , went to Iraq to clear land mines , and to get money for college .
When he returned home , he became homeless in less than a week .
He found himself sleeping in a cot in a crowded homeless shelter in San Francisco .
They are all part of a growing trend of homelessness among returning war on terrorism veterans .
More than 2,000 military personnel return home to California each month .
Most have no specialized job experience , education or an easy familiarity with civilian life .
And many have post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , making it difficult to get along with friends and family , and almost impossible to hold down a job .
" You feel like the whole world is against you when you get home , " said Kreutzer .
" I was sleeping on the sidewalk , whereas I had been wearing a uniform less than a year before . "
Soft - spoken and restless , Kreutzer was recruited in a 7 - Eleven while still in high school .
After five months in Afghanistan , he had a mental breakdown , diagnosed as PTSD .
When he returned to the United States , he spent almost four years living on the streets .
Kreutzer said he 's met several veterans of the war in Iraq on the streets of San Francisco , or sleeping in Golden Gate Park .
He also said he met several veterans of the war in Afghanistan , like himself , who were in similar situations .
Kreutzer now lives in a temporary housing facility for veterans on Treasure Island , run by the group Swords to Plowshares .
He attends PTSD counseling with other war on terrorism veterans so that he can learn to maintain a job and house .
" I was haunted by a lot of issues , a lot of things that I saw over there that were not good things .
There are some times when I can wake up in a room and think I 'm still there .
I still remember what it tastes like , the air over there .
I see all the rocks , I see the people , " said Kreutzer .
One of the symptoms of PTSD is isolation and withdrawal , according to Amy Fairweather , director of the Iraq Veterans project at Swords to Plowshares .
" So that interferes with your ability to get a job .
People sit in the dark by themselves , " she said .
Fairweather is seeing large numbers of homeless war on terrorism veterans come through her doors .
" Homelessness can happen very quickly , if they do n't get the help they need .
Their mental health will get worse , they will become more depressed , " she said .
" We are seeing Iraq and Afghanistan veterans , who are homeless , coming in very quickly .
After Vietnam , it generally took about five to 10 years to end up on the streets .
We 're seeing people on the streets three months after they come home . "
Moss spent 12 years with the military and had purchased a house with a VA home loan , but she fell behind on payments .
" When I got back from Iraq , I knew something was wrong , " she said .
Diagnosed with PTSD , she found herself awake at night devising ways to keep her family safe .
" I decided to move the refrigerator in front of the door to bunker us in , " she said .
" Then I would stay up all night baking cookies because I did n't want to go to sleep .
Eventually , I stopped leaving the house altogether . "
Moss lost her job and her income , and the bank foreclosed on her home .
She moved her two kids between temporary housing units and hotels until her PTSD was under control .
Now , she has a temporary house for her family , and a full - time job at the VA .
" It 's because of my kids that I go to therapy and take my medication .
If it was n't for them , I do n't know what would happen , " she said .
Other veterans are not so lucky .
McKeen was exposed to more than 300 bomb blasts in Iraq .
He suffers from traumatic brain injury as well as PTSD .
When he returned home , he slept on couches at friends ' houses , and in his car while looking for a job .
He spent many nights wandering the streets before he ended up in a shelter .
" It 's like a culture shock returning home , but you are supposed to be used to it , " he said .
" Unless you are in war , nobody can understand what it 's like .
And they expect you to just function normally by yourself after that ? "
The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates about 2,000 war on terrorism veterans have become homeless upon returning to the United States .
It 's still a small number , when compared to the staggering numbers of homeless Vietnam War -era veterans , but one that could balloon in the coming months .
At the Palo Alto VA , the inpatient programs for PTSD and TBI are crowded with war on terrorism veterans - an indication that a large number are at risk for homelessness , according to director of homeless programs Keith Harris .
" Before it gets to the point where someone is living on the street , what they are typically doing is struggling with a mental health disorder , burning their bridges with the people around them , family , employers , spouses , " he said . " I do n't believe there is a large chunk of returnees literally homeless without a roof over their heads , but I think a large chunk of them are at risk for it . "
The homeless shelter at the Palo Alto VA is full .
And many veterans still complain that the VA is unprepared and overly bureaucratic .
Most have to wait six to eight months for claims to be addressed .
But by all accounts , the VA is far better prepared this time than it ever has been in the past .
With an understanding that the looming homeless crisis is best treated as a mental health issue , it has hired 17,000 mental health workers , making it the largest mental health program in the country .
But with some 2 million active service members still fighting and undergoing the trauma of war , Moss wonders if any amount of preparation by the VA can address the fundamental problem of readjustment .
" I think the problem is war itself , " she said .
" War changes a person .
I talk to all vets .
The same experiences we had coming home from Iraq are the same experience World War II ( vets ) saw , Vietnam saw , Korean War saw , so it has n't changed .
I think the real problem is probably just war itself . "
It was only a matter of time before " The Reckoning , " the New York Times 'series on the roots of the financial crisis , concentrated on Alan Greenspan .
Today 's installment comes with a simple takeaway : Greenspan , the chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 until 2006 , had enormous power on Capitol Hill because of his perceived infallibility .
But " The Oracle , " as he was called , was wrong about one big thing : derivatives .
Despite ample warnings that the largely unregulated derivatives market could lead to financial disaster , Greenspan praised them as " extraordinarily useful " and rebuffed repeated attempts to regulate them .
But they did lead to disaster .
One kind of derivative in particular , the credit default swap , was one of the main causes of the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the near - collapse of AIG .
Essentially a form of insurance ( it 's not actually called insurance to avoid regulation ) , credit default swaps allow investors to protect themselves .
They proved especially useful to those making risky bets on mortgage securities over the past several years .
The total market for credit default swaps in 2002 had a notional value of $ 2.2 trillion .
In 2008 , it 's estimated to be $ 54.6 trillion .
Because the market is unregulated , the extent of the contagion is largely unknown .
As one hedge fund manager puts it , credit default swaps have become " the dark matter of the financial universe . "
As the Times documents , the warnings were clear and Greenspan 's response to them consistent .
In 1992 , Rep. Edward Markey ( D - Mass . ) asked the General Accounting Office to study derivatives .
The GAO 's report identified " significant gaps and weaknesses " in the regulatory oversight of derivatives .
And its prediction was right on :
" The sudden failure or abrupt withdrawal from trading of any of these large U.S. dealers could cause liquidity problems in the markets and could also pose risks to others , including federally insured banks and the financial system as a whole .
In some cases intervention has and could result in a financial bailout paid for or guaranteed by taxpayers . "
Markey introduced a bill requiring more derivatives regulation , but it went nowhere .
Later , in 1997 , a lawyer on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission pushed to regulate derivatives .
That , too , went nowhere , largely due to Greenspan 's opposition , along with then - Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin .
The two even pushed Congress to strip the CFTC of regulatory authority over derivatives .
And then there is Warren Buffet 's famous warning in 2003 that derivatives were " financial weapons of mass destruction . "
Greenspan 's opposition to regulation has its source in his libertarian philosophy , the Times notes , marshalling a number of his quotes from over the years about how the market will take care of itself .
In 1994 : " Risk in financial markets , including derivatives markets , are being regulated by private parties ...
There is nothing involved in federal regulation per se which makes it superior to market regulation . "
The risk of a crisis stoked by loose derivative trading was " extremely remote . "
And then in 2000 : " I believe that the general growth in large institutions have occurred in the context of an underlying structure of markets in which many of the larger risks are dramatically — I should say , fully — hedged . "
And then in 2003 : " What we have found over the years in the marketplace is that derivatives have been an extraordinarily useful vehicle to transfer risk from those who should n't be taking it to those who are willing to and are capable of doing so . "
It would be a " mistake " to increase regulation .
So what does he say now ?
Greed ran rampant on Wall Street .
As he put it last week : " In a market system based on trust , reputation has a significant economic value .
I am therefore distressed at how far we have let concerns for reputation slip in recent years . "
Greenspan did n't respond to the Times ' inquiries , instead referring the reporter to his 2007 memoir :
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gas prices have plummeted 44 % since peaking at over $ 4 a gallon this summer , and are now averaging around $ 2.30 .
There 's some evidence suggesting Americans are using the savings not to buy groceries or make home payments , but instead to drive more .
That may , in turn , drive up demand and push prices right back up .
So while gas prices are still well below $ 3 a gallon , is now the time to pass a gas tax in an effort to keep demand down ?
And will a President Obama , who wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions , have the political firepower to call for a tax that most politicians are unwilling to discuss - even though many economists say it would be the most efficient way to reduce global warming ?
" There 's no question , it will be successful as a way to cut consumption , " said Gary Becker , a Nobel Laureate economist at the University of Chicago .
" It 's certainly a better time to enact it , than when gas was at $ 4 a gallon . "
To those who support a gas tax , cutting consumption has many benefits .
First , it reduces greenhouse gas emissions .
It also helps alleviate congestion and eases the burden on the country 's aging roads and bridges .
While it is likely to raise prices immediately , the tax would also simultaneously act to reduce consumption , so the market price for gas would likely fall .
That would mean less money for OPEC or Exxon Mobil .
If the government raised the gas tax by $ 1 , that 's about $ 140 billion dollars a year that could be used for schools , roads , or whatever the feds wanted to spend the money on .
" If we can cut gas consumption , we can cut oil imports and we cut how much ( money ) we send to overseas nations , " said Becker .
As gas prices passed $ 4 a gallon this summer , there was ample evidence that Americans were driving less .
Sales of big cars and trucks plummeted .
As fall approached , it was clear Americans were changing their driving habits .
Numbers complied by MasterCard 's SpendingPulse market report showed gas consumption falling by as much as 9 % in early October , a deeper decline than the 4 % or 5 % seen throughout the summer .
Government figures for October showed a drop of over 4 % , also outpacing earlier government estimates .
Americans love to drive
Gas prices have fallen sharply since the summer and Americans once again are getting behind the wheel .
The latest MasterCard report shows a drop of only 4 % , while government figures show a decline of 2.5 % , despite an economy that only appears to be getting worse .
Sales of trucks are improving .
J.D. Power and Associates say that the most recent figures show that of people buying new vehicles , a greater number are buying trucks compared to previous months .
While the renewed interest in truck sales is partly due to bigger incentives and pent - up demand , falling gas prices most certainly played a part .
There 's got to be another way
A gas tax is of course just one way of cutting consumption , and some feel it 's too crude a tool .
" It would n't be the most efficient way to decrease energy demand , " said Chris Lafakis , an economist at Moody 's Economy.com , an economic consultancy .
Lafakis feels gas demand is too inelastic to be reduced with a tax - that is , people live too far from work and have to drive no matter how high the price .
A better way to reduce oil consumption , he says , would be for the government to promote different fuels - like natural gas , biofuels , or electricity .
With at least $ 25 billion promised to U.S. automakers , he feels that the feds have ample leverage to get them to build cars that use less gas .
There are also those that downplay the dangers of global warming and say what the country needs is more energy at a cheaper price .
" You do not get more energy by taxing energy , " said David Kreutzer , an energy economist at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank .
" The damage to the economy is fairly significant , while the case for catastrophic global warming just does n't hold water . "
There 's also the criticism that a gas tax is regressive - it hits poor people more than rich ones .
Now would be a terrible time for a new tax , with people losing jobs and the economy on the skids .
But proponents say a gas tax need not be a new tax , just a shift in taxes .
Andrew Samwick , an economic professor at Dartmouth , suggested lowering the payroll tax - which evaluated from an economists ' standpoint discourages people from working , and replacing it with a gas tax , which would discourage people from driving .
" Is there anybody who would actively promote the reverse , " asked Samwick .
Gas tax ?
Do n't bet the farm
As to whether Obama or the new Congress would attempt such a thing , no one spoken to , for this story , thought it was likely in the short term .
A spokesman for Obama said they were too busy dealing with the transition right now to comment on policy matters .
Politicians have long resisted a gas tax , simply because they fear voters will kick them out of office for passing such a blatant tax .
Obama would be better off dealing with a more politically popular problem , like health care , said Samwick , in order to get some momentum rolling in his administration .
As for Congress putting their neck on the line and picking up with a gas tax , " you would have to invent a negative number for probability , " he said .
Did you vote for Obama ?
How do you think the new president will affect your wallet ?
What do you think Obama needs to do to fix the economy - both in the short run and the long term ?
What should be first on the new Congress 's agenda ?

Climate scientists allied with the IPCC have been caught citing fake data to make the case that global warming is accelerating , a shocking example of mass public deception that could spell the beginning of the end for the acceptance of man-made climate change theories .
On Monday , NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) , run by Al Gore ’s chief scientific ally , Dr James Hansen , announced that last month was the hottest October on record .
“ This was startling , ” reports the London Telegraph .
“ Across the world there were reports of unseasonal snow and plummeting temperatures last month , from the American Great Plains to China , and from the Alps to New Zealand .
China ’s official news agency reported that Tibet had suffered its “ worst snowstorm ever ” .
In the US , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration registered 63 local snowfall records and 115 lowest - ever temperatures for the month , and ranked it as only the 70th - warmest October in 114 years . ”
It soon came to light that the data produced by NASA to make the claim , and in particular temperature records covering large areas of Russia , was merely carried over from the previous month .
NASA had used temperature records from the naturally hotter month of September and claimed they represented temperature figures in October .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
When NASA was confronted with this glaring error , they then attempted to compensate for the lower temperatures in Russia by claiming they had discovered a new “ hotspot ” in the Arctic , despite satellite imagery clearly showing that Arctic sea ice had massively expanded its coverage by 30 per cent , an area the size of Germany , since summer 2007 .
The figures published by Dr Hansen ’s institute are one of the primary sets of data used by the IPCC to promote its case for man-made global warming and they are widely quoted because they consistently show higher temperatures than other figures .
“ Yet last week ’s latest episode is far from the first time Dr Hansen ’s methodology has been called in question , ” reports the Telegraph .
“ In 2007 he was forced by Mr Watts and Mr McIntyre to revise his published figures for US surface temperatures , to show that the hottest decade of the 20th century was not the 1990s , as he had claimed , but the 1930s . ”
Dr Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the IPCC and a close ally of Hansen , also raised eyebrows recently during a presentation in Australia , during which he claimed that global temperatures have recently been rising “ very much faster ” than ever as he cited a graph showing purported temperature increases over the last decade .
In fact , as even the vast majority of man-made global warming advocates will concede , temperatures since 1998 have moved sideways and over the last 18 months they have clearly begun a downward trend .
Whether such “ mistakes ” are made in genuine error or are part of a politicized push for man-made global warming to be universally accepted , and the evidence clearly suggests that latter is the case , the fact is that we can no longer tolerate the cry that “ the debate is over ” on man -made global warming in light of such gargantuan falsehoods .
Likewise , the push for carbon emissions to be reduced by 80 per cent or more , a figure that would completely cripple western economies and lower living standards to a near third world level , can no longer be accepted as a reasonable course of action now that the primary authority on man-made global warming , the UN IPCC , has been proven to be using fraudulent data to make its case .
Foisted upon the public by means of giant multi-million dollar PR campaigns and brainwashing mandates that have worked themselves into every sector of society , including education , movies , television the arts and culture , all the attention and funding is being lavished upon a manufactured hoax , peddled with the aid of phony data , as governments prepare to suck what ’s left out of the middle class and poor with carbon taxes that do nothing to help the environment , while all the real environmental problems are left in the shadows .

Finding from balloon experiment adds to satellite data .
A high - altitude balloon experiment above the Antarctic seems to have seen a possible signature of mysterious ' dark matter ' , similar to that spotted earlier this year by a European satellite .
The Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter ( ATIC ) , an experiment to search for charged particles from space , has spotted a surplus of high - energy electrons coming from somewhere in the cosmos ( see Letter , page 362 , and News & Views , page 329 ) .
Although the interpretation is far from certain , the electrons could be produced by dark matter — previously undetected particles that physicists believe make up 85 % of all matter in the Universe .
ATIC 's findings are similar to data from the PAMELA ( Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light - nuclei Astrophysics ) satellite mission , a collaboration between Italy , Russia , Germany and Sweden that spotted an excess of high - energy positrons , or anti-electrons , at roughly similar energies ( see Nature 454 , 808 ; 2008 ) .
" In several respects the two measurements complement each other , " says John Wefel , head of the ATIC collaboration and a physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
Several experiments may have found dark matter , the existence of which is inferred here ( blue ) .
NASA
Wefel 's team looked at data from two multi-day ATIC missions flown between 2000 and 2003 some 35 kilometres above the Antarctic ice .
With 99.5 % of Earth 's atmosphere beneath them , the missions measured electrons that come from various galactic sources such as exploding stars .
As predicted by theory , the experiment saw fewer electrons at higher energies .
But between 300 gigaelectronvolts and 600 gigaelectronvolts , the number of electrons rose sharply before falling off to background levels .
PAMELA 's results , as posted on the arXiv preprint server last month ( O. Adriani et al .
http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4995 ; 2008 ) and also submitted to Nature , show positrons increasing up to 100 gigaelectronvolts .
Although the collaboration did not report beyond this energy level , some suspect that the number of positrons may continue to increase at higher energies .
And , because the PAMELA and ATIC data were measured in different ways , researchers believe that their findings probably confirm each other .
The ' bump '
ATIC sees in the number of electrons could be the result of heavy dark - matter particles annihilating , according to Wefel .
When this happens , two dark - matter particles collide and their mass is converted to pairs of fast - moving electrons and positrons , the energies of which would correspond to the mass of the original particles .
“ Annihilation of dark - matter particles is certainly the sexiest of the possibilities . ”
" That 's certainly the sexiest of the possibilities , " says Dan Hooper , a theoretical physicist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois .
The exact nature of the dark - matter particles that produce electrons is uncertain , but one idea is that they may be ordinary particles that spend part of their lives in a compact extra dimension of space .
Whereas the particles would appear relatively stationary to observers trapped in three spatial dimensions , they could be moving at ultra - high speeds in a fourth spatial dimension .
At high speeds , they would create a gravitational force that could be felt by matter trapped in three dimensions of space - time .
" It 's very wild , " Hooper says .
Other , more mundane reasons might also explain the data .
The leading candidate is a nearby pulsar , says Aldo Morselli , a particle physicist from the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics at the University of Rome , Tor Vergata .
Pulsars , the fast - spinning remnants of supernovae explosions , have enormous magnetic fields that can accelerate electrons to the high energies seen in the experiments , although ATIC 's bump is harder to match to a pulsar than PAMELA 's increase .

Wefel agrees that it is too early to say for certain whether ATIC and PAMELA have seen dark matter .
" You can not make a hard and fast claim , " he says .
" The case is still open . "
But more evidence may come soon .
NASA 's Fermi telescope ( formerly known as GLAST ) , which launched in June this year , is designed to hunt for high - energy γ-rays .
But the telescope can also spot electrons and positrons , according to Morselli .
In the coming months , he predicts that the telescope will be able to verify the positron and electron data of PAMELA and ATIC .
In addition , Fermi may be able to spot γ-rays that have come from dark - matter annihilations .
" By the spring of 2009 , we 'll have a lot more information , " Morselli says .
Eri Yoshida Becomes First Female Professional Baseball Player in Japan
16 - year - oldhas been drafted by the Kobe 9 Cruise , becoming the first woman in Japan to play professional baseball alongside men .
Yoshida , a high school student at Kawasaki Kita High School in Kanagawa Prefecture , says she " always dreamed of becoming a professional . "
Standing 5 - feet tall and weighing 114 pounds , Yoshida is known for her side - arm knuckleball .
She says her goal is to follow in the footsteps of knuckleballer Tim Wakefield of the Boston Red Sox .
At tryouts earlier this month , the right - hander held male batters hitless for one inning , helping her become one of 33 players picked in the draft .
With the recent release of URL - rewrite module for IIS 7.0 and the inclusion of ASP.
NET routing into the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 , many ASP.NET developers are questioning how these two features relate to each other and when each should be used .
Ruslan Yakushev has an instructive post on LearnIIS.net .
The essential difference is that IIS URL rewriting is handled at a lower level than ASP.
NET routing and is invisible to the client .
Ruslan provides a visual workflow of the IIS 7 URL Rewriting process .
You 'll see that the URL Rewrite Module is activated before the request is passed to a request handler , e.g. , the ASP.
NET managed ASPX handler .
IIS URL rewriting is unaware of specific request handlers .
He also provides a visual workflow the ASP .
NET Routing process .
You 'll see the ASP.
NET routing is a request dispatcher and must be fully aware of which handler a specific request should be routed to .
From Ruslan 's description :
Escalating its efforts to portray Senator Barack Obama as a candidate whose values fall outside the mainstream , the campaign of Senator John McCain on Tuesday unveiled a new television advertisement claiming that Mr. Obama , the Democratic nominee , favors “ comprehensive sex education ” for kindergarten students .
“ Learning about sex before learning to read ? ” the narrator asks in the 30 - second advertisement , which the campaign says will be shown in battleground states and on national cable .
The commercial also asserts that a sex-education bill introduced in Illinois , which Mr. Obama did not sponsor and which never became law , is his “ one accomplishment ” in the field of education .
Both sets of accusations , however , seriously distort the record .
The original controversy dates to 2003 , when a bill to modify the teaching of sex education in Illinois was introduced in the Legislature .
The proposal was supported by a coalition of education and public health organizations , including the Illinois Parent Teacher Association , the Illinois State Medical Society , the Illinois Public Health Association and the Illinois Education Association .
Mr. Obama voted for the bill in committee , where it passed , but it never came to a full and final vote .
The proposal called for “ age and developmentally appropriate ” sex education and also allowed parents the option of withdrawing their children from such classroom instruction if they felt that it clashed with their beliefs or values .
Do you remember when Jaw Lennon , Pall IcKartney , Gorge Harryson , and Dingo Scarr appeared on the Dead Sullivan Show and took the US by storm ?
Together this quartet forms the Zombeatles , four undead heartthrobs looking to share their music with the world .
And , thanks to zombie comedian Angus MacAbre , they 're getting their chance , in a mockumentary chronicling their rise to fame .
MacAbre , a.k.a. public radio producer Doug Gordon , got the idea to create All You Need Is Brains , which he describes as “ Night of the Living Dead meets Spinal Tap , ” from Madison - based band The Gomers .
Recalling The Zombeatles , the Halloween - time alter ego of The Gomers complete with songs like “ I Want To Eat Your Hand ” and “ Hard Day ’s Night Of The Living Dead , ” he was inspired to bring them together .
Gordon thought the respective acts [ his and the Zombeatles ’ ] could easily be combined thematically to create a short mockumentary set in a “ zomniverse ” where the walking dead have evolved , and apparently have staged their own British Invasion .

A report from the set gives us a taste of the film ’s musical zombie humor :
At one point during the scene , [ Jaw Lennon portrayer Steve ]
Burke strummed his axe with one dead hand before dropping it to the floor , at which point the zombie audience literally ate it up .

Gordon hopes to have a rough cut of the film done in time for the October 25 Madison Horror Film Festival , but you can get a peek at the Zombeatles ’ shtick with their single , “ A Hard Day ’s Night of the Living Dead . ”

To hear Brian Williams and Chuck Todd talk , as they did last night on Hardball , you 'd think things were perhaps not so peachy these days over at Camp McCain , after they spent the afternoon interviewing John McCain and Sarah Palin together :
Well , Chris , and this something that I -- I would n't blame Brian for not wanting to say this , but -- there was a tenseness between -- first of all , between the two -- there 's no chemistry .
I could n't see chemistry between John McCain and Sarah Palin .
It was -- I felt as if we grabbed two people and said , ' Here , sit next to each other , we 're going to conduct an interview . '
There was n't -- they 're not -- you know , they 're not just ... comfortable with each other , uh , yet .
The other thing about it is that you can tell they know that they 're losing .
They just have -- there 's an intensity there , they 're drained , the entire campaign staff is drained .
The two candidates are guarded , they seem on edge .
It 's not as if they were rude or anything , it 's not as if they were n't trying to be forthcoming , it 's just , they seemed -- it 's a negative intensity .
I do n't know how else to describe it .
But you 'll see , when you see the two of them together , the chemistry 's not all there .
You do wonder , is John McCain starting to blame her for things , blaming himself ?
Is she blaming him ?
You just wonder what 's going on inside their heads .
Are they upset with how the other has treated them , and is that why her numbers are low ?
But whatever it is , it 's a negative vibe that you get in that room .
This happens to echo the recent New Yorker piece ( which Todd in fact cites a little later in the discussion ) , which described how much McCain wanted to name his favorite fellow Mavericky Senator , Holy Joe Lieberman himself , and as many of us suspected , strongly preferred Joe as his running mate :
By the spring , the McCain campaign had reportedly sent scouts to Alaska to start vetting Palin as a possible running mate .
A week or so before McCain named her , however , sources close to the campaign say , McCain was intent on naming his fellow - senator Joe Lieberman , an independent , who left the Democratic Party in 2006 .
David Keene , the chairman of the American Conservative Union , who is close to a number of McCain ’s top aides , told me that “ McCain and Lindsey Graham ” — the South Carolina senator , who has been McCain ’s closest campaign companion — “ really wanted Joe . ”
But Keene believed that “ McCain was scared off ” in the final days , after warnings from his advisers that choosing Lieberman would ignite a contentious floor fight at the Convention , as social conservatives revolted against Lieberman for being , among other things , pro-choice .
“ They took it away from him , ” a longtime friend of McCain — who asked not to be identified , since the campaign has declined to discuss its selection process — said of the advisers .
“ He was furious .
He was pissed .
It was n’t what he wanted . ”
Another friend disputed this , characterizing McCain ’s mood as one of “ understanding resignation . ”
One can readily imagine the Mavericky One 's disappointment -- not to mention Holy Joe 's ... as well as the liberal blogosphere's .
My , what fun that 'd have been .
With the added value that Joe no doubt would 've helped McCain about as much as he helped Al Gore .
They kept fishing around long enough and came up with a hottie to run alongside the hero .
Too bad the hottie turned out to be a complete know - nothing capable of making everyone forget those " McCain moments . "
Now McCain knows who to blame for that swirling toiletlike sound he hears at every turn :
The idiots who told him to name Palin .
And of course , Palin herself bears the brunt of this :
Palin initially provided the McCain campaign with a boost , but polls now suggest that she has become a liability .
A top Republican close to the campaign said that McCain ’s aides have largely kept faith with Palin .
They have been impressed by her work ethic , and by what a quick study she is .
According to the Republican close to the campaign , she has sometimes discomfited advisers by travelling with a big family entourage .
“ It kind of changes the dynamic of a meeting to have them all in the room , ” he told me .
John McCain ’s comfort level with Palin is harder to gauge .
In the view of the longtime McCain friend , “ John ’s personal comfort level is low with everyone right now .
He ’s angry .
But it was his choice . ”
Just imagine :
If he'd been able to name Joe his running mate , he could just go out there and be John McCain and do his thing instead of being the victim of Dobson 's Choice he 's become .
Why , then he'd only be losing by 15 instead of 10 .

The software is written in Scala with no dependencies on external software , and is released under the LGPL licence .
From the list of features :
US killtech behemoth Northrop Grumman has has said that it is ready to take orders for the " world 's first ruggedised , weaponised high energy solid state laser designed for battlefield applications " .
The raygun module is dubbed FIRESTRIKE ™ .
Overkill , you might say , just for lighting campfires .
" This is a rugged electric laser with power levels , beam quality and runtime suitable for offensive and defensive military utility , " said Northrop beam - cannon chief Dan Wildt .
" Combined with advanced electro optical and / or infrared sensors , the FIRESTRIKE ™ laser can provide self - defense [ or ] precision strike capabilities . "
Northrop has long been working to produce weapons - grade solid state lasers with US military funding .
To date , the only way to make a laser useful as a weapon in its own right - rather than a pointer for other systems , or a dazzler - has been to use chemically fuelled systems .
There are two combat lasers under development right now using chemical fuels .
The biggest is the jumbo - jet mounted Airborne Laser ( ABL ) , intended to blast enemy ICBMs above their launch bases .
Then there 's the Hercules transport - plane Advanced Tactical Laser ( ATL ) gunship model , intended perhaps as a silent , undetectable sky - sniper for the US special - ops community .
But chem lasers need big tanks of dangerous toxic fuel , and produce equally hazardous and corrosive exhaust products .
Their logistics requirements are nightmarish , and realistically they are only for static use or mounting in large aircraft or ships .
Solid state lasers , powered by electricity , are much easier to deal with .
Until now , however , they have had rather low power levels .
As an example , Boeing 's Humvee - mounted " Laser Avenger " has to be shone on an enemy munition for quite some time before it will explode .
Northrop reckon they 've changed all that .
A single FIRESTRIKE ™ module weighs 400 lb and delivers 15 kilowatts .
FIRESTRIKE™s can be linked together to get a more powerful beam , apparently .
It would seem , then , that FIRESTRIKE ™ is simply one of Northrop 's previously - announced solid state laser " chain " units , ready for sale .
The firm has said that at least eight of these can be linked up to get a proper 100 kilowatt beam , generally seen as the threshold for a true battlefield weapon .
Beam quality , for the laser aficionados among those reading , is listed at " nominally 1.5 times the diffraction limit " .
Others may be pleased to note that FIRESTRIKE™s come with Ethernet interface as standard .
Energy efficiency for Northrop 's chains is supposedly in the 20 per cent region .
This suggests that a full - bore 100 kW battle ray will weigh about 1.5 tonnes and require half a megawatt of power .
That 's pretty hefty , but it 's within the ballpark for modern combat vehicles .
Portable blaster rifles or carbines are n't really on the cards yet , then .
But a reasonably useful laser tank could well be a goer if Northrop can do what they say .
There was no word on possible waterproof versions , with handy attachments for mounting on the head of one 's hollowed out volcano lair swimming - pool menagerie . ®

Hasan di Tiro returns to a much - changed Aceh .
Photos : Fauzan Ijazah
It must have been a strange moment for Hasan di Tiro .
Looking down from the steps of the plane at Aceh 's new international airport , what would he have seen ?
Rows of dignitaries and TV cameras , here to mark the return of an exiled rebel ; his family , frail and wilting in the morning heat ; and lined up on the tarmac , waiting to greet him , his former guerrilla fighters , now name - tagged and in suits .
For a man who slipped away in secret 30 years ago , it was a statesman 's return .
Of course , Aceh has changed a lot in that time too .
The fact that Indonesia has allowed him back at all is a sign of how much .
Three years ago , in the aftermath of the devastating Asian tsunami , and under the glare of international attention , his rebel group the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) gave up its bloody fight for Acehnese independence and settled instead for autonomy within Indonesia .
But Hasan di Tiro 's image - part royalty , part rebel leader - has outlasted all those changes .
Almost royalty Truckloads of supporters , most of them too young to remember the last time he was here , began arriving in the Acehnese capital , Banda Aceh , days before he returned .
Young men like Neh who talk about a very personal attachment to this remote , elderly rebel .
" We miss him like a son to a father , " he told me .
Or like Sayeed , just a few months old when Hasan di Tiro slipped out of Aceh .
" I miss him , " he said .
" I want to see his real face , not a picture in the internet or the newspaper .
I 'm happy he 's coming back , because he 's the one person who really cares about Aceh . "
Not bad for a man who has lived in exile for three decades .
But then Hasan di Tiro has two things going for him .
Firstly , he founded GAM back in 1976 and led the 30 - year fight for independence and control of Aceh 's rich natural resources .
Secondly , he really is almost royalty here - he is a descendant of Aceh 's old rulers .
Some people here would like to see him take on a similar role again , to speak up for Acehnese interests under the province 's new autonomy deal .
But of course not everyone would welcome that .
Others resent di Tiro for his absence during the long bloody years of conflict .
Many suffered as a result of it , and not everyone here was in favour of independence anyway .
But his appearance at the main mosque in Banda Aceh can still draw several thousand people , neatly packed into its wide open spaces , all hoping for a glimpse .
Several thousand greeted Hasan di Tiro 's appearance in Aceh
The question is , now that the separatist war has ended , what will Hasan di Tiro do with all his popularity ?
This is being billed as a personal trip , the wish of an old man to revisit his homeland .
But the signs point elsewhere .
It has been a highly organised event .
And one organised by his former guerrilla colleagues - it is they who have largely managed his security , journalist access and crowd control .
Some of these men are now running for parliament under the banner of GAM 's new political party - part of the terms agreed under the peace deal .
Called the Aceh Party , it is expected to do very well indeed in elections due next year .
And its logo was everywhere during this trip ; the hallmark of Hasan di Tiro 's return .
Aceh Party flags peppered the crowds that came to see him - and the trucks that brought them .
Party officials in party T - shirts helped with airport security as he arrived .
There had been some careful preparation of the crowds .
Nobody who arrived in groups from the districts would talk about politics .
But that could n't hide the smell of it .
Powerful figure
For men like Sayeed and Neh - and some of their older neighbours - the independence fight was n't just about splitting from Indonesia , it was fuelled by the desire to get a better deal for Acehnese ; a greater share of the province 's resources , prosperity and control over their own affairs .
Supporter are now looking ahead to elections next spring Much of that was delivered in the peace agreement .
Yet while GAM may have stopped fighting for a separate state , but the struggle to safeguard Aceh 's interests in relations with Jakarta continues .
And it 's likely to be the battleground for next spring 's elections .
In that sense , Hasan di Tiro has it all - nationalist credentials , a blood line to Aceh 's old sultan and 30 years of exile that have kept him apart from the new party politics .
But it 's doubtful how big a role he could actually play , even if he wanted to .
He 's an old man now ; too frail even to deliver his own speech at his welcome rally ; more like an elder statesman than a campaigner .
Yet he 's still a powerful figure , and as a poster boy for his former colleagues - turned - politicians , he 's probably irresistible .

But please know that this blog is about far more than the Saturday cartoons .
They 're merely a diversion and provide a humorous take on what 's really on our minds .
I primarily cover the U.S. Senate but also write about presidential politics and White House activities as well .
So please take a look around beyond the ' toons -- and come back soon .
University of British Columbia researchers have developed a technique that brings scientists a big step closer to unlocking the secrets of the most abundant form of matter in the universe .
A plasma – or ionized gas – can be as commonplace as in fluorescent light bulbs , or exotic in the extreme , as a thermonuclear explosion .
The Earth 's upper atmosphere is a plasma , as are lightning bolts and virtually all stars that light up the night sky .
For nearly a hundred years , physicists have worked to develop intricate mathematical theories for dealing with the plasma state , but detailed knowledge about plasma constituents and their precise interaction dynamics has been hard to come by .
Conventional plasmas are hot , complex and difficult to characterize either in the natural world or in the laboratory .
Recently , a handful of laboratories have begun work on a new class of plasma so simple that it promises to take our understanding to a new level .
Termed ultracold plasmas , these systems start with trapped atoms , cooled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero , to form clouds of ions and electrons that are nearly standing still .
With this control , scientists have found it possible to study the elementary steps by which atomic plasmas are born and grow .
Now , for the first time , UBC researchers have found a way to make ultracold plasmas out of molecules .
Starting with a gaseous sample cooled in a supersonic molecular beam , a team led by Ed Grant , Professor and Head of the Department of Chemistry , has formed a plasma of nitric oxide that has ion and electron temperatures as cold as plasmas made from trapped atoms .
These plasmas last 30 microseconds or more even though , unlike atoms , molecular ions can quickly dissociate by recombining with electrons .
" It 's amazing that our plasmas have sustained life at all , " says Grant .
" We think that the high charged particle density we create interferes with ion-electron recombination . "
Their technique , detailed in the current issue of the journal Physical Review Letters , not only produces plasmas three orders of magnitude denser than those made with trapped atoms , but appears to reach much higher levels of correlation , a factor describing the onset liquid - like collective motion .
" Molecules represent a holy grail of ultracold science , " says Grant .
" The ability to break out of the atom ' trap ' is tremendously liberating and could lead to a whole new field of physics . "
Grant adds that further understanding of ultracold plasma on a molecular level could lead to new knowledge about gas planets ( Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune in our solar system ) , White Dwarf stars , thermonuclear fusion and X - ray lasers .
Link of the day - I will pay you $ 25 , if you come up with a cool domain name for me .
Dallas , who works at Donna ’s Ranch in Wells , Nev. , waits for customers .
Signs of the economic free fall have cropped up in many of Nevada ’s 25 or so legal brothels .
Donna ’s Ranch has seen its business plummet nearly 20 % .
The women at Donna 's Ranch are crowded around the kitchen table on a warm summer night , dining on stir fry , tugging at thigh - high dresses , griping about depleted bank accounts .
At this northeastern Nevada bordello , which marks a gravel road 's end , they woo grizzled truckers and weary travelers for a single reason : money .
Lately , the women do n't go home with much .
Amy , 58 , once bought a $ 32,000 Toyota Tacoma in cash ; now her $ 1,200 mortgage saps her dwindling pay .
Some weeks , she could make more flipping burgers than flirting under a made - up name .
Marisol 's daughters think she works at a resort ; she struggles to keep up the ruse .
It now takes months , not weeks , to bring $ 5,000 back to Southern California .
" Marisol , " one of her regulars tells her , " it costs me in gas what it takes for me to spend a half - hour with you . "
Tonight , she tries lingering at the dimly lighted bar that 's decorated with red Christmas lights and smells of hot dogs and beans .
Wearing a shimmering strapless top , Marisol sips cheap champagne and tries to seduce travelers , some with thick guts and most with thin wallets .
After 20 minutes , she gives up .
Signs of the economic free fall have cropped up in many of Nevada 's 25 or so legal brothels .
The Mustang Ranch , for example , has a steady stream of customers , but the number of women vying for work has soared .
Even a 74 - year - old applied .
This summer , the Shady Lady gave $ 50 gas cards to those who spent $ 300 .
The Moonlite Bunny Ranch offered extras to customers paying with their economic stimulus checks .
Here , 180 miles west of Salt Lake City , near the junction of Interstate 80 and Highway 93 , Donna 's Ranch has seen its business plummet nearly 20 % .
More than three - quarters of its customers are long - haul truckers , and high fuel and food prices have drained them of " play money , " owner Geoff Arnold says .
That cuts into pay for his 10 - member staff and the " working girls . "
Marisol , 49 , retreats to the kitchen , a homey nook with lemon - yellow walls and a plate of scones that another woman whipped up .
Amy is staring at the Lazy Susan , snuffing out a Misty cigarette .
" There are two guys , " Marisol says , her voice thick with frustration .
" They want to relax and drink a beer and think about it . "
She plops into a chair , pushes open blue curtains and scans a parking lot , bathed in yellow and pink by the neon advertising DONNA'S .
Her face puckers .
It 's empty .
The brothel 's woes start with the barflies , who are hoarding what little money they 've saved .
Tonight , two of them slouch in their stools and bemoan the economic slump , their voices rising to near shouts .
" The government 's got to do something , " says Dean Hargis , a tattooed trucker who calls Springfield , Mo. , home .
" Everybody who eats or drinks anything , they 're going to hurt .
It affects what I eat , it affects what motel I stay in , it affects what dog food I buy . "
David Zett , a long - hauler from Loretta , Wis. , gulps a Miller Genuine Draft and bashes oil companies : " They 've got you over a barrel and can do whatever they want to you , and they do n't even kiss you when they 're done . "
" Just like this place , " Hargis says .
" No , " Zett says .
" They kiss you . "
The bartender , Gayle Salinas , shakes her head .
She 's pinching pennies too .
She used to take home $ 50 in tips at the end of most shifts .
Now she might pocket $ 12 .
Her pay is linked to how much the prostitutes make -- and customers are n't choosing their most expensive offerings .
The women negotiate the price of " parties " and their duration , which the bartender tracks using kitchen timers .
Ten to 15 minutes costs at least $ 100 .
Customers once regularly paid thousands of dollars for extras listed on a hot - pink " menu " -- but these days , for example , few men desire the hot tub or mirrored fantasy room .
Earlier that night , Marisol had guided Rob Siddoway , a gangly , pony - tailed trucker from Tooele , Utah , into the fantasy room .
This was his first brothel trip in a year ; he used to stop by every few months .
" See how comfortable you can get ? " Marisol coos .
She points to a red - blanketed , circular bed and a pillow stitched with the word LOVE .
" You can see yourself in the mirror , " she says .
He looks instead at her : olive skin , substantial curves , dark , tired eyes .
He passes on buying an expensive party .
Marisol is n't surprised .
She had played a fortune - telling card game that afternoon ; it showed the future would bring little cash .
About a dozen years ago , Arnold plunked down more than $ 1 million for Donna 's Ranch .
He 's a certified public accountant in Boise , Idaho , and had combed the books of several brothels ; buying one seemed business - savvy .
He owns another in Battle Mountain , Nev .
" They 're easy to run , " says Arnold , president of the state brothel association .
" If you keep the girls happy , you 're done .
If the girls are happy , then the guys are happy .
I can't think of any other business as good as a brothel , except for a doctor 's office -- they 're equally profitable . "
Billed as the West 's oldest continuously operating bordello , Donna 's Ranch greets drivers with a sign that depicts a cowboy - hatted , buxom brunet preening atop a truck bed .
The red-roofed , single - story brothel is plagued with leaks ; a recent earthquake cracked its beige exterior .
The women 's rooms are small .
Most have a double bed , a television and DVD player , and tables with assorted lotions , sex toys and toiletries .
There 's also a handmade sign that reminds customers :
Tips are appreciated .
From 2006 to 2007 , the brothel 's revenue climbed 7.6 % , to about $ 1 million .
This year , Arnold expects to make about $ 200,000 less .
Closing that gap is tricky : Brothel advertising is legal , but billboards and bus ads risk upsetting neighbors .
So the bordello sponsors a soccer team in Boise and a rodeo in Wells .
It also bought lights for the high school football field and gave local motels pens , which boast that Donna 's is " Your Biggest Bang for the Buck . "
Arnold 's staff clips coupons to slash the $ 3,300 monthly grocery bill .
He brainstorms other cost - cutting measures .
He owns 33 acres in Wells -- enough room , by his calculation , for five to 10 cows that could feed his workers .
" That 's what we 've come to , " he says , chuckling at the idea .
" Donna 's Ranch could be a real ranch . "
In the kitchen , Amy alternately smooths her black , rhinestone - trimmed mini-dress and reddened hair that falls to her waist .
She appears about a decade younger than she is , with a trim figure , high cheekbones and a tendency to giggle .
She waits for the CB radio to crackle .
During even - numbered hours , the women take turns sweet - talking truckers .
( They cede the odd - numbered hours to Bella 's , the other brothel in this city of 1,300 people . )
The tactic , which lures more than a third of Donna 's customers , is more vital now that business is slumping .
Amy is perched on a chair , legs crossed , a wedge heel dangling off French - manicured toes .
At last , a trucker grunts through the airwaves : " Where you girls at ? "
Amy leans toward a microphone and urges him to pull off at Exit 352 .
" Are you the Asian girl ? " he asks .
" Bingo ! " she says .
Amy has worked in brothels , on and off , for eight years .
She needed cash to get her own place , but also blames " a broken heart . "
Her grown son is the only person who 's figured out her line of work , something she admits with downcast eyes .
She typically does three - week stints , but starts wanting to go home to Utah after two .
She used to pocket $ 6,000 each time -- even after splitting money with the house and covering room and board , condoms , licenses and legally required medical tests .
But what she wistfully terms the good old days -- when she could see up to 13 men a day and afford to turn down customers -- are gone .
Tonight , the bartender counts four brothel customers .
Maybe , Salinas says , things will pick up .
Some car buffs are in Wells for a show .
" I do n't know , " Amy says .
" They bring their wives . "
The other women -- who likewise use pseudonyms and hide their jobs from their children and friends -- are discouraged too .
Tori , a blond veteran with a no - nonsense manner -- she waves off questions about her age -- commutes from the Reno area with an array of wigs and sequined get - ups .
In the early '90s , she was laid off from a Southern California real estate office ; she eventually turned to the brothel circuit : winters in southern Nevada , summers up north .
She wants to work in auto sales but makes do at Donna's .
" Some other places want you to work 24 hours , " she says .
" They do n't want you to sleep . "
Danielle , younger and more reserved than the other women , is passing time solving word puzzles .
She is milky - skinned with a long brown ponytail .
She ended up here after a divorce .
She periodically flies to South Carolina -- ticket prices have soared -- and tries to return with at least $ 2,000 .
But most customers have been trying to bargain down their prices .
Some are paying with credit cards -- an indication they do n't have as much cash .
( The receipts say Apache Wells Development Co. , not Donna 's Ranch . )
" Whatever they have , " Amy says , " you have to take it . "
Earlier , when she was parrying with the trucker , Amy curled up at a folding table just big enough for a radio and mike , a water bottle , a gray stuffed kitten , an ashtray and a dry erase board listing selling points :
Free beer .
Free chili .
Free shower .
SOUVENIRS .
" I 'm going to bed , " the trucker tells her .
" Maybe come here and have a happy ending ? " she purrs .
" Tell me what a happy ending is . "
" I ca n't talk about it over the radio . "
Silence .
Thanks , the trucker says .
Not tonight .

· Project will provide record of archaelogical sites ·
Two locations mapped so far with plans for a third
Archaeologists are creating a permanent digital record of shipwrecks around European coasts .
By recording the precise 3D arrangement of timbers and cargo from the wrecks the researchers aim to preserve the information they contain about past civilisations even if the wrecks are damaged or destroyed .
Scientists and members of the general public would in future be able to float over the wrecks in a virtual submarine from the comfort of their own desks .
For researchers , this would allow them to explore the wreck and make decisions about future excavations without spending large amounts of money going out to sea .
So far the € 2.2 m Venus ( Virtual Exploration of Underwater Sites ) project , which involves 11 different institutions across Europe , has created a digital representation of two shipwrecks ; one a Roman ship dating from around AD200 off the island of Pianosa near the Tuscan coast and the other , the Barco da Telha , a pre-18th century vessel that sank off the Portuguese coast near Sessimbra .
There are already plans to begin mapping another Roman wreck off Marseilles .
Dr Paul Chapman , a computer scientist at the University of Hull , said that it was aimed at creating a permanent record of the wrecks .
" Because of activities like trawling , these archaeological sites get destroyed , " he said .
" What we have been focusing on with the Venus project is how to generate a permanent database or record of these sites . "
Underwater archaeological sites have also been damaged by divers taking souvenirs .
" Our job has been to develop a virtual reality diving simulator that allows the user to dive down and experience the site first hand , " Chapman added .
One advantage of the simulator is that researchers can add in elements that are no longer there , for example even if the wooden frame of the ship is partially or completely destroyed it can be superimposed on the remains of the cargo that are still there .
" We can also animate the disintegration of the wreck over time , " said Chapman .
The cargo in the 3D simulator – for example , double - handled ceramic vases called amphorae in the case of the Roman wreck – is in precisely the same arrangement as in the real wreck .
To achieve this level of accuracy the researchers conducted sonar surveys from ships on the surface before adding information from a robotic submarine called the Phantom S2 .
This provided more detailed sonar data plus images of the wreck itself .
The Roman site off Pianosa was first discovered by sport divers in 1989 .
The ship itself has rotted away , leaving a mixed cargo of amphorae .
The archaeological puzzle is why there are vases that date from several different periods of Roman history .
Lying at just 36 metres and in excellent visibility , the wreck provided an ideal initial proving ground for developing the 3D mapping techniques .
Next the researchers want to investigate another Roman wreck off the coast of Marseilles .
The simulator is on display at the British Association Festival of Science in Liverpool until Thursday and at the Deep aquarium in Hull .
Within two to three months it will also be available for download from the project 's website and will run on a standard PC .
The two wrecks surveyed so far :
Pianosa
In Roman times , the island off the Tuscan coast was home to the nephew of Augustus Caesar who was exiled there to the Villa di Agrippa where he was later murdered .
Two underwater archaeological sites have been identified around the island .
Pianosa 1 , the site the Venus team has mapped is at 36 metres depth .
The ship 's cargo is a collection of amphorae – double handled ceramic vases – in a variety of different styles .
The site was discovered by sport divers in 1989 and initially surveyed in 2001 .
Sesimbra
The Barco da Telha or Tiles Vessel lies in 55 metres of water in the bay of Sessimbra off the south - west coast of Portugal .
The wreck was initially discovered in 2005 by two sport divers .
They saw the ships cargo of tiles and bricks spread over an area of 20 metres by 8 metres .
Also at the site are several different sized stone bullets indicating that the wreck must date from between the late middle ages and the 18th century .
More accurate dating has been difficult to achieve as no wooden structures of the vessels have survived .

THE snowy night I met Willem at a synagogue in New York City , I knew we would marry , but I did not know that it would last only 10 years .
He was sitting in front of me and I fell in love with the back of his neck .
The floor sloped down to the front , so I did n’t realize that he was 6 - foot - 3 , more than a foot taller than I was .
He was from the Netherlands , the son of a Mennonite minister , and was drawn to Judaism .
I was the child of suburban assimilated Jews .
He was almost 40 and had never wed , and I was 37 and had just about given up on men , Jewish or otherwise .
Soon after , he dragged me to the Lower East Side where we met an old rabbi , who looked at us a bit askance and said wisely , “ You will have a sweet and crazy life together , ” which we did .
A mere five weeks from now , as night sweeps across the continent on Nov. 4 , the 2008 presidential campaign presumably will be decided by the results in a handful of key states .
Iowa does n’t seem likely to be one of those .
So we were left puzzled by a John McCain itinerary that found him spending a good part of Monday and much of Tuesday in that locale .
We can only assume that he and his political advisors know something that the polls of that state ’s voters are n’t detecting .
They ’d better , because with one exception , several recent surveys in Iowa have shown Barack Obama solidly ahead in the fight for its seven electoral votes .
If McCain and his camp do n’t have good reason to dispute these findings , it ’s hard not to view the roughly 24 hours he spent in Des Moines and vicinity last week as a waste of time at this point in the White House race .

Not only does winning Iowa loom as a difficult challenge for the Republican ticket , it ’s hardly key to victory .
Obama began with a big advantage in the state over McCain .
The 2006 midterm election showed a drift toward Democrats there .
And in early 2007 , with an eye on a strong showing in Iowa ’s caucuses , Obama began organizing his support among Iowans .
His victory in the caucuses showed how successful his efforts were -- and ensured that a ground - level operation was in place that could then focus on the general election .
McCain , by contrast , did not invest much time or energy in the state ’s GOP caucuses -- and was rewarded with a fourth - place finish .

His selection of Palin as his running mate helped excite Iowa Republicans about his candidacy , but recent polls have n’t shown a major shift toward McCain .
Here ’s the bottom line : McCain can afford to have the state ’s electoral votes subtracted from the base of 286 that Bush won in 2004 and still win -- as long as he rebuffs Obama ’s aggressive efforts to win Virginia , Florida , Ohio , Colorado and Nevada .
And McCain can deal Obama ’s hopes a virtual death blow by winning Pennsylvania .
So again , we wonder . . . what attracted McCain to Des Moines last week , rather than Wilkes - Barre , Pa . ?

Dueling polls in Virginia
On Wednesday , a Time magazine / CNN poll of 684 voters in Virginia conducted within the last week gave Barack Obama an eye - popping 9 - percentage - point lead over John McCain , 53 % to 44 % .
A new survey of 625 voters in the same state over roughly the same time frame by the Mason - Dixon Polling & Research company showed it McCain 48 % , Obama 45 % .

Whom to believe ?
Perhaps the best posture to take in tracking the fight for the Old Dominion ’s crucial 13 electoral votes is to keep in mind the aggregate for recent polls compiled at Pollster.com .
Those results : Obama , 47.8 % ; McCain 47.5 % .

CHICAGO ( Reuters Life ! ) - U.S. Christians have a reputation for generosity -- but when it comes to supporting their own churches , it turns out most are stingy .

The extent of their penury is outlined in a new book , “ Passing the Plate : Why American Christians Do n’t Give Away More Money ” by Christian Smith and Michael Emerson .
It reveals that 20 percent of U.S. Christians give no money to their church , and that many who do donate fall far short of the 10 percent of income their churches traditionally expect .
Christianity is the dominant U.S. religion , with an estimated 226 million followers in 2005 , and 140 million belonging to churches .
The U.S. population exceeds 305 million .
“ If American Christians could somehow find a way to move to practices of reasonably generous giving , they could generate , over above what they currently give , a total of another $ 133.4 billion a year to devote to whatever purposes and needs they would choose , ” according to the book .
“ What good in the world U.S. Christians could do with an additional $ 133.4 billion , year after year , is almost unimaginable , simply astonishing , nearly beyond comprehension , ” said Smith , of the University of Notre Dame , and Emerson , of Rice University .
A mere $ 500 million , for instance , would close the funding gap needed to eradicate polio globally by 2010 , they estimate , while $ 10 billion would sponsor 20 million needy children worldwide for food , education and healthcare .
The book cites a number of sources for its figures on giving .
One found that 22 percent of all U.S. Christians gave nothing , 71 percent gave less than two percent of their income and nine percent gave 10 percent or more .
Smith said in an interview that there is no simple explanation for the lack of contributions .
Factors range from the pressure on consumers to spend money on themselves to how money is collected and how much information is given to people .
Parental example can also be an influence .
Another factor may be that people ’s formal link with organizations has declined over time along with “ a sort of responsibility to uphold institutions , and also an overall decline in trust of social institutions -- media , banking and so on , ” Smith said .
“ The less people trust the less they will give , ” he added .
Megachurches could be playing a part because they appeal to the unaffiliated offering casual encounters but asking very little up front except attendance and short , entertaining services , he suggested .
But Mormons , who appear to give seven times more as a percentage of their income than Catholics , are the exception .
Smith said the book does not include them in its overall calculations of giving because “ they are so sociologically distinctive in terms of giving ” that they deserve a separate mention .
“ Mormons have a much higher expectation .
They teach tithing much more conscientiously .
Every year you meet with a local bishop who asks you if you tithed , and if you have n’t there are consequences , ” Smith said .
Although the book only examined giving in the United States and did not compare levels of giving elsewhere in the world , it said Americans are more generous with charities than people in other advanced industrialized nations .
American religious believers are more generous than non-believers .
What the impact of the current economic upheaval on giving will be remains to be seen .
“ In general I expect people to give less , ” said Smith , the director of Notre Dame ’s Center for the Study of Religion and Society , adding that giving fell precipitously during the Great Depression of the 1930s .
" I still say I will not be surprised if there is no debate tonight .
Anything can happen .
And do n’t think that they have n’t tried to get out of this .
And do n’t think that they ’re still trying to get out of this .
I do n’t care what anybody says . "
The case against Dr Asha was pure speculation , his barrister said An NHS neurologist accused of masterminding a car bomb campaign is a dedicated pacifist , a court has heard .
Dr Mohammed Asha would not get involved in terrorism " in a million years " , his barrister Stephen Kamlish QC said .
Dr Asha , 28 , from Newcastle - under - Lyme , is accused of providing advice and cash for a plot to detonate car bombs at Glasgow Airport and in London .
Together with Dr Bilal Abdulla , 29 , from Paisley , he denies conspiracies to murder and to cause explosions .
Dr Abdulla was the passenger in a Jeep , driven by engineering student Kafeel Ahmed , 28 , which crashed into a terminal building at the airport in June last year .
The car was laden with petrol and gas canisters and Ahmed later died from burns sustained during the incident .
Opening Dr Asha 's defence , Mr Kamlish said his client was a completely different man to Dr Abdulla , who has admitted trying to scare people through the attempted bombings but denies any attempts to harm .
I love the country here , I love the way people treat each other here , especially medical training
Mohammed Asha Mr Kamlish told Woolwich Crown Court that Dr Asha was a professional , academic and peaceful man who had dedicated his life to medicine .
He said : " This is the man you are trying , he is a pacifist , he is a decent man and he is a man dedicated in an extreme way .
" There is the irony , Bilal Abdulla , an extremist , describes Mohammed Asha 's dedication to medicine as extreme , and that is why he is not guilty . "
Mr Kamlish described the prosecution case against his client as " pure speculation " and said there was no evidence pointing to his guilt .
When speaking in his defence , Dr Asha said nothing would make him " jeopardise my family or my wife for anything in the world " .
Medical career
The court heard that Dr Asha had completed a six - year medical degree at the University of Jordan , before undertaking a placement at Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge , where he met co-defendant Dr Abdulla in January 2005 .
Dr Asha met Dr Abdulla through a friend and the men studied and ate together several times , the court heard .
Dr Abdulla then introduced Dr Asha to Indian engineering student Kafeel Ahmed , who died after ramming a car into Glasgow Airport .
As a junior doctor , Dr Asha went on to work briefly at Llanelli's Prince Philip Hospital before travelling to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital for a two - year placement .
The court was told that , at the time of his arrest last June , Dr Asha was a highly - respected member of staff in the neurology ward at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire .
The doctor added : " I already had the blueprint of my future before I came here but in my experience here I really accepted the greatness of the health system in this country .
Improved English " I know people have complaints about the NHS but , take it from me , it is a great system .
" I love the country here , I love the way people treat each other here , especially medical training . "
Dr Asha also revealed his English has improved while on remand in Belmarsh Prison .
He said : " It is definitely better than when I was arrested ; funnily enough , this traumatic experience has some advantages .
" One of them was being in an English - speaking environment , only English , so I have been able to practise my English in prison . "
The trial continues on Monday .

McCain would likely continue the Bush administration 's quiet war on contraception ; Pro-life pharmacy opens in Virginia , will not dispense birth control ; Catholics group explains why they think Obama is the real " pro-life " candidate ; Outlook bleak for abortion rights in Northern Ireland ;
The myth of non-activist justices .
McCain Is Party to Secret War on Contraception
Abortion is high on the political radar this campaign season .
But less obvious , says Roberta Riley of Women ’s eNews , is the Bush administration ’s secret war on contraception , which a McCain - Palin administration can be counted on to press ahead .
Two recent federal court cases decided by Bush - appointed justices are worrisome :
In March 2007 , the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against
female workers who simply wanted their health plan to cover
contraception on the same terms it covered other preventive care as
well as Viagra and Rogaine for men .
( Note : Viagra and Rogaine are not
preventive care . )
A second ruling , issued in late 2007 by a lower court and now on
appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , allows people who run
pharmacies to refuse to dispense birth control based on their belief it
kills the unborn .
Since then " pro-life pharmacies " have been cropping
up all over the country .
Today , for example , in parts of Montana , women
must drive 80 miles to find a pharmacy willing to sell contraception .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

But combine those anti-contraception decisions with explicit efforts made by the Bush administration and it is clear that the Bush administration has launched a quiet war on contraception :
Before he leaves office , President Bush has signalled he will use
his rule - making power to boost this cause and undo state laws requiring
all hospitals , including Catholic institutions , to offer emergency
contraception to rape survivors .
The process is already underway .
All this comes on top of Bush ’s steady attacks against contraception during the past eight years .
On his first day in office , he stammered his revulsion of abortion ,
as he signed the so - called global gag rule , which forbids U.S .
assistance to foreign groups that use funding from any other source to
perform abortions , discuss abortion with their patients or lobby to
change their nations ’ abortion laws .
In reality , he took contraception
away from the world ’s poorest women .
In his first budget proposal he silently tried to ax contraception
out of health benefits for federal workers .
He relented under pressure
when the Office of Personnel Management reported contraceptive coverage
added no cost to premiums .
In 2002 he appointed Dr. W. David Hager , a staunch opponent of birth
control , to an FDA panel where Hager blocked over - the - counter approval
of emergency contraception despite overwhelming scientific evidence of
its safety and efficacy .
In 2006 he hired Dr. Eric Keroack , who believes contraception
" demeans women , " to run Title X , the program that once made birth
control and cancer screening affordable for millions of uninsured
women .
Those federal dollars now flow to groups that preach " abstinence
only , " which is code for " do n’t tell young people about condoms . "
He appointed over 300 federal judges , including the fellows who
issued the recent rulings that threaten your access to contraception .
So , where was McCain while all this was going on ?
He was voting in lock - step with Bush :
Over his long career , McCain voted against women ’s health 125 times .
At each and every opportunity , he voted against insurance coverage for
contraception , against family planning programs and against medically
accurate sex education .
Not only did he approve all of Bush ’s judicial
picks , he promises to fill future court vacancies with " clones of Alito
and Roberts , " the ultra - conservatives Bush put on the Supreme Court .
Federal judges , whom presidents appoint for life , will play a key role
in the outcome of this war .
As we compare the candidates ’ plans for health care , bear in mind
the Catholic Church owns a substantial portion of hospitals in the
current system and has a long history of lobbying against access to
birth control .
Under McCain ’s plan , churches and insurance companies
will control even more of our health care .
And if that is not enough to convince you that a McCain administration would pursue four , perhaps eight , more years of a war on contraception , the selection of Palin for Vice President makes it clear that McCain is committed to continue degrading women ’s access to birth control :
McCain ’s running mate selection sends the most coded message of all in this war .
Gov. Sarah Palin belongs to Feminists For Life , a group that tries
to deter women from taking Plan B , which is the best type of emergency
contraception now available .
In two easy links from Feminists for
Life ’s home page , one finds volumes of misleading information designed
to scare women and convince them the drug induces abortion .
( It does
not . )
There are two kinds of Feminists for Life members : those who oppose
all contraceptives and those who oppose the methods they consider
" abortifacients , " a scientific - sounding term the group will not define .
It is code for all of the most popular and effective hormonal methods .
Palin is free to believe anything .
But can she separate her personal
views from her public duties ?
As mayor of Wasilla , she cut funds for
rape kits .
The evidence indicates she did it to make sure women did n’t
receive emergency contraception .
She even hedged when Katie Couric asked if she condones or condemns
Plan B. " Personally I would not choose to participate in that form of
contraception , " she said about the drug , which is simply a high dose of
regular birth control pills and the safe , proven treatment for rape
survivors and women who experience birth control failures .
By sheer force of logic , if Palin rejects " that form , " she also
disapproves of the pill , IUD , Depo Provera , Nuva rings and patches that
millions of U.S. women rely on .
Which is precisely why she hedged .
You might remember that earlier this summer McCain was asked directly about that Eighth Circuit court case that ruled against women seeking the same insurance coverage for birth control that is given for Viagra and Rogaine .
But you might remember McCain ’s answer , or lack of one , so here ’s a timely reminder :
Pro-Life Pharmacy Opens in Virginia , Refuses to Dispense Birth Control
Divine Mercy Care Pharmacy opened its doors in a strp mall in Chantilly , Virgina this week .
The drug store is the seventh in the country to be certified as not
prescribing birth control by Pharmacists for Life International .
The
anti-choice group estimates that perhaps hundreds of other pharmacies
have similar policies , though they have not been certified .
Catholics for Obama
A group called Catholic Democrats has launched a new web site , CatholicsForObama.org , that attempts to explain why a " pro-life " Catholic should vote for Obama .
The group ’s president gives the short explanation :
" I feel that every Catholic can vote for Obama in good conscience , "
said Patrick Whelan , president of Catholic Democrats .
" I think Barack Obama is the first Democratic presidential candidate
who has come out and said he plans constructive measures to reduce the
number of abortions in the United States . " …
He believes some will come to see Obama as he does : a person who may
not mesh with the faith in all regards , but whose " life parallels the
central messages of Catholic social teaching . "
" I think that from a Christian standpoint , and Catholics in particular ,
the ethos is about inviting people to the moral life and working on
constructive measures to reduce abortions , " Whelan said .
" And I
honestly believe that Obama has helped this country turn a corner on
this issue . "

Running out the Clock on Abortion Rights in Northern Ireland
British MPs are due to debate an amendment to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill soon which would extend the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland .
But time is running out to make that extension to Northern Ireland ’s women as authority on matters of criminal justice will soon be ‘ devolved ’ to the Northern Ireland assembly and thus will be out of the hands of British MPs in London .
And anti-choice interests are working to make sure time runs out before a vote can be made on the amendment .
All abortion , including in cases of rape and incest , is illegal in Northern Ireland .
The failure of the UK ’s government to pass these laws further protecting a woman ’s right to choose causes some activists to worry that it may trigger a regression for the right to choose across the EU .
On the Supreme Court There are no Originalists only Activists of Different Stripes
A Los Angeles Times editorial highlights recent writings of two prominent conservative judges asserting that Justice Antonin Scalia was guilty of judicial activism in his opinion on the gun control case , District of Columbia vs. Heller .
Scalia is held up by conservatives as an example of a " strict constructionist , " or an " originalist , " a justice who purports to adhere strictly to the original framer ’s intent of the Constitution .
Transcript of Interview with CDR , USN , Phil Butler on the Rob Kall Bottom - up Radio Show ( 1360 AM WNJC )
Transcription by Jay Farrington and Paul Hawley
Kall : Great to have you with us here on the Rob Kall Show at 1360 AM .
Butler :
Thank you .
Kall :
It 's interesting ; I 've had a couple of emails .
Now you wrote this article , " Why I wo n't Vote for John McCain " and you talk about your experience having been a POW for eight years , huh ?
Butler :
Yes , that 's right .
Kall : Oh !
I 'll bet you know exactly how many days after eight years it was , too .
Butler :
Well , two thousand eight hundred and fifty five days and nights — as a POW .
Kall :
Oh my God , it 's hard to imagine ; it 's mind boggling ; thank you for your service !
You know , a couple of people have said , " This guy 's doing to John McCain what John Kerry had done to him by the ' Swiftboaters ' . "
Butler :
No , that 's not true , because I think the swiftboaters got some preconceived lies that they were pushing about John Kerry 's service ; that he was not a bona fide veteran ; his medals were n't real and so forth , and in my article that I 've written here , Why I Wo n't Vote for John McCain , I say clearly that I respect John ( McCain ) and I respect his service as a naval officer and also as a POW .
Kall : Yeah , let me read what you wrote : " Senator John Sidney McCain III is a remarkable man who 's made enormous personal achievement .
He 's a man that I 'm proud to call a POW who returned with honor . "
Butler : Absolutely .
Kall :
So you 're not any way like a Swiftboater ; I just wanted to kind of clear that up right from the beginning .
Butler :
No , I 'm not in any way in concert with the Swiftboat Liars .

In my life , I 've been asked numerous times what it is to be " Black " in
America and over the years the answer has changed considerably .
If
someone asked me today , and a few have in various ways , I 'd say it 's a
ceaseless paradox of heightened expectations .
I can take a plane ride
to any place on the globe and upon arrival see the youth of that
country acting as much like their image of " Blackness " as possible , but
in that same trip I will have to field a barrage of negative
stereotypes and prejudices .
Other people may experience this in their
own way but none experience it to such an extreme degree as We .

I picked up the LA Times today and read an article written from two separate perceptions .
One was a reporter who'd followed Barack Obama's
campaign and the other a reporter covering McCain's .
What struck me was
the focus of both on the personality , or I should say the
personableness , of the two .
McCain was reported as being personable and
approachable but prone to stumbles and misstatements , while Barack was
seen as restrained and always on his game .
The reporter for Obama was
impressed by his extreme sense of self - restraint in the most
frustrating of situations but was disheartened that after months of
being near him he did n't know the man ; this made me laugh slightly .
My
first thought being , " Were this reporter Black , this would n't seem at
all strange to him . "
In fact , he might not have thought to even report
on it ; and the overtone would have been drastically different had he .
He was witnessing the Black professional reality in it 's most extreme
expression .
Then I thought of Paul Dunbar when he wrote " We wear the
mask that grins and lies . "
When I first heard then later read those
words in my youth they struck me deeply .
By that time I 'd already moved
from Oakland to
Sacramento with my family and we all of us were faced with towering
uncertainty ; and the reception by this all white neighborhood was far
from welcoming .
In my first few years my brother and I were gripped by
loneliness and despaired at the thought of the battles each new school
day would bring .
Spurned on by students and faculty , we began to
believe that we were somehow victims of some insurmountable conspiracy
to destroy or at least break our spirits .
Fortunately we had each
other , and my family pulled together and our home became our sanctuary .
No friends , no neighbors from whom to borrow sugar , no family within 10
miles in any direction as it had been in Oakland ; just our own little
island where we laughed , cried , argued , embraced , plotted and schemed .

Like so many before us we 'd resolved ourselves to enduring the
American nightmare in order to capture the American dream .
Our parents
taught us how to play " this here game " and make the most of a reality
that had always been grim and from which our ancestors had always found
the means to garner some light .
Even now the lessons are in my ears
ringing as soundly as when they were uttered , " Always look a white man
in his eyes . " , " Never tell your business but listen when they tell
theirs , because they love to tell it . " , " Never get comfortable with
your situation . " , " Once you learn how to play the game they change the
rules . " , and my personal favorite " You must be twice as good to gain
half as much . "
Home was where the heart lived , where you were never anything other
than yourself , but once you opened that front door you were on ; walking
the pavement to school then work fully aware of the war that raged long
before you and your part to play in its drama .
Then came the day when while in a professional setting I was asked
by a supervisor my honest opinion on affirmative action , which was in
the news at the time .
I gave the calculated response , " I do n't think
about it much because it 's never helped or hurt me . "
Which was true .
But so persistent was the inquiry that I finally and fully spoke my
mind .
I pointed out that in all the departments of that division there
were five Black people working there ; one per department and never more
than one .
Then we went through the list of what each of us was capable
of doing .
I was apart of the online education department at the time so
I was surrounded by writers .
Each of them had degrees in English or
related disciplines , the typical hyper - specialized model that America
had been pushing through education since the engineering mentality took
hold in the Industrial Revolution .
But I was the only person with a number of disciplines and skills in
his repertoire , what 's more this was true only of the African - American
workers , even the Indian programmers lived and died by one skill alone .
I explained to them that for We , that reality is disastrous , never
could we afford to rely on a single skill or resource , and those of us
who have , met with calamity .
Furthermore , we seldom " do as we do " when
amongst others ; our face before them was not the face of our reality .
In fact each of them knew little to nothing about other people and
cultures , especially ours , even those of them married to people from
other cultures ; like the man who was married to a Chinese American ,
had Chinese children , and knew nothing of Chinese culture or history .
" Because " , as I told them , " you do n't have to know .
You can afford to
be ignorant and mediocre if you wish to be .
So the problem is n't that
certain people want affirmative action or social welfare programs , it's
that you fail to recognize your own unwritten social welfare that is
support by all those ' others ' of whom you remain ignorant .
We , on the
other hand , are not afforded the luxury and my abilities , celebrate
though they may be , are necessary , expected . "
Needless to say I did n't
work there much longer , but neither did they it seems .
Because at the
time Corporate America was just beginning to teach White America that ignorance was no longer bliss ( the Indian programmers should 've been their first clue ) .
Which brings me back to Barack , who like so many others before him
learned the game which has evolved over four generations from keeping
yourself from hanging from the poplar tree , to climbing the popular
tree to see the glass ceiling for yourself .
I may not agree with his
politics or what he states as a solution to the problems that we face .
But I can not deny that he is among the most striking examples I've
seen of a Black Professional navigating these turbulent waters .
His
impersonal approach to media and constituents , his carefully worded
answers that reveal enough to say he's not like the establishment but
not enough for you to paint him in any particular camp , and his
determined focus on an objective that is n't fully revealed in anything
that he says outright but is always presented in a way that will not
offend .
If any of these things faltered , America would see him as
human , flawed , and most of all Black .
We avail ourselves of this dark
reality through our ability to seem to float above it all as if
superhuman , thus transcending our human form and with it our multi-hued
skin and all that comes with it .
Were we to lose that transcendence ,
would we lose our battles .
So I remind myself , He wears the mask , I
wear the mask ,
We wear the mask , and he wears it well .
The Treasury is considering more changes to the Trash Asset Removal Plan :
It will no longer will buy Trash Assets ( and it never has )
It will continue to inject capital directly into companies but only alongside other private - market investors
These potential changes are actually positive , but they still do n't address the elephant in the room : writedowns .
Historically , the most successful financial system bailouts have done two things :
Recapitalized banks ( by injecting capital )
Forced banks to write down asset values to nuclear winter levels , thus staving off the need for future writedowns ( and , in so doing , encourage private investment ) .
It is hard to believe that , say , Citigroup has written down its $ 546 billion of on - balance sheet consumer assets to nuclear - winter levels , let alone the off - balance sheet ones .
Thus , any new investor will likely get its equity wiped out by future writedowns and additional capital .
This is a major deterrent to investing in Citigroup .
The new TARP modifications will deal with this to some extent by forcing financial institutions to raise private capital alongside the government money .
Private investors , presumably , will be more concerned about preserving their capital than the government will be and therefore wo n't invest unless the banks have written their assets down appropriately .
Forcing banks to raise private capital will also get the government out of the business of picking winners , which has created the potential for unfairness , corruption , and a whole host of perceived improprieties , as well stoked the fires of senators like Chuck Schumer who complain that the taxpayer money is only going to healthy companies , not the ones who need it most .
Bottom line :
These changes would be improvements to TARP , but the government should still force participating banks to write down their assets to nuclear winter levels -- at which point there wo n't be anything else to do with the money other than buy other banks and lend .
( And give executives bonuses , of course ) .

Moderate Dems worry of liberal ascendancy RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Waxman bid to oust Dingell worries centrists Henry Waxman , a long - serving , outspoken , progressive California Democrat , has launched a bid to take control of perhaps the most powerful committee in the House of Representatives .
The move has many moderate Democrats worried about what they see as a takeover from the party 's left flank .
Waxman currently chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , but last week he announced an attempt to take over the Energy and Commerce Committee , chaired by Rep. John Dingell ( D - MI ) .
The powerful committee has jurisdiction over an array of important areas , including environmental policy and healthcare .
While there had been some expectation in Washington over the last several months that Waxman might seek the new post , his formal announcement last week caught Dingell off guard .
Roll Call reports that Dingell is mobilizing allies in the Blue Dog and New Democrats coalitions to stave off Waxman 's rise .
The coordination marks a departure for the groups , which have not traditionally worked together , and a shared fear that with Democrats preparing to take control of all levers of political power , moderates could get steamrolled by emboldened liberals .
 We re very concerned about the direction that some are trying to move our majority ,  said Rep. Mike Ross ( D - Ark. ) , Blue Dog co-chairman for communications .
Leaders of both groups were working the phones last week to round up support for Dingell , the 27 - term dean of the House , in his counteroffensive against Waxmans surprise challenge .
Ross and Reps. Allen Boyd ( D - Fla . ) and John Tanner ( D - Tenn . ) , both senior Blue Dogs , joined Rep. Ellen Tauscher ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of the New Democrats , on Dingells 26 - member team .
Dingell 's sympathy for the auto industry has contributed to a lack of action on climate change legislation , frustrating environmentalists .
President - elect Barack Obama said during the campaign that he wanted quick action on legislation to cap carbon emissions and require polluters to purchase emission credits on an open market .
The Senate failed to pass a cap and trade bill over the summer , and Dingell belatedly introduced his own cap and trade proposal last month .
Environmentalists believe Waxman would be more aggressive in pursuing such legislation .
" We have lost a tremendous amount of time .
Rep.
Dingell has always opposed bringing the energy and transportation sectors into a more efficient and modern era , " a senior Democratic aide for a member who supports Waxman 's bid told the Associated Press .
MUMBAI–A Toronto man caught in the middle of terrorist attacks here fled for his life as people were falling around him shot dead or wounded by terrorists in the lobby of the Taj hotel Wednesday .
Raynor Burke , 38 , ran toward the pool area , but the gunmen were already there .
In a telephone interview with the Star , Burke said he saw a husband and wife get shot .
It took him nearly two hours to escape through a broken window , cut and bruised but otherwise unharmed .
Burke was in the lobby when " a bunch of kids with duffel bags " opened fire on the crowd .
" There were body parts everywhere , " Burke said .
" It 's bedlam , " he said by phone around 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday .
Burke , who had just arrived in Mumbai after a round of charity work in southern Indian , said he knew of at least two more Canadians , one woman and one man , caught in the attacks , but did n't know how they fared .
At least 104 people were killed and over 300 injured in targetted attacks on 10 locations in Mumbai .
There have been reports from Indian officials that Canadians were believed to be among the hostages and injured .
Cannon did not take any questions from reporters .
" Consular staff have been accounted for and are actively seeking to locate and assist Canadians in Mumbai , " he said .
" This morning I spoke to the Indian foreign affairs minister and relayed to him on behalf of the people of Canada my sincere condolences for those injured and killed in the barbaric Mumbai terror attacks , " he said .
" Canada stands united with Indian to combat all forms of terrorism .
These attacks have strengthened our resolve to work together for the mutual security and prosperity of our people , " he added .
Canadians in need of consular assistance are asked to call Foreign Affairs at 613-996-8885 .
Collect calls are accepted .
The highly co-ordinated attacks Wednesday night by bands of gunmen were aimed at two five star hotels , a popular restaurant , a crowded train station , a Jewish centre and at least five other sites .
The militants were armed with assault rifles , hand grenades and explosives .
Indian officials confirmed that Canadians were among the hostages held by suspected Muslim militants .
State 's Deputy Home Secretary Bitin Srimali said foreigners being held captive include Canadians , Americans , British , Italians , Swedes , Yemenis , New Zealanders , Spaniards , Turks , a Singaporean and Israelis .
There were no reports of Canadians killed in the attacks .
Among the dead were at least one Australian , a Japanese and a British national , said Pradeep Indulkar , a senior government official of Maharashtra state , whose capital is Mumbai .
A German and an Italian were also killed , according to the foreign ministries in the two countries .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed " external forces . "
" The well - planned and well - orchestrated attacks , probably with external linkages , were intended to create a sense of panic , by choosing high profile targets and indiscriminately killing foreigners , " he said in address to the nation .
A previously unknown Islamic militant group claimed responsibility for the carnage , the latest in a series of nationwide terror attacks over the past three years that have dented India 's image as an industrious nation galloping toward prosperity .
The most high - profile target was the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel , a landmark in Mumbai since 1903 , and a favourite watering hole of the city 's elite .
The attackers , dressed in black shirts and jeans , stormed into the hotel at about 9:45 p.m. and opened fire indiscriminately .
" I was in the main lobby and there was all of a sudden a lot of firing outside , " said Sajjad Karim , part of a delegation of European lawmakers visiting Mumbai before a European Union - India summit .
Suddenly " another gunmen appeared in front of us , carrying machine gun -type weapons .
And he just started firing at us ... I just turned and ran in the opposite direction , " he told The Associated Press over his mobile phone .
The shooting was followed by a series of explosions that set fire to parts of the century - old edifice on Mumbai 's waterfront .
Screams were heard and black smoke and flames billowed , continuing to burn until dawn .
The gunmen also seized the Mumbai headquarters of the ultra- orthodox Jewish outreach group Chabad Lubavitch and attacked the Oberoi Hotel , another five - star landmark .
" It seems that the terrorists commandeered a police vehicle which allowed them easy access to the area of the Chabad house , " said a spokesman for the Lubavitch movement in New York , Rabbi Zalman Shmotkin .
Around 10:30 a.m. , a woman , a child and an Indian cook were seen being led out of the building by police , said one witness .
The child was identified as Moshe Holtzberg , 2 , the son of Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg , the main representative at Chabad house .
The child was unharmed , but his clothes were soaked in blood .
Sandra Samuel , 44 , the cook who pulled the boy out the building , said she saw Rabbi Holzberg , his wife Rivka and two other unidentified guests lying on the floor , apparently " unconscious .
The gunmen appeared to be holed up inside all three buildings on Thursday , nearly 18 hours later , holding foreign and local hostages , as Indian commandos surrounded the buildings .
" We 're going to catch them dead or alive , " Maharashtra Home Minister R. R. Patil told reporters .
" An attack on Mumbai is an attack on the rest of the country . "
Gunfire and explosions were heard from the Taj Mahal , the Oberoi and the Chabad facility .
In the afternoon , bodies and hostages slowly emerged from the building .
At least three bodies , covered in white cloth , were wheeled out .

About a dozen hostages including foreigners were also evacuated from the hotel and whisked into a waiting ambulance .
Several of them carried small pieces of luggage .
One older man was carried into the ambulance by police .
The attackers appeared to have been targeting Britons and Americans .
Alex Chamberlain , a British citizen who was dining at the Oberoi , told Sky News television that a gunman ushered 30 to 40 people from the restaurant into a stairway and , speaking in Hindi or Urdu , ordered everyone to put up their hands .
" They were talking about British and Americans specifically .
There was an Italian guy , who , you know , they said : ' Where are you from ? " and he said he 's from Italy and they said ' fine ' and they left him alone .
And I thought : ' Fine , they 're going to shoot me if they ask me anything – and thank God they did n't , " he said .
Chamberlain said he managed to slip away as the patrons were forced to walk up stairs , but he thought much of the group was being held hostage .
The United States and Canada were among the countries that condemned the attacks .
In Washington , White House press secretary Dana Perino said the U.S. " condemns this terrorist attack and we will continue to stand with the people of India in this time of tragedy . "
In Ottawa , Prime Minister Stephen Harper condemned the attacks calling them " despicable and cowardly . "
" These attacks targeted people from India and around the world .
They were attacks on values we hold dear , and we share your loss , " Harper said in a statement Thursday .
Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon called the attacks ``savage . "
" Canada strongly condemns the savage terrorist attacks in Mumbai , which have left hundreds of innocent civilians injured or killed , " Cannon said in a release late Wednesday .
" These cowardly attacks are truly appalling . "
Ottawa also issued a travel warning Thursday advising travellers to avoid non-essential travel to Mumbai until the situation stabilizes .
" Visitors in the city should monitor local news reports , immediately return to their accommodation and remain indoors , " the advisory said .
Meanwhile , Sweden was preparing to send a special ambulance plane to India to evacuate European Union citizens injured in the terror attacks .
The country 's Foreign Ministry said a Boeing 737-800 has been prepared following a request from the European Union .
Ministry spokesman Anders Jorle says the plane is ready to take off once the EU gives the green light .
Jorle said Thursday the plane is equipped with six intensive care units for severely injured patients .
It also has space for 23 people with serious but not life - threatening injuries .
The motive for the onslaught was not immediately clear , but Mumbai has frequently been targeted in terrorist attacks blamed on Islamic extremists , including a series of bombings in July 2006 that killed 187 people .
Later Thursday the Indian navy said its forces were boarding a cargo vessel suspected of ties to the attacks .
Later Thursday the Indian navy said its forces were boarding a cargo vessel suspected of ties to the attacks .
Navy spokesman Capt .
Manohar Nambiar said Thursday that the ship , the MV Alpha , had recently come to Mumbai from Karachi , Pakistan .
The navy has " located the ship and now we are in the process of boarding it and searching it , " he said .
Earlier , Indian media showed pictures of black and yellow rubber dinghies found by the shore , apparently used by the gunmen to reach the area .
India has been wracked by bomb attacks the past three years , which police blame on Muslim militants intent on destabilizing this largely Hindu country .
Nearly 700 people have died .
Since May a militant group calling itself the Indian Mujahideen has taken credit for a string of blasts that killed more than 130 people .
The most recent was in September , when explosions struck a park and crowded shopping areas in the capital , New Delhi , killing 21 people and wounding about 100 .

CNN 's Rick Sanchez has the story .
From AP :
Baylor University officials said they are investigating an apparent noose hanging from a tree the day Barack Obama was elected the nation 's first black president .
Campus authorities also responded to a barbecue pit fire where several Obama campaign signs were believed to have been burned , interim president David E. Garland said .
" These events are deeply disturbing to us and are antithetical to the mission of Baylor University , " Garland said in a statement Wednesday .
" We categorically denounce and will not tolerate racist acts of any kind on our campus . "
On Tuesday afternoon at the world 's largest Baptist university , some students notified officials that a rope resembling a noose was in a campus tree , Garland said .
Campus police took the rope and are investigating .
The student paper at Baylor , The Lariat , has more :
Devin Culberson , Spring freshman , found a thin , white rope tied to a loop at the end , hanging from a tree .
Culberson borrowed a knife from a janitor and cut it down , he said .
The rope evokes historical images of when black people were hanged from trees in the American South in the early 1900s .
The rope is now in possession of the Baylor Police .
Dub Oliver , Vice President of Student Life , says that he believes it was intended to look like a noose and send a hateful message .
He hopes students will continue to come forward and help with the investigation .
Culberson believes the rope was put in a tree to intimidate black supporters of president - elect Barack Obama .
" I had to cut it down to show respect for myself and other black people , " he said .
That was n't all .
As the AP mentions , there was a bonfire made of Obama signs .
And outside one of the residence halls , there was nearly a riot :
Later , verbal altercations occurred outside of Penland Residence Hall .
A group of Obama supporters were walking around shouting " Obama " and then passed a group of white men outside who made threatening and racist remarks , said Emmanuel Orupabo , Arlington senior .
According to Orupabo , one the men told the group , " Any ( expletive ) who walks by Penland , we 're going to kick their ( expletive ) , we 're going to jump him . "
Orupabu and the people with him stopped and responded , " Excuse me ? "
The groups shouted at each other until police showed up .
Doak said the police did n't witness any racist remarks , but they were told of them .
There were only about 10 to 15 people involved , he said , but there appeared to be more because so many stopped to watch .
Looks like the fuse lit by McCain and Palin is n't going out so readily .
( This has been updated slightly as of May 2012 and January 2013 . )
It ’s pretty much an indisputable fact that , in the world of open source operating systems , Linux is the most generally popular .
This applies to estimable widespread use , press , advocacy , and corporate support .
Even though many other open source projects ( that are n’t operating systems ) are more widely used than the Linux kernel ( OpenSSH and SQLite come to mind ) because almost everybody using a Linux distribution has them — and others , using other OSes , have them as well — very few if any are more popular .
Firefox and GCC may give it a run for its money , but they have lost market share to Chrome and Clang / LLVM , respectively , as well .
Among open source licenses , the GPL ( including all its versions ) is easily the most popular , though waning in popularity .
Some open source software advocates tend to refer to the GPL first and foremost , or even only , especially those who call themselves “ Free Software ” advocates .
Open source opponents refer to the GPL as well , in negative terms , even if they do not mention it by name .
While Firefox has its own license ( the MPL ) , it ’s also available under the terms of the GPL .
The Linux kernel is GPLed .
Many of the strongest open source advocacy groups , notably including the FSF , the Linux Foundation , the Software Freedom Law Center , and Open Source Development Labs , have focused primarily on the GPL .
Copyfree - licensed systems like the major BSD Unix OSes , and copyfree licenses themselves such as the various BSD licenses , are ( comparatively ) getting ignored in the wider world of open source advocacy .
Few are really against copyfree licensing , except insofar as their favorite licenses may not be copyfree licenses ; their counter - advocacy efforts are generally focused on either the GPL or proprietary licensing , depending on where they stand with regard to the divide between open and closed source software development .
Only the most rabid fans of copyleft licenses such as the GPL tend to be specifically anti-copyfree licensing , and even then only because they believe copyfree licenses encourage proprietary software vendors to restrict people ’s freedom — which brings their true ire back to proprietary licensing rather than copyfree licensing per se .
Even if I have personally received death threats and been called a number of unsavory , morally condemnatory things in online discussion because of my preference for copyfree licensing , the ultimate problem these people seemed to have with me was their belief I was somehow shilling for proprietary software vendors .
Ironically , proprietary closed source software and GPLed software are not nearly as opposed to each other in practice as many seem to believe :
On one hand , we have people like Microsoft ’s Craig Mundie who have expressed the opinion that the GPL is a threat to software industry success and to copyright law .
On the other hand , we have people like Richard Stallman who set out to monkeywrench closed source software vendors by making it as difficult as possible for them to make effective use of GPLed code , and claim the GPL is the shield of software freedom .
On the gripping hand , organizations like IBM , MySQL AB , and MySQL’s “ new ” owner Sun Microsystems ( subsequently purchased by Oracle ) have proven that copyleft licenses like the GPL and closed source licenses are natural complements .
It seems like any time someone in an online debate claims the GPL is just an anti-property , leftist attack on copyright , some GPL advocate ( who typically identifies himself as a Free Software advocate ) points out that the GPL could n’t exist without copyright law .
This is , on some level , generally meant as a diversion from the fact that GPL advocates are often bent on the destruction of any actual business model based around the sale of software .
Ironically , however , that ’s an important point : the GPL is a natural ally of software industry players whose business models are built on “ ownership ” of software copyrights .
Before we get into that , however , let us examine the poster child for GPL opposition , the corporate behemoth known best for its attacks on the GPL in principle , and open source software in name .
Microsoft policies seem to indicate utter cluelessness on the subject of what makes the benefits of open source software work .
The Shared Source initiative Mundie discussed in his 03 May 2001 speech on the subject of future commercial software development is clearly a naive attempt to gain the benefits of open source development without having to actually do any open source development .
He identified five benefits supposedly derived from the Shared Source approach :
a strong support community of developers promote collaboration and interoperability while supporting innovation and healthy competition promotes the growth of a profitable business level of research and development investment drives resources for future innovation provides product and source access without jeopardizing the intellectual property rights of those who create or use the software
The truth of the matter :
Of course , Microsoft has always benefited from something like “ a strong support community of developers ” , but his meaning in this case seems to target the kind of developer community support one gets from an open source development model — which is not even slightly the same thing .
In a Microsoft software project , something is produced behind closed doors and presented to the world ( for a price ) .
Others then develop additional tools that fit on or around that piece of software that came out of Microsoft ’s development shop .
There is no really direct developer support from the community for the software itself .
In an open source software project , a strong developer community contributes to the source for the project , drawing on the abilities , free time , and dedication of a lot of people who like your project .
This happens because people feel invested in the project , and feel a sense of “ ownership ” in a broader sense in the project as a whole .
That ’s not really something that ’s easily achieved when you do n’t let people directly modify the software , acquire it for free if need be , and so on .
This Shared Source initiative eliminates the single most important factor in fostering direct developer support within a community of users : that sense of shared ownership .
Promoting collaboration and interoperability while supporting innovation and healthy competition is just code for for “ getting direct developer support and helping third - party developers work together , but without giving up proprietary control of our source code so nobody else can use it in ways we do n’t approve ” .
In Microsoft ’s version of the English language , “ innovation ” means bureaucratic , commercial software development , and “ healthy competition ” means “ people can compete with each other all they like but , dammit , we wo n’t let them compete with us ” .
Promoting the growth of a profitable business is just repetition of the intent behind the second half of the previous statement .
Microsoft ’s notion of innovation is that it comes at great expense , under carefully controlled , bureaucratically managed corporate conditions , and can only happen when people are motivated ( almost solely ) by filthy lucre and organized by middle management .
Oh , sure , one might quibble over the absolute truth of that translation of Mundie ’s meaning , but in spirit there ’s no real grounds for disagreement .
I think the last point speaks for itself .
The only real reason Microsoft cares about providing “ product and source access ” is , of course , to try to rub off some of the open source mojo to make itself more popular and successful — and when Mundie refers to “ those who create or use the software ” , he means the software that Microsoft produces , which in turn means Microsoft as the corporate “ creator ” of the software .
Users ’ rights , of course , amount to the “ right ” to get software from Microsoft through channels of Microsoft ’s choosing , at Microsoft ’s price .
Nowhere in there do I see anything that suggests there ’s anything going on but a scam — and an ideological attack on the Free Software faithful .
The speech as a whole is ostensibly about commercial software benefits in harmony with some corporate conception of what constitutes positive open source development , and in opposition to this dangerous and undisciplined notion of “ open source ” software that currently dominates the use of the term .
In reality , however , it ’s just a combination of an advertisement for Microsoft with an attack on the GPL in particular and copyleft licensing in general .
He spends paragraph after paragraph attacking the GPL by name , on the basis that it represents a faulty business model and acts like a communicative disease that “ poses a threat to the intellectual property rights of any organization that makes use of it . ”
Clearly , Mundie is an anti-GPL zealot who has utterly lost the plot , and Steve Ballmer obviously never knew the plot in the first place .
It seems likely that this state of affairs is tied directly to the fear of MS Windows market share being undermined by Linux - based OSes , and using the GPL as a convenient “ fatal flaw ” against which the corporation can direct its negative marketing efforts .
The extremes are pretty well covered .
The truth lies somewhere in the middle .
The truth is that it is extremely difficult to build a conventional , copyright dependent business model solely around software licensed under the terms of the GPL .
The truth is also that the purely closed source model of commercial software development — or even a shared source model , where the benefits of truly open source licensing models are lacking for both the vendor and the user — limits the possible success of the software in the market , endows it with an aura of uncertainty about its future , restricts third - party support , and provides none of the assurances of peer review .
Both approaches to a widget - sales copyright dependent business model , taken alone , are damaging to both the business and the customer .
Put them together , however , and you have a winning combination for the business : core functionality that cannot ( easily ) be had from anyone else , because the secrets of their construction are jealously guarded , plus goodwill and community development support on components whose operation are n’t worthy of secrecy without allowing competing businesses to improve upon them , unless those competitors are willing to benefit your business as much as theirs in the process .
If those copyleft components were developed entirely in - house , in fact , they can be used with closed source code and sold as part of a proprietary package , with additional improvements also developed in - house that are not available as part of the open source package — because the business owns the copyright , and makes the decision about how , when , and to whom to license the code .
In fact , for software developed in - house by a market dominance oriented corporation seeking anticompetitive advantages over other software providers , the smart play is to use an entirely new , in - house copyleft license .
License compatibility with another copyleft license is a bad idea all around , because that compatibility allows too much opportunity for competition from the open source community itself , and ( luckily for corporate users of custom copyleft licenses ) any two copyleft licenses are , by default , naturally incompatible .
Sun ’s ZFS is a prime example ; it uses a copyleft license , incompatible with the GPL , which means it is difficult to incorporate as fully into a Linux distribution as some would like because ZFS support cannot be incorporated into the GPLed kernel and distributed to others .
If others make improvements to ZFS , however , Oracle — the company that bought Sun — gets to reap the rewards of an open source development model , as Sun did before Oracle acquired its assets .
Ultimately , it is corporations that have realized the benefits of this kind of business model that gain the most measurable benefit from copyleft software licensing .
It is also in the best interests of such organizations — corporations that prefer GPLed software when using code written by someone else , custom copyleft licensed code when releasing code for open source development , and strong copyright enforcement for “ competitive advantage ” — for organizations like the FSF and Microsoft to very publicly go at each others ’ throats .
This makes the GPL and Free Software crowd look like crazies to people who like their business models traditional and restrictive , makes Microsoft look like an evil empire to people who like open source software development , and makes the corporations who straddle the line look good by comparison to them both : “ open source friendly ” and “ enterprise worthy ” at the same time .
It appears to be in the best interests of all three groups , considering their current goals , to ignore and marginalize copyfree licensing and the software distributed under copyfree terms ( such as the BSD Unix systems ) as much as possible , in each case almost entirely for marketing purposes .
This leads to all kinds of shenanigans , some more obvious than others .
The most common that I ’ve noticed include Microsoft ’s incessant targeting of the GPL as “ evil ” and the tendency of GNU / Linux and Free Software advocates to wear ideological blinders .
Only three groups would actually benefit from stronger , more visible copyfree advocacy ( and counter - advocacy for copyleft and copyright policies ) :
Users
Independent Developers and Teams
Relatively Honest Businesses
Maybe I ’ll talk about that later .
A Los Angeles real estate developer is suing Apple for patent infringement over the way the iPhone navigates Web sites .
The suit , which was filed on behalf of EMG Technology , seeks unspecified damages .
EMG
Technology is a company that holds the patents of Elliot Gottfurcht , the real estate developer , as well as Marlo Longstreet and Grant Gottfurcht .
The company claims that the iPhone infringes on patent 7 , 441 , 196 - a patent that was approved only last month , after a filing process that began on March 13 , 2006 .
That patent is for an invention that displays " on-line content reformatted from a webpage in a hypertext markup language ( HTML ) format into an extensible markup language ( XML ) format to generate a sister site . "
This sister site is a simplified version of the original site that is then displayed on any number of devices -- including cell phones , EMG says .
Now , it seems to me that this is a description of what every single mobile phone on the market does .
Every mobile phone EXCEPT the iPhone , that is .
Remember all those commercials touting how the iPhone does n't display a simplified Web site , but the full Web page ?
The press release issued by EMG claims that the iPhone uses the same method as their invention .
So , does n't every other mobile phone do this as well ?
Should a patent granted last month hand over intellectual property rights for every single handheld device that accesses the Web ?
This is just the latest of several lawsuits against Apple for the iPhone including an allegation in January by Minerva Industries that the iPhone was similar in concept to their own idea for a " Mobile Entertainment and Communication device , " and then a suit in March over visual voicemail .
EMG is represented by Stanley Gibson of Jeffer , Mangels , Butler & Marmaro ( JMBM ) .
In 2005 , Gibson won a patent infringement lawsuit for Gary Michelson M.D. against Medtronic , which resulted in one of the largest payments ever for an intellectual property dispute .
For all the magnificent diversity of life on this planet , ranging from tiny bacteria to majestic blue whales , from sunshine - harv­­est­­ing plants to mineral - digesting endoliths miles underground , only one kind of “ life as we know it ” exists .
All these organisms are based on nucleic acids — DNA and RNA — and proteins , working together more or less as described by the so - called central dogma of molecular biology : DNA stores information that is transcribed into RNA , which then serves as a template for producing a protein .
The proteins , in turn , serve as important structural elements in tissues and , as enzymes , are the cell ’s workhorses .
It may not straddle the port as its predecessor once did , but in terms of sheer luminosity and eye - catching height the new Colossus of Rhodes will not disappoint .
Nor will it fall short of the symbolism that once imbued the ancient monument .
Twenty - three centuries after craftsmen carved the legendary statue that has inspired legions of painters , poets , playwrights and politicians , a new world wonder , built in the spirit of the original Colossus , is about to be born on the Aegean island .
After decades of dashed hopes , the people of Rhodes will fulfil a long - held dream to revive one of the world 's seven ancient wonders - thanks to the promise of international funding and the East German artist Gert Hof .
" It will be a unique architectural creation , " said the island 's mayor , Hatzis Hatziefthimiou , presenting what is likely to become one of the 21st century 's largest artistic projects in Dubai last week .
" We want to make it a work of global appeal and significance . "
Like the original , erected in homage to the sun god Helios by the master sculptor Chares of Lindos , the new Colossus will adorn an outer pier in the harbour area of Rhodes , and be visible to passing ships .
And like its ancient namesake , the modern - day wonder will be dedicated to celebrating peace and built , at least in part , out of melted - down weapons from around the world .
But unlike the ancient Colossus , which stood 34 metres high before an earthquake toppled it in 226BC , the groundbreaking work of art is slated to be much taller and bigger .
And unlike previous reconstruction efforts , officials say the Cologne - based design team is determined to avoid recreating a replica .
In the past , new Colossus aficionados have persistently run up against the objections of Greece 's powerful lobby of archaeologists .
A proposal to recreate the legendary statue in the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics whipped up such controversy that opponents claimed its glitzy , we 're - bigger - than - you overtones were not only offensive but defiled rather than boosted the country 's cultural heritage .
" Monumental works can't be copied for the simple reason that they risk becoming caricatures , " insisted Hatziefthimiou .
Instead , in the spirit of the 21st century the new Colossus has been conceived as a highly innovative light sculpture , a work of art that will allow visitors to physically inspect it by day as well as enjoy - through light shows - a variety of stories it will " tell " by night .
" We are talking about a highly , highly innovative light sculpture , one that will stand between 60 and 100 metres tall so that people can physically enter it , " said Dr Dimitris Koutoulas , who is heading the project in Greece .
" Although we are still at the drawing board stage , Gert Hof 's plan is to make it the world 's largest light installation , a structure that has never before been seen in any place of the world . "
The statue is also expected to cost up to € 200 m according to yesterday 's Vima newspaper .
But , in another first that has also been welcomed by the people of Rhodes , international organisations led by the World Trade Centre Association , a network of exporters who promote peace through trade , have weighed in with financial help .
" The new Colossus has been the dream of Rhodians for many years , " said Yannis Hadzimarkos , president of the Dodecannese Islands ' Chamber of Commerce which is also supporting the project .
" It will be a marvellous opportunity for the economy of the region even if it is naive to think it will be easy . "
Backstory
Carved by Chares of Lindon , one of antiquity 's greatest sculptors , the original Colossus was erected in homage to the Sun god Helios .
It is believed to have been about 120 ft high on a 25 ft white marble plinth ( compared with the Statue of Liberty 's 151ft on a 159ft plinth ) .
For almost seven decades it stood over Rhodes before being destroyed by an earthquake in 226BC .
In later years , its huge bronze and marble parts were carted off by Arab tradesmen .
" Even lying on the ground , it is a marvel , " wrote Pliny the Elder .
It was so big , he said , that " few people can get their arms around its thumb " .
Although historians have spent years arguing about the wonder 's exact location , artists have always depicted it straddling Rhodes ' imposing harbour .
Unlike the original statue , which took Chares 12 years to carve in situ , the new statue could be built in less than half that time if adequate funding is found , project organisers say .
While the Statue of Liberty was built in France and then assembled in New York , the new Colossus is expected to be built by locals on the island .
The Colossus was included in Sidon 's list of the Seven Wonders of the World compiled some 2,137 years ago along with the Pyramids , the Walls and Hanging Gardens of Babylon , the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus in modern Turkey , the statue of Zeus at Olympia , the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the Lighthouse at Alexandria .

OOGEDY - BOOGEDY …. Kathleen
Parker blames the demise of the Republican Party on its “ evangelical , right - wing , oogedy - boogedy branch , ” and Jonah Goldberg is annoyed :
What aspects of the Christian Right amount to oogedy - boogedyism ?
I take oogedy - boogedy to be a perjorative reference to absurd superstition and irrational nonsense .
So where has the GOP embraced to its detriment oogedy - boogedyism ?
With the possible exception of some variants of creationism ( which is hardly a major issue at the national level in the GOP , as much as some on the left and a few on the right try to make it one ) , I ’m at a loss as to what Kathleen is referring to .
Opposition to abortion ?
Opposition to gay marriage ?
Euthanasia ?
Support for prayer in school ?
OK , maybe “ oogedy - boogedy ” was n’t the most felicitous phrase to use .
Sway to the music all you want and no one will mind .
But I think conservatives do themselves a disservice if they pretend not to know what Parker is talking about .
There will always be plenty of votes for a culturally conservative party .
That ’s not the problem .
The problem is the venomous , spittle - flecked , hardcore cultural conservatism that ’s become the public face of the evangelical wing of the GOP .
It ’s the wing that does n’t just support more stringent immigration laws , but that turns the issue into a hate fest against La Raza , losing 3 million Latino votes in the process .
It ’s the wing that is n’t just a little skittish about gay marriage , but that turns homophobia into a virtual litmus test , losing 6 million young voters in the process .
It ’s the wing that is n’t just religious , but that treats belief as a precondition to righteousness , losing 2 million secular voters in the process .
It ’s the wing that is n’t just nostalgic for old traditions , but that fetishizes the heartland as the only real America , losing 7 million urban voters in the process .
It ’s the wing that goes into a legislative frenzy over Terri Schiavo but six months later can barely rouse itself into more than a yawn over the destruction of New Orleans .
Now , the GOP did n’t lose all those votes solely because of their embrace of cultural victimhood .
It was a Democratic year , after all , and the economy worked against them too .
Still , exit polls suggest they had already lost most of this ground by 2006 , and the economy had nothing to do with it back then .
Conservative gains after 9/11 may have masked the problem for a while , but fundamentally these are voters who saw the Republican Party turn into a party of rabid identity politics and turned away in disgust .
It ’s probably cost them ( so far ) about 10 million votes , and in an era where 53 - 47 is considered a big victory , that ’s a helluva deficit to make up elsewhere .
A party that merely wants to move more slowly and more deliberately than liberals in the cultural sphere would n’t have lost all those votes .
But the real - life GOP , a party whose primary association in much of the public mind is with revulsion toward gays , immigrants , urban elites , and the non-churchgoing , did .
That ’s oogedy - boogedy .
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THOSE WHO WILL HEAR .

Today we 're going to walk into a specialty food market and purchase one of the most trendy , popular , and correspondingly overpriced products on the market today : Organic food .
Organic food is a conventional food crop ( genetically exactly the same plant variety as the regular version ) but grown according to a different set of standards .
In this sense , organic food is really the same thing as kosher food .
The food itself is identical , but it 's prepared in such a way to conform to different philosophical standards .
Just as kosher standards are defined by rabbinical authorities , the USDA 's National Organic Program sets the requirements for foods to bear a " certified organic " label .
Basically it forbids the use of modern synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in favor of organic equivalents , and for animals it requires that they have not been kept healthy through the use of antibiotics .
There are other rules too , and the basic goal is to require the use of only natural products throughout the growth , preparation , and preservation stages .
Organic food is more expensive than conventional food , due not only to its lower crop yields and more expensive organic fertilizers and pesticides in larger quantities , but mainly because it 's such a big fad right now and is in such high demand .
Why is that ?
Is organic food healthier ?
Does it make an important political statement ?
The usual arguments boil down to three : that it benefits small farmers rather than big evil companies ; that it 's somehow healthier to eat ; and that the cultivation method is better for the environment .
Rather than accepting these emotionally satisfying benefits at face value , let 's instead take a skeptical look and see what the data actually show .
Let 's take these three claimed benefits one at a time .
Buying organic food benefits small farmers , and represents a blow to the big food corporations .
All right , let 's take for granted the position that major food producers deserve to be struck with a blow .
I 'm sure the starving millions in Africa appreciate the sentiment .
Make no mistake , organic food is big , big business .
The days when the organic produce section of the supermarket represented the product of a small local farmer are long gone .
California alone produces over $ 600 million in organic produce , most of it coming from just five farms , who are also the same producers of most non-organic food in the state .
70 percent of all organic milk is controlled by just one major milk producer .
Five or ten years ago , when the major food producers saw that organic food was coming into vogue , what do you think they did ?
They smelled higher prices charged for less product , and started producing organic crops .
Nearly all organic crops in the United States are either grown , distributed , or sold by exactly the same companies who produce conventional crops .
They do n't care which one you buy .
You 're not striking a blow at anyone , except at your own pocketbook .
Trader Joe's is a supermarket chain specializing in organic , vegetarian , and alternative foods with hundreds of locations throughout the United States , centered in organic - happy Southern California .
Shoppers appreciate its image of healthful food in a small - business family atmosphere .
Really ?
In 2005 alone , Trader Joe 's racked up sales estimated at $ 4.5 billion .
The company is owned by a family trust set up by German billionaire Theo Albrecht , ranked the 22nd richest man in the world by Forbes in 2004 .
He 's the co-founder and CEO of German multi-national ALDI , with global revenue in grocery sales at $ 37 billion .
According to Business Week , the decade of the 1990's saw Trader Joe 's increase its profits by 1000 % .
Trader Joe 's also compensates its employees aggressively , with starting salaries for supervisors at $ 40,000 .
They hire only non-union workers .
Now , to any capitalist or business - minded person , there 's nothing wrong with any of that ( unless you 're pro-union or anti-big business ) .
It 's a great company , and very successful .
Trader Joe 's customers are willing to pay their premium prices to get that healthful image .
But they should not kid themselves that they 're striking a blow at big business and supporting the little guy .
I 'm not exactly sure why anticorporatism wound up on the organic food agenda , since it 's so counterintuitive .
The irony is that the organic food companies supply a smaller amount of food per acre planted , and enjoy dramatically higher profits , which is why anticorporatists hate corporations in the first place .
Organic foods are healthier to eat .
Did you ever wonder why Chinese drink only hot tea ?
They boil it to kill the bacteria .
Most local Chinese farming uses organic methods , in that the only fertilizers used are human and animal waste :
Without being boiled , it 's basically a nice cup of E. coli .
In the case of China and other poor nations , the reason for organic farming has less to do with ideology and more to do with lack of access to modern farming technology .
The National Review reports that Americans believe organic food is healthier by a 2 - 1 margin , despite the lack of any evidence supporting this .
When you take the exact same strain of a plant and grow it in two different ways , its chemical and genetic makeup remain the same .
One may be larger than the other if one growing method was more efficient , but its fundamental makeup and biochemical content is defined by its genes , not by the way it was grown .
Consumer Reports found no consistent difference in appearance , flavor , or texture .
A blanket statement like " organic cultivation results in a crop with superior nutritional value " has no logical or factual basis .
Some supporters of organic growing claim that the danger of non-organic food lies in the residues of chemical pesticides .
This claim is even more ridiculous :
Since the organic pesticides and fungicides are less efficient than their modern synthetic counterparts , up to seven times as much of it must be used .
Organic pesticides include rotenone , which has been shown to cause the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease and is a natural poison used in hunting by some native tribes ; pyrethrum , which is carcinogenic ; sabadilla , which is highly toxic to honeybees ; and fermented urine , which I do n't want on my food whether it causes any diseases or not .
Supporters of organics claim that the much larger amounts of chemicals they use is OK because those chemicals are all - natural .
But just because something is natural does n't mean that it 's safe or healthy — consider the examples of hemlock , mercury , lead , toadstools , box jellyfish neurotoxin , asbestos — not to mention a nearly infinite number of toxic bacteria and viruses ( E. coli , salmonella , bubonic plague , smallpox ) .
When you hear any product claim to be healthy because its ingredients are all natural , be skeptical .
By no definition can " all natural " mean that a product is healthful .
Consider the logical absurdity proposed by those who claim conventional growers produce less healthful food .
To the organically minded , conventional growers are evil greedy corporations interested only in their profit margin .
What 's the best way to improve the profit margin ?
To buy less pesticides and fertilizer .
This means they must use far more advanced and efficient products .
The idea that pesticides leave dangerous residues is many decades out of date .
Food production is among the most regulated and scrutinized of processes , and today 's synthetic pesticides and fertilizers are completely biodegradable .
They 're supported by decades of studies that demonstrate their total safety .
In the United States , 2006 brought two major outbreaks of E. coli , both resulting in deaths and numerous illnesses , ultimately traced to organically grown spinach and lettuce .
According to the Center for Global Food Issues , organic foods make up about 1 % of all the food sold in the United States , but it accounts for 8 % of E. coli cases .
Organic growing methods are better for the environment .
Organic methods require about twice the acreage to produce the same crop , thus directly resulting in the destruction of undeveloped land .
During a recent Girl Scout field trip to Tanaka Farms in Irvine , California , one of the owners told us his dirty little secret that contradicts what you 'll find on his web site .
Market conditions compelled them to switch to organic a few years ago , and he absolutely hates it .
The per-acre yield has been slashed .
Organic farming produces less food , and requires more acreage .
Many so - called environmentalists generally favor organic farming , at the same time that they protest deforestation to make room for more agriculture .
How do they reconcile these directly conflicting views ?
If you want to feed a growing population , you cannot do both , and soon wo n't be able to do either .
If you support rainforest preservation , logically you should oppose organic farming , particularly in the developing world .
On the other hand , if you demand organic soybeans , then you should have the courage to stand up and say that you do n't care whether black and brown people around the world have enough to eat or not .
I 'm not making this stuff up .
For every dreadlocked white kid beating a bongo drum in favor of organics , there is a Ph.D. agriculturist warning about its short sightedness and urging efficient modern agriculture to feed our growing population .
Personally I like forests and natural areas , so I favor using the farmlands that we already have as efficiently as possible .
This benefits everyone .
I say we dump the useless paranormal objections to foods freighted with evil corporate hate energy , and instead use our brains to our advantage for once .
When we find a better way to grow the same crop faster , stronger , healthier , and on less acreage , let 's do it .
We all benefit .

The public 's perception of children is a negative one , says the survey More than half the population believe UK children behave like animals , a survey has suggested .
Half of the 2,021 adults interviewed by YouGov also felt children were increasingly a danger to others .
Children 's charity Barnardo's , which commissioned the study , said society " casually condemned " children .
It is behind an awareness campaign , with a stark internet advertisement showing adults hunting " vermin " , which turn out to be children .
The advert , intended to show how society demonises young people , was launched on 17 November .
A second - different - advert will be launched for TV on 24 November .
The survey asked people whether they agreed or disagreed with statements about children .
About 54 % of the adults questioned thought that British children were " beginning to behave like animals " .
More than a third of those surveyed also agreed that " it feels like the streets are infested " with children , while 43 % said something had to be done to protect adults .
Around 49 % said they disagreed with the statement that children who " get into trouble " were " misunderstood " and needed professional help .

The charity also examined comments left on stories published on the websites of several national newspapers .
Staff found messages where children were described as " feral , cruel and ruthless " and were said to " wander in packs " .
The charity 's chief executive Martin Narey said the British population was guilty of labelling all children in the same way .
He said : " It is appalling that words like animal , feral and vermin are used daily in reference to children .
" Despite the fact that most children are not troublesome there is still a perception that today 's young people are a more unruly , criminal lot than ever before .
" The British public overestimates , by a factor of four , the amount of crime committed by young people .
" The real crime is that this sort of talk and attitude does nothing to help those young people who are difficult , unruly or badly behaved to change their ways . "
' Unfair treatment '
The charity claimed that the attitudes revealed by its study reflected the results of the latest British Crime Survey .

These showed that people blamed children for up to half of all crime when in fact they were responsible for only 12 % of criminal activity .
Last month , the United Nations said there was a " general climate of intolerance " towards British children and this could result in them being treated unfairly .
Barnardo's has also published a report called Breaking the Cycle .
The report stated that children who carried out illegal and anti-social behaviour were those most in need of support .
It also claimed that young people who became involved in criminal activity came from the most deprived families , had the poorest educational experiences and were more likely to suffer from poor health .
Mr Narey said the charity was not " naive " and accepted a " minority of children " were anti-social and committed crimes .
He said action had to be taken to prevent those at risk of criminal behaviour from following that path .

They 're the bizarre undies that promise a perfect derriere ...
Would you dare to wear a BUM bra ?
Curvy is the new thin .
Even Victoria Beckham has put on half a stone in her mission to get a bigger bottom , after David expressed his desire for big - bottomed girls .
How far are you prepared to go to get the look ?
If , like me , you 're only a packet of Jammie Dodgers away from a fat day , then you wo n't be lacking in padding - but you might be searching for something that can keep your curves firmly in shape .
Well , good news : you can now buy a pair of pants that promise to lift your bottom into pert gloriousness without actually making it bigger .
Perky promise : The Double - O Thong claims to lift your bottom without actually making it bigger
If that is n't enough , these miracle knickers can even flatten your stomach at the same time .
Suddenly , you 've got the kind of shape that won Marilyn Monroe legendary status and a room full of A - list lovers .
However , when I clap eyes on the Double - O Thong , I recoil in horror .
It looks like a piece of fetish gear gone badly , badly wrong .
First , they are flesh coloured , which makes my bottom look like pieces of beige plastic welded together to make a giant , malfunctioning Barbie .
Secondly , the pants are the shape of cycling shorts , with two large holes cut out over each buttock .
That 's the thong part and I 'm guessing the ' Double - O ' does n't have anything to do with James Bond - it refers to my large derriere .
Aye carumba .
Thongs and cycling shorts are unflattering enough in themselves , but together they are nothing short of terrifying .
Seriously , these undies may as well come with an incontinence pad for the level of desire they inspire .
I 've seen sexier surgical stockings .
I would n't be surprised if these new - age knickers double as contraception , because surely no one would ever feel like having sex while wearing these .
Merely looking at them gives me goosebumps - and not in a good way .
When it comes to my usual attire , I put one foot in followed by the other and away I go .
With the bottom bra there is plenty of room for confusion .
There are five holes : one for my torso , two for the legs and two for the buttocks .
Curvy : Jennifer Lopez 's bottom is the envy of women everywhere
Finding the right place to put your feet is a real challenge that leaves me feeling like a contestant on The Krypton Factor .
Reluctantly , I wriggle into the control pants .
I 've hated my bottom for the past decade , and now it hates me , too .
Each cheek squeezes out of its cut - out hole and sits proud , propped up by the special ' butt booster bands ' - basically , tight elastic straps at the top of each thigh that act as scaffolding for your buttocks .
I feel pretty humiliated .
As I turn this way and that in the mirror , I can't get used to how freaky my rear looks .
Honestly , even granny pants are more flattering .
' It 's not quite two delicious halves of a peach , but it 's not two saggy Space Hoppers squashed into a cupboard like before
But the knickers are weirdly comfortable : soft against my skin yet , thanks to the high - compression latex inside , the high waist is strong enough to rein in even the most determined doughnut - gut .
They also feel securely wedged in place .
I need clothes .
Urgently .
Choosing what to wear with the new pants is tricky : the lace - trimmed knees would show below a miniskirt hem and I would n't want these horrors coming over the top of my jeans waistband to say hello .
The answer is a pencil skirt : the only fashion item that will sheath the pants and work with my newfound Jessica Rabbit wiggle .
Ta da !
I had worried that lifting up the cellulite - heavy zone of my bottom would put my dimples right in everyone 's eyeline , but my fears on this score are unfounded .
When I turn backwards to catch my rear view in the mirror , to my amazement it looks like my bottom is higher , rounder and smoother .
VPL is n't really an issue either , because the design is virtually seamless under clothing .
Even if you were apprehended by a member of the fashion police wielding a magnifying glass , the lines under my skirt are so bizarre that no one would suspect they were from my underwear .
Mission : Victoria Beckham has put on half a stone to get a bigger behind
I 've always preferred to sit on my bottom and pretend it 's not there .
But once acclimatised , I have to admit that the engineering of these knickers is impressive .
It 's suddenly as though I 've spent the past six months in the gym performing squats .
It 's not quite two delicious halves of a peach , but it's not two saggy Space Hoppers squashed into a cupboard like it looked before , either .
OK , it 's just me who 's grabbing it , but I 'd say it 's grab - able .
Hello , pertness .
For the first time in my life , I 'm actually yearning for a bigger bottom .
I reckon the more flesh you 've got , the more fabulous the effect .
The Double - O Thong is like a passport to a second slice of cake .
And maybe a double - chocolate fudge brownie , too , just to wash it down .
' OK , there 's something different about you .
What is it ? ' asks my friend
Zoe curiously when I meet her in our favourite bar .
' Is that a new skirt ? '
I smile happily and widen my eyes like an innocent person who would never commit buttock fraud .
I like it that the effect is dramatic enough for people to notice , yet subtle enough that no one would guess what you 're wearing .
However , I imagine the temptation to lift up your skirt and show your weird pants off to everyone might get stronger with a third glass of wine .
I do n't know .
I 'm not brave enough to test it .
Heck , I 'm not even prepared to show my boyfriend what I look like in these .
We 're happy together .
Why spoil it ?
I 've heard men complain about falling for Wonderbra - wearing women , only to discover their breasts are nearer their belly button than their armpits .
I bet the male of the species might become quite hypnotised by the effect of these knickers , but be horrified by the actual garments themselves .
Remember that scene in Bridget Jones 's Diary where the lusty Daniel Cleaver slides his hands up Bridget 's skirt for the first time only to discover her suck - in pants ?

" Yeah .
I 'm going to sit at that desk because I 'm thinking that will inspire big thoughts , " she told her father .
" Hey , go ahead kid , " Michelle Obama said with a laugh .
Her father said Malia is " quite the historian " and is sure she will be using the desk .
" That 's her plan and she usually executes her plan , " Obama said with a touch of paternal pride .
The soon - to - be first kids were afraid that the White House would n't be a kid friendly , but those fears were dispelled after their visit , Michelle Obama told Walters .
" Malia ... said , ' You know , I thought this was was going to be an untouchable place .
You know , the kind of place where you can't touch anything ...
But actually the White House is kind of homey , ' " Michelle Obama said .
Like any home , especially one anticipating getting a dog , there was some good natured banter about what kind of dog to get , with Obama objecting to any suggestion that they get a " yappy " little " girly " dog .
He also wanted to be certain that his daughters are going to be willing to " scoop the poop " on the White House lawn .
Obama told Walters that his promise of a dog for Malia and her 7 - year - old sister Sasha has produced an avalanche of advice and dog pictures .
" We 're getting more advice about this than my economic policy , " he said with a laugh .
" No doubt about it . "
More on Wednesday 's " World News , " and watch " A Barbara Walters Special : Barack and Michelle Obama " tonight at 10 p.m. ET
Obama got another suggestion during his sit - down with Walters , who suggested he get a dog like her Cha Cha , a small breed known as a Havanese .
Obama was immediately skeptical .
" But it 's like a little yappy dog , " the president - elect said .
" Do n't criticize , " a laughing future first lady Michelle Obama urged .
" It like sits in your lap and things ? " Obama asked .
" It sounds like a girly dog . "
His wife reminded Obama , " We 're girls .
We have a houseful of girls . "
Making an executive decision , Obama announced , " Well , we 're going to have a big rambunctious dog of some kind . "
Like any potential dog owner , Obama fretted about who would walk the pooch and pick up after it .
Acknowledging that Malia and Sasha are excited about the prospect of getting the pet , the soon - to - be First Dad said , " They 're not excited enough to walk the dog , though . "
His wife insisted it would become the girls ' job .
Not just walk the dog , Obama insisted .
" And scoop the poop .
...
We do n't want to litter the White House lawns .
So they 're going to have to do their job . "
The Obama girls are going to have other chores to do while living in the White House , including making their beds and cleaning their rooms .
" That was the first thing I said to some of the [ White House ] staff when I did my visit , " Michelle Obama told Walters .
" Because of course , the girls , they 're so good .
I said , ' You know , we 're going to have to set up some boundaries .
Because they 're going to need to be able to make their beds ' " and clean their own rooms .
Michelle Obama added with a laugh , " Do n't make their beds .
Make mine . "
Barack Obama said he was intent on having his children know they are special to their parents , " But they 're not special , you know , in terms of having to do their homework or having to do chores . "
Malia and Sasha Still Believe in Santa
The hourlong interview with Walters touched on the economy , Iraq , Afghanistan and energy issues , but it became more casual when Michelle joined her husband .
Obama joked that once he 's president , " Hail to the Chief " will play every time he officially enters a room .
" I 've been trying to get Michelle to do the same thing , " he said .
" I saluted once , " Michelle put in .
They agreed on one thing : Michelle gets the last word .
" When Momma 's happy , everybody is happy , " Obama explained .
Obama is getting his way when he gets to the White House .
He had considered replacing the White House bowling alley with a basketball court .
" Well , it turns out there 's a tennis court in the White House and I think the guys in charge say they maybe can put a couple of basketball hoops at either end , " he said .
In the next few weeks the Obamas will celebrate the last holidays in their own home .
The girls believe in Santa , their parents said , and will write letters to Santa .
Thanksgiving will be a big affair with 60 people , mostly Michelle 's relatives , in Chicago .
But she 's not cooking this year .
" Do n't you think ... my husband ran for president ... that I should get an out on cooking something for dinner ?
Do n't you think , Barbara ? " Michelle Obama pleaded .
TBILISI , Georgia 
Newly available accounts by independent military observers of the beginning of the war between Georgia and Russia this summer call into question the longstanding Georgian assertion that it was acting defensively against separatist and Russian aggression .
Instead , the accounts suggest that Georgia ’s inexperienced military attacked the isolated separatist capital of Tskhinvali on Aug. 7 with indiscriminate artillery and rocket fire , exposing civilians , Russian peacekeepers and unarmed monitors to harm .
The accounts are neither fully conclusive nor broad enough to settle the many lingering disputes over blame in a war that hardened relations between the Kremlin and the West .
But they raise questions about the accuracy and honesty of Georgia ’s insistence that its shelling of Tskhinvali , the capital of the breakaway region of South Ossetia , was a precise operation .
Georgia has variously defended the shelling as necessary to stop heavy Ossetian shelling of Georgian villages , bring order to the region or counter a Russian invasion .
President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia has characterized the attack as a precise and defensive act .
But according to observations of the monitors , documented Aug. 7 and Aug. 8 , Georgian artillery rounds and rockets were falling throughout the city at intervals of 15 to 20 seconds between explosions , and within the first hour of the bombardment at least 48 rounds landed in a civilian area .
The monitors have also said they were unable to verify that ethnic Georgian villages were under heavy bombardment that evening , calling to question one of Mr. Saakashvili ’s main justifications for the attack .
Lebanese officials believe that the " Israeli espionage network " uncovered recently was involved in the assassination of senior Hizbullah commander Imad Mugniyah .
Security sources told the As - Safir newspaper on Wednesday that the network 's leader , Ali al - Jarah , had confessed to his investigators that he was ordered to survey the Kafr Sousa neighborhood in Damascus , where Mugniyah was killed by a car bomb in February .
Commentary Hizbullah and the ‘ spies ’ Ron Ben- Yishai
It seems that Hizbullah exposed ‘ Israeli spies ’ for deterrence purposes Hizbullah and the ‘ spies ’
The Lebanese security sources estimated that al - Jarah and his brother Yusuf were recruited by the Israeli intelligence in 1982 , and have since carried out many missions .
According to the report , Ali al - Jarah also operated in additional Arab capitals apart from Damascus and Beirut and used a " military vehicle " provided to him to ease his movements .
The investigators are now checking whether additional al - Jarah brothers are involved in the network and have also worked for Israel
As -Safir was the paper which revealed that the two espionage suspects were arrested about two weeks ago .
The Lebanese army confirmed some of the details the same day .
Fed elevates AMEX to bank status Agence France - Presse

The US Federal Reserve Monday authorized giving credit card giant American Express full status as a bank holding company .
The US central bank said that both American Express Company and its affiliate American Express Travel Related Services would be allowed to form bank holding companies , as the Amex group converts its Salt Lake City , Utah - based American Express Centurion Bank into a full bank .
" In light of the unusual and exigent circumstances affecting the financial markets , and all other facts and circumstances , the ( Federal Reserve ) Board has determined that emergency conditions exist that justify expeditious action on this proposal , " the Fed said in a statement .
The carnage in India served yesterday as an urgent and disturbing reminder to Barack Obama , the US President - elect , that the spectre of foreign terrorism is just as likely to challenge him in his first days in office as are the continuing stumbles of the domestic economy .
The attacks are deeply alarming to the United States .
They were denounced simultaneously by President George Bush and the Obama transition team in Chicago .
Events in India also seemed to give a measure of vindication to Vice President - elect Joe Biden who was criticised , not least by the Republican candidate John McCain , when he predicted weeks before voting that the " mettle " of Mr Obama would be tested within weeks of his taking office by an " international crisis " .
Just such a crisis seem to have arisen earlier than Mr Biden imagined .
The attacks , reported saturation - style on the US networks on Thanksgiving Day , were a reminder to ordinary Americans of the threat .
Only this week , an FBI memo was leaked to the press , warning the authorities of possible attacks by al - Qa'ida on the New York subway before Christmas .

" These co-ordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism , " an Obama spokesman , Brooke Anderson , said .
" The United States must continue to strengthen our partnerships with India and nations around the world to root out and destroy terrorist networks . "
There was no word of Americans being among those killed , witnesses in Mumbai said the terrorists had singled out Britons , Americans and also Israelis as they stormed the hotels .
There is also an acute awareness that , in the seven years since 9/11 , India has emerged as the most important ally to the US in the region , which may have made it a target for terrorism .
" If the terror threat spreads from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the important American ally , India , that 's an enormous problem for the United States , " David Gergen , an ex-presidential adviser and commentator warned .
For much of this week , Mr Obama has tried to reassure Americans that he is getting on top of the economic crisis , holding news conferences three days in a row in Chicago and rolling out the senior members of his economic team .
The economy was also the focus of new media interviews , the most recent with Barbara Walters on Wednesday when he warned he was " no miracle worker " .
The horror in India will now force him quickly to spread his focus also to international issues .
Helping India recover from its trauma and bring the captured terrorists to justice as well as the broader issue of foreign - bred terrorism will now by necessity be at the top of his agenda .
Already as candidate he spoke of a rapprochement between India and Pakistan as holding the key to winding up terrorism along the border with Afghanistan .

We speak to the people who knew Barack Obama best , revealing an intimate , often touching , portrait of a man on the brink of greatness
Indonesia 1969 : Rully Dasaad
After Barack 's parents split up , he moved with his mother and Indonesian stepfather to Jakarta , aged seven , where he befriended classmate Dasaad - now a commercial photographer - at Basuki Primary School .
When the teacher introduced ' Barry Soetoro ' [ Obama went by his stepfather 's name at the time ] to the class , he was very exotic .
He was the only non-Indonesian ; he was taller than all of us and chubby .
He was accompanied by his white mum and his Indonesian stepfather , who was wearing a military outfit , and I remember thinking , that 's strange , he looks half black , half white - maybe this is what a boy from Hawaii looks like .
He wore Bermuda pants that extended below the knee , whereas our short pants were halfway down our thigh , and he wore T - shirts with stripes whereas ours were plain .
He was the only left - handed student in class - it's not considered polite in Indonesia to be left - handed - so it was always amazing to see him writing with his left hand .
Barry was the only one in the class who had bread in his lunch box - the rest of us had traditional Indonesian snacks .
There 's one called kepan - sticky rice and desiccated coconut which you have to dip in this very strong chilli sauce .
It 's hot even for us .
But Barry was very curious .
He tried it and burnt his mouth , and he was saying : ' It 's hot , it 's hot . '
You can see he was always open to learning something new .
He and his mum had been living in Indonesia since 1967 .
She worked for USAID , helping Indonesian women in the countryside to live in a more Western fashion .
For the first two months , Barry was still adjusting .
We had a singing class once a week and he would n't sing , probably because he was shy and worried that he might sing a word wrong .
But after three months , he spoke Indonesian .
He became one of us .
I remember one time he had a birthday and I went to his house with some classmates .
Barry 's house was down a mud track ; to play football there , you had to put plastic bags on your feet .
Near his house was a small canal - at that time it was n't polluted - and they had small salamanders in it .
Barry had chickens in his home field .
It was totally normal for Jakarta in those days .
Me , Barry and Yanto used to play together every lunch break for two years and he was very loyal to our gang .
If I said : ' Do n't play with that boy , play with us ' , he 'd do it .
We 'd try to finish our lunch as fast as we could and then we'd go to the fields and play : running , hide and seek , marbles and tak gebok , an Indonesian game of tag where you try to hit your fellow boys with a ball .
One time , there was a naughty young boy who missed Barry with the ball so he took a small stone from the playing field and threw it and hit Barry 's head , which started bleeding .
I remember Barry just went quiet - his mum had taught him not to fight .
He was one of those kids you could tell was brought up with a lot of love and affection and so he was never angry or nasty .
We loved playing so much we were always in on the third bell .
Most of the girls had a problem with our gang because we were always very active and sweating , and sometimes we 'd miss - throw and hit a girl .
' Oh , here they are again , ' they 'd say .
' Oh , you 're sweating from the sun , you stink , go away . '
So I had to teach Barry Indonesian swear words to say back to the girls .
At the time , my father and President Sukarno were the only people in the country with Cadillacs , and both were presents from my grandpa , who was the richest man in Indonesia .
Grandpa bought me all the DC Comic books , and I was the only one who had them , so Barry and Yanto would borrow the books and copy pictures of Batman and Spider - Man out and ask me to judge which was better .
Barry was always better than Yanto .
Even Yanto always agreed with that .
Barry had a great eye .
We came back from the summer vacation for fifth grade and Barry was n't there .
The teacher said he'd gone back to Hawaii .
Our small gang was split up .
Somebody said in 2006 : ' Look at Time magazine - your old friend is running for President . '
I did n't recognise him .
He was much slimmer .
Then I saw a picture where he was laughing and I recognised him from the smile and the teeth .
Later on there were allegations that the school was a madrassa , and foreign journalists began hanging around .
But the small mosque at the school today was added on in 2001 .
There was no mosque at the time and it was n't even a particularly religious school .
It 's very sad if a great nation like America wants to persecute Obama just because he was born from a Muslim dad and had a Muslim stepfather .
I 'm sure one of the reasons for the flexibility he has today is his experiences in Indonesia .
At the school , there were half - Chinese and half - Dutch Indonesians , Javanese people , Ambonese , and there were Buddhists , Hindus , Muslims , Christians and Catholics .
Barry is used to a mix .
Hawaii 1975 : Tony Peterson
Barack moved back to Honolulu , Hawaii in 1971 , aged 10 , and lived with his grandparents .
At Punahou High School , he met Peterson , who now works for the United Methodist Church in Tennessee .
There were only five black kids out of 1,600 .
I used to get to school early ; I 'd see Barry and he'd say : ' Let 's go shoot some hoops ' and we 'd play pick - up basketball together .
He was a bit chubby but far better than me .
Rik , Barry and myself jockeyed around and talked casually , and realised that here we are , intelligent black men , and we could have some good conversations .
We 'd sit on the sidestep of the library , where a radio would be playing Marvin Gaye and the Eagles , and have these great conversations about life .
I recorded one for an English assignment .
Rik asked what we thought ' time ' was , and Barry replied : ' Time is just a collection of human experiences combined so that they make a long , flowing stream of thought . '
He was 14 then , Rik was 16 , I was 17 , and Barry was definitely matching us .
We talked about the future .
Rik said he'd be a doctor , which he is ; I was going to be a lawyer , which I 'm not ; and Barry was going to be a basketball player .
Barry wrote in my year book : ' Go on and get that law degree , and I 'm going to be a famous basketball player , and when I need to sue my team I 'll call you . '
Of course he went on to be the lawyer and not a shabby one either .
We talked about race but not , I thought , out of a deep sense of pain .
The revolutionary anger started to die down in the Seventies .
We were n't dealing with the harsh barriers , more with the rate of change , the progress we were making .
Black culture was popular across the race spectrum .
Jesse Jackson was a big public figure , everyone loved Stevie Wonder , the most popular sports star was Julius ' Doctor J ' Ervin , the basketball genius .
So we were talking about things like : would the girls date us black guys and would we see a black President in our lifetime ?
The answer to the first was yes and on the second our take was : there 'll be progress , but we wo n't see it happen .
Decades later , I was in a bookstore in Boulder , Colorado , visiting my brother Keith and he picks this book Dreams From My Father out of the remainder bin and said : ' Look who wrote this . '
It was Barry 's memoir .
Where he talks about his Punahou years , I was surprised by the agony he was feeling .
But I 'd been black all my life in a way that Barry sort of had n't .
People looked at him and saw a black man , but his own identity was that he was raised by and living with his white mother and these white grandparents .
And maybe because of his white half , white people were willing to let their racist side out in front of him .
So he had a lot to wrestle with , especially as a teenager .
He was questioning things and following them towards agony and resolution .
In 2004 ( at the Democratic convention ) , I told all my friends that an old friend of mine was making the speech .
I 've voted both sides before , but I have never heard a political speech so profound .
What he was saying is what I believe - that 's the America I want to live in .
I 'm extremely proud of him and I trust him .
I know the man .
I trust his intellect .
I trust his judgment .
One of my favourite lines from that speech was something we used to talk about on the library step :
' We need to eradicate the slander that says a black kid with a book is acting white . '
That was the kind of stuff we 'd experienced ; I had lived a lifetime of trying to do well academically and having black kids say : ' You 're acting white . '
Punahou was a good school - my family had to save every penny to send me there , Obama scraped in on a scholarship .
It was originally a school to educate missionaries ' children and it still had that missionary spirit .
One of the things that Punahou instilled in us is that you 're given much in order to give much - you 're here to go out and help the world .
Los Angeles 1980 : Margot Mifflin
University friend of Obama at Occidental College , LA .
Now a journalism professor .
I was a year ahead of him .
I invited him and his roommate Hasan Chandoo , who I started dating , to dinner , and they showed up looking crisp and fresh - faced .
I 'd go to student parties round their house ; I remember dancing to ' Once in a Lifetime ' by Talking Heads in a sea of people .
Barry was a focused , dedicated student and an earnest , sincere person , but he was n't too serious to talk about the fun stuff .
We 'd hang out and talk about what was happening in class and who was dating whom .
He goofed around with the rest of us .
He was engaging and perhaps even charismatic , but I was n't aware of him being a playboy .
He was friends with women who were impressive feminists as well as people who were more socially focused .
He straddled groups : the arts / literary crowd , which tended to stick together , and the political activist crowd , likewise .
He belonged to both .
I studied in a creative writing class with him .
I remember him submitting a poem called ' Pop ' ( since published in the New Yorker ) .
It was a penetrating portrait of his grandfather , in which his grandfather asked him what he was going to do with his life .
I was also at the rally where he gave his first speech , an anti-apartheid rally at Occidental .
He was hunched over the mike , it was too low for him .
He was nervous and he was rushing a little .
I recall him saying something like : ' Occidental should spend less time investing in South Africa and more time on multicultural education . '
That was impressive because you think of multiculturalism as a Nineties phenomenon , and here he was in the early Eighties , thinking about the need for that in an educational sense .
It did n't occur to anyone this guy could become President .
He certainly did n't go around saying anything that audacious or ambitious .
He was a nose - to - the - grindstone , quiet worker , not the kind who would run around tooting his own horn , even though he was probably getting messages from his professors that he had serious talent .
I think he was figuring out who he would be and when he left Occidental he took the steps to become that person .
It 's like Shakespeare 's line : ' Some are born great , some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them . '
He was the guy who achieved greatness and it clearly took a lot of hard work to do that .
Chicago 1980s : Auma Obama
Obama 's Kenyan half - sister , who first met Barack in the Eighties .
Worked in children 's services in Reading , UK but has since moved to Nairobi .
We used to see photos of Barack as he was growing up in America .
My father always talked about him , that Barack would come home to Kenya some day .
He would say to us : ' You 've got to write to your brother Barry ' and obviously as a child you think : ' Oh yeah , OK , all right ' , but you 're not really that fussed , so I did n't make any contact .
It was actually Barack who contacted me first , after the death of our father .
I was in Germany , studying in Heidelberg , and he wrote to me .
He has the same name and handwriting as our father so when I looked at the back of the letter I had this shiver go up my spine .
We corresponded for a while and then I went over to the US to see a friend .
It was the mid-Eighties .
I had decided to visit Barack as his guest in Chicago .
I was nervous .
I was very close to my dad and Barack was a piece of him that I had n't known .
What if we did not get along ?
Well , I was n't disappointed .
We just got into the car , his little car , and started talking and never stopped .
It was a very intense 10 days together .
Barack was a community organiser .
He was just a small person , a nobody , but he had the same intensity he has today .
He was disturbed by the status quo and was working at the grassroots to see what was going wrong .
I was very active in political awareness work in Germany and I saw that he had the same energy and passion to make a difference and to change people 's lives .
For me it was : ' Wow , this is like Christmas ' , where you get this huge , big present of somebody who actually understands what you are saying , where you 're coming from .
Later , I moved back home for a year to work as a tutorial fellow at the University in Nairobi .
Barack visited Kenya for the first time .
I picked him up in my Beetle .
He did not have any of these hang - ups , you know : ' Oh there are mosquitoes . '
He came and just was .
It made it so easy .
We spent a lot of time discussing and explaining things .
I do n't know if it was strange for Barack to come here .
The thing is it was n't strange for the family .
Nobody but me had met Barry but everybody knew him from our father .
We do n't dramatise family in Kenya and people were n't fazed by him at all , although they did find some things interesting .
For my grandmother , it was his accent and the fact that he could not speak Luo .
And all the kids would come and compare their skin colour to Barack's .
People had many questions for him and Barack definitely had many questions for them .
There was never a moment of silence or embarrassed awkwardness .
It was n't all nice .
Sometimes , he wanted to see relatives I did n't really get along with and he'd be like : ' It 's my right and I need to see them and I 'm not going alone and you 're coming with me ' .
To take a break , we went to the coast .
Coming back ( from Mombasa to Nairobi ) we travelled by bus .
The driver was going so fast and I was so , so scared .
Barack took it all in his stride .
I , the Kenyan who should have been used to it , was furious at the driver .
But Barack was just like : ' OK , this is the adventure that it is . '
He came with this big baggage of tolerance and relaxedness and the ability to just absorb .
When I went to his wedding [ in the US , in 1992 ] I could see that people were very impressed with him .
People listened to him .
I could see that a lot of them were people of prominence and thinkers in the community .
Today , I still see the same Barack I first met .
At home , he 's the same , very normal person .
Politically , he 's now a big shot , but there 's an expression that says a big shot is a small shot who never stopped shooting .
He was shooting back then - not in the sense the Republicans would use it , with a rifle - but in that he was always working , and people came on board and slowly more and more people understood that what this guy is trying to do is going to make a difference to America and the American people .
Sometimes , I 'm awed by what he has achieved .
I 'm very , very proud of him .
I have to keep reminding myself : ' Oh he 's just my little brother ' just to bring it back to reality and make sure that I do n't get too excited about who I am because of what he 's done .
Chicago 1985 : Gerald Kellman
Employed Obama as a community organiser at the Calumet Community Religious Conference , Chicago , 1985 - 88 .
I met Barack at a coffee shop on Lexington Avenue , New York .
He was a year out of Columbia and he'd just quit a job working as a journalist for a business publication .
One of his preoccupations was being a novelist and he had taken the journalism job to facilitate that .
He wrote a number of short stories about his experiences , other people 's lives and their struggles .
I read a couple and I thought they were pretty good .
He 's a wonderful writer by non-professional standards , but he knew he was n't up with his heroes .
So he 'd applied to work for my group as a community organiser in the impoverished South Side of Chicago .
The Calumet region of Chicago was the largest producer of steel in the country .
When the mills shut down , the jobs went , gangs and drugs became huge and the place unravelled .
Barack had grown up as an outsider , without a father , as an American kid living abroad and separated from his mother at high school .
Outsiders do one of two things : try to be like everyone else or identify with other outsiders .
Barack did the latter .
He was reflective and willing to identify with people in poverty , with people who faced discrimination .
He was also idealistic .
He had been inspired by Dr Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement , but he was a decade or so too late for it and this was the closest he could get .
I was offering him $ 10,000 a year and two grand for a car and I remember thinking : someone who was smart enough to do it should have been smart enough not to do it .
The salary was ridiculous , the status low , the prospects bad and he had to move to Chicago .
The way I convinced him was to talk about the Calumetians ' lives and he wanted to see what he could do to help them .
Barack is often motivated by a desire to learn , and he was hungry for hands - on experience .
Chicago 's South Side contains the largest black community in the States .
Barack 's job was to go into the community and interview individuals to find out what the problems were and then teach them the public skills to get change and that if they were to get anywhere the community needed to work together .
Barack had to give people confidence and he did it brilliantly because he listened .
He 's a remarkably quick learner and not at all snobbish about whether he learns from people of high or low status .
In community organising , people often do n't like each other .
The less there is , the more people tend to grasp for it .
One day , Barack noticed that the city had removed asbestos from the manager 's office of the Altgeld housing estate , but not from the residents ' flats .
People were so incensed by the inequity that they were more than ready to organise .
They drove down to Springfield to confront the politicians and it got that area of Chicago mobilised in a way they never had been before .
I think a lot of his orientation was formed in his time as an organiser .
Local politicians and clergy felt our group was a potential threat and Barack had to decide when to compromise and when not to , when to be confrontational and when to be collaborative and those parts of his character were shaped during his organising career .
He was resilient and good at turning things around .
Always , when things were going badly , Barack would stay up most of the night , trying to figure things out .
And by the next day he'd be meeting people and we'd be trying an alternative strategy .
We socialised together .
He would come over for dinner at our house and we played tennis together .
He was neat for a young man .
His afro had been cropped by that time and he would wear button - down , short - sleeve shirts , slacks and shoes .
He could n't afford to take his shirt to the laundry but it always looked neatly pressed .
His apartment was also very neat , almost monastic , without much furniture and filled with books .
He was very thin , skinnier than he is now .
Women would regularly invite him home to dinner to try to fatten him up , but it did n't work .
Three years after he'd started work for us , we were walking around at a conference at the Harvard divinity school in Cambridge and he said he 'd decided to leave organising for law school .
He did n't see organising making the big differences that he felt were needed .
He had n't met Michelle yet , but he wanted a family and he did n't want the uncertainty of the low salary .
I thought his reasons were good and that he'd done a great job .
He was open to learning about the church .
As for his personal orientation towards God , he was working that out too .
He was influenced by the kind of people he was meeting and the role that faith played in their lives .
He was moving from an intellectual understanding to a more visceral and experiential understanding .
Jakarta 1980s : Julia Surakusuma
Close friend of Obama 's mother , Jakarta , Indonesia , 1981 to 1995 .
Sociologist and feminist writer .
Ann was very proud of Barry .
She was very close to her children and spoke very warmly about them .
There are n't many mothers who could create their children in the way she created him .
I always resent the suggestion that she was not a good mother because Barry went back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents when he was 10 .
It was precisely because she was a good mother that she made that choice , to do what was best for him .
It was a very painful decision for her but they contacted each other as frequently as possible .
Both Barry and his sister , Maya , are the living incarnation of what is best about their mother .
Often , it 's really painful for me to watch him on television because I can see his mother in him .
Ann was very smart and , in many ways , a pioneer .
She was really brave , even revolutionary , to have married entirely outside her culture .
She was a rebel in a way , but not confrontational .
They are the same qualities you see in Barry .
The fact that he wants to work for the community , that was his mum .
The people 's person side of him , that was his mum .
Ann and Barry have ' fire ' , but in the case of Ann , it was tempered by her earthy , motherly nature , whereas with Barry , he 's more ' air ' and expresses his passion more through his intellect .
I met him two or three times when he came to visit his mum in Jakarta when he was in his early twenties .
I remember him coming into the living room and sitting on the arm of the sofa .
I remember so well his smile and his personality .
He was charismatic even then .
Harvard 1989 : Larry Tribe
University professor of constitutional law , who taught Obama , and for whom Obama worked as a research assistant .
Barack came to see me during his first year at Harvard .
It was 31 March 1989 .
I found my desk calendar and I 'd written his name with an exclamation point .
From the late 1960s , when I began teaching as a professor at Harvard Law School , until the present , there has been no other student whose name I 've noted in that way .
He impressed me from the beginning as an extraordinary young man .
He was obviously brilliant , driven and interested in pursuing ideas with a clear sense that his reasons for being in law school were not to climb some corporate ladder , nor simply to broaden his opportunities , but to go back to the community .
He had a combination of intellectual acumen , open - mindedness , resistance to stereotypical thinking and conventional presuppositions .
He also had a willingness to change his mind when new evidence appeared , confidence in his own moral compass and a maturity that obviously came from some combination of his upbringing and earlier experience .
I asked him to be my research assistant , a role he filled for a year and a half .
We had a much more vibrant dialogue than one typically has with a research assistant .
He was witty , he had a lighthearted touch and even though we were dealing with some pretty grave and weighty subjects , it was always a breezy thing to talk to him .
He had a charismatic quality and was very engaging .
Other students gravitated towards him and liked him rather than envying him or wanting to compete with him .
Typically in a place as competitive as Harvard or Yale , one student will make a comment and another student will try and one - up him by saying something cleverer or wittier .
But Barack would never put anyone else down .
If a student expressed a view he did n't agree with , he nevertheless saw the value in it and built on it .
He found points of communality and gave people the sense that he could see where they were coming from , and what their core beliefs were , and why they were worthy of respect .
It was really a precursor to the way he engages in dialogue across ideological and partisan divisions .
In his second year , he became the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review [ one of the leading law journals in the world ] .
It was a position which represented the judgment of his peers about his intellectual acumen and his leadership capacities .
He emerged with the enthusiastic backing of other students .
In no sense was this some kind of affirmative action ; he was chosen as the best person people could find .
We used to take long walks on the Charles River in Boston .
Our conversations were enormously wide - ranging and enjoyable , about life in general , not just about work .
I had no doubt as I got to know him that he had an unlimited future .
I did n't have a clear sense of what direction it would take , but I thought it would be political and I thought the sky was the limit .
He had a personal quality which was transcendent and I continued to feel that way about him each time we met .
And the quality he demonstrated that I 've always been left with more than any other is authenticity .
There is n't a fibre of phoniness about this guy .
Illinois 1996 : Senator Terry Link
A friend of Obama since they played poker and golf together at the Capitol , Springfield , Illinois in the 1990s .
We came into the Illinois Senate together in 1996 , were seat mates - we sat next to one another on the Senate floor - and office mates - our offices were adjacent .
The Senate schedule had us in Springfield away from our families on Wednesday nights .
I do n't drink at all , Barack would have a beer once in a while , so we did n't carouse the bars like lots of the others .
You could say that we were both measured personalities .
So I said : ' Why do n't we have a card game ? '
We called it the ' Committee Meeting ' but there was no shop talk allowed .
We had seven or eight Republicans and Democrats and it was a time to get to know one another out of the shadows of the Capitol .
We 'd take the suits and ties off , sit back and have a night of relaxing .
It was low - stakes poker : a dollar stake , three dollar top raise .
No one was going to lose their mortgage or house .
Barack wore sweat pants and a baseball cap , drank a beer and would cadge a few cigarettes .
If his style of poker is like how he 'll run the White House I 'll sleep well at night .
He is very conscious of the odds .
If he thought he had a chance of winning he'd stay in the game ; if he thought not he'd fold straight away .
He read and played the field very well .
He was serious at it .
There was another player , Larry Walsh , a relatively conservative Democrat .
Barack trumped his four of a kind with a higher four of a kind to take the pot and Walsh threw his cards down .
' Doggone it , Barack , ' he said .
' If you were more liberal in your card playing and more conservative in your politics , we 'd get along much better . '
Barack 's golf game was terrible at first , that 's probably the nicest way to say it .
I 'm an avid golfer .
He hated losing to me .
He 's so competitive and his frustration got so bad that he went out and took lessons .
His game improved a lot but I still beat him .
As Republicans controlled the House it was a monumental task to get legislation passed .
Barack could forge relations with others very well .
He was very even - keeled , even when bullied on the Senate floor .
It frustrated him , but he always kept his cool .
His demeanour was : ' I 'm going to explain this , I 'm not going to get into a fist fight about this . '
One of his biggest preoccupations was healthcare and he worked very hard with the Republicans to say : ' This is something advantageous to your party as well . '
When we took a majority in 2002 , he became chairman of public health , but he kept his relationships with the Republicans ; the last thing he was going to do was say : ' I 'm in charge and I forget you guys . '
The old chairman of public health used to have meetings in City Hall , but Barack would take the meetings out and about to the people .
I saw his daughters being born and I know his wife Michelle very well .
She is a very level - headed individual and she keeps Barack 's feet on the ground .
London 2008 : David Lammy
British MP and Minister of State for Higher Education ; friend of Obama 's since 2005 .
I first met him at Harvard at an event for black alumni from all over the world .
There was lots for us to talk about because we share similar heritage ; my family are from Guyana , half his family are from Kenya , we 're both black , we 're both politicians in western democracies ; but beyond law and politics there was lots of synergy .
What I found interesting about Obama is his reach beyond America .
He has an acute understanding of developing countries .
He is someone who I find it very easy to get along with .
He 's incredibly charming and funny .
He 's clearly got an obsession with ties because whenever he meets me he talks about the ties that British people wear .
I 'll be wearing something with loud colours , and in America they are a bit more straightforward , and he makes light of that .
He 'll go : ' Look at my tie compared to yours ! ' - this coming from one of the coolest men in the world !
There have been moments where he 's rung me up over the past few years , and he 's been sincere and very calm .
He 's not someone that gets into a flap or displays any anxiousness , even though sometimes those conversations have been in the heat of anxious situations .
I met him this February when he had just come out of Super Tuesday .
We were in Eau Claire , Wisconsin , very much rural America , and he gave a speech in the university .
He went down really well but what struck me was that , despite his hectic schedule , backstage he wanted to thank every local official : he spent a good 20 minutes with all of them .
He then started to walk me around , introducing me to them , and I was a bit ' I 'm not really terribly important ' , but he was determined that they should meet the Minister for Skills in the UK .
When I saw him I felt he'd been emboldened and strengthened by his experiences .
He always had charisma and a relaxed , personable style , but a few years later one can see his growth as a presidential candidate and a man .
We 've got a professional friendship ; we have n't been golfing together .
I do n't think he 's got enough time for that , and actually neither have I .
But his faith is very important to him , and that 's something I have had some affinity with and that we reflect on .
He has also lost both his parents , and he was very gracious when my mother died of ovarian cancer earlier this year ; he had lost his mother to the same illness .
Like all inquisitive , curious and interesting politicians , he is someone who can scan the horizons of many different issues and can find politics in cultural situations - the sadness of death , the experience of living in a developing country and what that means , or economic hardship in rural middle America .
He is someone who has a strong emotional intelligence as well as a strong cognitive intelligence .

Federal regulators seized Downey Savings & Loan and PFF Bank & Trust late Friday , saying hundreds of millions of dollars in bad loans from the housing bubble had rendered the Southern California banking fixtures unsound .
The banks ’ branches will continue operating as usual under the ownership of Minneapolis - based U.S. Bank , one of the country ’s largest banks , and no depositors will lose any money because of the failures , regulators said .
Newport Beach - based Downey lost $ 547.7 million in the first nine months of 2008 , largely because of risky “ option ARM ” mortgages -- adjustable - rate loans that let borrowers pay so little each month that their loan balances rose .
PFF , short for Pomona First Federal , specialized in loans to Inland Empire developers and home builders , running up $ 289.5 million in losses in the January - September period .

“ The closing of these two thrifts once again demonstrates the tremendous impact of the housing market distress on the state of California , ” John Reich , director of the Office of Thrift Supervision , said in a statement announcing the seizure of the institutions .
After seizing the banks , the agency handed them over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which immediately agreed to have U.S. Bank , a unit of US Bancorp , acquire virtually all their assets and assume all of their deposits .
US Bancorp agreed to shoulder the first $ 1.6 billion in losses on the two thrifts ’ loans .
The FDIC will be on the hook for losses after that , which it estimates will be $ 2.1 billion .
Of the $ 3.7 billion in total estimated losses , $ 2.9 billion is on Downey ’s loans and $ 800 million is on PFF’s .

The FDIC said it entertained other offers for the two thrifts .
But the agency determined US Bancorp ’s offer was the least costly to the federal deposit insurance fund , which is financed by premiums paid by banks and thrifts .
US Bancorp , which has largely escaped the mortgage losses plaguing many banks , said acquiring Downey and PFF was part of its strategy of expanding in the West , particularly in California , where it recently completed the acquisition of Mellon Business Bank in downtown Los Angeles .
Before the latest deals , U.S. Bank had 353 California branches , a modest number in contrast with the presence the bank maintains in downtown Los Angeles .
Its name appears on the former Library Tower on Fifth Street , the highest U.S. skyscraper west of the Mississippi .
The Downey and PFF branches brings U.S. Bank ’s California total to 561 branches , compared with more than 1,000 each for Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co .
Advertisement
The $ 2.1 - billion loss brings the deposit insurance fund ’s losses on failed banks to about $ 15 billion this year , said Arlington , Va. , bank consultant Bert Ely .
Ely said that amount could have been far lower if regulators had stepped in earlier to force the operators of big thrifts like Washington Mutual Inc. and Downey to find a buyer or clean up their acts before their loan problems became so severe .
“ It ’s really sad about Downey , ” Ely said .
“ It was a great institution with a great branch system and customer base , and it made it through all the bank troubles of the 1980s .
In the end , it was just like WaMu .
These problems are like a fresh - caught fish , not like a fine red wine -- they do n’t get better with age . ”
Downey Financial Corp. , parent of Downey Savings , was co-founded in 1957 by developer Maurice McAlister , a bass fisherman and nickelodeon collector who built shopping centers with Downey branches .
McAlister remained chairman until July , when Downey ’s woes were already apparent .

PFF was the oldest banking outfit based in Southern California , founded in Pomona in 1892 to serve towns in what was then the citrus belt .
Parent PFF Bancorp Inc. , based in Rancho Cucamonga , had hoped to sell itself to Oak Park , Ill. - based FBOP Corp. , which owns California National Bank and other community banks .
The seizures are likely to make permanent the disappearance of the stock market value of Downey Financial and PFF Bancorp .
Since the end of 2006 , when the mortgage meltdown began , Downey ’s shares have lost 99 % of their value .
PFF ’s stock is down 99.8 % .
Regulators allowed Downey and PFF to complete their business Friday before stepping in .
At Downey ’s headquarters , a group of 10 FDIC and US Bancorp officials strode into the lobby of pink granite and marble at 6:06 p.m. and took the elevator to the fifth - floor executive offices to begin the transition to new ownership .
Advertisement
Downey and PFF were the 21st and 22nd FDIC - insured institutions to fail this year .
No. 20 , a bank in Georgia , was seized earlier Friday .
Other collapses this year have included Pasadena ’s IndyMac Bank , the largest Southern California S&L ; , whose failure in July is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $ 8.7 billion .
The FDIC is operating IndyMac while seeking a buyer for it .
US Bancorp said it would modify home loans for struggling Downey borrowers using as a model an aggressive program the FDIC has adopted at IndyMac .
Downey and PFF ’s customers are better off than some of IndyMac ’s because all of their deposits were assumed by U.S. Bank .
IndyMac customers whose accounts were n’t fully insured have n’t gotten , and may never get , access to all of their money .

Before the announcement , Tim Stevenson , 54 , a retired construction contractor who was getting money from an ATM at Downey ’s Burbank branch , said he had considered moving his more than $ 80,000 at Downey to another bank .
“ I heard they were hurting , but what ’s happening to their stock is not something I wanted to hear , ” Stevenson said .
“ I thought they ’d cranked things back up . ”
Joe Schweitzer , 69 , a retired teacher and a longtime Downey customer in Sherman Oaks , said Friday afternoon that he had known the thrift was at risk of failing .
“ I heard that their stock was below $ 1 , that they had bad loans and that the government was n’t going to help them , ” he said .
“ But as long as my money ’s insured , I ’m not scared . ”
Advertisement
Still , when a certificate of deposit matured two weeks ago , he and his wife transferred the money to Citibank .
Schweitzer said he was frustrated to learn that Citibank ’s parent company , Citigroup Inc. , had its own problems .
Its stock plunged 60 % this week .
“ We moved the CD to Citibank , and now look at where they are in the stock market , ” he said .
“ They ’re where everyone ’s money is going to , but they ’re also in terrible shape .
It ’s like jumping from one hot potato to another . ”
Some Southern California banks whose stock prices have cratered continue to operate .
Advertisement
Temecula Valley Bank Chairman Stephen H. Wacknitz said Friday that Temecula was not in as dire a situation as PFF , Downey or Vineyard Bancorp in Corona .
All four banks have seen their stocks punished by investors worried about the banks ’ loan troubles .
Wacknitz said Temecula had stopped its high - risk lending on speculative buildings seven or eight months ago .
“ You show me a bank whose stock has n’t gone down , ” he said .
“ Look at Citigroup . ”

Off - label prescription of a drug is generally legal , but promotion of off - label uses by a drug manufacturer is illegal .
In an article in this week 's PLoS Medicine , two physician researchers describe the techniques that drug companies use to covertly promote off - label use , even when such promotion is illegal .
Adriane Fugh - Berman ( Georgetown University Medical Center , Washington DC ) and Douglas Melnick ( a preventive medicine physician working in North Hollywood , California ) argue that while off - label drug use is " sometimes unavoidable " and sometimes " demonstrably beneficial , " it has also been linked with serious side effects .
Off - label drug use , they say , " should be undertaken with care and caution due to the uncontrolled experiment to which a patient is being subjected " .
Nevertheless , drug companies have a stake in promoting such off - label use , say the authors , since increased off - label use means " larger revenues from larger user populations , especially for products with narrow indications " .
Based on Dr Melnick 's previous experience working in the pharmaceutical industry in medical affairs ( supporting drug marketing ) and both authors ' current contacts within the industry , they outline some of the ways that drug companies can promote such off - label use .
One example is known as the " decoy indication " .
In development , say the authors , drugs may be promising for several uses , and companies must choose one or two conditions on which to focus research .
Ease of approval is the most important factor in this decision .
If extensive off - label use is anticipated , a company may seek approval for just a narrow indication in order to speed a drug to market .
In other words , a drug may be approved for this very narrow " decoy indication " while an extensive off - label campaign is not disclosed to drug regulators .
Another technique is to use drug representatives , even though in the US drug reps are not supposed to detail doctors on off - label uses .
The authors quote an article in Medical Marketing and Media in which a pharmaceutical industry attorney says : " Before engaging in off - label promotion , companies should ascertain the risk profile , safety , efficacy , and potential commercial benefits of the use -- without committing that last bit to print " .
In other words , say Fugh - Berman and Melnick , illegal promotion may be cost - effective if potential profits trump potential fines .
Pharmaceutical marketing , they say , has " distorted the discourse on off - label uses and encouraged the unmonitored , potentially dangerous use of drugs by patients for whom risks and benefits are unknown . "
" Companies that engage in off - label promotion should be heavily fined and their future marketing practices subject to increased scrutiny by regulatory agencies . "

This is F.A. Hayek in 1975 on Meet the Press .
If you have never listened to a Mises.org podcast before , you must listen to this .
I heard this Friday and I ’ve been haunted by it ever since .
A number of points stand out to me .
1 ) Hayek is amazing here .
He holds the line .
He is patient and explains very well .
He refuses to relent .
The core of his message is rooted in the Austrian view of cycles , and this interview demonstrates that he never stepped away from it , despite some far - flung claims .
2 ) The line of questioning he endures is hilariously naive and idiotic .
We think we have a Keynesian problem now ; it ’s clear that these people really believe that policy makers can manipulate the economy like a machine , trading off unemployment for inflation and back again , with no trouble .
So they hit Hayek for his supposed personal opinion that unemployment is better than inflation , as if the trade off is direct and easy to manipulate .
How far we ’ve come !
3 . In light of the present crises , and the appalling ignorance of the present generation of policy makers of any historical understanding , it is so helpful to remember that we ’ve been down this road before , and done all the wrong things before .
Forget learning from history .
The present generation does even know enough history to learn anything from it .
So this interview really makes it clear what has come before .
Finally , all hail Professor Hayek .
He really did a wonderful service back then .
He has much to teach us 35 years later !

after
Michael Kimmel , a sociologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , recently released the results of his groundbreaking study in a book entitled .
Kimmel interviewed nearly 400 young men between 16 and 26 years of age , and over the course of 352 pages , he reveals a disturbing trend among the future of American manhood .
seeks to answer the contemporary questions , “ Why do so many guys seem stuck between adolescence and adulthood ?
Why do so many of them fail to launch ?
Just what is going on with America ’s young men ? ” Kimmel coined the term “ Guyland ” to describe “ the world in which young men live . ”
Guyland , according to Kimmel “ is both a stage of life , [ an ] … undefined time span between adolescence and adulthood that can often stretch for a decade or more , and a place … where guys gather to be guys with each other , unhassled by the demands of parents , girlfriends , jobs , kids , and the other nuisances of adult life .
In this topsy - turvy , Peter - Pan mindset , young men shirk the responsibilities of adulthood and remain fixated on the trappings of boyhood … ” ( Kimmel , [ New York , NY : Harper Row , 2008 ] , 6 ) .
Kimmel goes on , “ In college , they party hard but are soft on studying .
They slip through the academic cracks … getting by with little effort and less commitment .
After graduation , they drift aimlessly from one dead - end job to another , spend more time online playing video games and gambling than they do on dates … , ‘ hook up ’ occasionally with a ‘ friend with benefits , ’ go out with their buddies , drink too much , and save too little .
After college , they perpetuate that experience and move home or live in group apartments in major cities , with several other guys from their dorm or fraternity … .
They have grandiose visions for their futures and not a clue how to get from here to there .
” In other words , many young men are not growing up ; they ’re not leaving the narcissism of childhood for the responsibilities ( as well as opportunities ) of manhood .
They ’re unproductive and short of ambition ; they ’re hedonistic , shallow and vain , lacking any coherent sense of direction , purpose or meaning .
And this is not , according to Kimmel , the exception .
He writes , “ Guyland … has become a stage of life , a ‘ demographic , ’ that is now pretty much the norm . ”
( I would add the church is not countering this condition when it employs the same childish methods of amusement and entertainment to “ disciple ” our youth . )
Kimmel is not alone in his assessment .
Scholars at the National Research Council in 2002 “ estimated that at least one of every four adolescents in the U.S. ( male and female ) is at serious risk of not achieving productive adulthood ” ( Jacquelynne Eccles and Jennifer Appleton Gootman , National Research Council and Institute of Medicine [ eds . ] , [ Washington , DC : National Academies Press , 2002 ] ) .
Neither is this a uniquely American problem but a growing trend among many Western nations .
Both Britain and Australia are confronted with “ Laddism ” : Lads are simply Guys with British accents , consuming the same media , engaging in the same sorts of behaviors , and lubricating their activities with the same alcohol .
In Italy , they ’re called , or mama ’s boys .
In Italy “ a whopping 82 percent of men aged 18 –30 are still living at home with their parents ” ( Mark Penn , , [ New York , NY : Hachette Book Group , 2007 ] , 324 ) .
So severe is the economic impact that the Italian government is offering incentives for these mama ’s boys to move out and become productive !
In France , they ’re called “ Tanguys ” after the French film with the same title , which depicts their lifestyle .
Not coincidently , these countries have among the lowest birth rates — no marriage = fewer families , which means less children .
So what is essential to becoming an adult ?
Psychiatrically trained anthropologist David Gutmann summarizes the answer well when he writes , “ We can say that adulthood has been achieved when narcissism is transmuted ” ( David Gutmann , “ Adulthood and Its Discontents , ” Working paper 67 [ New York : Institute of American values , 1998 ] , 4 ) .
So what is it that most hinders the transmutation of narcissism among adult males ?
While there are a number of factors that combine to encourage childishness in young men , I would offer that one of the most compelling is the delay or absence of marriage .
Consider : in 1970 , 69 percent of 25 - year - old and 85 percent of 30 - year - old white men were married ; in 2000 , only 33 percent and 58 percent were , respectively .
And the percentage of young men entering marriage is declining .
Census Bureau data show that the median age of marriage among men rose from 26.8 in 2000 to 27.5 in 2006 — considered a dramatic demographic shift in only six years .
One writer observed , “ Not so long ago , the average mid-twenty something had achieved most of adulthood ’s milestones …
These days , he lingers … in a new hybrid state of semi- hormonal adolescence … ” ( Kay Hymowitz , “ Child - Man in the Promised Land , ” , Winter 2008 , vol. 18 , no .
1 ) . So what ?
According to David Meyers , professor of psychology at Hope College , “ Marriage domesticates men ” ( David G. Meyers , , [ New Haven , CT : Yale University Press , 2000 ] , 117 ) .
More specifically , “ once men are married , they are much less likely to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking heavily , drivingly dangerously , or using drugs .
They are also more likely to work regularly , help others more , volunteer more , and attend religious services more frequently ” ( Steven L. Nock , “ Marriage as a Public Issue , ” , Vol 15 No 2 , Fall 2005 , available at : www.futureofchildren.org).Sociologist Steven Nock adds , “ Others have made similar arguments about how marriage ‘ domesticates ’ men by fostering a sense of responsibility for their families , orienting them toward the future and making them sensitive to the long - term consequences of their actions … ”
Marriage is an essential element in the maturation of men and their future contributions to society .
What changed ?
According to a study by Rutgers University , the top reason given by men for their unwillingness to commit to marriage is “ they can get sex without marriage more easily than in times past ” ( Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and David Popenoe , “ The State of Our Unions , The Social Health of Marriage in America , 2002 , ” ( Rutgers , the State University of New Jersey ) .
Wow !
Apparently sexual immorality does adversely impact marriage ; in this case , it simply nullifies marriage .
What will the future hold where a majority of men refuse to take their place in society ?
What kind of future can we expect where men are disinclined to commit to the building of families much less the world in which they live ?
To young women : if you want men to grow up and become responsible , you must stop giving to men what they should only receivethey have committed their lives to you in marriage .
Lastly , if the church would begin to live this way , it would strengthen our culture ’s commitment to marriage more so than any legislation ever could . © 2008 by S.

This is incredible , totally incredible .
A vice presidential candidate is n't going to be available to the press for two weeks ?
Two weeks ?
In September .
We have this total unknown who could be president of the United States next January .
And she 's in hiding for two weeks .
Chris Matthews on this clip says that this is fine .
Has he lost his mind ?
She needs to be in front of the press now .
The United States and the world cannot have this total unknown foisted on the presidency without any serious vetting and without any press interaction .
This is absolutely third world .
Since when is the governor of a state given two weeks in hiding ?
The sexism that implies that someone cannot stand up to reporters because she is a woman is appalling .
This entire pick , of course , is incredibly sexist , and the handling of her in the last week the most sexist double standard I have ever seen in American politics .
Can you imagine Hillary Clinton saying she was n't going to answer questions for two weeks ?
Or Margaret Thatcher ?
Or Kay Bailey Hutchison ?
Or Elizabeth Dole ?
And none of these women were ever as close to global power as Sarah Palin now is .
This is getting to Manchurian Candidate levels of creepiness .
It 's deeply sinister and slightly terrifying .

In a test case which could have severe ramifications for free speech on the internet , a 35 year old man is being prosecuted under British obscenity laws for a story he allegedly wrote and published on the internet .
Darryn
Walker did not enter a plea and was sent for trial in March next year after the prosecution decided to charge him under the “ Obscene Publications Act 1959 ” .
This is the first prosecution for written material under this law since 1991 .
Walker allegedly wrote and published a story called Girls ( Scream ) Aloud – about pop group “ Girls Aloud ” – on the internet .
The story describes in detail the kidnap , rape , mutilation and murder of the band members and ends with the sale of various body parts on eBay .
The story was then published on the Usenet groups , in the “ alt.sex ” discussion groups , where it was seen by the Internet Watch Foundation , who alerted police .
The Obscene Publications
Act has had a bit of a hit - and - miss legal history .
It was used to try to get rid of “ Lady Chatterley ’s Lover ” ( we can see how THAT turned out ) and after that , every attempt to get rid of objectionable books using the OPA was subsequently shot down by appeals courts .
I heard at one point that the British Government was going to either get rid of the OPA or radically re-write it .
But obviously nothing has come of that yet .
But now we have this totally ridiculous prosecution for publishing a story on the internet .
Yes , the subject matter of the story is absolutely awful but nevertheless , everyone has a right to publish what they want online without being harassed or prosecuted .
If Walker is convicted , this will set a chilling precedent .
If acquitted , the right to free speech on the internet will be affirmed by the courts .
You know you ’ve done something right with broccoli when the person you made it for describes it to someone else the next day as “ better than biting into a steak . ”
Those were Craig ’s words and they were a marked change from the first words he uttered about the broccoli , before he bit in : “ You made broccoli for dinner ?
Broccoli and sweet potatoes ? ”
Then he did bite in and his eyes lit up .
“ Oh my God , ” he said .
“ This is the best broccoli I ’ve ever had in my life . ”
Later he said : “ If parents made this broccoli for their kids , kids would n’t hate broccoli .
They ’d beg for it . ”
So what did I do to the broccoli to make it taste so good ?
I ca n’t take any credit .
The credit goes to that formidable force in my foodie life ; namely , The Barefoot Contessa .
From the very beginning , when I used to go to book stores and copy recipes out of her books on little index cards that I kept in my pocket , Ina Garten ’s recipes have proved to be that perfect combination of simple yet sophisticated ; she maximizes flavors in ways that are both ingenious and incredibly replicable .
Anyone can do an Ina recipe yet when you taste the finished product , it does n’t taste that way ; it tastes like it was made by a pro .
I ’m going to have a hard time this week not posting all of the recipes from her new book , Back To Basics .
In the past few days alone , I ’ve made her roasted pears with blue cheese and walnuts ; her roasted sweet potato wedges ( which I wrote about in the previous post ) ; and from her “ Parties ! ” book , her butternut squash soup and her roasted pork loin .
As you can tell from these recipe titles , The Barefoot Contessa loves roasting .
Specifically , she loves roasting vegetables at a high temperature until they caramelize .
That ’s the basic premise of most of her vegetable recipes in most of her cookbooks and that ’s precisely what makes her broccoli recipe the best you ’ve ever had .
Normally , broccoli gets squishy when you cook it .
Not this broccoli ; it develops an amazing brown crust in spots .
Then you toss it with lemon juice , lemon zest , and Parmesan cheese and you ’re in heaven .
Seriously , this recipe is so easy I can recite it without looking at the book .
( Ok , I ’m lying , I ’m about to open the book just to double check … . )
You preheat the oven to 425 .
Take 4 to 5 pounds of broccoli ( I just got two large bunches ) , cut into florets ( but relatively big ones . )
Here ’s the key that she does n’t mention in the recipe : dry them THOROUGHLY .
That is , if you wash them .
I saw an episode of Julia Child cooking with Jacques Pepin once when Pepin revealed he does n’t wash a chicken before putting it in a hot oven : “ The heat kills all the germs , ” he said in his French accent .
“ If bacteria could survive that oven , it deserves to kill me . ”
By that logic , then , I did n’t wash my broccoli ; I wanted it to get crispy and brown .
If you ’re nervous , though , just wash and dry it obsessively .
Now , it ’s easy .
Put the broccoli on a cookie sheet .
Toss with olive oil , salt and pepper .
( She says 5 Tbs olive oil , 1 1 / 2 tsps kosher salt , 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper , but I just eyeballed it . )
Now add 4 garlic cloves that are peeled and sliced and toss them in too .
Roast in the oven 20 to 25 minutes , until “ crisp - tender and the tips of some of the florets are browned . ”
I shook the pan around a bit as it went , but not sure that ’s necessary .
When it ’s done , take it out of the oven–and here ’s where it gets really good–zest a lemon over the broccoli , squeeze the lemon juice over the broccoli , add 1.5
Tbs more olive oil , 3 Tbs toasted pine nuts ( I left those out ) , and 1/3 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese .
She also has you add 2
Tbs julienned fresh basil , but I left that out too .
You wo n’t miss it : the magic combo of the crispy broccoli , the garlic , the lemon and the cheese will make this the best broccoli of your life .
I guarantee it ; you will go ga - ga over it .
I ’m so ga - ga over it that I would seriously consider a trip right now to the store just so I could make this for lunch .
Broccoli for lunch ?
After trying this , you ’ll never want to eat anything else for breakfast , lunch or dinner ever again .
Print The Best Broccoli of Your Life Roasted broccoli so good that it tastes like steak .
Servings 4 people ( or 2 very hungry people )
Ingredients 4 to 5 pounds broccoli , cut into florets
5 Tbs olive oil , plus more for drizzling
1 1/2 tsps kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
4 cloves garlic , thinly sliced
1 lemon
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions Preheat the oven to 425 .
Wash and dry your broccoli very well ( optional : do n't wash the broccoli at all ... on the theory that the oven will kill any germs ) !
But do n't tell anyone I said that .
The point is you want it very dry .
Toss the broccoli well with the olive oil , the salt , pepper , and garlic .
Place on a cookie sheet and roast for 20 to 25 minutes , tossing every so often with a spatula , until the florets are golden brown and crispy .
Remove from the oven ; drizzle on some extra olive oil , lemon zest , lemon juice , and the Parmesan .
Serve right away .

LAS VEGAS ( AP ) 
The spokeswoman for the Republican Party in Nevada 's most populous county was removed from her post Saturday , after she said the Democratic Party made black people " dependent on the government . "
Didi Lima , the Clark County GOP communications director , also was removed from her volunteer role as a Hispanic community liaison for Republican John McCain 's presidential campaign over the remarks made earlier in the day while working at a McCain campaign booth .
" We do n't want ( Hispanics ) to become the new African - American community , " Lima told The Associated Press .
" And that 's what the Democratic Party is going to do to them , create more programs and give them handouts , food stamps and checks for this and checks for that .
We do n't want that . "
" I 'm very much afraid that the Democratic Party is going to do the same thing that they did with the African - American culture and make them all dependent on the government and we do n't want that , " she said .
In August , Lima was named co-chair of McCain 's Nevada Hispanic Leadership Team , which aimed to reach out to a crucial voting bloc in a state where polls show McCain in a dead heat with Barack Obama .
" Didi Lima is no longer a part of this campaign , her comments do n't reflect Senator McCain 's beliefs and are not tolerated on his campaign , " McCain spokesman Rick Gorka said after learning about her remarks .
Lima is the second Republican Party official to land in hot water this week over comments perceived as inflaming tensions between blacks and Hispanics .
The chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico 's most populous county resigned Thursday , nearly a week after saying " Hispanics consider themselves above blacks " and wo n't vote for Obama .
Fernando C de Baca had been urged to resign for days by members of his own party .
Clark County Republican Party Chairman Bernie Zadrowski said he was " appalled " by Lima 's remarks .
Lima was appointed party spokeswoman in late July .
" She was speaking for herself , not the Clark County Republican Party , " Zadrowski said .
" And she wo n't be speaking for the Clark County Republican Party anymore . "
Obama campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Searer said the remarks were " proof of how out of touch John McCain and Republicans are with the issues facing all Americans today . "

The MIT Energy Initiative has doled its second round of seed funding — $ 1.7 million in grants in total — to 17 separate projects .
The initiative , which was established in September 2006 and first proposed during MIT President Susan Hockfield ’s inauguration in May 2005 , aims to tackle the challenges of energy and the environment .
A broad goal , sure , but we like the idea that funding basic scientific research is the best way to get good ideas out of the laboratory and onto the market .
Thermoelectrics was the most prevalent area of research , with four different projects that focused on developing materials and systems to turn heat energy directly into electricity .
The hope for some of the projects is that super - efficient thermoelectric materials could replace the dirty and dangerous kerosene and wood - burning lamps and stoves used all over the developing world .
A proposed solar - powered , thermoelectric stove is pictured below .
Smart grid and energy management solutions were also popular themes , including policy elements , which are often barriers in regulated markets .
Meanwhile , although oil prices have come down , the technology of drilling for deep - sea petroleum also got some attention and money , although that type of drilling can also be used to further geothermal development .

President Mwai Kibaki signed the agreement on behalf of Kenya
The leaders of three African trading blocs on Wednesday agreed to create a free trade zone of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated $ 624bn ( £ 382.9bn ) .
It is hoped the deal will ease access to markets within the region and end problems arising from the fact several countries belong to multiple groups .
The deal also aims to strengthen the bloc 's bargaining power when negotiating international deals .
Analysts say the agreement will help intra-regional trade and boost growth .
The three blocs which struck the deal were the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the East African Community ( EAC ) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( Comesa ) .
" The greatest enemy of Africa , the greatest source of weakness has been disunity and a low level of political and economic integration , " said Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at a meeting with the heads of state who chair the three trade blocs .
The agreement will also lend its backing to joint infrastructure and energy projects in the zone .
Redressing imbalance
Six heads of state from 26 countries in Comesa , SADC and the EAC attended the meeting in the Ugandan capital , Kampala , to sign the agreement .
Many of the leaders and representatives consider the new pact a way of giving Africa a greater voice on the world stage .
" By coming together , the member states will have a strong voice in advancing our interests on the international scene , " said South African President Kgalema Motlanthe .
Meanwhile , President Museveni said that it was a step in the right direction for a continent that suffered unfairly when it came to global trade .
President Motlanthe also called for developing countries to have positions within global institutions .
" " While Africa and other developing countries had marginal influence over the decisions that have brought the international finance systems to the brink of collapse , unjustifiably , African countries will bear the brunt , " he said .
" Development countries must be included in the governance of all international financing institutions to mitigate adverse effects on them , " Mr Motlanthe added .
Groupings
The three blocs are already well - established in their own right but cover varying swathes of land and numbers of people .
The SADC was first established as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference in 1980 in order to reduce independence on apartheid South Africa .
It was reincarnated as the SADC in 1992 .
It covers a population of some 248 million people and a zone whose cumulative GDP is $ 379bn in 2006 .
The SADC 's members include South Africa , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
Comesa was established in 1994 and replaced the Preferential Trade Area .
It includes 398 million people and the area has a combined GDP of $ 286.7bn in 2006 .
Among its members are Zimbabwe , Zambia , Uganda and Sudan .
EAC is the smallest of the group in terms of GDP , and had a GDP of $ 46.6 bn in 2006 .
Set up in 1967 , disagreements between founding members Uganda , Kenya and Tanzania led to its collapse .
A treaty was signed for its re-establishment in 1999 and the new EAC was formed in 2000 .

One subject that features in the article is soil restoration , including a look at " terra preta " - rich , fertile artificial soils found in the Amazon .
In this post I 'll have a look at modern day techniques to produce terra preta ( often called biochar or agrichar ) which have the potential to increase soil fertility , generate energy and sequester carbon all at the same time .
Journalists sometimes describe unsexy subjects as MEGO : My eyes glaze over .
Alas , soil degradation is the essence of MEGO .
The article uses an acronym I 've never come across before to describe the problem faced by those trying to draw attention to the issue : MEGO ( My Eyes Glaze Over ) - a phenomenon which should be familiar to anyone who has ever talked about peak oil , global warming or any of the other " limits to growth " .
This month 's edition of National Geographic has a feature article on " Soil " , which looks at the steady degradation of agricultural land and the problem this poses in world where the population is heading for 9 + billion people - effectively calling attention to the " peak dirt " problem ( however soil is renewable , so any " peak " should be able to be reversed if sufficient time and effort is put into doing so ) .
The History Of Terra Preta
Terra Preta ( " black earth " ) was discovered by Dutch soil scientist Wim Sombroek in the 1950's , when he discovered pockets of rich , fertile soil amidst the Amazon rainforest ( otherwise known for its poor , thin soils ) , which he documented in a 1966 book " Amazon Soils " .
Similar pockets have since been found in other sites in Ecuador and Peru , and also in Western Africa ( Benin and Liberia ) and the Savannas of South Africa .
Carbon dating has shown them to date back between 1,780 and 2,260 years .
Terra preta is found only where people lived - it is an artificial , human - made soil , which originated before the arrival of Europeans in South America .
The soil is rich in minerals including phosphorus , calcium , zinc , and manganese - however its most important ingredient is charcoal , the source of terra preta 's color .
It is n't entirely clear if the Amazon Indians whose old settlements terra preta is found at deliberately created the soils or if they were an accidental by - product of " slash and smoulder " farming techniques , though the emerging consensus seems to be that the Indians deliberately created the material , with some early European accounts in the area noting the practice still being performed .
The key ingredient is apparently the activated carbon in the charcoal .
Activated carbon has a complex , spongelike molecular structure - a single gram can have a surface area of 500 to 1,500 square meters ( or about the equivalent of one to three basketball courts ) .
Having this material in the soil has several beneficial effects , including a 20 % increase in water retention , increased mineral retention , increased mineral availability to plant roots , and increased microbial activity .
It has also been shown to be particularly beneficial to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi , which form a symbiotic relationship with plant root fibers , allowing for greater nutrient uptake by plants .
There is speculation that the mycorrhizal fungi may play a part in terra preta ’s ability to seemingly regenerate itself .
Pyrolysis and Eprida
Modern day producers of biochar ( agrichar ) take dry biomass and bake it in a kiln to produce charcoal .
Biochar is the term for what is left over after the energy is removed : a charcoal - based soil amendment - this process is called pyrolysis .
Various gases and oils are driven off the material during the process and then used to generate energy .
The charcoal is buried in the ground , sequestering the carbon that the growing plants had pulled out of the atmosphere .
The end result is increased soil fertility and an energy source with negative carbon emissions .
Eprida is a company founded by Danny Day , which is attempting to commercialise the idea by building systems that turn farm waste into hydrogen , biofuel , and biochar ( see here for a short movie explaining their process ) .
The Eprida technology uses agricultural waste biomass to produce hydrogen - rich bio-fuels and a new restorative high - carbon fertilizer ( ECOSS ) ...
In tropical or depleted soils ECOSS fertilizer sustainably improves soil fertility , water holding and plant yield far beyond what is possible with nitrogen fertilizers alone .
The hydrogen produced from biomass can be used to make ethanol , or a Fischer - Troupsch gas - to - liquids diesel ( BTL diesel ) , as well as the ammonia used to enrich the carbon to make ECOSS fertilizer .
We do n't maximize for hydrogen ; we do n't maximize for biodisel ; we do n't maximize for char ...
By being a little bit inefficient in each , we approximate nature and get a completely efficient cycle .
The potential power of biochar lies in this closed loop production process , where agricultural practices involving biochar production see increasing returns of crop yields , energy and soil fertility over time .
Biochar also has potential to address problems such as waste disposal and rural development .
A significant proportion of the world 's population relies on charcoal as a cooking fuel , the production of which drives deforestation in Africa and other places .
Replacing traditional charcoal kilns with modern pyrolysis units could reduce the demand for wood from forests by increasing the efficiency of energy production and adding the ability to use any source of biomass , including agricultural waste products .
This would also help to reduce respiratory diseases in the developing world , particularly amongst children .
There has also been speculation that pyrolysis could be a useful technique for dealing with the huge swathes of Canadian forests that have been killed by pine beetles recently .
Some industry participants believe that energy , rather than agriculture , will be the key driver for adopting biomass pyrolysis .
Desmond Radlein of Dynamotive Energy Systems has been quoted as saying " It is wishful thinking that people will switch to renewable fuels unless it is cheaper .
All of this is tied to the price of oil ; as it goes up , many more things are possible . "
Another company active in the pyrolysis sector is Best Energies .
Technical Manager Adriana Downey recently had an interview with Beyond Zero Emissions , talking about some of the pilot programs they have been running and plans to build the first fully commercial scale pyrolysis plant in Australia .
Lukas 's program with the NSW DPI ( Department of Primary Industries ) in Northern NSW have basically taken some of the agrichar material that we 've made here at Best Energies and they 've been trialling that material in different agronomic applications to see how the agrichar , when its applied , can help crop-productivity and improve the sustainability of agriculture as well as , and what you guys are more interested in , sequester carbon long - term in soils and also decrease the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide emissions from soil .
...
The agrichar when it 's applied to the soil has a good effect on the general physical structure of the soil .
Because the agrichar has a really high surface area , it means that there 's lots of pores in the soil which can then retain moisture and act as little reservoirs for the water to be retained in the soil .
As well as this , all of the surface area helps to bind nutrients in the soil and also provides a microhabitat for micro organisms in the soil which are essential for the natural processes in the soil which allow micro organisms to flourish .
Carbon Capture Potential
There is a large difference between terra preta and ordinary soils - a hectare of meter - deep terra preta can contain 250 tonnes of carbon , as opposed to 100 tonnes in unimproved soils from similar parent material , according to Bruno Glaser , of the University of Bayreuth , Germany .
The difference in the carbon between these soils matches all of the carbon contained in the vegetation on top of them .
The ABC's " Catalyst " program last year had a feature on " Agrichar – A solution to global warming ? " ( shown below ) in the lead up to an international biochar conference in Terrigal , NSW , which included Tim Flannery talking about the potential for sequestering gigatonnes of carbon in the soil .
This year 's International Biochar Initiative conference has just been held in Newcastle - upon - Tyne in the UK .
It is not yet clear what the limits are to how much biochar can be added to the soils using these techniques , however some fairly extravagant claims about biochar 's capacity to capture carbon have been made .
Soil scientist and author of " Amazonian Dark Earths : Origin , Properties , Management " Johannes Lehmann believes that a strategy combining biochar with biofuels could ultimately offset 9.5 billion tons of carbon per year - an amount equal to the total current fossil fuel emissions .
Lehmann also notes that unlike biodiesel and corn ethanol , biochar does n’t take land away from food production .
If true , this would be an interesting form of geoengineering to try and reverse the effects of global warming ( and one far less risky than some of the alternatives proposed ) but I would still question our ability to turn all the world 's oil , coal and gas reserves back into rich soil via burn - atmosphere - pyrolysis loop .
Criticisms
A number of criticisms have been made about biochar .
These include :
* The technology to implement the process is still immature .
* Scientists do n’t know how much charcoal farmers should use , how they should apply it , or which feedstocks work best .
* Farmers are reluctant to spread unproven products on their fields , so the few companies manufacturing biochar have struggled to find buyers .
* Charcoal production can generate toxic waste if performed incorrectly .
* The energy needed to produce , transport , and bury biochar could outweigh the carbon savings .
* Some analysts say the economics of the process will not be acceptable until carbon markets are established , allowing farmers to earn carbon credits for applying biochar to their fields .
* Some environmental activists claim that applying the process on a large scale would result in further rainforest clearing which would actually degrade soil quality and increase global warming .
Rhizome In The Amazon
Jeff Vail recently had a post on a " Rhizome Template in the Amazon ? " , which looked at a paper by Mark Heckenberger suggesting that a dense civilization of networked villages once existed in the Amazon , which Jeff noted was interesting because it " appears to show a form of organization that permits density without significant hierarchy " .
The paper shows that the Xingu region of the Amazon was once populated by a grid - like pattern or villages , each connected by a precisely aligned network of roadways ( the Xingu river is the Amazon 's second longest tributary , with the region currently experiencing tension over plans to dam the river ) .
Here 's an alternate mode of organization - - a networked " grid , " " lattice , " or " peer - to - peer " structure of small , minimally self - sufficient villages , or " rhizome " as proposed in my article The Hamlet Economy .
The Xingu settlement structure seems to consicously model itself in the latter pattern .
Heckenberger even notes that each village was surrounded by a buffer zone of " managed parkland , " exactly the kind of fall - back , resiliency - enhancing production zone that I recommended for rhizome .
Here 's a link to a satellite image of one section fo Xingu settlement .
Did this Xingu civilization really develop a dense , ecologically sustainable civilization without hierarchal structure ?
Or did they simply find a new way to impose hierarchy without developing the signatures of " central places " ?
Was this a conscious reaction to prior abuses of hierarchy , or simply an expedient to survival in the dense forrests and poor agricultural soils of the Amazon ?
We do n't know the answers to these questions at this time , but the research of Heckenberger and his colleagues suggests that there is still a great deal for us to learn from the past about how we can best live in the future
Heckenberger also examined the terra preta pockets in the region , which is described briefly in an interesting article by Charles Mann in The Atlantic Monthly called " 1491 " .
Scientific American also notes the correlation between the lost cities of the Amazon and terra preta in " Ancient Amazon Actually Highly Urbanized " , as does The Vermont Quarterly in " Pay Dirt " .
Terra preta , Woods guesses , covers at least 10 percent of Amazonia , an area the size of France .
It has amazing properties , he says .
Tropical rain does n't leach nutrients from terra preta fields ; instead the soil , so to speak , fights back .
Not far from Painted Rock Cave is a 300 - acre area with a two - foot layer of terra preta quarried by locals for potting soil .
The bottom third of the layer is never removed , workers there explain , because over time it will re-create the original soil layer in its initial thickness .
The reason , scientists suspect , is that terra preta is generated by a special suite of microorganisms that resists depletion .
" Apparently , " Woods and the Wisconsin geographer Joseph M. McCann argued in a presentation last summer , " at some threshold level ... dark earth attains the capacity to perpetuate — even regenerate itself — thus behaving more like a living ' super ' - organism than an inert material . "
In as yet unpublished research the archaeologists Eduardo Neves , of the University of São Paulo ; Michael Heckenberger , of the University of Florida ; and their colleagues examined terra preta in the upper Xingu , a huge southern tributary of the Amazon .
Not all Xingu cultures left behind this living earth , they discovered .
But the ones that did generated it rapidly — suggesting to Woods that terra preta was created deliberately .
In a process reminiscent of dropping microorganism - rich starter into plain dough to create sourdough bread , Amazonian peoples , he believes , inoculated bad soil with a transforming bacterial charge .
Not every group of Indians there did this , but quite a few did , and over an extended period of time .
When Woods told me this , I was so amazed that I almost dropped the phone .
I ceased to be articulate for a moment and said things like " wow " and " gosh . "
Woods chuckled at my reaction , probably because he understood what was passing through my mind .
Faced with an ecological problem , I was thinking , the Indians fixed it .
They were in the process of terraforming the Amazon when Columbus showed up and ruined everything .
Scientists should study the microorganisms in terra preta , Woods told me , to find out how they work .
If that could be learned , maybe some version of Amazonian dark earth could be used to improve the vast expanses of bad soil that cripple agriculture in Africa — a final gift from the people who brought us tomatoes , corn , and the immense grasslands of the Great Plains .
All in all I think biochar is worth exploring further in some depth .

President - elect Barack Obama made history on Tuesday , said John Dickerson in Slate , but “ so did his strategists . ”
Team Obama designed and relentlessly executed a plan that carried him through a “ brutal primary and general election ” and pulled in “ a host of new voters . ”
Obama out - organized , outspent , and “ out - hustled ” John McCain in key states like Ohio , where he won over working - class whites .
He beat McCain among women by 14 points .
Obama also won a formidable , modern " multiracial coalition ” that should make Republicans nervous , said Ben Smith and Jonathan Martin in Politico , including urban and suburban Hispanics , Jews , African Americans , and young whites .
That said , racism “ turned out to be a footnote . ”
Obama ’s use of cutting - edge technology also swamped McCain .
“ Any presidential victory is partly personal , ” too , said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial , and McCain could n’t match “ Obama ’s rhetorical skills and unique appeal . ”
Of course those skills allowed him to “ disguise the details of what was the most left - of - center Democratic agenda since the early 1970s . ”
He enacts that agenda at his peril .
Yes , Obama ’s “ ability to adapt to circumstances and make everything sound moderate and reasonable ” helped him , said Philip Klein in The American Spectator , but many Republicans still blame McCain for blowing the election .
That ’s unfair .
He made some serious blunders , but voters blame Bush and the GOP for the economy , and “ no Republican could have won under these conditions . ”
DOES playing computer games boost your brainpower ?
Not necessarily , seems to be the answer .
Walter Boot and colleagues at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , found that non-gamers showed no improvement in memory skills or the ability to multitask after spending more than 20 hours on one of three video games .
This appears to contradict previous studies which detected superior mental aptitudes among habitual gamers .
The researchers suggest that , while a few hours playing an action game could improve your concentration , that ’s not enough for other cognitive skills .
“ Perhaps individuals with superior abilities are more likely to choose video gaming as …
Stranded Galveston residents call in vain for help Stranded Galveston residents call in vain for rescues
Nearly 510,000 customers without electricity in Houston area
As Hurricane Ike pushed a swelling surge onto Galveston Island tonight , many Galveston residents who ignored a mandatory evacuation order phoned for rescues to no avail because emergency workers were called off the streets , officials said .
Help was n't expected until after dangerous storm conditions subsided .
" We do n't know what we 're going to find tomorrow , " said the city 's mayor , Lyda Ann Thomas .
" We hope we 'll find that the people who did n't leave here are alive and well . "
City Manager Steve LeBlanc went so far as to ask the media not to photograph " certain things " in the aftermath , referring to the possibility of dead bodies .
Power was out all across the island , much of which already had flooded .
Two house fires are burning , as did a boat warehouse that was widely photographed earlier today .
Power lines are down , he said , and it may be weeks before it can be restored .
Assessment teams will get out Saturday morning after the storm .
Fifty people were rescued from high water and about 260 are in a shelter at Ball High School .
LeBlanc said he did n't know how long it would take before evacuated residents could return .
The city may briefly allow them back in to check on their homes , but will then ask them to leave again until the city is safe .
" We feel the city of Galveston will have suffered from this storm , " she said .
Power outages extended across the Houston area , well beyond the coast but mainly south of Interstate 10 as of 11 p.m. , CenterPoint Energy spokesman Floyd LeBlanc said .
At least 510,000 customers were without electricity , with outages ranging as far northwest as Jersey Village and northeast as Humble .
Entergy Texas , which services communities to the east of Houston , had about 29,300 customers without power at 9 p.m. Friday night , according to spokeswoman Debi Derrick .
The company said it would be the last update until Saturday morning .
Galveston ordered an 8 p.m. curfew because 40 percent of the city 's 58,000 residents ignored calls to evacuate .
The curfew ends at 5 a.m. Saturday but will continue along the same schedule for Galveston and Pelican Island through Monday morning .
" We 're going to make sure these homes are safe when they return , " said Thomas , the mayor .
Earlier today , LeBlanc expressed dismay that so much of the city 's population remained behind to ride out the storm .
'' It 's unfortunate that the warning we sent out — the mayor 's mandatory evacuation — was not heeded , '' he said .
By comparison , nearly 100 percent of Galveston left the island during Hurricane Rita , just three years ago .
Galveston Island was the site of the nation 's deadliest natural disaster the hurricane of 1900 , which claimed at least 6,000 lives .
In Harris County , a curfew started at 7 p.m. and is in place until 6 a.m. for the areas covered by the mandatory evacuation .
The Harris County curfew will be for Friday and Saturday night , for the nine evacuated ZIP codes only .
Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt and Harris County Sheriff Tommy
Thomas said they would be strictly enforcing those curfews to protect evacuees ' homes .
By 10 p.m. today , the massive Ike loomed about 55 miles southeast of Galveston with maximum Category 2 winds of 110 mph .
It 's moving west and northwest at 13 mph .
Weather forecasters predict
Ike may grow into a weak Category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. Saturday .
Ike 's massive size is expected to bring a storm surge of at least 25 feet at landfall .
The anticipated surge prompted Michael Chertoff , secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , to remark : " This is pretty much a worst - case scenario for flooding the Gulf Coast area . "
FEMA anticipates about 100,000 homes will be flooded and as many as several million people could be without power .
'' It is a potentially catastrophic hurricane , '' Chertoff said .
'' We will move as swiftly as possible to relieve suffering . ''
The Harris County Flood Control District is tracking surge - related flooding along and around Clear Lake and on low - lying areas on the Houston Ship Channel , the San Jacinto River and San Jacinto River tributaries , meteorologist Jeff Lindner said .
The bank is nearly full on Clear Creek east of Bay Area Boulevard and on Greens Bayou south of Interstate 10 , he said .
The bank is half full on Brays Bayou at Lawndale and Eastward and one - third full on the lower end of Little Vince Bayou , he said .
The flooding is entirely related to the storm surge , rather than rainfall , Lindner said .
The county 's natural elevation will allow all rainwater to drain from the upper end of the watersheds to the lower end , he added .
" We really do n't want people to be overly concerned about traditional bayou flooding , " County Judge Ed Emmett said .
" The rain wo n't necessarily cause those bayous to go out of their banks . "
Several hundred people on the Bolivar Peninsula ignored the call to evacuate forcing Coast Guard helicopter crews to rescue 45 people trapped on the peninsula .
Others were rescued by other agencies , Chertoff said .
Helicopters were to be grounded when hurricane winds picked up , he said .
And once it hits , thousands of people will be without power and food , said FEMA Administrator David Paulison .
Emergency personnel have shipped in 2.5 million MREs ( meals ready to eat ) in Texas , and another 3 million will be brought in , he said .
The Red Cross expects to feed 500,000 people .
Ike , when its core was still 135 miles at sea , indirectly claimed its first victim today when a 10 - year - old Montgomery boy was killed by a falling branch as his parents cut down a tree .
Montgomery County authorities , who declined to immediately identify the victim , said the boy was killed about 9 a.m. as his parents cut down the tree , apparently in preparation for the coming storm .
The boy was dead on arrival at Tomball Regional Medical Center .
A 19 - year - old Corpus Christi man was presumed drowned after storm surge from Hurricane Ike swept him from a jetty , Corpus Christi Police Chief Bryan Smith said .
Flooding and rescues were numerous throughout the region as authorities in multiple counties renewed their pleas for residents to flee to higher ground .
At High Island , a community in far eastern Galveston County near the Chambers County line , emergency workers used an Army surplus personnel carrier to help rescue dozens of people stranded in high water along Texas 124 .
" These people had ignored the evacuation order , " said Ryan Holzaepfel , Chambers County 's emergency management .
" Some were hanging from telephone poles , searching for any high ground they could find . "
He said workers helped evacuate 33 people , who then were bused to a shelter in Canton , in northeast Texas .
The High Island residents told their rescuers they had gone through previous storms and believed they would be safe there until the water began rising quickly today .
" Cars were submerged .
They were wading in it , feeling trapped .
They called and wanted help to get out of there , " said Holzaepfel .
By early afternoon , the police chief in the small Brazoria County town of Surfside Beach said the entire island was covered by rushing water , chest - deep in some places .
Also this afternoon , the Coast Guard and the Army aborted a rescue mission to save the 22 crew members on a Cypriot freighter that had lost power in towering swells 90 miles off Galveston 's coast .
The ship , loaded with petroleum coke floated helplessly as Hurricane Ike approached .
New Orleans - based Petty Officer Jaclyn
Young said the two helicopters and three other aircraft that had been sent could not safely rescue the crew .
The Coast Guard will not be able to approach until the storm has passed .
'' We will talk to them hourly and they have electricity and no injuries , " Young said .
" They have an emergency beacon to put on if they get in distress . ''
Tilman Fertitta , a Galveston native and CEO of Landry 's Restaurants , recalled the damage from Hurricane Alicia in 1983 — the last big hurricane to rip the region — and other storms before it .
'' This is the longest period we 've gone for some time without a major storm , and when you go that long , you know you 're going to get it , '' he said .
'' Sometimes , after things like this happen , you build back and it's better for the economy .
It will be interesting to see , but this surge is not going to put us out of business in Galveston . ''

That ’s crazy to admit something like that :
This week , Republican Presidential candidate John McCain will come to Wisconsin to push for his candidacy .
Four years ago , he made a comment to a reporter that some people might not think would be so welcoming around here .
Reporter Mark Leibovich , now of the New York Times , heard him say that , as Leibovich put it in his 2004 article in the Washington Post , “ He would hate to live in Milwaukee . ”
“ It was pretty random , ” Leibovich tells Newsradio 620 WTMJ ’s “ Wisconsin ’s Morning News . ”

1 . We are here at Ruby Fringe , Toronto .
Who are you ?
I am Tom Preston - Werner .
I work at Power Set and Github .
Power
Set is what we call natural language search or semantic search .
It 's trying to do search a little more intelligently .
Your Google searches all keyword baTse so you type in something like Ruby Fringe Toronto and then you get a page that would come up and say you 'd have a list of things and they would somehow relate .
At Power
Set we would say you 'd have a more specific question say .
In the GUI you type that in and try to find a page , for PowerSet we wanted to be more like " When is Ruby Fringe ? " and you just say that and it would try to find words on the pages that would say something grammatically like " Ruby Fringe is held in Toronto on July second " , or whatever the date , I do n't even know what date it is .
It would say something like that .
It would take meaning from the sentences ; extract meaning out of those sentences .
We do grammatical parsing of web pages and we also grammatically parse the query as it comes in , we index that semantic understanding of the pages , and then try to match the query to those .
So it 's a more intelligent search with deeper knowledge of the content of the page .
2 . What content sources do you index ?
Do you index the web or specific to special sources ?
Sure , so right now it 's Wikipedia only .
We start with the Wikipedia corpus because it 's relatively small compared to the entire web , so it is a manageable piece to begin with .
We also do it because it 's a little more structured , and we start with something that is a little bit easier than all the really crappy grammar on the web .
And by doing this we can refine the algorithms to a point where they work on decent text .
Not have to worry about spam or really obnoxious grammar or some of the really difficult extractions , like text extraction kind of things .
We leave those for later we say we are going to get this problem solved , this piece of the puzzle which is the really hard grammatical parsing , figuring out what the index looks like , figuring out how to query that , how to do the parsing or the grammars and the incoming query .
We do these things right now on a smaller nicer corpus like Wikipedia .
And then we branch out to things like New York Times , like Web MD , other sources of really good knowledge , figure those out and just keep expending and eventually go web scale .
That 's the dream , that 's the goal .
3 . What technology is Power Set built on ?
We use a lot of different stuff , we use a lot of Ruby , we use Ruby almost entirely for internal tools , anything that people are going to use in the company for our relevance testing , things like that , that 's what I work on .
We use Ruby because it 's a very productive language , we have a lot of good Ruby knowledge there are some really excellent Ruby programmers .
As well in the company we use C , C++ , for some of the runtime that needs to be super super fast , we have an Erlang project that handles incoming queries , from the first part of the runtime , and handles taking them in and routing them to where they need to go .
That 's the Fuzed project that I also work on , as well as some Python for the build system , JavaScript and HTML , CSS obviously .
We try to choose languages that are appropriate , we do n't say " No we ca n't use this specific language at all " we say " Is that language appropriate to be used for a specific domain ?
And if it is and it makes us more efficient then we 'll do it " .
So all of it applies .
4 . You open sourced Fuzed on GitHub I think .
Yep .
That 's correct .
So Fuzed is an Erlang project which takes incoming requests , figures out where they need to go , and sends them there .
And the way that these backend things are configured you can have , like let 's way we have multiple indexes at Power Set .
We have different indexes , different build of the index .
And we have different versions of software that run on top of that to perform those index searches .
When we do testing we need to run tests on say two consecutive indexes , to be able to then do relevance testing and figure out did that feature that we think we fixed , is that actually better now ?
Better language feature ?
Is that , did we fixed that for real ?
We have multiple versions of the software and with Fuzed we can attach both of those versions up to a single thing so we have homogenous pools of resources that are the same within a pool .
But then inside Fuzed it 's a heterogeneous mixture of all of these things .
And by displaying what the versions are and what API that they support is , incoming requests that come in as JSON can contain a little snippet of JSON that says " I want to use software x at version y and here is the RPC call , here is the RPC to do " .
And it 's just a big routing machine and at the same time it allows these resources to come in dynamically .
You do n't have to change any config file or anything they will just say , they connect to the master and say " Here is who I am and here is what I offer " .
And then you are done .
So now they join into a pool , Fuzed figures out what pool they belong in , make sure all the things in the same pool are the same configurations and they become immediately available so we were able to ...
PowerSet was kind enough to be able to allow us to open source that .
And so it is up on Github now .
It 's Fuzed , and if you do a search for that on Github you 'll find some repositories .
The root is actually Kirin Dave , he is the other guy at Powerset that works with me .
So you can find it there .
5 . If you could name a project or product that is similar to Fuzed ?
How could you put it in relation to existing products or projects ?
Something similar , well there is really not a whole lot .
I mean one of the primary reasons for creating it was that there was n't anything that really served that need that we had .
I mean you can come up with something that is based on Apache and Nginx I guess there is a Ruby project .
How was it called ?
I can't remember what it is called but it basically allows you to do a dynamic join of Mongrels into a cluster so it handles that being able to have just a bunch of mongrel servers running on various machines .
And you can add them dynamically and they will join right up .
But it was very specific to that scenario , it was written in Ruby .
And it was only for that I do n't think it was very extensible but what we needed was something different we needed for just generic JSON calls .
And at same time we were able to make it more generic as open sourced so that it could run Rails as well .
And it does that by just having Ruby instances that have Rails in them that are running behind a Rack handler .
And then those connect up to the master and say " Here is who I am , where I am " and then they become part of it so ...
Oh , it is called Swiftiply .
So that is sort of similar but it is difficult to do this , not a whole lot of systems that are designed to do this .
6. So at Power Set what parts are written in Ruby ?
Can you talk about that ?
Sure .
The front end website runs Merb , and that is Ruby , Fuzed is written in Erlang but the things behind it , the things that it talks to , the resources , a lot of those are written in Ruby .
There is one piece that we internally call a power mouse and if you go to a website that is called Factz , with a z , that 's written in Ruby .
We have some other things like there is a Lexicon server that takes in words and then does lexical expansion on them , to say " Well a cat , maybe he meant a feline or a variety of cat like a tabby " it will do this kinds of things , Power Set can take those words and do broader searches on them to try and figure out " You typed in that but you might have meant this other thing which is basically equivalent " .
That is written in Ruby right now .
A lot of the internal tools are Ruby .
Anything that glues two pieces together like let 's say we have some C things over here and then some Erlang thing over here for instance , we use Ruby a lot as the go between .
So a lot of script writing , we have a lot of scripts that are Ruby based .
So we use it all over the place .
We use it wherever performance is n't super critical and where we need something done expediently development - wise .
That 's the sweet spot that we have for Ruby .
7 . So you mostly use MRI , do you use JRuby or other projects ?
We use only MRI right now , we are on 1.8.5 I believe .
We have to be sure that any of the upgrades are n't going to break anything throughout all the hundreds of servers that we have .
And so we are on 1.8.5 because the bugs that were in 1.86 at the time when it was started , we are looking at upgrading to 1.8.6 right now I believe and possibly even 1.8.7 but the whole patch debacle sort of made that a little unfortunate .
So we have to be very careful about upgrading , but we are only on MRI I do n't think we use JRuby for anything .
But we do really want to use Rubinius and so some of the employees at PowerSet had a chance to work on Rubinius and contribute back to that during work hours because we really see that as the future of the Ruby VM .
Once we get that on the VM and make it fast , and have really short start up times and whatnot that 's going to be really awesome so we are trying to put some resources behind that effort so we would love to use Rubinius but we 're on MRI right now .
8 . So at the time of this interview there is a new development in the corporate structure of PowerSet , the ownership .
We were several weeks ago acquired by Microsoft and that 's kind of a big change for us , we have been going through a lot of meetings with Microsoft , it 's specifically the LiveSearch team that would be working with .
And it 's actually been really great to meet with those guys , really smart guys over there .
And I did n't know what to think at first , those guys coming in , but it 's really been eye opening to interact with Microsoft employees at that level .
And yes , they really kind of blew me away with the knowledge that they have and the vision that they have for their product so I think it would be pretty cool I mean it gives us at PowerSet a really good access to information , resources , I mean we are going to have as many servers as we want now , right ?
And that is going to be huge .
It 's sort of sad anytime you lose that start up , you go from a startup to an acquisition , and it 's awesome but you are a little sad because it's not a startup anymore you become more of a corporate thing .
But in the long run it 's exactly what PowerSet needs to be super successful and I think that PowerSet will be .
9 . You are on another project or another website that 's very successful it 's Github .
What can you tell us about that and how are you involved in Github ?
Sure .
I co-founded Github wit Chris Wansrath and now PJ Hyett so we are a three men team right now .
Github is what we call " Social code hosting " which is like the next evolution of putting your code online .
For people who are not familiar with Git , Github is a place where you put up your Git repositories .
Git is very much like Subversion only a lot more advanced .
It has things like first class branching and merging , that 's built for that .
It has offline commit so every clone of a Git repository is a full repository with whole history .
So you can clone a repository down on your laptop get on the airplane , fly across the country be hacking on the airplane and then making commits on the airplane .
You can commit to your repository on the airplane and when you get back to the ground , you could push those back up to a place like Github and then share them with people .
So in essence Github is a place where you and I can put up repositories of our code , and you can come along , maybe you do a search or I tell you about it , you come on there and you say " ok , here is all the source , you can clone it down , you can view it online we have tools to visualize the branch structure and how people have forked .
On Github we call taking a project and making a copy of that on your account , we call that forking .
It 's forking in the good sense of I like your project enough to fork it and start working on it and contribute back .
The whole process is streamlined to make open source contributions or working together , collaborating , making that as simple as possible .
This came out the need that Chris and I had of we do a lot of open source stuff and it gets pretty onerous after a while to be responsible for all of the merging of people 's patches that come in .
and on subversions you accept patches on email or whatever , you have to try to figure how to apply them , maybe things have changed , since then , there is no shared history so the merge strategy can only be two way , there is a lot of problems .
And so , Git and Github try to solve those problems .
10 .
What is the infrastructure , what is Github built on ?
What does it use on the server side ?
Github is written on Rails , it uses Grit which is the open source library that I work on .
Also we have another developer now Scott Chacon who did a lot of work on a pure Ruby implementation of Git , we 've actually contracted him and we have replaced a lot of the shell out calls in Ruby you do the shell out , we replaced most of those , possibly all of them by now with just pure Ruby , we go directly to the file system .
We read the object data from the Git repository , we read that directly .
And by doing that we have been able to get a multiplier of two speed up on the web pages throughout the site .
Double the speed of the page load and that 's been awesome .
So we are using that when you install Git .
We are using that less and less and we are implementing some of that functionality that we need for the site in pure Ruby and that 's been really helpful to us .
I just finished up an Erlang git daemon
Whenever you do a public clone of a project on Github right now that runs an Erlang Git daemon which is just a server for pushing down the repository as a whole there is kind of a back and forth , it has it 's own protocol .
So I implemented that one in Erlang because we needed to have more flexibility .
We have grown to the size where we can't just take all the user directories and put them in a single place because we end up with a very very large directory .
So we have to take those and what we do is take an MD5 of the username and then split that up into directories .
And the built - in Git daemon that comes with Git is n't capable of doing that .
It can only say " Here is a directory , fill all the repositories within it " .
What we need to do is say " Here is a directory structure , serve all the repositories within that " .
And at the same time we want to do logging , we want to be able to log , when someone does an initial clone on a project , so that we can say " Hey your project has been cloned twenty times , hundred times , whatever " .
We want to be able to tell you as a Github user that .
Also the error messages that come back from Git daemon , if you try to push to a public clone address , regular Gib daemon just severs the connection , it 's just gone .
And it says " Connection closed unexpectedly " .
But with egitd which is what this project is called , egitd I can insert an error message into that and it comes back and it is shown to the user and it can say " You ca n't push to this , you are try the one that you should be pushing to " .
So it gives us a few advantages .
We also use bj which is a background job processor and by Ara Howard it has been really solid for us .
A lot of the tasks , like every time you push to your Github repository we need to do certain things , we need to run the Git garbage collection which compacts the objects on the server so that we can save space , we have things called web hooks , meaning if you put in an URL we can ping that every time you push , create a JSON packet or a YAML packet or whatever you want .
And we can push that to that URL , we just do a post to that URL with that information , so that you can create things off site that integrate with Github however you want as long as you just write a little service .
We also have a bunch of built in services , for doing things like take the commit messages and put them into a Campfire or IRC or you get them emailed , or you get them on IM , or there is all sorts of integration .
There is Lighthouse integration , so there is all these integration points , and for those we need to have just a bunch of background jobs that handle all of that asynchronously .
11 . Why did you choose Erlang as an implementation language for egitd ?
I chose it because I am familiar with it and it's a really productive language for writing servers .
Just the way that Erlang is structured , the way that it looks at the world , the way it perceives the world .
It 's functional .
So it is more like mathematical functions and Erlang makes doing servers rally easy because it makes sure that memory is really separated .
It makes it really easy to spot of new small lightweight processes , and so every incoming connection hits egitd gets spawned .
off into another lightweight process and at the same time Erlang is able to utilize all of the corse on a server , this is SMP enabled and so it 's spinning up processes on all of the cores , shared right across , you do n't have to do anything like create real operating system processes , which take more memory so it can be very memory lightweight .
And it is just the whole paradigm I 'm just very in tune to that paradigm now , and I think it 's really , egitd turns out to be a very small amount of code .
And so that 's why I chose it .
It 's just so strong for server applications , the way that it wants you to approach them is very in line with that kind of service requirement .
12 . Did you write it as an OTP behavior for TCP Servers ?
Yeah ... well , it actually does n't use OTP right now .
It uses gen_tcp which I do n't think is considered officially part of the OTP stuff .
gen_tcp allows you to do all the protocol stuff like you bind into a socket and then you accept a connection and then you can read and write to is and then you close the connection .
That 's gen_tcp and that 's all I really use right now but what I want to do now that I have it working and it's in production , I want to go in and clean that up and turn it into an OTP thing , do a little refactoring , make it so that right now if you close it if you kill egitd it will hang on to that socket because it is n't closed cleanly and in order to do that I want to be able to send a message to that OTP process to say " Close your socket " .
Because right now you can't do that it just runs and spawns off processes you can't really get into that where it stores that socket object and so I do n't want to go into that direction but right now it 's not really leveraging well OTP stuff .
But Fuzed is pretty much all OTP and OTP is awesome .
I mean that 's what makes Erlang .
13 .
To close up let 's talk about a rather divine topic .
Your monitoring system God .
What is that about ?
God is I call it a process monitoring framework .
I like to call it a framework because your configuration files but it 's pure Ruby , it 's just a Ruby file .
And so in this file you can do really advanced things like you can do looping , you can even have variables , you can have abstractions , the way that the config file works it 's a lot of block , methods that take blocks and then yields to them .
So if you want and have a bunch of functionality that can be the same across a bunch of configuration files you can take that and create a method that contains all of that stuff .
And all you do is pass it in a certain block which you then use and applies all of this code that you have written .
And you can reuse that whereas in your traditional systems like monit you do n't have looping , you do n't have variables , it has a very obtuse syntax that you have to learn specially , and it does n't have extensibility .
Another primary reason that I wrote God is to have an easy way to extend the framework .
There is a lot of built in conditions like " Is the process running ?
Is it using too much memory ?
Too much CPU ?
Does it URL respond ? "
These kinds of things .
With God you can write a new condition in Ruby just as easily as a few lines , all you have to do is implement a specific interface .
And when you are done you can just put that into your configuration file if you want .
It could be that easy .
Or you could refactor it out and include that from elsewhere .
But it makes the whole concept of extending the framework so easy , because it 's just Ruby and we all know Ruby so why not use that as a configuration file ?
JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - A 15 - year - old Indonesian girl has died of bird flu in central Java , a health official said on Wednesday , bringing the country ’s death toll from the disease to 113 .
The girl died last week after being treated at the Doctor Karyadi hospital in Semarang .
“ It has been confirmed by health ministry labs , ” said Agus Suryanto , the head of the medical team treating the girl .
Including the latest death , the virus has now infected 388 people in 15 countries , killing 246 of them , according to data from the World Health Organization .
Indonesia has the highest toll of any nation .
Although bird flu remains an animal disease , experts fear that the virus might mutate into a form easily passed from human to human , sparking a pandemic in which case millions could die .

A prominent Jewish group says it is reviewing legal options against a German neo -Nazi party for " racist " remarks calling Barack Obama 's election a " declaration of war " by non-white America .
The Berlin chapter of the American Jewish Committee ( AFC ) , condemned statements made by Juergen Gansel , a deputy in the Saxony state legislature for the far - right National Democratic Party of Germany , against Mr Obama 's election as the first African - American US president .
In a statement from his office entitled " Africa conquers the White House , " Mr Gansel said multicultural America sought the destruction of " pure " national cultures and that Mr Obama aimed to destroy the United States ' " white identity . "
" A non-white America is a declaration of war on all people who believe an organically grown social order based on language and culture , history and heritage to be the essence of humanity , " he said .
" Barack Obama hides this declaration of war behind his pushy sunshine smile . "
Mr Gansel said Mr Obama 's triumph was the product of " the American alliance of Jews and Negroes " and warned the president - elect enjoyed too much popularity in Germany .
The director of the AJC's Berlin office , Deidre Berger , said she was shocked by Mr Gansel 's " open expression of racism , anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism . "
She said the AJC hoped German authorities would look into Mr Gansel 's press release and that German politicians would clearly distance themselves from his sentiments .
" We are investigating the legal situation concerning the statement and will continue monitoring closely political statements using extremist language , " she said .
" We urge state authorities to do their utmost within legal bounds to prosecute such incitement . "

Addressing a developer conference in Sydney Australia , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said the idea of using WebKit as the rendering engine within its web browser was " interesting " and added " we may look at that . "
Ballmer chanted his hallmark line " developers , developers , developers " to engage participants at the Power to Developers event , but was apparently caught off guard when a student attendee posed a question about Microsoft 's own internal development efforts .
The student put Ballmer on the hot seat by asking , " Why is IE still relevant and why is it worth spending money on rendering engines when there are open source ones available that can respond to changes in Web standards faster ? "
" That 's cheeky , but a good question , but cheeky , " Ballmer replied , according to a report by TechWorld .
Ballmer explained that Microsoft would need to consider the future of the browser and determine if there is any lack of innovation for the company to capitalize upon with ' proprietary extensions that broaden its functionality . '
" There will still be a lot of proprietary innovation in the browser itself so we may need to have a rendering service , " Ballmer said , adding , " Open source is interesting .
Apple has embraced Webkit and we may look at that , but we will continue to build extensions for IE 8 . "
Ballmer also admitted the delays in moving from IE 6 to IE 7 during the development of Vista under the Longhorn project .
" But I do n't what to go there , " he said .
While Microsoft rapidly developed IE up to version six in 2001 , new innovation stalled after the apparent death of the rival Netscape browser between 2000 and 2001 .
The lull in Microsoft 's browser efforts afforded Mozilla the opportunity to release and refine the Netscape code into what became Firefox in 2003 .
During the same period , KDE shipped the fast and lean KHTML browser engine , a project Apple built upon to create WebKit , the rendering engine behind Safari 1.0 , also released in 2003 .
That web browser renaissance spurred Microsoft to deliver a new version of IE in 2006 .
WebKit has subsequently been chosen by a number of developers to serve as the foundation for their web browsers and other web related tools .
That includes Nokia 's mobile browser , Google 's new Chrome , and of course the mobile Safari browser used by Apple 's iPhone .
Embracing WebKit as the basis for new generations of IE would enable Microsoft to benefit from its standards compliance and raw speed , while still enabling the software giant to extend its features with proprietary extensions , just as Apple 's Safari browser adds unique features such as bookmark management and syncing , Dashboard Widget clipping , and SnapBack .
It would also give Microsoft a functional mobile browser to replace Windows Mobile 's Pocket IE , a poorly regarded and nearly unusable product based on a very old version of Microsoft 's proprietary web engine .

WMR has learned from knowledgeable Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) sources that the Bush administration is putting the final touches on a plan that would see martial law declared in the United States with various scenarios anticipated as triggers .
The triggers include a continuing economic collapse with massive social unrest , bank closures resulting in violence against financial institutions , and another fraudulent presidential election that would result in rioting in major cities and campuses around the country .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In addition , Army Corps of Engineer sources report that the assignment of the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team ( BCT ) to the Northern Command ’s U.S. Army North is to augment FEMA and federal law enforcement in the imposition of traffic controls , crowd control , curfews , enhanced border and port security , and neighborhood patrols in the event a national emergency being declared .
The BCT was assigned to duties in Iraq before being assigned to the Northern Command .
On April 3 , 2008 , WMR reported on a highly - classified document regarding the martial law scenario : WMR has learned from knowledgeable sources within the US financial community that an alarming confidential and limited distribution document is circulating among senior members of Congress and their senior staff members that is warning of a bleak future for the United States if it does not quickly get its financial house in order .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those who have reportedly read the document .
The document is being called the " C & R " document because it reportedly states that if the United States defaults on loans and debt underwriting from China , Japan , and Russia , all of which are propping up the United States government financially , and the United States unilaterally cancels the debts , America can expect a war that will have disastrous results for the United States and the world .
" Conflict " is the " C word " in the document .
The other scenario is that the federal government will be forced to drastically raise taxes in order to pay off debts to foreign countries to the point that the American people will react with a popular revolution against the government .
" Revolution " is the document ’s " R word .

Major leadership changes Thursday at Twitter renewed questions about its business prospects – was the replacement of CEO Jack Dorsey by fellow co-founder Evan Williams a shuffling of deck chairs on the Titanic ?
But VC backers of the microblogging service interviewed by wired.com Friday insisted they remain bullish , and Bijan Sabet , a general partner at Twitter backer Spark Capital , revealed that new revenue models will be unveiled in the first half of next year .
For now , they grow weary of the question .
“ It ’s like the stupidest question in the world : How ’s Twitter going to make money ? , " said Union Square Ventures ’ Fred Wilson , another investor .
" It ’s like ' How was Google going to make money ? '
" Eventually Google was going to make money and they figured out how to do it and they figured out a great business , and I think the same thing is true with Twitter . ”
There are a number of new products and services in addition to the new business models that have been discussed and are currently in the works , says Sabet , but he would n’t go into any specific detail .
He also downplayed the notion that there was anything to worry about , even in an environment when investments and ad dollars are drying up .
“ I think it ’s very normal and expected for people in this economy , saying ‘ when is Twitter going to show us how it can generate revenue , ’ and the answer is ‘ stay tuned , and they ’re working on it , ” Sabet said .
Wilson said there are plenty of possibilities for building a business on Twitter , not only for themselves but for third party developers , like Twitterific , which are already supporting advertising in their apps .
The recently acquired search engine , Summize , might be a good place to start .
“ There ’s a lot of commercial activity happening today on Twitter , and what Twitter ’s going to do is figure out how to harness that commercial activity and make it better and stronger , ” said Wilson .
Thursday Williams announced that he would be replacing Dorsey as CEO , as the company enters into its next phase .
“ Healthy companies acknowledge the need for change even during the best of times , ” wrote Williams .
The past 6 months have been spent on stabilizing the service and making it reliable and scalable , and the leadership roles were simply altered to better prepare themselves for the future .
“ Increasingly it was becoming a little bit of a too many cooks in the kitchen problem , and we just had to pick one person to be the boss , ”
said Wilson .
“ I think it ’s a better fit for each individual ’s set of strengths . ”
The company raised about $ 15 million this summer giving it a total of around $ 20 million in resources and a valuation of about $ 80 million .

1. Consideration of comedians : they use laughter to make everything ridiculous .
The good things , while made ridiculous , still are essentially good and cannot be dismissed .
They are necessary no matter how much we laugh .
The bad things , made ridiculous , fall away quickly .
All comedians – including those who believe all is spin , such as Jon Stewart / Stephen Colbert – think they are defending the truest , perhaps the oldest goods in practicing their art well .
2 . A more sophisticated consideration of comedy comes about in “ The Birth of Tragedy ” when Nietzsche associates Socrates with the comic .
Strauss on Nietzsche ’s “ Socrates : ”
“ He [ Socrates ] is the prototype of the rationalist and therefore of the optimist , for optimism is not merely the belief that the world is the best possible world , but also the belief that the world can become the best of all imaginable worlds , or that the evils that belong to the best possible world can be rendered harmless by knowledge : thinking can not only fully understand being , but can even correct it ….
Rationalism is optimism , since it is the belief that reason ’s power is unlimited and essentially beneficent … .
Rationalism is optimism , since the belief in causes depends on the belief in ends , or since rationalism presupposes the belief in the initial or final supremacy of the good .
The full and ultimate consequences of the change effected or represented by Socrates appear only in the contemporary West : in the belief in universal enlightenment and therewith in the earthly happiness of all within a universal state , in utilitarianism , liberalism , democracy , pacifism and socialism . ”
– Leo Strauss , Socrates and Aristophanes , p. 7
We must keep in mind that Strauss is only sticking to Nietzsche ’s surface here for a purpose .
Strauss is putting us in the Aristophanean position of defending the ancestral and seeing Socrates from that viewpoint .
Socrates is not Rousseau , and the latter half of the quote is pure Rousseau .
Moreover , we have noted from Natural Right and History the truer teaching – reason cannot correct “ being . ”
The whole of being is itself beyond being ; reason ’s ability to merely apprehend “ what is ” in all cases is dubious .
However , I bring up this more sophisticated view of the “ comic ” to make the point that comedy , in appealing to what is “ common sense , ” begins with the ancestral but is beholden to reason as progress without knowing it .
“ Common sense ” can be concerned with immediate effectiveness , after all .
This is an enormous problem because people who love wisdom or are very rational – people who can see 10 steps ahead of everyone else – are not necessarily embraced by the comic .
The comic only embraces rationality as optimism : it confuses the two and misses that reasonable people can sometimes see problems the rest dismiss as paranoid ravings .
3 . The plot of Aristophanes ’ “ Clouds ” is simple enough : a father , Strepsiades , is of moderate means and is going broke .
His son , Pheidippides , is using all the family money to become a superior horseman .
These lavish tastes stem from the merger of old and new Athens – Strepsiades did n’t have much money but married rich , and his wife instilled lavish tastes in the son .
So what Strepsiades wants to do is get Pheidippides to go to Socrates and learn sophistry , i.e. the “ unjust speech . ”
With that he can win any lawsuit against creditors and can go back to his son wasting tons of cash and himself , well , sitting around farting ( I kid you not .
Aristophanes uses this sort of joke every other line ) .
He goes to Socrates ’ thinkery himself and runs into new deities Socrates introduces – “ the Clouds . ”
The “ Clouds ” promise Strepsiades quite a bit if he listens to Socrates , and even give Socrates a hint or two about how to deal with his new pupil .
He almost becomes decent enough to defend himself , but does n’t have the natural ability .
Socrates expels him but the Clouds get him to enroll Pheidippides and Pheidippides learns the unjust speech .
The father holds a feast for the son but they argue about the pious things ; needless to say , son is a lot less pious having worked with Socrates , and beats his father up after the verbal exchange becomes heated .
Father encounters the Clouds again and learns from the Clouds that his initial want of injustice brought this on .
He turns to piety of a regular sort , and in this turning , decides to burn Socrates ’ “ thinkery . ”
This he does , and the god Hermes appears to drive him to expel Socrates and his disciples even from the theater .
4 . The structure of the play is very complex – Aristophanes is featured himself as a character , the Clouds are selective in what they tell and do n’t tell the audience and other actors .
It is possible to get a reading of the play that is very sympathetic to Socrates .
5 . I am not in the mood for such a reading .
While eros unites all comically in the Symposium , where Aristophanes and Socrates seven years after this play was performed do n’t seem to hate each other , the ending of this play is absolutely brutal .
The god Hermes condones arson and encourages violence against Socrates and his followers , and Strepsiades , an unthinking brute who was more than willing to treat creditors like dirt when he thought his son could win any lawsuit , is given not a “ last laugh ” but a rather serious role in the polity .
His piety is good enough to get Athens horsemen it will need for war , and makes him useful to the city ’s higher purpose of throwing the distracting and unnecessary out .
Aristophanes comes before us as a character in the midst of the play to declare his wisdom ; he too is a devotee of the Clouds , who can mimic everything .
Only : Socrates believes the Clouds to be a stand - in for human reason – imitation is the province of the imagination and refers back to the uniquely human .
Aristophanes sees the Clouds as genuinely divine and claims to be a disciple of Dionysus , the god of wine , himself .
It ’s hard to see how Socrates is n’t correct in this debate : how on earth are the Clouds gods ?
Strauss notes that the Clouds want to be gods that do n’t wander , but find a home .
They want to reside in Athens .
Socrates is their only devotee , but a flawed one .
His willingness to consider them divine stems from a rejection of divinity in any traditional sense .
What Socrates does n’t see is that reason is a tool for divine , not just human , purposes .
The Clouds may reduce to reason , but it is n’t human reason exclusively – the Clouds are everywhere , and are literally above man .
The Olympian Gods and the city that bears the name of the goddess of wisdom have a stake in the Clouds .
Reason can never divorce entirely from “ common sense ” for Aristophanes .
If you look unhealthy , you must be unhealthy – Socrates ’ gauntness does n’t reflect moderation as much as hubris : he thinks himself beyond the human .
But we ’ve seen above that “ common sense ” can be fatally flawed : it does n’t even realize its own grounding .
And fathers , wanting the best for their sons , can end up throwing away years of tradition that might help the city as a whole .
Strepsiades is an arsonist at the end of the drama ; his pious revelation is just as destructive to the city as the sophist that Socrates is purported to be .
Except that it was n’t Socrates who came into the thinkery asking if he would teach injustice .
Point is , Aristophanes is between a rock and a hard place in defending his comic art .
He wants to defend all the good things the city wants at once – wealth , martial virtue , reason / superior speech , piety .
Guess what ?
No matter how much awareness your play may show as to the tensions between those things , even the exaggerated , poorly represented Socrates is in a better position to address the issue of the good .
He ’s at least honest about the things that are n’t compatible with each other .
So the question we ’re left with is :
Does human reason , which allows actual apprehension of the good , require a “ beating up ” of one ’s own father ?
How radical is the questioning of “ common sense ? ”
The Platonic and Xenophontic Socrates , the one that would never teach an unjust speech or hold “ clouds ” to be responsible for all phenomena , keeps the critique very radical .
That much Aristophanes got right ; what he missed is why it is essential to not give up on lines of questioning .
People are going to ask questions about authority no matter what , and it is when they do n’t have any questions one has to wonder : either they ’re frittering their money away on luxuries like horses , not caring for the debt .
Or maybe they ’re perpetually at war , with their neighbors and other cities .
Finally , if they have no questions , maybe they ’re in the most dangerous state of all , thinking they know everything when they can’t even articulate what they believe .
Human rights campaigners and Britain 's largest police force have expressed doubts over plans to make 10,000 Taser stun guns available to officers across England and Wales .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith today announced that £ 8 m would be made available to increase the supply of Tasers and to train 30,000 officers to use them .
But Amnesty International claims the 50,000 - volt guns have been responsible for 320 deaths in the US , and the Metropolitan Police Authority said their use by non-specialist officers could damage public confidence .
Smith 's decision follows year - long trials of Tasers by frontline officers in 10 police forces .
The guns , only deployed in the UK by specialist firearms officers , deliver a powerful electric shock that temporarily incapacitates targets and causes them to " freeze " or fall to the ground .
Oliver Sprague , an arms expert at Amnesty International UK , said : " We do n't oppose the use of Tasers as long as it's by a limited number of highly - trained specialist officers , responding to genuinely life - threatening or very dangerous situations .
" Tasers are potentially lethal weapons , which are already linked to numerous deaths in North America , and that 's why wide deployment without adequate training is a dangerous step in British policing . "
He said the human rights group 's research showed that 320 people had died after being Tasered in the US since 2001 , and that 90 % of those killed were shocked multiple times and were not armed .
A Metropolitan Police Authority spokesman said : " The MPA recognises the potential to cause fear and damage public confidence if the use of Tasers is extended to non-specialist trained police officers and is perceived by the public to be indiscriminate .
" There is no doubt that in some circumstances Tasers are a very effective alternative to firearms or asps [ metal batons ] but their use must be tightly controlled and we have seen no case made out to extend their availability . "
The home office minister Alan Campbell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that during the trials Tasers had been deployed more than 600 times , but used on only 93 occasions .
According to the BBC , police officers in England and Wales have fired the stun guns more than 1,000 times since 2004 .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said 35 complaints about their use had been received since 2004 .
In 2007 , a Polish man , Robert Dziekanski , died after being Tasered at Vancouver airport in a notorious incident that was captured on video .
Despising America has long been a Middle East pastime , but then the country that brought war to Iraq and orange - suited prisoners to Guantanamo Bay elected a Facebook - friendly president who speaks in poems .
What ’s a mullah to do ?
With the speed of a Twitter missive , the cultural game has shifted .
Barack Obama ’s rise to the White House comes when the Arabs are intensely suspicious of U.S. intentions , and when Islam , through satellite TV and the Internet , is inundated with Western culture .
Eight years of President Bush gave conservative Muslims a buttress against America .
But Obama , who plays as well in Hollywood as he does in the villages of Kenya , is changing Washington ’s image from a cowboy with snarling sound bites to a conciliator with star appeal .

The Middle East probably wo n’t put aside its mistrust of Washington over the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , Iraq and regional flash points , including Iran ’s nuclear program .
The early elation in the Arab media over Obama ’s victory was later balanced with the belief that the president - elect is encumbered by entrenched U.S. policies , and that what looms before the world is a new face , one with international sensibilities , yet ultimately one that will act in American interests .
--
‘ Voice of voiceless ’
But Obama ’s is a multicultural face that narrows degrees of separation .
He is the Christian son of a Muslim father ; he seems more a citizen of the world than an Illinois senator .
To many in the Middle East , he is that rare thing : a minority who , with breathtaking speed and without a military coup , has risen to political prominence .
This strikes deeply in a part of the world where repression carries a twofold meaning : Western power and military dominance , and Arab regimes that silence dissent .

“ His resonant , melodic voice is heard as the voice of the voiceless , ” Gamal Nkrumah , whose father , Kwame , led Ghana to independence from British rule in 1957 , wrote in the Egyptian weekly Al Ahram .
“ Obama ’s genius is that he appeals to the well - heeled liberals in Western nations as much as the penniless peasants of impoverished nations , the teeming millions eking out a meager existence . ”
The president - elect presents new dangers to the established order .
He is charismatic and cyber - savvy ; he bridges hip - hop and Mozart ; his middle name is Hussein .
He built a campaign around a well - choreographed electronic populism that generated millions of dollars in Internet donations .
This strategy speaks to religious and political reformers in the Middle East , who in recent years have turned to blogs and Facebook groups to organize government protests and debate Islamic tenets .
U.S. allies Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Morocco jail dissident bloggers and online commentators .
These governments , which are crucial to regional stability and the stemming of terrorism , are frequently criticized by democracy advocates and human rights groups .
The Internet , YouTube and message boards , which Obama navigated to win the support of steelworkers , college students and investment bankers , are viewed by leaders in this region as dangerous tools of revolt for the young .

Obstacles ahead
This is where Obama ’s lyrical prose meets the gruff calculus of the police state .
Would he recommend cutting the nearly $ 1.8 billion in annual U.S. aid to Egypt if President Hosni Mubarak ’s government continues rounding up political opponents ?
How far would he go to push for civil rights in the oil kingdom of Saudi Arabia ?
Obama ’s presidency also comes when the Middle East is engaged in intense debate between Muslim moderates and conservatives over the role of Islam .
Moderates seek more openness to democracy and rapprochement with the West .
Obama offers a tantalizing message that may inspire them while disarming fundamentalists who gained followers and benefited from what many here regard as Bush ’s war against Muslims .

Religious devotion is growing in the Middle East , and Islamic puritans worry that the widening intrusion that the telegenic Obama personifies threatens their hold on society .
Muslim rappers scat about women ’s rights and tolerance ; sitcoms are embracing romance and sexual allure ; and a new generation of TV preachers , the Islamic version of their Christian counterparts , are dynamic speakers , less rigid in their interpretations of holy texts .
Tailored suits have replaced beards and tunics .
The Obama presidency will intensify the influence of American culture , but that dynamic can’t appear to diminish the permeating role that Islam -- be it moderate or conservative -- has on Arab society .
Yet even Obama ’s facial characteristics emblazoned on T - shirts seem more a reflection of the region than a foreign - imposed graphic .
Islamic militants probably will be forced to search for new symbols in rallying followers to blow themselves up in their war against the U.S .
--
Critics allege bias
Advertisement
Skepticism , however , can spin like a desert storm , and even the most effervescent poster - sized smile can dim quickly in the Middle East .
Arab newspapers are already criticizing Obama for his postelection comments and decisions , especially regarding the Arab - Israeli divide .
Obama ’s campaign statements about Israel and his naming of Rahm Emanuel , a Jew whose father once had links to a militant Zionist organization , as his chief of staff have Arab commentators warning of an Israeli bias .
The president - elect is considered the antidote to Bush ; one cannot imagine , at least not yet , him being burned in effigy at the edge of a souk .
But in this region , politics and history are score cards , and if the Arab - Israeli conflict shows no sign of improving , Obama probably will face “ Imperialist America ” slogans and placards painted in vitriol .
But for now , it ’s a fascinating Bluetooth moment ; cyberspace is abuzz from North Africa to Damascus , Syria , to the white sands of Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates .
The Arab world is about respect , saving face ; you can cut a man , but you give him his dignity .
Arabs say the Bush administration seldom understood this ; they ’re hoping Obama ’s does .
A blog called the Black Iris of Jordan put it this way :

“ Congratulations are in order to the American people and the Obama fan base .
So begins a new chapter in American history , to say nothing of world history .
Fingers crossed that it will be a positive one , especially for this region . ”

A Rant about the Link Economy
Sitepoint has an interesting article about Whether or Not Blogging is Dead – and they conclude basically that it is n’t , but the “ link economy ” is probably messed up .
To help reinforce their point , I wo n’t be linking to them in this blog post .
Why ?
Because their blog has essentially disabled links in comments and pings .
Am I being selfish ?
Are they ?
Part of blogging is participating on other peoples ’ blogs and creating a literal network of contributors held together with convenient links .
Heck , this is probably why Sitepoint ’s forum is so busy , active , and worthy of linking to .
Its not just Sitepoint ’s blog , its a lot of places these days .
The guys who are the problem are the ones that use automated scripts to plaster dozens of links to unrelated topics in questionable business sectors .
Nofollow obviously does n’t stop spammers from leaving links .
So , in the eternal quest to avoid the simple blogging duty of comment moderation and visitor - author interaction , a lot of blogs are just simply getting rid of the comment link altogether .
I guess they figure so long as there is no URL attached , they will never have to look through their comments again .
So wait , why are they running a blog ?
Is what they are running even really a blog ?
The definition of that Blog word is up for considerable debate , and if comment links are n’t missing an essential component of blogging , they ’re at least losing out on one of the biggest strengths that the platform can offer .
Listen , comment links are n’t even just for other webmasters or people who work for websites .
Anyone can find and contribute a link to a valuable resource they come across .
If these links and comments they leave are valid , they should be manually approved and added to the democratic web of the internet .
I shudder when I see links to government websites automatically “ nofollowed ” as if some software in its infinite wisdom decides that the Census Report is n’t a valid authority that the search engines should value .
I hate to imagine how many times people have posted “ too many links ” to such authoritative sources and had their comments sent to the Akismet bin of doom .
The calculus of internet democracy is actually pretty simple .
Yes , authors who contribute more comments on other blogs , who get more articles published to directories and newspapers , and who submit popular links to social bookmarking sites should get a little extra link weight to their websites because they ’re obviously active and contributing to the democratic - digital debate .
People have tried to overcalculate this easy formula , they ’ve tried to hoard their linking power ( as if that was something they could actually do ) .
There ’s no shortage of capital in the link economy , the problem is that no one is sharing because everyone is afraid to actually do the editorial work that goes along with publishing a blog !
So I ’ve got my money where my mouth is – any comment you can get past my moderation is completely dofollow .
Attention to all blogs that do n’t allow comment links : I wo n’t be linking to you here , on my other two blogs , on any of my bookmarking sites , or on any of the blogs or bookmarking sites or forums that I visit .
To the rest of you dofollow webmasters , I ’m looking for ya and linking for ya .
Keep making the quality content and I ’ll do my little part with visibility .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President - elect Barack Obama could protect ocean wildlife and save jobs in commercial fisheries by ending widespread overfishing , environmental and economic leaders and scientists reported on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
About 70 percent of the world ’s fisheries are over - exploited or have already crashed , the report said .
If this long - term trend continues , scientists have predicted that all current salt - water fish and seafood species will collapse by 2048 .
The report said this could be remedied by instituting a system known as catch shares , where the total amount of fish allowed to be taken in a given fishery is capped and fishermen are given a share of the fishery ’s quota .
That is different than the conventional way of trying to limit the number of fish taken , which is to shorten the length of the fishing season , which prompts fishermen to get the absolute maximum during whatever time they are permitted to fish .
Fishermen are frequently so skilled at this that the number of fish caught increases even with a short season .
“ It is true that fishermen feel an almost desperate need to catch as many fish as they can when they ’re allowed to , ” said James Greenwood , a former U.S. congressman who co-chaired a working group that wrote the report .
“ That sense of desperation ... ca n’t be an excuse for the policymakers of the world and this country to allow that to cause the universal collapse of fisheries , ” Greenwood said in a telephone interview .
Because catch share management sets a scientifically sustainable level of catch for each fishery and divides this among those who fish there , fishers have more flexibility in when they work , knowing that the number of fish they can legally take is strictly limited .
Unlike other environment problems facing the new administration , most notably the pressure to limit climate - warming carbon emissions , overfishing is an issue that can start to be fixed in Obama ’s first four - year term , the report ’s authors said .
The report urged Obama to make sure that all federal fishery management plans are evaluated by 2012 and that at least 50 percent of them feature catch share management by 2016 .
It said Congress could help by passing legislation to require that catch shares be considered in all plans by 2012 .
Greenwood , a former congressman , now heads the Biotechnology Industry Organization and serves on the board of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute , which convened the working group along with the Environmental Defense Fund , an advocacy organization .
Others in the working group include co-chair Bruce Babbitt , former U.S. Interior secretary ; Christine Todd Whitman , former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator ; and Norm Mineta , former secretary of Transportation and of Commerce .

British savers had billions of pounds invested in Iceland 's banks
Here we go again .
Having fought three rather pointless - though at times bitter - little wars over fishing limits , Britain and Iceland have now allowed a problem over British deposits in a failed Icelandic bank to become a crisis .
Instead of two North Atlantic islands who are partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and who both charged into financial danger zones quietly sorting this out , prime ministers have swapped insults .
Echoes of those cod wars are heard .
The British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , has publicly declared Icelandic actions to be " effectively illegal " and " unacceptable " and the Icelandic Prime Minister , Gier Haarde , has expressed his annoyance that the UK used anti-terrorism legislation to seize assets in Britain of the one of the Icelandic banks .
In a situation where people 's money is at stake , one government tends to blame another and vice versa .
British argument
The complaint in the present case from the British side is that Iceland was not prepared to compensate UK investors equally but was protecting its domestic savers first .
I am told that the case refers only to that of the internet bank Icesave .
Britain did not get the assurance it sought that a legal agreement for equal treatment would be honoured .
Icelanders are hurt that the British government acted under the Anti-terrorism Act
The British government therefore decided that it had to take steps to try to protect its own savers and seized assets of Icesave 's parent bank , Landsbanki , in the UK .
It is interesting to note that the tone adopted by Treasury minister Stephen Timms in the House of Commons on Thursday was much milder than that of his prime minister .
Mr Timms said the freeze was a " precautionary measure ... and could be lifted once safeguards are in place . "
But the damage had been done and will take some repairing .
Icelandic complaint
The Icelanders are hurt that the British government acted under the Anti-terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 , specifically Part 2 , Article 4 .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Act is in fact very broadly based and says that assets can be frozen in the UK if the Treasury " reasonably believe " that " action to the detriment of the United Kingdom 's economy ( or part of it ) has been or is likely to be taken by a person or persons , or action constituting a threat to the life or property of one or more nationals of the United Kingdom ... "
The person against whom action is taken has to be either a foreign government or resident .
It is not clear why the Act and not another had to be used but one suspects that it was to hand and was quick .
And it shows how an Act designed for one set of circumstances can easily be used for another .
Cod wars
It is worth recalling how angry each side got over fish to understand these feelings about finance .
It was all about the extension of fishing rights , something that has since been settled and indeed , at the height of the third round of clashes between British trawlers and frigates and Icelandic gunboats , was already on the way to being agreed internationally .
Britain and Iceland have had bitter disputes over fishing rights Britain was furious that Iceland started to cut British trawler nets within the 200 mile zone before an actual international agreement was reached .
Iceland countered that it had to show that it was serious .
No shots were fired , though at one stage an Icelandic captain did order his guns to be manned , in the face of somewhat superior firepower from a Royal Navy frigate .
One lighter moment came when the BBC 's venerable agriculture correspondent , Archie McPhee , who also doubled as fisheries correspondent , landed in Iceland from a British vessel , without taking the precaution of checking in with immigration .
He was arrested and held for several hours before resuming his duties , now with a good story to tell .
But at the time , I recall , it seemed to be the Icelanders who had the better of it .
They had designed their gunboats to cut nets and be strong enough to withstand ramming .
The British frigates were lightly armoured and at one stage had to fix wooden planks to their bows to strengthen themselves .
They were designed for anti-submarine warfare , not protecting the nets of trawlers .
The damage had been done and will take some repairing
It was a classic case of how a small force designed for a specific job can hold off a larger force designed for another .
Fishing stocks have nevertheless declined even in Icelandic waters and the island turned to finance and tourists instead .
Iceland has become a favourite haunt for racy weekenders after hot tubs and environmental explorers after hot springs .
It has come as a surprise to many of us how much British public money was invested in Icelandic banks .
An island of 300,000 souls seems to have been supporting not just West Ham United ( whose owner is Icelandic ) but a great swathe of private and public investors .

Latest GOP smear plot revealed : Professor paid to try to tie Ayers to Obama biography John Byrne
Published : Saturday November 1 , 2008
Print This Email This
The brother of a Republican congressman and a Republican businessman attempted to pay an professor in Oxford to use software he designed to " prove " that 1960s radical William Ayers helped write Sen. Barack Obama 's biography .
The professor , Dr. Peter Millican , teaches philosophy at Hertford College , Oxford .
His software is designed to detect when works are by the same authors by comparing the use of similar words and phrases .
The offer was revealed Sunday in a British newspaper .
 He was entirely upfront about this , " the professor said of the Republican businessman who made the offer .
" He offered me $ 10,000 and sent me electronic versions of the text from both books . 
Millican said he took a preliminary look and found the charges that Ayers had had a hand in ghostwriting Obama 's book very implausible .
A deal was agreed for " more detailed research , " the paper said , but when Millican " said the results had to be made public , even if no link to Ayers was proved , interest waned . "
The Republicans sought to allege similarities between Obama 's Dreams of My Father and Ayers ' Fugitive Days .
The offer was made by Robert Fox , a California GOP businessman and brother - in - law of Republican Rep. Chris Cannon ( R- UT ) .
Asked by the British paper who'd made the offer , Fox and Cannon tried to pin it on each other .
Cannon said " he merely recommended computer testing of the books .
He doubted whether Obama wrote his autobiography , adding : ' If Ayers was the author , that would be interesting . ' "
Fox " said he had hoped that Cannon would raise the $ 10,000 to run a computer test .
' It was Congressman Cannon who initially pointed me in that direction and , from our conversation , I thought he might be able to find someone [ to raise the $ 10,000 ] . ' "

Updated 7:30 p.m. : news of departure of BitTorrent CEO
As an open - source technology protocol , the file - sharing system BitTorrent is going strong , representing about half the world ’s Internet traffic by some measures .
But the San Francisco company , BitTorrent , is showing signs of serious trouble while it tries to commercialize the technology .
Today BitTorrent informed about half its employees , or 18 people , that they were being let go , according to a person familiar with events inside the company .
That is in addition to a 20 percent staff reduction in August .
In addition , a co-founder , Ashwin Navin , said yesterday that he was leaving the company , although he informed the board of directors of his exit in March .
A person with knowledge of BitTorrent ’s plans also said the company would soon close its BitTorrent Entertainment Network , once conceived — and covered in the press — as a rival to iTunes .
The company , with its remaining 20 employees , will focus on BitTorrent DNA , a content delivery network that helps media and video game companies distribute their products cheaply over the Internet .
Update :
The chief executive , Doug Walker , a Silicon Valley veteran , has also been replaced , according to a company news release .
A spokeswoman for BitTorrent had no comment .
BitTorrent is backed by Accel Venture Partners and DCM , formerly Doll Capital Management .
Good news for commuters , as Transport for NSW has announced that it ’s teaming up with Twitter Australia to launch a convenient and personal alert system .
The service is focussed on “ major disruptions on the suburban and intercity train networks ” , and is geared towards weekday workers with regular commute schedules .
The process is relatively simple , just follow the link on the @TfNSWAlerts account and hit “ Let ’s get started ! ” .
This will give you a personalised link , active for an hour , that takes you to an external site where you can add alerts for both your morning and evening commutes , with each giving you a ‘ From ’ and ‘ To ’ station as well as a time window in which you ’re likely to be travelling .
NSW train commuters can now sign up for alerts on Twitter about delays or disruptions from @TfNSWAlerts .
Here 's how : https://t.co/580zkshwIG pic.twitter.com/uB8yyMfqdPDecember 11 , 2016
Once you ’ve hit “ Save Alerts ” , you ’ll get sent a DM confirming your saved settings , and you ’re done .
If this has you scratching your head , do n’t worry – the handy video above should give you an idea of exactly what to do .
While this is currently a trial , the service should prove to be incredibly useful , giving users even more refined and personalised information to smooth out their workdays .
People use eBay to sell more than just Juicy Couture and used plasmas – you can also find elephant ivory products and endangered animals .
This fact was highlighted recently following a six - week investigation by the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( IFAW ) .
The investigation , tracking more than 7,000 wildlife products listings on 183 websites in 11 countries , discovered that
eBay was responsible for two - thirds of the online trade in wildlife
animal products worldwide .
And of the over 4000 elephant ivory listings uncovered by the investigation , most of the sales took place on eBay ’s U.S. site .
In fact , the investigation found that more than 70 % of all endangered species ’ products listed online for sale happened in the United States .
e Bay ’s response to this disturbing news was to say “ no more ” .
They announced that they are instituting a global ban on the sale of elephant ivory products by January 1 , 2009 – and they want other web sites to do the same .
But this is n’t the first time that eBay has announced a ban on selling
elephant ivory .
Just last year , following an another IWAF report , Bidding for Extinction ( 2007 ) , which found 2,275 ivory items for sale on eight national eBay sites in a single week , eBay announced a ban on cross - border trade in elephant ivory .
IWAF ’s recent investigation and report ( Killing with Keystrokes : An Investigation of the Illegal Wildlife Trade on the World Wide Web ) illustrates the ineffectiveness of that ban and highlights the importance of not only global bans but also better enforcement of these bans .
This latest IWAF report believes that “ a lack of stringent and enforceable legislation that clearly declares trade in endangered wildlife online as a serious criminal offence ” and “ weak monitoring and enforcement ” are two primary reasons why this trade continues and calls on CITIES ( UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ) governments , internet marketplaces , internet service providers , and individuals to work harder to stop illegal wildlife trade over the internet .
Their recommendations :
Enact robust domestic legislation on internet wildlife trade .
Implement and empower effective enforcement .
Increase public awareness .
Devise new ways to monitor and curtail the online trade in endangered wildlife .
e Bay ’s determination to enforce a global ban on elephant ivory is a great step in making this all happen .
But it ’s only one small step and more action must follow .

Ski patrollers are some of the most unappreciated people on the mountain — until you need them in an emergency .
Unless you ’re getting caught for ducking a rope , or careening out of control on a beginner slope , odds are you 're staring at a red coat with a white cross due to an injury .
Getting a sled ride down the mountain is probably not one of the top things you thought of while planning your ski trip .
While many ski injuries are sometimes unavoidable , there are things you can do to help minimize injuries and get your money ’s worth out of your ski vacation , rather than spending it on medical bills .
Choose Your Gear Wisely
Beginning - to intermediate - level riders who rent ski or snowboard gear can sometimes buy the wrong gear .
What will help you the most in this situation ?
Do n't lie about your weight or ability .
Why ?
When you rent skis , the shop will make adjustments ( known as release , or DIN settings ) based on weight and ability , which will help keep you in your skis , but more importantly , get you out of them quickly in case of a bad fall .
The most common skiing injury is a tear to the medial collateral ligament ( MCL ) or anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) in the knees , which is often the result of a ski that stays on your foot as you twist and fall backward on the slope .
Skis and snowboards that are too long , too stiff or too heavy can make a good day go bad very quickly .
Skis that you ca n’t turn quickly can get you into trouble , and heavy skis can tire you out quickly — if you ’re relying on pure strength over technique .
The most critical piece of gear in either skiing or snowboarding is a well - fitting boot — not too big or too small .
Good quality ski socks ( not cotton , and not too thick ) can be your best investment .
A proper boot fit can help avoid blisters , shin splints and the worst discomfort — cold feet .
If you decide to buy your own equipment , look for a shop with a boot - fitting specialist .
Do n’t Get in Over Your Head
Ability - wise , you should always ski or ride with control and avoid terrain that is above your skill level .
On the flipside , you become a better skier by pushing your limits and trying out newer and steeper terrain .
Double black diamonds will come in time , but only after you have sufficient lessons and practice on easier slopes .
Do n’t venture outside of resort boundaries without a qualified guide or the necessary knowledge and equipment if you find yourself in avalanche territory .
Ski etiquette also states that you always are responsible for avoiding people in front of you .
This is especially critical when you are a fast skier coming up on slower beginner skiers , who often take erratic turns and can be difficult to get around .
Shaping Up for Your Ski Vacation
Being in good physical shape is the No. 1 thing you can do to get the most out of your ski trip .
You do n’t need to be an elite athlete , but you ’d be surprised how much a little gym time can make a difference .
Getting physically strong will in turn help you become a stronger skier .
After all , do n’t you want to be able to ski as many runs as you can , every day , without getting exhausted too quickly ?
During the weeks before your trip , look for Pilates - based workouts or sports - specific conditioning classes at your local gym .
In addition , try to concentrate on these key areas :
Cardio Fitness .
Spend three to five days a week , doing at least 45 minutes of cardio work .
It may come in handy at high altitude , and will definitely help if you want to try cross country skiing instead of downhill pursuits .

Core Strength .
Tweaking your back on the hill is n’t fun .
Use an exercise ball to work on abs and back extensions .
If you do feel tired while skiing or snowboarding , it ’s important to listen to your body and take breaks as necessary .
If you ’re on the trail , pull off to the side — never stop in the middle , below a jump or blind rollover .
If you can , head to the closest lodge for water and a snack , and rest for a little while before heading back out .
If you ’ve really overdone it on the slopes in the morning , do n’t overdo it and push yourself to ski all day .
There ’s nothing wrong with quitting a little early if it helps prevent a serious injury .
Besides , there are ( usually ) fewer people in the resort hot tub in the mid-afternoon .

Vote caging exposé
pt. 2
Oh , my …more
Sen .
Whitehouse ( is n’t that the best name for a politician ? ) on vote caging
Have you just set up a new business ?
Or perhaps 2020 is the year you ’ve decided to take the plunge and break out on your own ?
If so then you ’ll probably be wondering how to make your business work and ensure that start making a tidy profit .
Here ’s everything that an aspiring entrepreneur needs to know about becoming a business owner .
1. Work Hard
The first step to success in the business world is to work hard .
Many people think running a business - especially one that involves online trading – is easy and requires little effort or just a few hours a day of commitment .
The truth is you will often be competing with seasoned professionals who know and understand the marketplace .
In the early stages of your business , you need to play catch up and learn as you go .
You will make mistakes and sometimes you will put in hours and days of hard work only to find that you lose a lot of money or have made a fundamental mistake .
But this is part of the process .
The best businessmen and women are all people who have failed but have started again and not given up .
At 30 years old Simon Cowell – today a multimillionaire record producer with his own label and production company – moved back in with his parents because he was bankrupt .
But he succeeded in the end .
2. Know Your Customers
Knowing your customers is important in today ’s climate as everybody can pursue their interests and niches , however small due to the power of the internet .
The world is also more globalized so it ’s easy to sell in places like India , Vietnam , or remote countries in Africa .
They all have their own culture and backgrounds that it ’s important to understand if you are going to tap into that market .
You can do this by doing some market research and visiting the countries you intend to sell to .
If you have a bamboo straw business targeting the developing world then you will no doubt need to understand what would convince a business owner to invest in them and how your product fits in with the local price .
3. Market Well
Marketing is the cornerstone of a good business .
Even if you have the best business concept in the world or the best product aimed at the right audience , it does n’t matter if nobody hears about it .
Marketing in the 2020s is not about bombarding people with messages or costly advertising campaigns that reach a wide range of people .
It ’s about knowing your target customers , even if they are very small , and creating a genuine connection with them .
Part of your market research should also include getting some product design tips on your product from professionals to improve it before you go to market .
Social Media
To establish this you first need to talk to as many different people as you can about your project .
Social media is integral to this .
It allows you to establish a two - way conversation that was previously not possible and to get feedback on your business .
Think carefully about which social media channels would work best for your product .
If you are selling a product or your business is in fashion then Pinterest or Instagram might both be good options .
But if you ’re business is something service - related – perhaps you want to start a life coaching business – then image - based social media platforms would not work well unless you got creative .
Blogging
You can supplement social media by setting up a regular blog with valuable content for potential customers to enjoy .
If you ensure your content is Search Engine Optimized ( SEO ) or you hire an agency to do this for you , you can start to rank highly on Google .
You can then target keywords you think your potential customers will be searching for and bring them to your site .
4. Embrace Remote Working
Finally , as the recent Corona Virus Pandemic has shown , the traditional ways of working are not viable anymore .
Hiring a huge office with loads of overheads and asking your employees to work there can bring with it a host of issues .
It can weigh your business down financially when you could free up that cash as emergency cash flow or to plow it into an investment to help you grow in other ways .
It restricts the people you can employ to a geographical location or means you might have to relocate workers at your expense .
But it ’s also bad for your employees who do n’t get the freedom to live where they want and fit their work around the business .
Happier employees and employees from different perspectives and backgrounds can lead to a happier business environment and ultimately a more productive company .
Get your employees hooked up with laptops loaded with remote working apps such as Zoom , Slack , and Skype .
Aspiring Entrepreneur ?
You Can Do This
If you ’re an aspiring entrepreneur then make 2020 the year you launch the business you ’ve always wanted to .
Listen to your instincts , do your research but above all work hard .
Do n’t be afraid to fail .
Even the most successful entrepreneurs failed many times before they succeded .
What sets them apart from others is their capacity to adapt and learn from their mistakes but also to keep trying , even when the odds are stacked against them .
Finally , do n’t forget to embrace all that the internet has to offer , from marketing opportunities to remote working .

Were people so afraid to appear bigoted that they lied to pollsters , thinking it more socially acceptable to support a black candidate ?
Pollsters and political scientists have long questioned that assumption because they do not believe people have an incentive to deceive unless they are explicitly asked , “ Do you support the white guy or the black guy ? ”
“ We have no evidence that people lie to us , ” said Joe Lenski , executive vice president of Edison Media Research , which conducts the exit polls the television networks use .
He and others say that discrepancy in the polls has more to do with which people decline to participate , or say they are undecided .
Adam Berinsky , a political scientist at M.I.T. who has written about the “ I do n’t know ” voters , points out that while polls overpredicted Mr. Dinkins ’s support in 1989 , they got it right in 1993 , when he was running against the same opponent , Rudolph Giuliani .
In 1989 , Mr. Berinsky argues , people who feared being thought racist said “ I do n’t know . ”
By 1993 , they could find things in Mr. Dinkins ’s mayoral record to object to and so felt more free to express their opposition without fear of seeming racist .
Mr. Kohut conducted a study in 1997 looking at differences between people who readily agreed to be polled and those who agreed only after one or more callbacks .
Reluctant participants were significantly more likely to have negative attitudes toward blacks  15 percent said they had a “ very favorable ” attitude toward them , as opposed to 24 percent of the ready respondents .
“ The kinds of people suspicious of surveys are also more intolerant , ” Mr. Kohut said .
Scott Keeter ,
Pew ’s director of survey research , said pollsters had a harder time reaching voters with lower levels of education .
Less -educated whites are the kind Mr. Obama has had trouble winning over .
Conversely , young people are more likely to answer surveys , and they tend to favor Mr. Obama .
There may be several factors at work : Michael Traugott , a University of Michigan professor who studies polling , argues that the Bradley effect was misnamed from the start ; the problem with the polls in the 1982 race was not that they failed to capture latent racism but that they failed to account for the absentee ballots , which ultimately handed the election to the white Republican , George Deukmejian .
Whatever its causes , the Bradley gap seems to be disappearing .
In a new study , Daniel J. Hopkins , a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard , considered 133 elections between 1989 and 2006 and found that blacks running for office before 1996 suffered a median Bradley effect of 3 percentage points .
Blacks running after 1996 , however , performed about 3 percentage points better than their polls predicted .
Mr. Hopkins argues that the changes in the welfare laws in 1996 and the decline of violent crime took off the table issues that had aggravated racial animosity .
Tory strategy in framing the public financing debate is intellectually dishonest at best
Almost more troubling to me than Jim Flaherty and Stephen Harper ’s plans to scrap public financing of political parties , is the realization that the Prime Minister ’s sycophants over at the Blogging Tories are parroting a particular line of rhetoric that any intellectually honest person would realize does n’t even make sense .
The issue , for those of you who have n’t heard , is that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty wishes to scrap the public financing that the political parties winning more than 2 % of the vote receive .
The rationale he ’s given for this is as a way of cutting federal spending and avoiding a deficit .
But , since the Conservatives only rely on such funding for roughly 37 % of this type of funding as a source of revenue compared to roughly 57 % for the NDP and upwards of two - thirds for the Liberals , Bloc and Greens , this proposal would have the effect of hammering the opposition parties and emaciating the opposition much as Jim Flaherty had promised to do to anyone who stood in his way .
Let ’s cut through the ( insert expletive here ) :
Let ’s ignore the fact even the National Post and the Globe & Mail have called out Harper ’s moves as “ Machiavellian ” and wrong .
Let ’s ignore the fact that it would emaciate the opposition , creating an effective one - party state
I ’d ask Conservatives to have some intellectual honesty for a moment .
Maybe they believe on ideological grounds that the federal government should not be funding political parties despite the fact that virtually every industrialized democracy has some form of funding mechanisms .
That ’s fine .
If Conservatives honestly believe in cutting this funding on its merits , then I could at least respect that and , what is more , we could engage in a debate about that on its merits .
But just read through the comments on TheStar.com ( a favourite spot for Blogging Tory trolls ) and you ’ll see that the Tories ’ sycophants are busy cloaking this debate in the rhetoric of saving money when the total cost of the financing program is less than $ 30 million dollars compared to a federal budget of roughly $ 250 billion .
In other words , this program is less than 0.01 % of federal expenditures according to the government ’s own sources .
If you ’re interested in seeing that graphically , allow me to put that into perspective .
No matter how large I made this pie chart below , I could not make the sliver representing the public financing costs show as more than one pixel across .
Put another way , the distance from my outstretched fingertip to outstretched fingertip is the same as my height ( roughly 5 ’ 10 ” ) .
If I were to chop off 0.01 % of my body – the same percentage as the public funding costs the government — that would be the equivalent of cutting only 1/142nd of an inch .
That ’s less than the width that would be removed by filing my nail once with an emery board .
In fact , it ’s less than one half of the thickness of one sheet of standard 8 ½ x 11 printer paper , given my height .
So please , Conservatives , if you want to cut the public funding of political parties , stop insulting everyone ’s intelligence by telling us that you just want to save the federal budget from deficit .
It ’d be preferable if you just went out there and said that you are extreme right - wing fanatics who would be perfectly contented living in a one party state in order to satisfy your various ideological fetishes .
Really , admitting your problem is the first step to recovery .
( Getting kicked out of government is the second step )

Update : After I wrote this piece , the Conservatives reluctantly agreed to table the one - party state bill as a separate confidence motion rather than attach it to the ways and means money bill which is due for a vote on Monday .
The fact that the Conservatives still plan on proceding with this bill suggests to me that the issue of party financing and the risk of a one - party state remain the central propelling matters irrespective of whether they are included in the bill due for a vote on Monday or not .
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , who just eight years ago was the Democratic Party ’s nominee for vice president , portrayed Senator John McCain Tuesday night as a man who transcends party .
President Bush and former Senator Fred Thompson also appeared .
Wrap Up | 11:11 p.m.
The Lieberman speech was an astonishing moment of political history , for a one - time Democratic vice presidential nominee to be making this speech at a Republican convention and so thoroughly dismiss the current Democratic nominee — and Mr. Lieberman has not even become a Republican !
Take a minute to climb into the way - back machine and imagine yourself in 2000 looking ahead to this moment .
Would you have believed it ?
More Lieberman | 10:59 p.m.
Now he addresses “ my fellow Democrats and Independents , ” saying : “ You may be thinking of voting for John McCain but you ’re not sure .
Some of you may never have voted for a Republican before and in an ordinary election , you probably would n’t .
But this is no ordinary election , because these are not ordinary times , and John McCain is no ordinary candidate . ”
He concludes : “ So tonight , I want to ask you , whether you are an Independent , a Reagan Democrat or a Clinton Democrat , or just a plain old Democrat :
This year , when you vote for President , vote for the person you believe is best for our country , not for the party you happen to belong to . ”
And he urges them to “ vote for the person who has always put America first , ” as if Mr. Obama has n’t .
Dissing the Democrats | 10:54 p.m.
This is not an angry Zell Miller speech .
But it will probably strike many Democrats as just as treacherous in its denigration of Mr. Obama .
“ Only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people .
And that leader is John McCain ! ”
He adds : “ God only made one John McCain , and he is his own man . ”
In tearing down Mr. Obama , he even praises Bill Clinton — remember , Mr. Lieberman was one of the first Democrats ( back then ) to criticize Mr. Clinton for his affair with a White House intern .
“ Senator Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead .
But eloquence is no substitute for a record , ” he says .
“ In the Senate he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done , nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic Party .
Contrast that to John McCain ’s record , to the record of the last Democratic President , Bill Clinton , who stood up to some of those same Democratic interest groups , worked with Republicans and got some important things done like welfare reform , free trade agreements , and a balanced budget . ”
Joe ! | 10:39 p.m.Senator Lieberman is up .
He gets a rousing applause of welcome from the delegates in the hall .
( Prepared Text )
Mr. Lieberman tries to sound bi-partisan , referring to the Hurricane Gustav as a time when we are n’t Republicans or Democrats but Americans .
And yet , he says a moment later , “ being a Democrat or a Republican is important , but it is nowhere near as important as being an American . ”
And now , to the point : “ What , after all , is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this ?
I ’ll tell you what .
I ’m here to support John McCain because country matters more than party . ”
More Thompson | 10:37 p.m .
In one of the biggest lines of the night , Mr. Thompson says , “ We need a president who does n’t think the protection of the unborn is above his pay grade . ”
He was referring to Mr. Obama ’s answer at the Saddleback Church a few weeks ago , when he was asked when life begins and he replied that this was above his pay grade .
( Mr. McCain answered instantly : “ At the moment of conception . ” )
Hanoi | 10:28 p.m. Mr. Thompson recounts the grim details of Mr. McCain ’s captivity in Hanoi as only an actor can , bringing new life to that story .
“ This is the kind of character that civilizations since the beginning of history have sought in their leaders , ” he says .
Mr. McCain has been to Iraq eight times , Mr. Thompson says , “ seeking truth , not publicity . ”
When the war was going badly , Mr. McCain stood up and called for more troops , he says , “ and now we ’re winning . ”
The crowd is chanting “ USA !! ” as it was earlier this evening .
Now back to the red meat .
Mr. Thompson slams Mr. Obama , though not by name , referring to his speech in Berlin as “ a Tel - e - prompter speech designed to appeal to America ’s critics abroad . ”
And he says , again without a name , that Mr. Obama is “ the most liberal , inexperienced nominee ever to run for president . ”
Needless to say , the crowd is roaring .
More Praise for Palin | 10:23 p.m. Also , Mr. Thompson says , she has run a municipality and a state and is “ the only nominee in the history of either party who knows how to properly field - wrestle a moose — with the possible exception of Teddy Roosevelt . ”
He casts her as a fellow reformer with Mr. McCain , also advancing the campaign ’s story line that a maverick presidential nominee has picked a maverick running mate .
When they get to Washington , Mr. Thompson says , “ they wo n’t care how much the alligators get irritated , they ’re going to drain that swamp . ”
Thompson Serves Up Red Meat | 10:20 p.m. Mr. Thompson is here to deliver the cudgel to critics of Sarah Palin , and to the media : “ What a breath of fresh air Gov. Sarah Palin is ! ” he declares .
“ She ’s from a small town with small - town values , but apparently that ’s not good enough for some of the folks out there now attacking her family .
Washington pundits and media big shots are in a frenzy , ” he says , because she has actually governed rather than just talk on the Sunday talk shows and hit the Washington cocktail circuit . ”
( This is clearly a talking point for the McCain camp — we heard nearly the same line from Laura Ingraham , the talk - show host , this afternoon . )
Mr. Thompson says Ms. Palin ’s selection “ has got the other side and their friends in the media in a state of panic .
And no wonder .
She ’s a courageous , successful reformer who ’s not afraid to take on the establishment .
Sound like anybody else we know ? ”
The crowd is loving the red meat .
Reagan , the Movie | 10 p.m .
As soon as Mr. Bush is offstage , there ’s a “ morning - in - America ” bio film of Ronald Reagan on now , and it featured a picture of Mr. Reagan shaking hands with …
John McCain !
Reminiscent , of course , of the picture of Bill Clinton shaking hands with JFK .
This is the lead - in to Fred Thompson , who gets a wild cheer in the hall .
Reaction to Bush Our colleague Sarah Wheaton has the following from the floor :
Jack LaMar Wolfe , attorney , from McAllen , Texas , attorney :
His favorite part of the Bush speech : “ When he talked in such glowing terms about McCain and his military experience . ”
“ There was reason for him not to be that gracious .
They ’ve had some bitter fights . ”
Did n’t think the speech would have been different if Bush had been there in person , except that he would not have talked over the applause and thus cut it off .
“ I mean , there would have been longer applause because there would have been better reaction . ”
“ He knows where the Republican hearts are .
He knows they ’re with him and Laura , ” he said .
Betty Hanes , 72 , of Othello , Wash . : “ I appreciate his service , what he ’s done and what he tried to do .
I did n’t agree with everything he did .
I never agreed with any president we ’ve had .
I think he did always what he thought was best for the country . ”
“ I think his legacy will be higher than his rating is now , ” she said .
Kristine Greene , West Greenwich , R.I. , 44 , wearing a pin that said , “ Thank W ” with pictures of Alito and Roberts – During the speech “ I was thinking I ’m proud to be an American .
I ’m proud to have President Bush as president .
“ I ’m proud that my children have experienced his presidency . ”
Has 7 kids .
She said she admired that he was “ more concerned about doing what was best for our country than what was construed as the popular thing to do . ”
Saying Goodbye | 10 p.m .
This hall is the last great redoubt of support for George W. Bush , and his fans here must be disappointed that they are missing out on the experience of bidding him farewell in person .
Mr. Bush had to finish up just before the opening of prime time .
Laura Bush is back , thanking their supporters , for both her and her husband .
She gives a little wave as she walks off stage by herself .
President Bush | 9:54 p.m. Mr. Bush is standing in what is called the “ Cross Hall ” at the White House ; the Oval Office is reserved for less political , more presidential addresses .
He first mentions Hurricane Gustav , then gives a shout - out to his parents .
( Transcript )
“ I know the hard choices that fall solely to a president , ” he says .
Mr. McCain “ is ready to lead this nation . ”
He ’s now on to Mr. McCain ’s bio .
Cameras are flashing in the hall , even though the president is on a big screen , not here in real life .
In a strikingly partisan remark , Mr. Bush says : “ If the Hanoi Hilton could not break John McCain ’s resolve to do what ’s best for his country , you can be sure that the angry left never will . ”
And then he brings a chuckle , by assuring the crowd that Mr. McCain is not afraid to speak his mind .
“ I know , ” he says .
Mr. Bush is speaking rather softly , and slowly .
We ’ve been told he ca n’t hear the response of the crowd in the hall .
So there ’s an aide standing there with him , behind the camera , who is listening in and signaling to him when to pause for applause .
Straight Talk | 9:50 p.m. Mrs. Bush is giving the convention “ a little straight talk . ”
Her husband is n’t here to polish his record for the history books , so Mrs. Bush is doing it for him .
Among his accomplishments , she says , are : his two appointments to the Supreme Court ( which draws a big cheer here ) ; faith - based initiatives ; a huge increase in the number of Africans being treated for AIDS .
With a twist on Barack Obama ’s slogan , she adds : “ You might call that change you can really believe in . ”
She goes on to say that 50 million people in Iran and Iraq are “ living in freedom . ”
“ And let ’s not forget , President Bush has kept the American people safe , ” which brings a huge ovation from the delegates .
She introduces him , beamed in live from the White House .
Laura Bush | 9:44 p.m. First Lady Laura
Bush just took the stage in the hall and the crowd is enthusiastically cheering .
The Texas delegation stands out , all in their red shirts and waving their cowboy hats .
Mrs. Bush just gave a clue as to how the campaign will frame Gov. Sarah Palin : she hailed her as “ a strong executive and proven reformer . ”
She added , slightly redundantly , that she was proud “ the first female vice president will be a Republican woman . ”
Gearing Up | 9:22 p.m.
Hi everybody .
We ’re going into the hall at the Xcel Center now to watch tonight ’s line - up – starting with President Bush , who will be beamed in from the White House .
It ’s his farewell to his party , and carries a kind of poignancy : he is n’t being given the chance to bid adieu to his most loyal supporters , who are here in St. Paul , in person .
And yet , his father and mother are here .
Moreover , he wo n’t even appear in prime time .
Also we ’ll see Fred Thompson tonight , who is expected to join in with the McCain campaign strategy of blasting the media .
And finally , Senator Lieberman , Mr. McCain ’s wingman , who is being given the final 20 minutes of prime time , wherein some Republicans are predicting he will give us something to remember .
Our colleague Kate Phillips will be twittering tonight ’s events .
And you can watch video here :
Last week , we stumbled upon multiple user reports of intermittent hangs with Seagate ’s 1.5TB Barracuda 7200.11 hard drive .
According to folks on the Seagate support forums , the drives randomly freeze for around 30 seconds at a time in Linux , Mac OS X , and Windows Vista .
Freezes allegedly occur in tasks like streaming video or transferring files at low speeds , and they happen regardless of drive configuration or Serial ATA controller type .
We shot off an e-mail to Seagate last week to inquire about these problems .
We ’ve now received a response from company spokesman Mike Hall , who ’s written the following :
Seagate is investigating an issue where a small number of Barracuda 7200.11 ( 1.5TB SATA ) hard drives randomly pause or hang for up to several seconds during certain write operations .
This does not result in data loss nor does it impact the reliability of the drive but is an inconvenience to the user that we are working to resolve with an upgradeable firmware .
We are therefore asking customers if they feel they are experiencing this issue to give our technical support department a call with any questions .
Affected part number : 9JU138-300 , 336 with firmware revisions SD15 , SD17 , or SD18 .
Support contact information : Technical Support in the USA : 1.800 . SEAGATE ( 1.800.732.4283 ) Technical Support in Canada : 1.405.324.4700
Other regions please go to our support web page : http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/support/
For the record , many users who posted in the Seagate support forums say they ’ve received unhelpful responses from the company ’s support staffers , including some saying the 1.5TB ‘ cuda does n’t support Linux or RAID setups .
( Desktop RAID is still among the list of “ best - fit applications ” on the official product page . )
One user posted about a similar response as early as last Saturday .
RIVERSIDE , Calif . --
Riverside County sheriff 's investigators are trying to decide if a crime was committed when a veteran Los Angeles County fire official crushed a puppy 's skull with repeated blows from rock , but they have been unable to talk to the man .
" For several days , investigators have attempted to contact ( Glynn Johnson ) to ask if he is willing to provide more information about the incident , " Investigator Cherie Blossfield stated Monday .
" Attempts to contact ( Johnson ) by phone , at his home and through his employment have been unsuccessful so far . "
Johnson , 54 , is an assistant chief with the Los Angeles County Fire Department .
He is in charge of several stations in eastern Los Angeles County .
The shepherd mix , Karley , was euthanized after the beating in Johnson 's yard in the 17000 block of Armintrout Drive .
A veterinarian told the owners , Jeff and Shelley Toole , that the dog had a crushed skull and brain damage , among other injuries .
Karley apparently got out of his yard and , about 4:30 that afternoon , neighbor Travis Staggs was walking it dog back to the Tooles .
But Johnson -- another neighbor who lives between the two -- stepped in and said he would take the dog back .
Staggs told KTLA - TV that Johnson started beating the dog without provocation .
Johnson said the dog bit him .
According to Staggs , Johnson tried to break the dog's jaws by prying them apart , then started hitting Karley in the head with a big rock .
Police said they got a call reporting a dog attack about the same time someone else reported the attack on the dog .
Apparently , the Tooles and Johnson had been at odds before Monday .
The Tooles said they planned to sue Johnson even if no criminal charges are filed .
Johnson went to a hospital for treatment of an injured thumb and wrist .
[ Genetic ] variation tends to be shared widely among populations , so race will often be an inaccurate predictor of response to drugs or other medical treatments .
It would be far preferable to test directly the responsible alleles [ genetic variants ] in affected individuals .
Which species is more diverse , humans or chimps ?
Most of us would be tempted to answer ' humans ' .
Unless you 're a primatologist or you work at a zoo , you would likely have trouble telling one chimp apart from another , not to mention distinguishing between West African and Central African chimpanzees .
By contrast , we can easily spot differences among humans - if asked to guess whether someone was from China , Pakistan , or Kenya , few of us would have any trouble getting the answer correct .
By the measure of genes though , humans are amazingly uniform .
Humans are genetically less diverse than chimps , and both chimps and humans are much less diverse than a common species of fruit fly .
Given our species ' long history of racial conflict , our genetic uniformity may come as a surprise .
Not too long ago people in polite company would debate whether different human races really all belonged to one species .
Our DNA tells us that our genetic differences do n't even come close to matching the variety found within a single , apparently monotonous fruit fly species .
How do we measure genetic diversity ?
The basic concept is simple .
Pick a few dozen or a few hundred genes and tally the differences in those genes in a sample of a few dozen or a few hundred people .
Thus at gene A , person 1 and person 2 may differ at 5 DNA bases , while person 1 and person 3 may differ at 7 bases .
After making all of the possible comparisons for gene A , you compute the average number of differences - in the case of gene A let 's say we find an average of 6 differences between any two people .
If gene A is 6000 bases long , we say any two people would differ on average once in every 1000 DNA bases .
But when we look at gene B , we may get a different answer - maybe only an average of one difference every 2000 DNA bases .
To get a good measure of how genetically different humans tend to be , it 's obviously best to get results from many different genes , or even entire genomes .
Most recent studies have found that humans differ on average once in every 1000 - 1500 DNA bases .
Given that we have 3 billion DNA bases in our genome ( just counting one copy - either your maternal or paternal version ) , any two people are likely to differ at about 2 - 3 million positions in their genomes .
That number applies to differences within yourself as well - there are about 2 - 3 million differences between the DNA you inherited from your mother and the DNA you inherited from your father .
( There exist more sophisticated ways of measuring genetic differences , and we could include genetic variants that involve more than just a difference at a single DNA base pair - we could count segments of DNA that have been inserted or deleted , called copy number variants .
However the basic approach to measuring genetic difference that I 've described is all we need here . )
How does this genetic variation stack up against variation in other animals ?
While we tend to differ at 1 position in every 1000 bases or so , chimps differ at about 1 in every 750 bases , and gorillas differ at roughly one in every 650 bases .
The fly species D. melanogaster is much more genetically diverse , and tends to differ at one out of every few hundred bases .
Keep in mind that these estimates are just averages - genetic variation is not spread out evenly across an entire genome .
Some portions of our genomes are highly variable , while others are relatively uniform .
The bottom line is this : although fruit flies and gorillas may look largely the same to us , they beat us hands down in genetic diversity .
Of course the genetic differences that do exist among humans are enough to generate much of the biological diversity we see around us - differences in skin , hair , and eye color , our voices , our physical stature , and our personalities .
Obviously environment plays a big role in many traits , but as the differences between Samoans and Japanese illustrate , genetics can account for a great deal even when there is a large environmental influence .
At first guess , you might think that most of our genetic diversity would fall along racial lines .
Race differences often seem to be the most obvious differences among different human groups , so it would n't be surprising if genetic differences fell along racial lines as well .
Genetically , a white guy like me should be much more similar to my white neighbor than my black one , right ?
Before we get to the answer , let 's fill in some background .
In any discussion of genes and diversity , it is critical to keep in mind one obvious but nevertheless subtle point : only genes that exist in different versions are responsible for our biological diversity .
There may be a gene that is critical for intelligence , but if that gene is absolutely 100 % identical in all humans , then it does not account for differences in intelligence among humans .
We may one day identify all of the genes involved in producing intelligence ( defining intelligence may actually be a harder problem ) , but we wo n't understand the genetic basis of differences in intelligence until we discover the human genetic variation in the genes responsible .
This narrows our species ' genetic palette - not all of the genes responsible for a particular trait will be a source of diversity in that trait .
With the availability of genome - scale tools , researchers have devoted a significant amount of effort in the last eight years to finding those genes that exist in different versions among humans .
We have n't mapped all of this genetic diversity yet , but there is enough to start looking at genetic variation among humans in different parts of the world .
With this new data , we are developing a much more detailed picture of how races differ genetically .' Race ' though , is a horribly sloppy term .
Geneticists prefer to speak about populations , not out of political correctness but because race is extremely imprecise .
We 've all filled out some form or another asking whether we are Black , White , Hispanic , or ' none of the above . '
It 's obvious that this is much less informative than knowing whether someone 's ancestry is African , Australian Aborigine , European , or East Asian .
Thus researchers like Richard Lewontin have argued that " As a biological rather than a social construct , ' race ' has ceased to be seen as a fundamental reality characterizing the human species .
" Race may be too imprecise to be biologically meaningful , but there has to be some biological reality behind the obvious physical differences in different human populations , right ?
Yes , there are genetic differences between different human populations , but the big surprise is this : genetic differences between human populations are few compared to the differences within human populations .
Here is what that means :
If you compare my genome with that of a Chinese grad student down the hall from me , you 'll find that only tiny fraction of the 2 - 3 million differences between us tells you much about our ancestry .
Among Chinese , there may be a tendency to have a DNA base ' G ' at position XYZ in gene ABC on chromosome 12 , while among Europeans ( where my ancestors came from ) , there is a tendency to have an ' A ' at that same position .
What we find though , in almost all cases , is that these tendencies are not absolute : 90 % of Chinese may have base ' G ' , while the other 10 % have base ' A ' .
And maybe 70 % of Europeans have base ' A ' at position XYZ , while 30 % have base ' G ' .
So in other words , the fact that my Chinese friend has base ' G ' at position XYZ in gene ABC does not tell you with certainty that he 's Chinese .
In fact both my Chinese friend and I may have the base ' G ' at that same position , even though it is less likely in my case .
If you look at any one gene , you do n't get enough information to make an accurate call .
In order to really see differences among human populations , you have to look at many genes ( or any place in the genome where humans vary - it does n't have to be a gene ) .
In the Chinese population , base ' G ' may be common at position XYZ on chromosome 12 , base ' T ' may be more common at position TUV on chromosome 6 , etc. , etc .
So once you look at dozens or hundreds of informative positions , you can say with high confidence , ' this person is Chinese , and that one is European . '
( And of course we could all be American or Canadian or British by birth - we 're obviously talking about ancestral populations here . )
By examining enough genes , we can reliably use just DNA to correctly assign people to ancestral geographical populations .
Researchers can do it blindly - they can look at DNA sequence for 1,000 people whose identities are hidden , and use DNA information to assign those people to geographical populations .
Once the assignments are made , the researchers take a peek at the true identities of their sample group , and it turns out that their assignments are extremely accurate .
But here is where it gets paradoxical : while there are enough genetic differences among human populations to make accurate classifications , those genetic differences make up only 5 - 15 % of the total amount of genetic variation .
Most of the genetic variation among humans has nothing to do with differences in populations .
The genetic differences between ' races ' are minor compared to the differences between people in general .
So what does this mean about the biological differences we can observe directly ?
One key area where this has implications is medicine .
This result suggests that race is not actually a very good predictor of medical outcomes ( at least those based on genetics , not lifestyle ) .
Let 's take a classic case :
There is a genetic variant in an angiotensinogen gene that substantially increases one 's risk for developing high blood pressure .
This genetic variant shows up fairly frequently among some African populations , in up to 90 % of the population in some cases .
But , like most medically important genetic variation , it shows up in other populations as well .
30 % of Europeans also have this genetic variant .
Suppose there is a blood pressure drug that is ineffective in people with this particular angiotensinogen genetic variant .
If you simply make treatment decisions on the basis of race , you will frequently make the wrong call - some Africans who would benefit would n't get the drug , and a fair number of Europeans who do n't benefit would be given a useless prescription .
As University of Utah geneticist Lynne Jorde argues ( PDF ) : When it comes to medically important traits , we need to avoid typological thinking - when we consider genetic variation as a whole , humans do n't fall neatly into racial or population categories .
Yes , a minor fraction of genetic variation enables scientists to accurately categorize people by ancestral population , but the vast majority of the variation that produces diversity in our susceptibility to disease , response to drugs , and even our behavior does not fall neatly along racial lines .
All human populations overlap substantially in their genetic diversity .
The debate over race and intelligence has a long and tarnished history , although that does n't mean it 's not a legitimate scientific question to address .
However , the debate has taken place almost entirely outside modern genetics , falling instead within the realm of psychology ( such as work done by Arthur Jensen ) .
Some writers would have you believe that science is converging on a consensus that the ' IQ ' gap between various races is genetic ( and that liberal conspirators are trying to cover it up ) .
That claim is false .
Researchers have not identified a single genetic variant with an impact on intelligence that falls along population lines .
In fact several studies have recently tested variants in genes that appear to be involved in controlling brain size .
No correlation with intelligence was found .
Yes , genetics does play a significant role in intelligence , and many other traits .
But there is simply no genetic evidence ( and I mean real genetics , not psychology ) for genetic differences in intelligence between human populations .
Why is this so ?
Other traits , like skin color , obviously fall along population lines .
While skin color is obviously not a 100 % reliable predictor , skin color is a major indicator of race .
Irish , Kenyans , Pakistanis , and Chinese populations all have clearly different skin tones .
It turns out , not surprisingly , that the genetic variation for some ( but not all ) skin color genes does in fact follow population divisions , in contrast with most other genetic variation .
This is most likely because skin color differences end up being relatively simple - a single variant of a gene ( causing lighter skin , for example ) can easily become common in a population through natural selection .
The result is that you have different human populations with dramatic differences in skin color .
Other traits , however , are much more complex than skin color .
Physical differences which are determined not by one , but many different genetic variants , are unlikely to split neatly by population .
Intelligence is probably one of the most complex traits humans possess .
It is almost certainly affected by variants in many different genes , and many of those genes have other important functions in the body .
That means this : two different human populations could have easily developed differences in skin color between them , but differences in intelligence would have been extremely hard to develop , by chance or by natural selection .
Racial conflict has long been a part of human societies .
Along with that conflict has come frequent speculation ( most famously , but not exclusively among whites with European ancestry ) that one race is inferior to another .
Some have been worried that modern genetics would substantiate that belief , but our best genetic evidence to date shows those worries unfounded .
Genetics does play a large role in the diversity we find among human beings .
That diversity , in spite of some dramatic but superficial exceptions like skin color , is shared in common among all races .

Sarah Palin ’s perpetual presidential campaign continued today , as she told reporters that she thinks she represents something more than a celebrity .
She represents hard working American families .
She also represents ignorance and the politics of division .
Palin told reporters at the Republican Governors Association meeting that she does n’t think that she is the future of her party , “ I do n’t think it ’s me personally , I think it ’s what I represent .
Everyday hardworking American families _ a woman on the ticket perhaps represents that .
It would be good for the ticket .
It would be good for the party .
I would be happy to get to do whatever is asked of me to help progress this nation . ”
Palin no more believes the above statement , than she believed that John McCain was going to win the election .
The interesting thing is that both Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana both seem to have targeted Palin .
Pawlenty said today that drill baby drill is not an energy policy , while Jindal was on cable news yesterday stating his belief that the GOP needs to change , and get away from divisive social conservative politics , and return to discussing the big issues that all Americans are worried about .
Advertisements
Pawlenty , Jindal , and Palin all see a leadership vacuum in their party and they are battling to fill it .
Palin is the bigger celebrity and whether she likes it or not , she is more famous for her shopping spree and gaffes than she is for knowledge and policy .
I think Palin has bought into her own hype , and she is making a big mistake by trying to stay in the media spotlight .
She is not going to be able to fix her image by giving more interviews to Fox News , Matt Lauer , and Larry King .
If anything her little media blitz is going to lead to overexposure .
The best way for Palin to become a serious candidate for president in 2012 or beyond would be to go back to Alaska , learn something about policy , keep a low profile , and if Ted Stevens ’ seat comes open , run for the Senate .
I think her fifteen minutes of fame have long been up , so if she wants to be taken seriously , she is going to have quietly go off and get some real experience and knowledge .
The biggest problem for her is that she represents the socially conservative element of the party , and as 2006 and 2008 have proven , social conservatives alone can’t win an election for the GOP .
Palin carried a negative approval rating with Independent voters for over a month of the campaign .
I think that both Jindal and Pawlenty are correct in believing that if Republicans are going to get back on track , they need to start talking about policy , and expand their base .
Right now , Palin can do neither , which is why she would be a terrible choice to lead the party .
I do n’t think it matters who comes out of this leading their party , because if Obama governs half as well as he is capable of , he will romp to a second term .
That preoccupation extends , of course , far beyond JFK to the rest of his family .
A recent example is the exhibit of Jackie Kennedy ’s clothing that traveled last year from the JFK Library and Museum in Boston to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
In “ Costumes From Camelot ” ( December 2001 Atlantic ) , Caitlin Flanagan reviewed this traveling exhibit and its accompanying catalogue .
Although aware that the Kennedy family is far from perfect —
“ For the cynical , the entire Kennedy enterprise is a kind of all - you - can - eat buffet of hypocrisy and untrammeled personal ambition " — she nevertheless admitted that she is not immune to the star - struck adulation that the family tends to inspire :
When it comes to looking at pictures of the Kennedys , I fall into a kind of stupor , and everything I know about the bad marriage and the political misdeeds ... flies out of my head , the way the times table used to the moment the test paper was set down on my desk ....
It is impossible for me to look at these pictures and not impose on them the exact sort of narrative that inspired the family to make themselves so available to photographers in the first place .
It is this irresistible allure of the Kennedy family that Steven Stark explored in “ The Cultural Meaning of the Kennedys ” ( January 1994 Atlantic ) .
The Kennedys , Stark explained , were the first political family whose image was as strongly embedded in the public consciousness as that of Hollywood stars .
Even the family ’s unusual number of untimely deaths , he suggested — as with many movie and music stars — only served to magnify the legend .
Dying young freezes the stars at their peak : like the promise of Hollywood itself , they remain forever young and beautiful — the perfect icons for the immortality that films and records purport to offer .
The public ’s sense of familiarity and personal investment with the Kennedy family , Stark argued , has been formed in part by watching the family weather tragedy after tragedy and by following the ubiquitous tabloid coverage of their lives .
The Kennedys , he pointed out , are commonly referred to by their first names :
Jack , Jackie , Bobby , Ethel , Teddy — just as we once knew Elvis , Marilyn , and Ringo , but certainly not as we have known Franklin , Ronald , or even Bill .
The Kennedy men are well known for their rather public life of wine , women , and song ( or its modern equivalent ) , an existence that approximates life on the road for a rock star .
This phenomenon has rippled out to the current generation of Kennedys , with JFK Jr. inheriting this life of public scrutiny .
In “ Playing Nick Carraway ” ( June 2002 Atlantic ) Thomas Mallon reviewed American Son : A Portrait of John F. Kennedy Jr. , a book by George magazine ’s executive editor , Richard Blow .
Mallon criticized
Blow for hypocrisy and a lack of discretion , pointing out that although Blow self - righteously praised his own restraint in the media furor that followed JFK Jr. ’s death , as soon as George folded Blow wrote at great length about JFK Jr. and things that went on behind closed doors .
Mallon pointed out that despite Blow ’s attempts to portray himself as impervious to the lure of fame , his own words give him away :
Recollecting a bit of touch football played during a winter snowfall , he writes , “ Romping like a kid , I forgot that I was throwing a football around the streets of Manhattan with John F. Kennedy Jr. , substituting in a ritual he usually performed with his famous family . ”
This is not , of course , what Blow “ forgot ” ; it ’s what he most remembers .
“ I would respect and protect John , ” he recalls thinking in early 1996 .
“ I would do my utmost to stand by him .
But I would not be seduced by him . ”
Well , we ’ll be the judge of that .
Moreover , although George magazine was purportedly about contemporary political culture , Mallon argues that it was such a mediocre publication —
( “ A typical issue of George could n’t sustain the reader ’s attention for a forty - minute shuttle flight between New York and Washington ” ) — that in truth it became more about JFK Jr. ’s celebrity .
There was , Blow writes , “ one question none of us wanted to ask :
Were readers buying George because they liked the magazine or to get a glimpse of John ? ”
Let me answer that question : to get a glimpse of John .
It is easy , of course , to become so distracted by the Kennedy legend that one loses sight of who John F. Kennedy Sr. really was and what he stood for .
An article Kennedy wrote during his first year in the Senate , “ New England and the South : The Struggle for Industry ” ( January 1954 Atlantic ) reveals aspects of Kennedy ’s persona that are sometimes lost in the Hollywood - style myths .
In it , Kennedy ’s thoughtful and rigorous arguments show Kennedy to be a policy - maker genuinely concerned with social justice and economic vitality .
The article , which explored the issue of industry migrating from New England to the South , did not simply regard the phenomenon as a matter of competition between regions .
Rather , he analyzed the issue from several angles and expressed concern about the reasons for which the migration was occurring .
It was clear to him that a number of companies were moving south “ for causes other than normal competition and natural advantages . ”
There was less unionization among southern workers , he pointed out , so many companies were moving there in hopes of exploiting cheap labor .
Although he hoped for continued prosperity for southern industries , he did not wish them to thrive on unfair practices , and he advocated countrywide standards for worker benefits and compensation :
The minimum wage , Walsh - Healey , Taft - Hartley , unemployment compensation , and social security laws must be improved to prevent the use of sub - standard wages , anti-union policies , and inadequate social benefits as lures to industrial migration .
Further evidence of Kennedy ’s social vision lies in his vested interest in the arts .
Both he and Jackie Kennedy are remembered for emphasizing the importance of culture in public life , and for bringing artists of all types to visit and perform at the White House .
An avid admirer of Robert Frost , Kennedy asked the poet to give a reading at his inauguration .
In a reciprocal gesture , several months after Frost ’s death ( less than a month before his own assassination ) , Kennedy gave a speech at Amherst College in Frost ’s honor .
In it , he argued that the role of the artist as a critic and commentator is as important as that of the politician .
( The speech was reprinted in the February 1964 Atlantic . )
The men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nation ’s greatness , but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable , especially when the questioning is disinterested , for they determine whether we use power or power uses us .
Our national strength matters ; but the spirit which informs and controls our strength matters just as much .
This was the special significance of Robert Frost .
He ended the speech with a focus on a grand future he envisioned for his country :
I look forward to a great future for America  a future in which our country will match its military strength with our moral strength , its wealth with our wisdom , its power with our purpose .
I look forward to an America which will steadily raise the standards of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all our citizens .
And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world , not only for its strength but for its civilization as well .
And I look forward to a world which will be safe , not only for democracy and diversity , but also for personal distinction .
“ A nation reveals itself , ” he proclaimed , “ not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors , the men it remembers . ”
Little did he suspect that in a few short weeks he , too , would be a man to be honored and remembered .
The Best Undiscovered Playstation 2 ( PS2 ) Games
If you ’ve played all the blockbuster games on the PS2 ( or PS3 ) already and need to dig into the lesser - known - but - equally - exciting games , this is the guide for you .
I ’ve had long discussions with many experienced PS2 owners in order to determine a list of all the best PS2 games that most people have n’t played ( or possibly even heard of ) .
Much like previous entries in the Hidden Gems series , this guide is divided up by genre to help you find games that suit your tastes .
Since the PS2 library is so immense and filled with so many wonderful titles ( and also has had a lot of exposure over the years ) , I wanted to get more particular about which games I include in this Hidden Gems feature .
If I were to have compiled this a year or two ago , you would have seen a number of titles that have since gained popularity and edged into mainstream .
The games I ’m thinking of include Katamari Damacy , Shadow of the Colossus , the Viewtiful Joe Series , Disgea , Okami , Odin Sphere , Guilty Gear , Beyond Good & Evil , and Rez .
So when you notice I do n’t list these games below , you ’ll know why .
Instead I hope you find a number of games that you have n’t heard of ( or at least not much ) that catch your eye and eventually provide you with hours of enjoyment ..
So far most of these are n’t yet on the PS2 Rare and Valuable list , so scoop some out before they get pricier !
A special thanks to those the contributed their game summaries : BulletMagnet , NebachadnezzaR , bonegolem , roushimsx , Perseid , executioner , and everyone else in the forum that pitched in with ideas !
If you have more games to share , please use the comments section below and I ’m terribly sorry if we overlooked your personal favorite !
Action Adventure
Ico
One of the earlier PS2 titles , Ico is an epic adventure that serves as the spiritual predecessor of the late PS2 blockbuster , Shadow of the Colossus .
It ’s minimalist game design , awe - inspiring animations , puzzle - solving elements and a touch of platforming helped Ico achieve critical acclaim , but it was n’t enough to get it the mainstream attention that it deserved — even after the boost from the Shadow of the Colossus release .
From Adrenaline Vault ’s Review : “ Ico is one of those rare titles that you do n’t so much play as experience .
Many adventure games boast this same interactivity and immersiveness , but with its careful blending of genres , delicate balancing act between a story of growing love and mounting horror , and a brilliant system that also incorporates tense moments of action , Ico really lives up to its claims . ”

Drakan : The Ancient ’s Gates
Sequel to the PC game Order of the Flame , Drakan on the PS2 is an action / adventure game where you fight on the ground and in the air , on the back of your dragon .
The ground parts play in a style similar to Tomb Raider , a blend of action , exploration and puzzle - solving in a medieval - fantasy setting more reminiscent of RPG’s .
This game actually has some RPG elements , like a quest system or the ability to level up Rynn , the main character , but overall it ’s more Legend of Zelda than Final Fantasy , with a bigger emphasis on exploration and combat instead of a complex story or party management .
The flying parts , where you fly mounted on Arokh ’s back , on the other hand are obviously more action oriented , with the dragon basically scorching every creature who dares to block his path , making for a nice change of pace that prevents the game from getting too repetitive .
From Armchair Empire ’s Review : “ Approaching twenty hours of gameplay , the value of the game is very high , and , in the end , the game simply feels like such a labor of love that it is hard not to like it .
The attention to detail , the story , the action , the graphics — everything about the game is solid and well thought out .
Anyone who likes fantasy adventure games is likely to be happy with their purchase ”

Action Platformer
Psychonauts
Despite having a decent amount of pre-launch hype , receiving praise from critics , being the product of Tim Schafer ( of Monkey Island and Grim Fandango fame ) , and being down - right fascinating and hilarious , Psychonauts failed to rack up big sales on any of the three platforms it was released on .
Due to word - of - mouth aftermarket sales of the game have picked up a bit , but far to many gamers still have n’t given this one a chance .
From 1UP ’s Review : “ It could be the best adventure game Schafer has ever produced , and I do n’t say that lightly .
His games are renowned for their humor , writing , and in Grim Fandango ’s case thrillingly unique setting , but looked at purely in gameplay terms , they did n’t always work : often , the puzzles were dragged down by arbitrary - seeming solutions ( the anchor puzzle in Grim Fandango being a prime example ) .
That ’s all gone from Psychonauts , which carefully draws from the best of the modern 3D adventure genre to incorporate puzzles which always have a solution at hand somewhere in the level , and there are always enough subtle but real clues to help you find the answer . ”

Klonoa 2 : Lunatea ’s Veil
The original Kloana was also a hidden gem on the PS1 , and while the sequel maintains its 2D platformer feel , it ’s now using 3D graphics to give it a more modern look .
Do n’t expect a great story or intense challenges from Klonoa 2 , but you will be treated to some great visuals and lots of fun .
From Gamespot ’s Review : “ Because of its airtight gameplay , awesome visuals , and great soundtrack , Klonoa 2 is an almost perfect platform game–almost .
You ’ll wish that the game were longer , and if you ’re experienced with games of this kind , you ’ll probably wish it were a little tougher too .
Still , Klonoa 2 is a pleasure to play from start to finish .
It ’s a must - have for fans of platform games , and all PlayStation 2 owners ought to give it a try . ”

Kim Possible : What ’s the Switch
Do n’t write this one off just because it ’s based on a Disney kids TV series .
Every so often a Disney - licensed game manages to surprise us with solid gameplay .
If you are a fan of 16 - bit platformers , this Kim Possible installment should impress you with its two - dimensional gamplay coated and cartoony 3D graphics .
The difficulty level is n’t too high since its aimed for kids , but there is a challenge in trying to unlock everything .
From IGN ’s Review :
The world of Kim Possible is very cartoonish and uses the 2.5 - dimensional style of Viewtiful Joe .
All the action is side - scrolling with plenty of platforming , but it is a 3D world and the camera moves around to take advantage of this .
The fighting is all right and a little bit of a challenge , but the real star of the game is the environment and learning how to explore it …
Like with Viewtiful Joe , the moves may be simple , but the uses can be complicated .
There are loads of hidden coins and items to find on each of the levels and getting them all is a pretty serious challenge that takes some observation .
It ’s definitely not easy , but it is rewarding . ”

Adventure
Indigo Prophecy / Fahrenheit
If you are in the mood for an especially cinematic experience in your adventure games and enjoy mystery thrillers , you really need to look into Indigo Prophecy ( known as Fahrenheit outside of North America ) .
You follow Lucas Kane , your ordinary guy who manages to unconsciously commit a random act of murder .
As if that was n’t intriguing enough , the game also changes the plot and the outcome based on the decisions you make throughout .
From Gaming Age ’s Review : “ Summing up , the Indigo Prophecy is unique , artistic , immersive and beautiful .
There ’s no reason in the world why any self - respecting gamer should n’t have this game in their collection .
The relatively short completion time ( first play through took me just over 10 hours ) is a bit of a drawback , but if you think of this in terms of movies then it ’s easily an epic – and I think the competence of the story - line aptly matches any Hollywood blockbuster . ”

Gregory Horror Show
Gregory Horror
Show , grossly easy but it ’s got to be a shoe - in for hidden gems , very few people have heard of this game , but a truly unique visual style and characters combined with flawless gameplay and nice timed mechanic make it a great game to play .
It ’s quite short though ( but very cheap : P ) .
From Eurogamer ’s Review : Presented in a familiar third person ‘ action - adventure ’ style , the game borrows plenty of gameplay mechanics from the Resident Evil series , and on that basis could be considered a surreal survival horror offspring .
Much like any other game in that sub -genre , the idea is to wander around collecting seemingly unconnected objects , book fragments , health promoting herbs , and – most crucially – spy on the oddball occupants as much as possible ; while they ’re going about their business , when they ’re sleeping , or when they ’re just having a little think to themselves … .
Although it ’s peppered with a few fundamental niggles that detract from the overall experience , GHS is without question a charming adventure that will have you beaming at its dementedness .
Congratulations to Capcom for spotting the fact that this would n’t have worked at full price ; at twenty quid it ’s definitely well worth a punt if you have a lateral mind and you ’re thirsting for something slightly left field .
If only every publisher could be so experimental .

Everblue 2
A wonderful game of the shamefully neglected underwater genre , great game design , great missions , the “ pacing ” ( to use a fashionable word ) is perfect , collecting and exploration ( two basic important elements of game design ) are at times brilliantly executed .
In the end , Everblue 2 is worthwhile having , worthwhile playing , and a gem of every collection .
From GameSpy ’s Review : “ The central gameplay element of the diving sequence is the Multi -Sonar , which you can equip with different modules to search for different types of objects , such as metal , wood , and glass .
You press the L1 button to release a sonar pulse , and then listen for a bounce - back ; the shorter the time between the initial and reflected pulse , the closer you are to an object .
( No bounce - back means no items nearby . )
It ’s an addictive and lucrative gameplay mechanic — there ’s a lot of junk in Valentir ’s reef …
Everblue 2 is a unique and compelling experience … and exactly the kind of fresh approach that the role - playing genre so desperately needs .
It ’s laidback , good - natured , and a fine example of the quirky game design that only the Japanese seem to deliver ”

Disaster Report
A very original game which is essentially a survival horror game , but without any enemies .
The only threat in your way is the aftershocks of a massive earthquake .
It ’s a relatively low - budget title and this mainly shows up in the sound design , framerate issues and animation .
It ’s very enjoyable though and a great diversion from the typical “ horror ” game .
It ’s sequel , Raw Danger , can also be found in the additional list below .
From GameCritic ’s Review : “ Besides the ambiance and concept , the game ’s direction is exemplary in its forward - moving pace .
Disaster Report never feels slow or bogged down , and there ’s almost no backtracking to be done — always a plus in my book .
Add to that some late - game plot twists , several path - altering choices , a wide variety of obstacles to overcome , multiple endings to discover , and a wealth of small touches ( like your character ’s clothing deteriorating with each narrow escape ) and you ’ve got a progressively energetic game set in a fantastic locale : one step beyond everyday life .
Though it was totally unappreciated due to lackluster graphics and a semi-sketchy camera , anyone looking deeper than Disaster Report ’s surface will find more than enough heart to satisfy . ”

Haunting Ground / Demonto
A “ survival ” horror game in the truest sense , Haunting Ground ( known as Demento in Japan ) leaves you as completely weaponless young girl ( but with the aid of a dog ! ) against a series of pursuers .
The plot reminds me of 18th century Gothic novels with its Italian castle setting , the atmosphere is similar to that of a slasher movie .
The game ’s best feature is probably the sense of danger it can convey : the pursuers know how to give a scare , and most are so perversely twisted that they manage to get on your nerves on more than one way .
From GamingTarget ’s Review : “ No , Haunting Ground is n’t a fiendish fear - quenched fright - fest like I ’d hoped it be .
But , the game does have something else .
He ’s called Hewie , a compatible AI - controlled pooch , who with his smarts makes playing the already used Clock Tower - esque hide - and - seek system in Haunting Ground all the more intriguing .
Where the Clock Tower series always employed its notion for being the victim in a stalker ’s nightmarish world in a very mundane and ordinary fashion , Haunting Ground does so with a zing .
You get a gorgeous girl , a habitual cur , and the enemies in a rapacious formula that is n’t the most astonishingly magnetic , but it ’s better off than the ones in any of the Clock Tower games .
Besides , where Resident Evil 4 failed to outright drill terror into its players ’ senses , Haunting Ground succeeds on a couple accounts in delivering bits of spooky surprises .
That ’s got to count for something . ”

Mech - Based Action
Zone of the Enders : The 2nd Runner
The first Zone of the Enders game gained some attention near the beginning on the PS2’s life as it was associated with Hideo Kojima ’s team and came packaged with the then - unreleased demo of Metal Gear Solid 2 .
This sequel continues the epic story of the original , but turns every aspect up a few notches , resulting in one of the greatest , most cinematic action games on the system ( especially for anime fans ) .
From IGN ’s Review : “ In the realm of robotic videogames there are two distinct types of play that enthusiasts can choose from : action / shooter and straightforward simulation .
Zone of the Enders : The 2nd Runner qualifies as the former without even so much as a hint of similarity to the simulation breed .
A balls out action game in every sense of the word , its design and pacing is n’t meant for the type of crowd that worships titles like Armored Core or Carnage Heart …
Zone of the Enders : The 2nd Runner is a dazzling masterpiece of high tech production .
Obviously a much - loved project by its renowned producer Hideo Kojima and designer Shuyo Murata , ZOE2 has taken admirable steps towards melding cinema with gameplay .
The action - enabled counterpart to Namco ’s Xenosaga Episode 1 , The 2nd Runner is n’t so much a videogame as it is an all - encompassing experience . ”

R.A.D. ( Robot Alchemic Drive )
The main difference between R.A.D. and your typical mech game is in the way you control your robot .
Instead of sitting in a cockpit or having a dynamic third - person perspective , you have remote control from the point of view of a human character on the ground .
This requires you to strategically position your human character someplace where you can see the action , but not so close that you get killed .
Being able to control your giant robot as a kid that is running around , hiding through buildings , flying with your powers to a rooftop , or just standing on your robot ’s shoulder to be closer to the action just makes it so interesting .
From Gamespy ’s Review : “ While the fighting is outrageous and fun as heck , the story that ties it all together gets weirder by the moment .
The dialogue is straight out of a stunningly bad movie — the type of flick that plays forever at midnight showings where everyone yells out the line before the actors do .
A horrified high school girl turns to her friend , the pink - skirted hero Yui , and screams , “ How can you control a robot ?
Robots are terrible .
A robot killed grandma . ”
For some reason , though , it does n’t come off as camp .
Yes , it ’s goofy and not something that an actual human being might say , but within the context of the game it makes sense .
To her , robots are terrible .
A robot did kill grandma ..
Robot Alchemic Drive is a breath of fresh air .
When was the last time you used your Dual Shock controller to control a character who ’s using a device that looks an awful lot like a Dual Shock controller ?
RAD is a wonderful title that should be on every gamer ’s must - try list .
It ’s unlike anything else out there — and that ’s saying a lot .
It ’s fun , challenging , and it left this jaded reviewer as giddy as a schoolgirl — in this case , a schoolgirl that happens to control a 120 - foot tall robot . ”

Flight Action
Sky Gunner
Altus may be known from importing some quality RPGs to other parts of the world , but Sky Gunner proves they has a keen eye for games in other genres as well .
Sky Gunner ’s gameplay mechanics have often been compared to those of the Panzer Dragoon games minus the rails .
You have much more freedom of movement , but have the lock - on abilities like those in Panzer Dragoon .
Overall , the action is solid and its evident that there was much attention to detail when developing Sky Gunner .
Any gamer that enjoys flight - based combat definitely need to look into this gem .
From Gaming Age ’s Review : “ Sky Gunner a shooter fan ’s dream , and it ’s chock full of personality and presentation … I [ also ] love that more thought was put into this shooting engine than just “ take down all the enemies ” .
The scoring system really outlasts the story mode as far as replayability goes , and the key to it all is it ’s fun over and over again .
Sky Gunner is really easy to just pick up and play , and you wo n’t feel obligated to play for extended periods of time to enjoy it .
A small case of the jaggies and some really bad bouts with slowdown smudge an otherwise pristine experience .
Sky Gunner should really only be avoided by the most adamant anti-shooter type gamers . ”

Heatseeker
Heatseeker is an arcade - style flight combat game — like Ace Combat , but even less realistic .
The controls are really accessible , and it ’s completely balls - to - the - wall , sort of like After Burner but with freedom of movement .
Of course , this is n’t the type of game that usually wows critics , so most of the review scores are quite low , but if you ’re into games like this , you should get a kick out of it .
From Game Chronicles ’s Review : “ Heatseeker is certainly not a game for everyone , and even the flight sim enthusiast may be a little turned off by it ’s over simplification of aerial combat .
But , for short bouts of intense and mindless arcade action , this game definitely fits the bill .
Because unrealistic as it may be , Heatseeker is not a game that tries to be .
The game is very much an over the top , exaggerated representation of aerial combat and pulls it off wonderfully .
Heatseeker is an easy recommendation to any fan of the Top Gun or Iron Eagle movies , but die - hard simulation fans may want to drop their flares and break right . ”

On - Rails Shooter / Light Gun Shooter
Killer 7
It received a decent amount of buzz due to it ’s graphical style , originality , and bizarre setting , but not very many gamers actually gave this one a chance .
Killer7 is also hard to classify into a genre .
It is essentially an on - rails shooter , but it has a first - person perspective and has the feel of a survival horror adventure .
Anyway , if you like dark games and crave something out of the ordinary , score a copy of Killer7 .
From IGN ’s Review : “ I expect that Killer 7 is going to be one of the most debated games of the year .
I ’m well aware that some people hate the title , just as others love it .
Capcom has clearly emphasized story and style over good old - fashioned control mechanics and that is unequivocally the adventure ’s biggest problem .
The control setup , which lacks true freedom , feels like an archaic step backward when compared to today ’s more traditional games .
And yet , at the same time it ’s not an adventure - ruining choice for me , in the same way that the point - and - click mechanics of Myst did n’t ruin that experience .
Control remains very functional .
It ’s just radically different .
Players who can look beyond the control mechanics will find a truly bold and intriguing adventure game lurking within Killer 7 ’s beautiful cel - shaded visuals .
This is a game that oozes style from beginning to end and also one with a story so brutally off - the - wall that it practically demands your attention .
It ’s also a game that offers big rewards in the vein of gorgeous and lengthy cut -scenes for players who keep at it . ”

Third Person Shooter
Crimson Sea 2
The original game in this epic sci - fi shooter series was an XBox exclusive , but PS2 owners got treated to the much - improved sequel .
The developers at Koei did an excellent job refining the controls , pacing , and the upgrade system throughout the game .
And of course , Crimson Sea 2 still has the intense shooting and slashing of aliens , interesting characters and storyline that built its cult fanbase .
From GameSpy ’s Review : “ The gameplay is best described as Phantasy Star Online meets Devil May Cry. From IAG
Headquarters , you can choose one of several available missions and teleport down to the planet where the mission takes place …
The combat system is one of the best you ’re likely to see in an action game of this sort .
It ’s so solid that Crimson Sea 2 ’s “ kill everything that moves ” formula does n’t become stale or tedious until quite late in the game , which is a huge accomplishment for a game based on such a simple concept .
Expert gamers will love the variety of techniques and play styles available , but impatient button - mashers who just want to dive into the game will still be able to make a great deal of progress as they naturally pick up the more advanced combat techniques . ”

Psi-Ops : The Mindgate Conspiracy
Even though it was promoted quite heavily , Psi-Ops was n’t given much of a chance by mainstream gamers .
That ’s a real shame considering it tried so had to be original and innovative and was relatively successful in its goals .
In Psi-Ops , you do n’t rely too much on your standard weapons , but as you progress , you unlock a number of psychic powers , which eventually become your “ weapons ” of choice .
The game also features some excellent physics ( thanks to the Havok engine ) that adds an extra layer of polish on an excellent game .
From IGN ’s Review : “ Midway has done an incredible job , not just with creating a new franchise , expanding upon an overdone genre , and improving upon an established set of super - powered mind - weapons , but with creating a game that is of worth .
It ’s a simple bit of praise that ’s hard to appreciate until you ’ve played Psi-Ops through to the end and can reassure yourself that while struggling with a sometimes clunky camera and a few inappropriate design decisions , you ’re still having an immense amount of fun in what is an ultimately well put together , well thought out , and surprisingly functional , approachable title .
It ’s a little profane , a little gory , a little short , and may have a few problems , but Psi-Ops is nevertheless sadistic fun from start to finish . ”

Kill.switch
This overlooked gem introduced the cover mechanic and blind fire mode later made famous by Gears of War .
Instead of a single “ A Button ” press of Gears of War , Kill .
Switch used a hold down button not unlike Time Crisis ’ step peddle mechanic .
The cover mechanic was very innovative and well implemented .
From GameSpy ’s Review : “ Make no mistake — in many ways kill .
switch is a single - minded , no frills game .
There ’s no multiplayer , no online play , and only a couple of difficulty modes .
But it does its work extremely well , and it ’s safe to say you wo n’t play a similar game this year .
Some of the best arcade shooters succeeded with great action instead of depth , and kill .
switch is fun and addictive enough to hurdle over its limitations to become a worthy investment . ”

First Person Shooter
Deus Ex : The Conspiracy
In this remake of the original PC cult classic , Deus Ex : The Consiracy seamlessly combines a first person shooter with elements of role playing games .
While the graphics are certainly dated by today ’s standards , the game is definitely not short on fun .
The weapons are customizable , all of the nano - aug powers are upgradeable , and the skill system is easy to learn .
This game is great for RPG fans and FPS fans alike , and even better for fans of both .
From GameSpot ’s Review : “ All of Deus Ex ’s gameplay features and story elements , as well as the expansiveness of the game ’s environments and the scope of its setting , will add up to a satisfying and unusual experience if you can get past the game ’s technical shortcomings .
The way in which the individual gameplay elements are balanced against each other , and the way the consequences of your actions tend to come back into play , all help make Deus Ex increasingly impressive the longer you play it , just as they invite you to play the game over again .
It ’s not strictly an adventure game or a role - playing game , as its action sequences dominate much of its gameplay .
But it ultimately succeeds at creating a believable , open - ended game environment while telling a focused and memorable story , which makes Deus Ex well suited for anyone who ’s played through enough conventional action games or role - playing games to forgive its shortcomings in light of its great achievements . ”

Darkwatch
The setting and circumstances in first - person shooters can be quite similar most of the time , but that is n’t much of a concern for Darkwatch .
It takes place in a modern version of the Old Wild West and you follow the adventures of Jericho Cross , an train - robber - turned - vampire .
It may not be the great FPS from a techincal standpoint , but you have to give it points for creativity .
From IGN ’s Review : “ Of course , the most impressive thing about Darkwatch ’s single - player experience is how it controls .
It ’s one of the most responsive first - person shooters I ’ve played without needing a mouse and the smooth movement and highly customizable configuration means that fans of other games can jump right in without a hitch .
Targeting your enemies is fast , easy , and accurate too , and that ’s just as it should be .
Also worth mentioning is Darkwatch ’s excellent enemy AI .
While it ’s not on the same level as say , Far Cry or Resident Evil 4 , the computer ’s intelligence and behaviors do manage to pull off a couple of impressive feats .
Gunslingers , for instance , will dodge your bullets and melee attacks , Banshees coordinate in assault patterns to force you into their sonics , and the more basic low - level creatures team up in packs to rip you to shreds .
The CPU ’s whole mentality is pretty solid and packed with enough aggression to kick even the most hardened veteran in the teeth on the higher settings . ”

Multidirection Overhead Shooters
The Red Star
The Red Star is essentially the definition of a hidden gem on the PS2 .
This hybrid brawler / shooter struck a nerve with old - school gamers from the first moment it was demoed on the XBox , but got bounced around before finding a publisher who took a chance with the game on the PS2 as a budget title .
From GameDaily ’s Review : “ For a $ 20 game , The Red Star boasts amazing production values .
The graphics look terrific , employing superb lighting effects and details .
The battles with the Kiselev Aggressor look brilliant , whether it pops out weapons through virtual windows or launches attacks from a distance before swooping in to finish the job …
Action fans should find The Red Star irresistible , especially if they ’re fans of one man “ army classics ” games like Contra or Gunstar Heroes .
It brings an unstoppable amount of tension and energy throughout its nineteen levels , even on the easiest of difficulty settings .
( Hop right into hard to get the most out of it , though — humble advice from a hardcore shooting fan . )
It may have taken three years to get here , but The Red Star was definitely worth the wait . ”

Heavenly Guardian
This little - known 2D gem is the follow - up to Pocky and Rocky ( Kiki KaiKai ) on the SNES .
It did n’t receive very good reviews since it did n’t exactly look as good in 2D as some other modern games , but if you do n’t mind an old - school look ( no problems here ) and budget presentation , you might want to look into this one .
From Specialty Gamer ’s Review : “ For what it is , a specialty title , it does it very well .
The game does not force itself to appeal to a mainstream market , which I always tend to respect and appreciate .
That said , if you are a person that does not like either Anime / Japanese culture or shooter / quirky games , this game wo n’t make you like it any more as its very much more of that .
If you do enjoy and look out for the uncommon / under the radar Anime / Japanese culture or shooter / quirky games , I certainly think you will dig Heavenly Guardian .
I have to say if you tried to come up with an Anime fanboy ’s idea for a simple game , this would probably be it . ”

DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou
Just in case you thought that DonPachi and DoDonPachi were too easy , Cave has Dai - Ou - Jou ( “ peaceful death ” ) ready and waiting to shoot your ego full of holes .
Aside from the overall increased challenge and duskier presentation , the same “ chaining ” mechanic is in place here , though now you can pump up your firepower and score even further with “ hyper ” items – if you do n’t mind that using them makes enemies even angrier !
Definitely not one for players who tend to give up easily , but it ’s a great port , and includes an equally tough boss rush mode and a superplay DVD as a bonus .
From NTSC - uk ’s Review : “ Overall DoDonPachi DOJ is a very exhilarating game .
Unlike the sublime Psyvariar , which focuses on making the player choose the best strategy of building up BUZZ by skimming bullets , DoDonPachi DOU is all about learning how to weave through the bullet patterns unharmed , whilst still making the combo meter tick .
The game is all about skill and will take players months to be able to be able to one - credit the game – a mighty achievement in its own right …
The striking thing about the game is the adrenaline and satisfaction a player feels once they have been able to successfully come out alive of a bullet run , and it is this factor that makes the game a pleasure to play .
To be able to do this , though , the player will have to dwell deep into the mechanics and successfully implement the use of combo multipliers , combined with the careful use of bombs .
The game as a whole comes second to Psyvariar , as veterans of the series will not find a huge deal different in this incarnation , but as with all great gaming series , if it ai n’t broke why fix it ? ”

ESPGaluda
Much like its spiritual successor , ESP Ra.de , I have no idea how to pronounce this game ’s name , but I do know that the Matrix - esque ability to slow enemy bullets down is long - overdue within the genre and quite cool to mess around with here – it ’s limited , obviously , but you can use it either to get through tough spots or to fill the screen with enemy fire to cancel and reap loads of points from at the last second .
As such , the game is great for both beginners and score attackers – like Dai - Ou - Jou it ’s an excellent conversion , and comes packaged with a superplay DVD and a challenging Arrange mode .
From NTSC - uk ’s Review : “ Criticism could be levelled at Cave for not breaking their own mould a bit more with Espgaluda – from a distance , gameplay nuances are n’t immediately visible enough to make the title stand out .
It ’s also not their best game , but it ’s certainly the most approachable , opening the stable up to the possibility of gaining a new fan base .
Die - hard shooter or Cave fans wo n’t need telling twice – as a reward for their faithful allegiance , the game is a pastel - shaded success .
The company is synonymous with producing solid , ultra - tough games , which may well be music to the ears of the initiated , but can be off - putting to those nearer the sidelines , so it ’s commendable that Cave have made in - roads to constructing a more accessible , fun and rewarding experience for those possibly looking for a way into the genre .
They might only be baby steps , but they ’re all in the right direction . ”

Twinkle Star Sprites : La Petite Princesse
Many shooter fans were disappointed when rumors of a Western release of this game turned out to be false , but at least they can import the “ Best ” reprint and save some money .
Despite the 3D makeover , it plays almost exactly like the original Twinkle Star Sprites , which means it ’s still loads of fun to clear a screen full of enemies in one shot and drown your rival in fireballs and other cutesy projectiles of death .
The only knock I really have against it is that playing by yourself , while structurally solid , gets old too quickly – having a friend over to take you on ( online play is probably dead by now , unfortunately ) is where it ’s at .
From HG101 ’s Review : “ Much like the original , there ’s only one story mode for Time , although playing through the game with other characters will eventually unlock an emulation of the original Twinkle Star Sprites .
The sound seems a little bit off , and it ’s lacking any of the cool extras from the Saturn or Dreamcast ports , but it ’s an excellent bonus nonetheless .
There ’s also online play , but you need to sign up for a Japanese matching service , which not only incurs a monthly free , but is pretty much useless if you ’re living outside of Japan .
This would ’ve been awesome had SNK decided to port it to the Xbox and bring it to America , but that never happened .
While fans might view this sequel as almost entirely unnecessary , at least it ’s a nice modern overhaul of one of the best puzzle / shooter games ever made . ”

Mushihime - sama
Roughly translated as “ insect princess , ” this popular Cave offering puts you on the back of a giant beetle and sends you out to blast a bunch of even bigger ( and exceedingly unfriendly ) arthropods of various sorts .
As in the arcade version you can choose from three modes – Psikyo - esque Original , standard Maniac , and stupid - hard Ultra , as well as a slightly redesigned Arrange mode .
The basic scoring system is similar to DoDonPachi ’s chaining , but a bit more forgiving – the port is less than perfect , but the great visual and sound design still shine through .
From NTSC - uk ’s Review : “ If you want an undiluted shooter free of frivolous gameplay hooks and gimmicks , this will quench your thirst for such a title through this uncomfortable dry period .
However , as good as it is and as much as it could be recommended , it should n’t take priority over any of Cave ’s other current - generation titles . ”

Run-N - Gun Shooters
Metal Slug Anthology
Now the Metal Slug series is by now means a hidden gem on its own , but I do n’t think most PS2 owners are aware of the Anthology compilation on the PS2 and how great of a value it is .
For $ 20 or so , you get seven excellent installments of this classic shooter series .
From Armchair Empire ’s Review : “ Now , it ’s universally agreed upon that Metal Slug is pretty awesome .
Thankfully , SNK has realized this , and despite their financial ups and downs , have committed themselves to supplying as much Metal Slug as possible to the general public .
They ’re doing us all a favor , because it ’s one of the best arcade - style games still being released .
It ’s all simple — run forward , shoot stuff , do n’t die — but the humorous characters , two player simultaneous action , and extremely high quality 2D graphics have garnered many , many loyal fans … .
Metal Slug Anthology is already a tremendous deal for your money , and it ’s definitely worth checking out for anyone into chaotic old school mayhem .
The Playstation 2 version is also the best one for your money , since it is n’t hampered by the control or loading issues of the other ports .

Alien Hominid
If you frequent The Newsgrounds website , you are probably familiar with the original Flash game .
However , the developers expanded the game and polished it up a bunch for a full console release .
In terms of the gameplay , it is very much like Metal Slug , but it has its very own style and sense of humor .
From NetJak ’s Review : “ Alien Hominid
The gameplay should be extremely familiar to anyone who ’s played Metal Slug , or Contra , or any 2D shoot ‘em up in the last twenty years or so .
The goal is simply to get from the left end of the stage to the right end , shooting and through anything that may get in your way .
Of course , there are gun power - ups to help with the large - scale chaos , usually provided by the aforementioned fat kid .
There are also as a variety of vehicles to commandeer that are scattered throughout .
These range from run -of - the - mill , like bulldozers and killer robots , to the absurd , like a Sasquatch that you can ride in one of the Russian levels to eat KGB agents , Rampage - style …
Should you become bored with the main game , there are also a handful of mini - games that are easily as entertaining as the main package .
There are some mini - games based on the main game , which can be fun for a while , but the original mini - games are , by far , the hidden jewel of Alien Hominid .
The so - called PDA game is a simple puzzle game reminiscent of the old Lode Runner games , where you have to get from the start to the finish , while killing all the enemies and avoiding all the obstacles .
Once you get the hang of it , it ’s fairly addictive , and the 200 pre-made levels plus the included level editor ensure that , if you do enjoy it , you wont get bored of it for quite a while . ”

Contra Shattered Soldier
For some strange reason , this game got a bad reputation when it came out , but if you ’re a fan of the Contra series , you ’ll feel right at home .
As you might expect , Shattered Soldier is absurdly difficult and it has all the staples of classic Contra games but with updated visuals .
Some of the mechanics of this game are cool too , like being able to lock your firing position .
Neo Contra was also released on the PS2 a couple of year later , but it typically does n’t receive as many glowing recommendations .
From IGN ’s Review : “ From my perspective , this represents a smart philosophy for a classic revival .
It ’s not a clone of a classic Contra game .
It retains aspects of the earlier games in the series , and offers more than a little nostalgia value for the gamers who played and loved them way back when , but it does something new at the same time , revising and updating the series ’ gameplay .
Those revisions , of course , may rub some players the wrong way .
Make no mistake , you will die like a fly playing this game , very early and very often .
But the pattern design is good enough that skill and perceptive analysis offers the possibility of mastery for dedicated players .
While you ’re dying , you ’re also learning in anticipation of a future trip through the game . ”

Mark of Kri
Bringing something new to the table , The Mark of Kri was a refreshing gameplay experience and displayed a unique graphical style .
Making use of the dual analog sticks , it managed to make fighting with multiple opponents an accessible and fun , yet challenging , experience , while still giving players the opportunity to try other approaches , like shooting enemies at a distance with a bow or crawling sneakily from behind .
The visual style , the closer you get to an animated look without using cell - shading , is brilliant , and the mix between cartoonish characters and scenes of extreme graphic violence gives this game a unique and compelling look .
Even though it went relatively unnoticed by the genreal public it did warrant a sequel on the PS2 by the name of Rise of the Kasai .
From Armchair Empire ’s Review : “ The Mark of Kri ( MoK ) , is an interesting action - adventure title where you are a Mongolian horde - esque adventurer looking to make a name for yourself by defeating brigands , thieves , and general evil doers .
Besides having one of the funnier late - night television commercials ( that poor guy getting worked over as the striking dummy for a women ’s self defense class and snaps … ) ,
MoK boasts a streamlined combat system that allows you to “ target ” and simultaneously fight up to 3 people at once .
For a game that can easily degenerate from a stealth mission to taking on a swarm of enemies single - handed , this is important ( and the easy to use controls certainly help out immensely ) . ”

God Hand
Solid beat ’em up +
Japanese insanity = win .
If you give God Hand a chance , you ’ll come to appreciate the deep combat system and the over the top , funny moves .
Actually , everything about the game from the story to the music to the characters is funny , wacky and over the top .
Also , all of the things that make the game initially frustrating initially ( difficulty , randomness , etc ) will become less and less of a problem as you find yourself slowly mastering the game .
God Hand ’s may not be quite as good as Clover ’s other efforts ( Okami & Viewtiful Joe ) , but it packed with enough beatemup goodness to make up for its weaknesses .
From Gamer Revolution ’s Review : “ When God Hand ’s tongue is n’t drooling over the thousands of scantily - clad and literally - spankable babes in the game , it is firmly placed in cheek .
The jokes range from just silly ( the gorilla that you fight has a zipper running down its back ) , to pop-cultural ( you take on a team of midget power rangers ) , to cute ( one enemy ’s attack transforms you into an adorable puppy , whose attack is just a menacing , if irresistibly precious , growl ) .
God Hand puts the fun back in beating people retarded .
The humor and light - heartedness are certainly one half of what was missing from beat - em - up ’s before .
The other missing half was a decent combat system that could incorporate timing and reflexes into the traditional button - mashing slop .
God Hand ’s fighting is refreshingly intuitive and quick , leading to fast - paced and intense battles with plenty of the old ultra-violence . ”

Bujingai : The Forsaken City
Yes , this game is essentially a minimalist button - smasher , but beautiful in it ’s execution .
There ’s nothing too complicated and that gives Bujingai both stress - relieving properties and a better replay value than some games in the genre .
The challenge can be intense , the music is fabulous , the graphics are beautiful , and it has solid control .
From IGN ’s Review : “ Veteran videogame players who have experienced previous titles like Otogi , Dynasty Warriors , Shinobi , and Crimson Sea probably wo n’t find Bujingai to be too much different from what they ’ve seen before .
Overly simplistic and a bit formulaic , its unique approach to the genre is n’t necessarily found in gameplay , but rather , it ’s style and presentation …
But just because the game is short on the depth of its engine does n’t mean that it ’s short on the fun .
Though it can get a little bit tedious and repetitive for the more demanding crowds out there , Bujingai still has a lot of entertainment value in it and should n’t be so easily dismissed .
As not only is it easy to pick up and get into , it also provides a great deal of enemy challenges in the higher difficulty settings ; ones that are sure to test even the most elite of North America ’s most avid twitch gamers .
Besides , when was the last time you played through an adventure using a sword wielding gender - neutral marital arts master anyway ?
Yeah , that ’s what we thought . ”

Fighting
The King of Fighters XI
After a long line of annual installments and an attempt at bringing the series to 3D , SNK Playmore got back to the two - dimensional roots and ditched the yearly suffix .
Since it was designed for the Atomiswave arcade system instead of the classic Neo - Geo MVS hardware , it has a more modern look to it than previous 2D installments .
Of course , graphics are n’t everything , so to make the new installment worthwhile , SNK also included a number of new game mechanics to keep 2D fighting junkies on their toes .
The PS2 is also the only console to receive a port and has a number of great exclusive characters over the arcade .
From Eurogamer ’s Review : “ While the three - on - three action on display here adheres pretty firmly to the usual 2D beat - ’em - up blueprint , a few interesting new concepts carve XI a niche of its own .
The first of these is a vastly reworked Tactical Shift System compared to when we last saw it – switching between your three fighters on the fly can now be done to avoid an opponent ’s relentless onslaught through the Saving Shift or done to prolong your own combos and confuse opponents with some crazy mix - up thanks to the Quick Shift ability .
As with other technical moves , these function in unison with the game ’s new Skill Stock system where a section of the constantly recharging two - part meter must be expended to perform many more defensive abilities .
Leader Desperation
Moves are still in there too but XI introduces the Dream Cancel option to make the chances of ever landing some of these more realistic .
While expensive on both special and skill gauges , being able to cancel out of normal super attacks into your leader ’s most powerful move can do horrible things to your opponent ’s life bar . ”

Garou : Mark of the Wolves ( Fatal Fury : MOTW )
Possibly the best SNK fighters ever , Fatal Fury : Mark of the Wolves takes place well after the events of the previous games in the series .
This gave SNK the opportunity to explore their creativity in bringing fresh characters and a new style in terms of both fighting and aesthetics .
The new additions to the gameplay engine in MOTW include the T.O.P. ( Tactical Offensive Position ) system for offense and the “ Just Defended ” , system ( again similar to Third Strike ’s parry system ) on defense .
For some reason , SNK Playmore did n’t bring this gem outside of Japan , but if you do n’t have a Dreamcast or a Neo - Geo , you might want to consider importing a copy for the PS2 .
From NTSC - uk ’s Review : “ So , what about the PS2 port then ?
Well , it ’s as good as you could hope for and close to perfect .
Equip yourself with a NEOGEO Stick 2 ( the game is available as a Limited Edition that includes one of these fine reproductions ) and this basically is the NEOGEO version .
Loading times are almost non-existent .
We ’re talking around 2 seconds max to initially load up the 1st round , and that ’s it .
Graphically , it ’s pretty - much identical to the original : the character sprites are the same size and lose none of the animation that the original was famed for .
Plus , the lush backgrounds that impressed so much on the NEOGEO are still insanely good - looking some 6 years on .
SNK Playmore have also included a number of graphical display options for the PS2 version , the most notable being the ability to soften the image sharpness to help eliminate “ jaggies ” that can often be an issue with these kinds of ports . ”

Hokuto No Ken ( Fist of the North Star )
Arc System Works ( the development team behind the Guilty Gear series ) created this stunning anime - based fighter for the Atomiswave arcade platform and it was also released on the PS2 in Japan .
If you enjoy the Guilty Gear games , you should get a real kick out of it , but only fans of 2D fighters would find it worth importing .
From Diehard GameFAN ’s Review : “ Hokuto No Ken / Fist of the North Star is an okay game that will please fans of the franchise without doing anything to interest those who do n’t know or care about one way or the other .
It ’s a fan product , and in that respect , it does its job exceptionally ; the presentation is spot -on , the characters are recognizable and work as one would expect them to , and the general experience of the game is fun for those who actually know and like the license .
However , a dearth of content and variety , balance issues , stiff gameplay mechanics and a general lack of anything to do with the product beyond the first two hours of play unless you ’re a committed player hurt the game significantly .
Though Fist of the North Star is generally import friendly , only fans of the license or the most dedicated fighting game fans will find any worth to owning it ; everyone else can safely pass it by . ”

DreamMix TV : World Fighters
Ok , so if you ’re noticing a trend , most of the best undiscovered fighting games on the PS2 were only released in Japan .
However , instead of an old - school 2D fighter , DreamMix TV can be likened to the Super Smash Bros. series .
Of course , being on the PS2 , the game does n’t feature Nintendo ’s characters .
Instead , it features a boatload of characters from Konami , Hudson , and Takara — so you can battle it out with the likes of Simon Belmont , Solid Snake , Bomberman , and Optimus Prime .
( oh yeah ! )
From Nintendo World Report ’s Review ( for Gamecube version ) : “ Outside of having four - player matchups and using simple move commands , DMTV is somewhat different from SSBM in the gameplay department .
First of all , there are no ring - outs whatsoever ; characters must be attacked until they lose their large heart to another player .
The number of special moves from character to character will vary ; for example , Snake only has one , but it ’s easily a very dominating move that can be performed , even during a jump , while hanging , or while carrying another character .
That ’s right , each character can pick up , carry , and throw other characters , perhaps into a corner or where they might end up tangling with another character .
Hey , why do the dirty work yourself ?
Tricky players can even grab characters in the middle of a jump – it ’s a good way to catch people by surprise .
Items are also used in the same way – just picked up and thrown .
There are very few items in the game , but a few are worth noting ;
TwinBee can generate his own items ( bells that have different effects ) , as can Bomberman ( bombs ) .
In Licca ’s stage , cute things like teddy bears and pink buckets (? ) are regenerated constantly and are good for a quick throw . ”

Gitaroo Man
If you love quirky Japanese musical adventures , this game is your ticket to funland .
In addition to the colorful presentation , Gitaroo Man is actually a bit different than your standard “ simon - says ” rhythm games as it not only uses the face buttons , but the analogue stick as well .
Because of this , it requires a lot of hand - eye coordination with both hands at the same time and a lot of practice .
( It ’s not as much of a button - masher as Parappa the Rappa 2 ) .
From Gamespot ’s Review : “ The gameplay in Gitaroo - Man alternates between two different mechanics .
At certain points , using the left analog stick –which controls a cone in the center of the screen – you ’ll follow a line around the screen while pressing and holding the circle button at certain moments to pull off riffs .
At others , button commands will move toward a cursor at the center of the screen , at which point you ’ll have to press the designated face button on your controller .
The whole experience is incredibly fun and challenging , as the action gets pretty fast and furious early on in the game …
Gitaroo - Man is arguably the most original and inventive rhythm game since the advent of Dance Dance Revolution or the original Parappa the Rapper , and it ’s easily one of the best rhythm games for the PlayStation 2 .
This is a must - own title for rhythm - game junkies , but the whole package is so compelling that it will also appeal to anyone who is n’t a fan of the genre . ”

Space Channel 5 : Special Edition
Those of us that own the wonderful Sega Dreamcast are well aware of this duo of wonderful titles ( it includes both the original SC5 and SC5 part 2 ) .
Both the graphics and the music had a phenomenal retro-futurist ( reminds me of a hip Jetson ’s atmosphere ) feel to them and kept Space Channel 5 from becoming just “ another ” simon - says - type game .
Space Channel 5 has a handful of simple game elements that make it unique and the game does a good job of starting out easy and gradually getting more difficult .
While SC5 is n’t especially deep or long , the music will keep you coming back From start to finish , Space Channel 5 rocks the house .
Even when the moves become so complicated you get angry and want to hurl your controller across the room , the quality of the music helps bring you back .

Puzzle
Bombastic
Bombastic is the PS2 sequel to PS1 gem , Devil Dice .
Decent to great solitaire puzzle play , but it really shines for frantic multi-player goodness .
The game introduces a new concept to the whole Devil Dice idea : when you match dice , they explode — which creates some chain reactions , and generally causes more regular pain and frustration to your little devil dude .
What is particularly nice about this incarnation , is that you can quite easily unlock “ classic ” play — turn off the exploding dice , and play by the old skool rules .
From IGN ’s Review : “ The concept behind Bombastic , exactly like the idea behind Devil Dice , is genius .
Here , players take on the role of a nimble footed pixy , the Japanese equivalent of a Hoo ( of The Grinch Who Stole Christmas fame ) , that scurries across the face of die in the attempt of connecting same numbers to eliminate them from the 49 - square board .
The object is to quickly recognize the numbers , roll the dice into place , igniting them , and then to try and create chain reactions , linking them to other sets of dice before they blow up .
Players earn chain reaction points , they build up levels , and all the while they rid the grid of dice , more emerge from the ground to take their place .
The gameplay is tense , electrifying and requires a certain amount of quick decision - making skills , much like Tetris , but in 3D and using die in an entirely different gameplay experience . ”

Well , Aqua Aqua is actually the sequel to that like puzzler .
Anyway , AquaAqua puts you in control of an earth - like terrain on a mission to help the Aquas find balance between dry land and water .
By creating mountains from land - based pieces called “ uppers , ” you can trap rain and water - based pieces to create lakes .
If the mountains grow too high , a devastating earthquake may occur .
If the water flows too freely across the land , you will ultimately flood your terrain and fail .
You must balance these forces while dealing with other ( sometimes helpful ) obstacles such as bombs , fireballs , and ice cubes .
Interesting , eh ?
From IGN ’s Review : “ Having never played Wetrix before playing Aqua Aqua for the first time , I did n’t really know what to expect and must admit that I just did n’t see what all the hoopla had been about .
But after giving the game some time and getting deeper into it , I quickly found that Aqua Aqua is a very entertaining and addictive puzzler .
If you ’re looking for a puzzle game on PlayStation 2 , your first choice should be Aqua Aqua . ”

Sega has so many awesome franchises under their belt , but in recent years they have struggled to do them justice .
However , their recent resurrection of the Outrun franchise was right one the mark when it came to maintaining the exhilarating arcade feel in a modern gaming world .
If you liked the original Outrun back in the day , you ’ll love this new installment .
And if you just want a more arcade - like racer to add to your library , this is a great place to start .
From Eurogamer ’s Review : “ The structure hardly matters : you drive a Ferrari and try to avoid losing speed , doing incredibly cool power - slides when you really can’t make it through a turn with the pedal floored .
In fact , half the time you do it anyway because it ’s just fun .
Snaking a sideways car through lorries and hatchbacks is what arcade racing should be .
And as you get better , you pick up tricks like the s- bend shimmy and work out how best to employ your slide .
There ’s also a Heart Attack mode , where you ’re ranked stage by stage on your ability to do silly things over short distances – drift as much as possible , break the tape connecting traffic cars , maintain a particular line .
That ’s the entire game .

Well anyway , they are cool little racers that have a bit of a cartoon styling to them and have some RPG elements thrown into the mix .
Road Trip is localized name for the most popular of the series on the PS2 ( Gadget Racers , mentioned below , would be another one )
From GameSpy ’s Review : “ Complete the various quests and you earn money ( you ’re allowed to name the game ’s currency ; I chose my favorite British slang word , “ dosh ” ) with which to buy upgrades for your car .
Road Trip has a stellar amount of customization , allowing you to purchase hundreds of parts , wheels , paint jobs , body styles , spoilers , and wings .
My favorite goodie was the advertising billboard item , which earned me a whopping 10 dosh for every mile I drove while promoting the virtues of Peach Town ’s coffee shop .
Along with its RPG elements , Road Trip also has plenty of straightforward racing on a variety of unorthodox tracks , such as the interior of a ninja temple ( although I ’m told that a surprising number of silent assassins are NASCAR fans ) . ”

The original Valkyrie Profile on the PS1 was known for its for its artistic style and side - scrolling environments — the same can be expected from this prequel ( yes , prequel , so if you have n’t played the original , it ’s no problem ) .
More than a plane - jane RPG , this game has a heavy puzzle aspect that breaths new life into every battle .
Every dungeon has its own quirks and every battle is different , so you should n’t lose interest easily .
From GamingAge ’s Review : “ In summary , with only minor complaints dragging it down , it ’s safe to say Valkyrie Profile 2 : Silmeria is a quality sequel .
The world it presents is gorgeous , with some one of the most technically and aesthetically pleasing visuals we ’ve seen thus far .
Meanwhile , the revised and expanded battle system injects additional strategy while eliminating the issues that bogged down the previous game .
But perhaps best of all , it ’s an experience that can be enjoyed by both those that played Valkyrie Profile and those that have never heard of it .

Persona 3 FES contains an enhanced version of the original game , loaded with new Personas and cutscenes , a weapon synthesis system , additional quests and events , among other interesting features .
From Destructoid ’s Review : “ More than half a year ago , Atlus ’ Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 was released , and its intriguing story and characters , high production values , and gun - to - head action had gamers dusting off their PlayStation 2s .

It was n’t long before word got out that Japanese gamers were enjoying a sort of “ director ’s cut ” called Persona 3 : FES , which contained a new 30 - hour chapter called Episode Aegis .
American fans looked to Atlus with puppy dog eyes , and in late February , after a bit of teasing , Persona 3 : FES was announced for the US .

Magic Pengel : The Quest for Color
From IGN ’s Review : “ Until we actually started playing it , the structure of Magic Pengel was almost impossible to fathom .
At its heart , the game is a mix of role - playing and adventure with a good bit of Pokemon - type fighting sequences thrown in as the battle system .
Of course , the most important tool in the entire experience has to be the Paint Shop inspired illustrator that ’s used to draw your assistants .
Beginning with only four colors , one brush type , and two body variables , your early creations are n’t going to be much .
As your skills and experience improve , however , the things you can do with the paint program become enormously elaborate .
And while your only limitation is the confines of a multi-speed cursor and a total of 64 body parts , skilled artists will be able to create some seriously beautiful images .
As an added bit of strategy , the types of colors in use , thickness of your brushes , and placement of certain body parts affect the power and attributes of your drawings .
Use a lot of red , for instance , and your character ’s hit points increase .
Add a touch of blue , and your luck goes up a few notches .
There ’s a full rainbow of colors to experiment with , and the number of limbs , pieces , and other such factors all make a difference in your creation , with a potentially unlimited amount of possibilities .
Artists are going to love it . ”

Growlanser Generations
As the last release from Working Designs , this package contains both Growlancer II and III .
The games feature an isometric perspective , squad - based battles between diverse parties , a complicated system of cause and effect as fights play out , and customizable character development .
Growlanser also boasts enormous campaign worlds and open - ended stories that distinguish it from many more familiar strategy role - playing games .
The games have a bit more of a 32 - bit feel to them , so depending if that ’s your kind of thing , its something to keep in mind .
From GamingAge ’s Review : ” Battles are tough without making you want to pull your hair out .
It ’s a blessing when your strategy game rewards good strategy and not just out - leveling the competition .
The need for good tactics is compounded by certain stages , which change dynamically and often for the worse .
There are also many fights where the goal is not to “ defeat all enemies , ” which is a welcome challenge .
Fights can have multiple outcomes , and the level to which you complete a stage has a direct impact to the rest of the game .
It dictates who you meet , how the story unfolds , and ultimately which ending you receive .
Growlanser II and III share a lot of similarities , but there are some differences .
The world map for GII is just like Final Fantasy Tactics , where you move from town to town through a series of checkpoints .
Shops and conversations all happen by way of menu choices at said checkpoints .
In GIII , you actually enter the towns and walk around talking to NPCs and entering shops .
There is a subtle difference in area - of - effect type magic between the two , and GIII also allows the use of items in battle , where they are unavailable in GII . ”

La Pucelle Tactics
Developed by Nippon Ichi , creators of Disgaea , this is the next logical step if you ’re a fan of that series and want more .
La Pucelle Tactics is surprisingly deep and has plenty of hours worth of adventure and battles .
The tactics in the game are fun and advanced , however most players can easily enjoy the system .
While it is n’t flowing with eye - candy , the classic graphics do n’t hold the game back .
The only time you may complain is when you do not get the good ending .
However , as opposed to only having end - of - game endings in Disgaea , La Pucelle has different endings for each chapter .
From IGN ’s Review : “ We can definitely see fans of more character - driven RPGs enjoying La Pucelle more than they did Disgaea .
With its better storyline , heavier emphasis on characterization , and stronger verbal and musical approach , it can be a lot more endearing than its more technical younger counterpart .
But for diehard strategy fans that want to spend an entire season finding new ways to eliminate Tempetes and Dagons , La Pucelle ’s smaller feature set and easier difficulty may prove a little less tempting ; especially if they find out that some of the game ’s content has been censored from the Japanese release .
Small issues aside , La Pucelle : Tactics is still very much a powerful gaming experience and serves as a terrific companion piece to Hour of Darkness . ”

This Atlus Japanese SRPG is admittedly shallow compared to its Nippon Ichi brothers … but that ’s its greatest strength .
Sometimes you do n’t want to play a SRPG where your characters level up to 9999 ( I love Disgaea as much as anyone … but c’mon , who has the time ? ) .
Bonus : the soundtrack was composed by the same guy who did Final Fantasy Tactics and FFXII .
From NTSC - uk ’s Review : “ Though this is far from being a definitive SRPG for the PlayStation 2 , it still provides an outstanding example of what can be achieved in the genre .
In its favour , the battle system is easy to pick up and many happy hours can be lost in strategy ; it has an addictive quality that makes you want to keep on playing , levelling up , customizing and battling the hours away .
Fans of this type of game will not be disappointed and it should be considered as a good point of entry to first timers too . ”

Ring of Red
Set in an alternate post - WWII 1960 ’s where the US did n’t drop the bomb and the Japanese did n’t surrender , Ring of Red is a hybrid of turn - based strategy ( when moving units ) and real - time combat .
In this alternate timeline , Japan uses AFWs ( Armored Fighting Walkers ) to do battle .
However , these are n’t the sleek mechs you would find in most games , but are crude , gasoline - powered machines that you might imagine in the 60’s .
The what - if scenarios that the game presents are quite intriguing and the gameplay can be equally engrossing .
From IGN ’s Review : “ Ring of Red is a very satisfying strategy experience .
I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoyed the Front Mission series or Carnage Heart , and other wargaming fans should get a kick out of it as well , both its combat system and the involved world - building that surrounds it .
Hopefully , we ’ll continue to see more technically sound work come out of KCE Studios ( formerly just the creators of the Muscle Ranking games ) , and Konami of America will do their best to develop a more uniformly high standard of quality in localization .
Pull those pieces together , and you ’ll have a recipe for another excellent game . ”

GrimGrimoire
The 2D masters at Vanillaware followed up their underground action RPG hit , Odin Sphere with this real - time strategy title that is equally as beautiful .
The gameplay and perspective are significantly different from what veterans might be used to — the levels are all vertical , and the main focus is on the combat rather than resource management and building .
Grim Grimoire is not a deep RTS , but it is a fun one .
With multiple difficulty levels , it can be easy enough to attract newcomers to the genre and cater to hardcore RTS players at the same time .
From GameSpot ’s Review : “ While GrimGrimoire does an outstanding job of transporting PC - centric strategy mechanics to the PlayStation 2 , it ’s the differences that make it legitimately great .
For starters , you do n’t view your map from overhead .
Instead , each mission is a castle cross-section that at first glance makes it look like a side - scrolling platformer .
Every map is an amalgam of hallways and stairwells that most units must traverse to get from one point to another .
While each one looks much the same as the last , the placement of various features like mana crystals and barriers make each map functionally different .
Thus you need to take into account the path your units must take to their destinations , which may involve climbing stairways and crossing enemy territory .
Top - level units like chimeras cross the map without such concerns , but come with their own sets of needs and strategies . ”

Sky Odyssey
Think of this as the closest thing PS2 owners have to a modern version of Nintendo ’s Pilotwings .
Much like that wonderful series , Sky Odyssey makes the flight simulation genre more accessible to beginners but has enough depth to give even experienced players enough to keep them busy .
Players are given 40 missions that range from landing planes on aircraft carriers to navigating caverns and waterfalls , rescuing an out - of - control hot air balloon , and refueling on a runaway train .
From Armchair Empire ’s Review : “ This game was a pleasant surprise , if for no other reason than it has a very unusual mix of arcadiness and flight sim stylings .
The controls are tight and the planes handle as you would suspect they should in real life , but the mission objectives are so over - the - top sometimes that things can be nuts ( but in a good way ) .
With some nice visuals and a soundtrack that is oddly swashbuckling in a satisfying sort of way , it all adds up to a title that PS2 owners should look into . ”

Warship Gunner 2
Initially , this game sounded quite boring , but after hearing it described as “ Naval Ops : Warship Gunner with an actual storyline ” ( making it Ace Combat with ships , essentially ) , Warship Gunner 2 was worth looking into .
Sadly , you do n’t get the multi-ship control that was in Naval Ops : Commander , but what you do get is an extremely long ( 30 hours on my first playthrough ) , highly addictive ( 1500 unlockable ship parts ) , extremely customizable ( did you miss the line about 1500 ship parts ? ) , replayable ( 3 different paths through the game and a newgame + option ) alternate World War 2 naval action game .
The worst part of the game is the 1 hour tutorial , but if you can make it through that then you ’ll be set for one hell of an engaging game .
Well , except for that first submarine mission , anyway .
When you first play it , your ship will be too damn slow and you ’ll just be puttering in towards the bay .
Ratchet the difficulty level down to easy for that stage , blow through it , and then come back when you have some better hardware .
From SubSim ’s Review : ” It ’s an odd mixture of Manga - style admirals , deliberately - thought out ship design elements , sci - fi weapons , and rapid - fire , shoot - shoot carnage .
It ’s not in the same league as Silent Hunter III , more like Steel Tide .
If you can stomach the arcade style physics , and you find the ship - building entertaining , you may find Warship Gunner 2 a pleasurable way to pass a few afternoons .
What the game lacks in realism , it supplies endless shoot ’em up action .
If nothing else , this could be an intro into naval games for sub-teens . ”

MLB Power Pros
I love baseball , but its one of those sports that is hard to translate effectively into video games .
One series that provides a wonderful alternative to the EAs of the gaming world is the Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū series from Konami that , until recently has been only released in Japan .
Konami has now published its first game from the series outside of Japan under the name MLB Power Pros .
Much like its successors , Power Pros features big-headed , characters and addictive arcade - like gameplay .
It ’s definitely much more approachable than most baseball games and loads of fun .
From GamingAge ’s Review : “ Getting past the presentation of MLB Power Pros is not easy .
We ’ve become accustomed to fairly realistic sports games .
But we ’ve also become numb to how poorly sports games represent the real thing .
Power Pros is definitive proof that baseball can be recreated on a console .
The game is fun , consistent , accurate and is , in every way , baseball .
Over the course of nine innings and several seasons , it ’s clear that Konami knows baseball better than any other developer . ”

Fire Pro Wrestling Returns
This series has been around for quite a while , but it is n’t too often that it ’s published outside of Japan .
I think NTSC - uk said it best a while back that “ Fire Pro is to those US based games what Street Fighter is to Tekken : less glitz and glam and far more substance . ”
Even though the games are 2D and very much old school , you really do n’t know what you ’re missing until you try them .
From 1UP ’s Review : “ Let me just get this out the way : Fire Pro Wrestling Returns is the best wrestling game ever .
That ’s not an exaggerated statement — you will not find a better mat simulator on the market .
You can definitely find one that ’s prettier , so if you are the kind of gamer who goes gaga over graphics , you may not agree .
But while Fire Pro’s 2D visuals may lack the fancy three dimensions of the SmackDown series , it pins THQ ’s grappler to the mat when it comes to gameplay , moves , and customization . ”

There is a court case going on in the United States that could potentially make everyone with an alias or an anonymous account at any of the many social media sites a criminal .
Anyone following the Lori Drew case will know what I am talking about .
For those of you who do n’t here ’s a short back story .
Back at the beginning of the year a young girl by the name of Megan Meier committed suicide after being turned on by a young man with whom she had become close to on MySpace .
It turns out though that the young man never existed but was in fact a fake persona created on MySpace by Lori Drew .
Now the interesting thing is that this woman was n’t alone in the perpetration of the hoax .
In fact many of Megan ’s neighbours ; along with Drew , were in on this terrible hoax that ended in the death of a fine young lady .
No one ; least wise myself , is saying what was done is right but as is human nature there is a rising crescendo of voices calling for blood with the most attention being directed at Lori Drew .
The only problem was that there was nothing that state law enforcement could charge her with as she really had n’t broken any crime .
At that point the federal government stepped in and said they would charge her .
So what did they charge with ?
How about “ conspiracy and fraudulently gaining access to someone else ’s computer ” .
Yup .. that ’s it and as much of a twist of the laws as it might be this is exactly what they got indictments against Ms. Drew which has more than a few legal scholars a little worried .
the one thing that was in Lori Drew ’s favour though was that the judge hearing the case had originally said that any evidence relating to Megan Meier ’s suicide would be excluded from the trial .
Considering that the young girl ’s death had nothing to do with whether any computer fraud laws were broken this made sense .
Unfortunately though the judge has now reverse his decision and this evidence will be allowed .
In light of how emotionally charged this whole matter is evidence such as this will make it very hard for a fair trial to be heard on the charge of computer fraud ; as that is the only charge against Lori Drew .
So how does this affect any use of anonymous accounts or aliases ?
Well consider that the only thing Lori Drew did was to set up an account on MySpace under an alias it would make anyone who has done the same thing potentially guilty of the same charge as the one facing Ms. Drew .
The same could apply to all those alias account set up on Twitter , Facebook etc etc – they would all be breaking the law and subject to criminal charges .
As Mark ‘ Rizzn ’ Hopkins pointed out in a post at WinExtra recently even Kevin Rose who set up a Twitter account for the cold he had could be charged with the same thing as Lori Drew .
As bad as the circumstances are that surround this whole thing the fact is that Lori Drew is only guilty of is being a mean cruel bitch but that does n’t break any laws .
However if she is found guilty because of the emotions surround this case it would mean that in the future anyone who does something stupid while using an alias ; or posting anonymously , could be found guilty and sent to prison .
If that does n’t send a chill up your back I do n’t know what will because this is setting a very bad precedent against something that is a natural part of using the Internet .
Andrew Ross Sorkin
The New York Times
October 13 , 2008
In what could set an important precedent , federal officials assured a big Japanese bank that its planned investment in the embattled Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley would be protected , according to people involved in the talks .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
After two days of tense negotiations , Treasury officials urged a hesitant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to proceed with its $ 9 billion investment in Morgan Stanley , which has sought the capital infusion to reassure investors and customers about its stability .
The deal is considered a crucial step in the government ’s strategy for revitalizing the financial system by luring outside investment while it considers buying stock in banks directly .
The transaction ’s failure would deal a blow to that effort and potentially unnerve the financial markets .
The Treasury ’s assurances amount to another extraordinary move by the government and could serve as a model for future deals .
The tense , weekend talks were so critical to the financial markets that they drew in both the Treasury and the Japanese government .
Mitsubishi and the Japanese government pressed the Treasury Department over the weekend to guarantee that if the United States were to inject money into Morgan Stanley at a later time — a step the Treasury has ruled out for now — the move would not wipe out Mitsubishi ’s investment .

Prehistoric child is discovered buried with ' toy hedgehog ' at Stonehenge
This toy hedgehog , found in a child 's grave at Stonehenge , is proof of what we have always known - children have always loved to play .
The chalk figurine was probably a favourite possession of the three year old , and placed next to the child when they died in the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age , around 3,000 years ago .
Can you guess what it is yet ?
This carved toy hedgehog was found by archaeologists digging near Stonehenge
Archaeologists who discovered the grave , where the child was laying on his or her side , believe the toy - perhaps placed there by a doting father - is the earliest known depiction of a hedgehog in British history .
The diggers were working to the west of Stonehenge in what is known as the Palisade Ditch when they made the remarkable discovery last month in the top of the pit in which the child was buried .
Archaeologist Dennis Price said : ' It is not difficult to envisage the raw emotion and harrowing grief that would have accompanied the death of this child .
' Amid the aura of gloom that surrounds Stonehenge , it comes as a beam of light to find a child 's toy lovingly placed with the tiny corpse to keep him or her company through eternity .
' I 'm not aware of hedgehogs having any significance in pagan tradition so the discovery must rank as yet another unique and baffling aspect of one of the most famous and instantly recognisable prehistoric monuments on Earth .
To my mind , the hedgehog possesses a real charm and an innocent beauty . '
Burial ground :
The toy hedgehog was dug up here
Dr Joshua Pollard , of the Stonehenge Riverside Project , said : ' Representational art from this period is very rare and so far as I 'm aware , if the identification is correct , it 's the only known prehistoric depiction of a hedgehog from Britain . '
Fay Vass , of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society , said : ' We are very excited to hear about this find .
It shows humans have taken hedgehogs to their hearts for a very long time . '
In a deal with antitrust investigators , LG , Sharp , and Chunghwa will pay a combined $ 585 million in fines on charges they kept prices for LCDs artificially high .
That 's price - fixing , a big deal in a $ 70 billion industry .
The victims : Consumers of everything from TVs to cell phones , but also downstream vendors like Apple ( AAPL ) , Motorola ( MOT ) , and Dell ( DELL ) .
What exactly did the companies do ?
The U.S. Deptartment of Justice lays out its case :
LG and Chunghwa are charged with carrying out the conspiracy by :
Participating in meetings , conversations , and communications in Taiwan , Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT - LCD panels ;
Agreeing during those meetings , conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT - LCD panels at certain pre-determined levels ;
Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached ; and
Exchanging information on sales of TFT - LCD panels , for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed - upon prices .
Sharp is charged with participating in three separate conspiracies , to fix the price of TFT - LCD panels sold to Dell , Motorola and Apple by :
Participating in bilateral meetings , conversations , and communications in Japan and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT - LCD panels to be sold to Dell , Apple and Motorola ;
Agreeing during those bilateral meetings , conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT - LCD panels at certain pre-determined levels to Dell , Apple and Motorola ;
Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached ; and
Exchanging information on sales of TFT - LCD panels to be sold to Dell , Apple and Motorola , for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed - upon prices .
LG pays $ 400 million alone , the second largest antitrust fine ever imposed .

As same - sex marriage stalls in California and a U.S. recession looms , Massachusetts and Connecticut are carving out an economic niche for gay and lesbian weddings -- and the spending that comes with them .

While many Americans are postponing weddings as the economy weakens , gay and lesbian couples like Angela Fischer and Tami Schmidt who planned to marry in California are turning to New England instead , a prospect that economists say could have a multimillion - dollar benefit on tourism .
“ We had made plans to marry in California but we scrapped that , ” said Fischer .
Angered by California ’s November 4 vote to end legal same - sex marriage , Fischer and Schmidt of Phoenix , Arizona , married 16 days later at a United Church of Christ in Hartford , Connecticut .
Afterward , they held a reception with friends at a local restaurant and spent a week at a hotel .
“ California ’s loss will be Connecticut ’s and Massachusetts ’ gain economically , ” said M.V. Lee Badgett , an economist at the University of Massachusetts ’ Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies .
She doubts the bad economy will slow the weddings .
“ My sense is that gay people are aware that they ca n’t take the right to marriage for granted -- that it could be taken away .
To that extent , people may not wait to get married .
They may just have cheaper weddings , ” she said .
She led a study released in July that said over the next three years about 32,200 same - sex couples would travel from other states to marry in Massachusetts , which became the first U.S. state to legalize gay marriage in 2004 .
That would translate into 330 jobs and a $ 111 million boost to the state ’s economy , the study projects .
She expects a similar benefit over the same period for Connecticut , which legalized gay marriage on November 12 .
But spending could be higher in both states after California ’s recent ban on same - sex marriage , she added .
“ We take all the hundreds of millions that would have been spent in California , if those folks decide to get married and go to Massachusetts and Connecticut instead , those states will get even more than we had originally estimated , ” she said .
Another destination for U.S. couples is Canada , where same - sex marriages are legal .
CHASING THE ‘PINK DOLLAR ’
While all Americans are curbing spending , gay and lesbians are tightening their belts less than heterosexual couples , said Bob Witeck , chief executive of Witeck - Combs Communications , a marketing research firm that specializes in the gay market .
Among his findings : gay men have fewer children , bear a smaller financial burden from families and are less likely to worry about savings .
Lesbian women were also cutting back less in areas such as spending on restaurants , he found .
“ There are some signals that as the pain is spread , it ’s uneven .
Gay people are going to be feeling it but maybe not in the same capacity as larger households , ” he said .
The power of the so - called pink - dollar is well documented .
The nation ’s estimated 15.7 million gay men and lesbians , about 5 percent of the population , are responsible for $ 724 billion in annual spending , according to Witeck - Combs and Packaged Facts , a division of Marketresearch.com .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
That number is growing .
Individuals age 18 or older who self - identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender are projected to reach 16.3 million in three years , spending $ 835 billion annually -- a figure that translates into $ 51,200 per person a year , the Witeck / Packaged Facts study shows .
Audra Weisel , a pastry chef in Avon , Connecticut , hopes for a slice of that , after at least 66 marriage licenses were issued to same - sex couples since November 12 , when a judge legalized gay weddings following an October ruling by the state ’s top court .
“ Lots of couples went out and got their licenses and now they are just planning .
As a vendor we ’re sitting around waiting , ” said Weisel .
EXPANDING GAY MARRIAGE
The U.S. Census estimates Connecticut had 7,386 same - sex couples in 2000 .
About half of those , or 3,693 , will marry in the first three years , predicts a study by the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Joe Marfuggi , president of Riverfront Recapture Inc , has taken out advertisements in gay publications in a bid to attract same - sex weddings to a waterfront reception hall on the Connecticut River in Hartford .
“ Right now with the way the economy is , people are putting a lot of spending decisions on hold , but we want people to know that our facility is there and that it is welcoming , ” he said .
Across the state line , there ’s been no slowdown of same - sex weddings at the Old Mill on the Falls Bed and Breakfast in Hatfield , Massachusetts .
“ We continue to do a number of gay weddings big and small , ” said owner Ted Jarrett .
More than 11,000 gay men and lesbians have wed in Massachusetts since the state ’s highest court ruled in 2003 that a ban on same - sex marriage was unconstitutional , paving the way for the first gay weddings in 2004 .
That equals about , 1,500 a year , or 4 percent of all state marriages , in 2006 and 2007 .
Only two states -- New York and Rhode Island -- recognize marriages on gay couples performed in Massachusetts or Connecticut , a factor that could limit the number of marriages by out - of - state gay couples .
Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders , who helped to legalize gay marriage in Massachusetts and Connecticut , wants to change that by expanding gay marriage to New England ’s four other states by 2012 .
Three of those -- Maine , Vermont and New Hampshire -- already offer same - sex couples some form of legal recognition .

Presidential - elect Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) stands with former President Bill Clinton ( R ) at the end of their first joint appearance at a campaign rally , in Kissimmee , Florida , October 29 , 2008 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former President Bill Clinton has agreed to make public the names of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation as part of a deal with President - elect Barack Obama to clear the way for Sen.
Hillary Clinton to become secretary of state , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
Citing Democrats close to Clinton and Obama , the newspaper reported Clinton had decided to publish his contributor list to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest with his wife ’s duties as secretary of state .
Her appointment is expected to be announced on Monday .
A member of Obama ’s transition team confirmed the conditions of the agreement as reported by the Times .
The contributors ’ list is one of nine conditions that Clinton agreed to in his discussions with Obama ’s representatives , the newspaper reported .
Clinton turned over the names of all 208,000 individuals and organizations that have given money since 1997 , the Times said , while the agreement holds that his foundation will release them publicly by year ’s end .
Future donors will also be disclosed as long as Hillary Clinton is in the cabinet , it said .
The former president has also agreed to submit his speeches and business dealings in advance to State Department ethics officials for their review , as well as to the White House counsel ’s office if need be , the Times reported .
The Obama team said it expected Clinton ’s concessions would defuse any potential controversy , the report said .

The performance difference those couple hundred megahertz buys you is negligible , while a discrete graphics card from ATI or Nvidia will deliver serious performance benefits over Intel 's integrated graphics crap .
This is especially true if you do even light 3D gaming , HD video playback or anything else mildly graphically intensive like running Vista 's Aero interface ( oooo another burn ) .
Also , if you plan to keep a laptop for more than two years , buying the graphics card makes it more future - proof , since Windows 7 — and many resource - intensive apps — will grab hold of graphics cards for extra computing muscle , too .

Memory ( aka RAM ) is another place to sock your computing dollars instead of blindly bumping up the megahertz .
Adding RAM almost always gives your computer a more noticeable performance boost for the same price ( especially if you 're going from like 1 GB to 3GB ) , allowing you to multitask more and run crazier programs without dragging your computer down .
And really , you should n't even try to run Windows Vista on anything less than 2GB .
( If you can get 4GB and run Vista 64 - bit , that 's really magical . )

There is a trick to this , however .
You do n't buy the extra RAM as part of the computer configuration process , since your computer maker of choice will charge you by the arse - hairs for it .
Instead , if you 're comfortable doing an at - home installation , buy a laptop with the lowest amount of RAM , then buy it separately from Newegg , who even has a helpful tool to pick the right RAM that wo n't blow up your computer .
Crunch the numbers first , of course , but chances are , in big RAM jumps , you will save money .
Another memory tip for those taking the not - as - hard - as - it - sounds cost - cutting step of building their own desktop PC : DDR2 memory is significantly cheaper than DDR3 memory ( $ 60 vs. $ 120 ) , and at equivalent speeds , the performance difference is n't very noticeable .
Your best bet — following our not - skimping guidelines — is to get twice as much DDR2 memory for the same price .

Camera Lenses
The secret about DSLRs that Nikon and Canon do n't wanna tell you in the middle of their arms race is that what really matters is the glass — the lens .
A Canon 20 D — or hell , an XT — with an awesome lens will take better pictures than a 40D with a crummy lens every single time .
Besides , if you really want to maximize your DSLR 's potential , you 're going to need to expand beyond the kit lens that came in the box .
It 's literally like getting new glasses after a decade of avoiding the eye doctor .
Unfortunately , like glasses , camera lenses are one of those things where price really does tend to be commensurate with quality .
Do n't expect fire sales .

Do n't go crappy , instead go used .
A used or refurbished lens is always cheaper than a brand new one .
Of course , you should always buy from a reputable retailer with a good warranty and return policy , in case there 's something wonky with it .
( That applies for new lenses too , really . )
Here 's a list of places to buy used Canon glass .
With older lenses , there might be a few caveats like the lack of autofocus , but as Charlie at Gadget Lab notes in his account of using some more " antique " Nikon glass , the experience with those limitations can actually be rewarding , and help you learn about more photography in the process .
( And is n't learning why you got a DSLR in the first place ? )
If the used route frightens you , another approach is to go with a cheaper camera , and spend the extra money on quality glass .
And guess what ?
Just because a new camera model pops out every six to nine months , it does n't magically make the older models take less excellent pictures .

Portable GPS Navigation Devices
What ?
The GPS navigation in your phone is n't enough ?
Okay , it probably is n't if you actually get behind a wheel to go places .
There are lots of GPS navigation devices , and some of them look pretty good for pretty cheap .
We 're gonna get real specific with our advice here : Get a Garmin Nuvi .
Every .
Time .

We 've road - tested pretty much every navigation device out there , from the smartest cellular connected machines to the dumbest WinCE systems falling off the truck from China , and time and again , we come back to the Nuvi .
That 's not to say you have to spend $ 200 more on a navigator .
Maybe you could track down last year 's top models that are now on sale .
The maps would n't have changed that much in 12 months .
Regardless , even if the Garmin is $ 25 or $ 50 more than the TomTom or Magellan on the shelf next to it , get the Garmin .
The product will last longer and be more simple to use , resulting in your happiness and the happiness of the people stuck in the car with you .
It 's worth the extra scratch .

Headphones
Like liquor , strippers and accountants , when it comes to headphones , you get what you pay for .
In this dimension there 's no such thing as good $ 2 headphones .
You might tolerate them because you know do n't any better ( or you are simply a knowing masochist ) but I guarantee you , they sound like the Tin Man 's rusty ass .

You may recall that our amazing , extensive no -BS headphones battlemodo breaks down the best and the worst in every price category worth considering , and is a great place to start .
The trend of the piece , you might notice , is that you can't go wrong with Shures , which do n't cost as much as some audiophile earphones , but generally have list prices starting at $ 100 .
Good news , my favorites for the money , Shure 's E2 c sound - isolating headphones , now can be had for $ 60 easy , or as low as $ 40 on sale .
Some people prefer those to their current replacement the SE110 ( the E2 c 's are slightly bassier ) , that list for $ 100 but sell for $ 75 at Amazon at the moment .
I know that a few editors at Gizmodo prefer the SE110s , but either way , the " hundred dollar " headphones stomp the cheap - skate models .

It has been painful from the outside looking in to watch President - elect Barack Obama begin to cobble together his cabinet officers and senior staff in regards to what prospects there are for substantive cannabis law reforms in this first term .
There are only a couple of key appointments left that may signal the political tea leafs for cannabis law reforms in Obama 1.0 — head of Drug Enforcement Administration ( which serves under the Attorney General at the Department of Justice ) and the Drug Czar ( see below regarding rumored nominee ) .
Who among current Obama nominees are giving me some acid burn ?
In order of importance :
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
“ For us regarding opposing drugs and any reforms , it is : harms criminal justice ; children ; the pharmaceutical process and the legalization stalking horse . ”
- R.E. , 1997
As a longtime observer of Rahm ’s ascendancy into the stratosphere of politics ( Chicago Mayor Daley ’ staff , President Clinton ’s White House , Congress , and now back to the White as Chief of Staff ) what has me most concerned about Rahm is that for so long he has been so consistent in opposing drug policy reforms , most especially cannabis law reforms .
In the Clinton White House he played a major role in domestic policy making , with a strong nod to matters of criminal justice .
He was effectively the White House ’s point man with the Drug Czar .
In my view , Rahm was not concerned with effective policy - making as much as image making , so as to help inoculate the President ( and Democrats ) from the historical albatross hanging from their necks during most national elections — fear of being viewed by the Republicans , and more importantly the general public , as being ‘ weak on crime ’ .
To put it bluntly , Bill Clinton and Al Gore lied their way up and down the countryside running for the Oval office in the summer of 1992 , promising liberal donors , gay activists and drug policy reformers that if elected , at a minimum , they would expand the federal government ’s Compassionate Investigative New Drug Program ( a.k.a. IND , run by the Public Health Service ) , which allowed for a small handful of federally - approved medical patients to receive up to 300 ‘ joints ’ per / month for a serious medical condition .
When Clinton and Gore took office in 1993 , they immediately felt the political pressure from state politicians , major gay donors and activists , notably from California , who ’d impressed upon Clinton the need for medical cannabis for AIDS and cancer patients .
However , and disappointingly , rather than expand the important research program , Rahm and Co. moved to dismantle it , and by late July 1994 Clinton had canceled the IND program , grandfathering the group of eight patients in the program a columnist at the Washington Post deemed the Acapulco Eight .
Taking a far more politically pragmatic path than a compassionate one , Rahm chose to ignore the science ( and the Constitution I ’d hastily add ) and conflate the somewhat easy to distinguish and politically popular battle for patients to access medicinal cannabis with the decidedly unpopular ‘ War on Some Drugs ’ .
In the spring of 1997 , a writer and author who interviewed Rahm for a major Rolling Stone piece on the ‘ Drug War ’ , after he ’d walked the 3 blocks from Rahm ’s White House office to NORML ’s K St. office , kindly shared with me his three pages of shorthand notes .
The writer , who ’d spent a few days in DC interviewing all of the major players in drug enforcement and drug policy reform had wanted to get an interview with Rahm , because absent the President , there was likely no other person in the nation at the time who had more sway over which way the Executive branch implemented drug control strategies .
When I asked , “ Well , how was the interview , where does Emanuel stand on the issue of marijuana ? ”
The writer looked up from his notes and said , “ NORML is so screwed .
In Emanuel you have the prototypical liberal drug warrior : More government intervention , more laws , more arrests ; less freedom and personal responsibility . ”
What do these notes reveal from 1997 ?
When asked why did the Clinton Administration so actively oppose the 1996 ballot initiatives in California ( and Arizona ) to legalize medical access to cannabis , Rahm ’s replies :
- We opposed the Arizona initiative because it had to with sentencing and harder drugs ;
- We opposed the California initiative because it sent the wrong message to children and we believe that there is downward trend in use right now that these laws will hurt ; send wrong message .
- This procedure should not be done by initiative .
We have procedures whereby drugs are tested and approved .
These initiatives do n’t follow those procedures .
- We took an unpopular position on this .
Our position is based on policy even if polls are going the other way .
When asked ‘ what makes Clinton ’s drug policy any better than George Bush .
Sr.’s ? ’ , Rahm ’s replies :
- We have passed anti-meth legislation before meth has taken off nationally .
Law enforcement are telling me that we got ahead of it .
- Our four points for control : drug testing , drug treatment , coerced abstinence works and if the states want the money for prisons they have to adopt what is proven successful .
- Some members of Congress want to defund the ONDCP , but General McCaffrey is different , brings energy and focus to the job .
- We [ Clinton Administration ] shifted resources from borders to domestic , community policing and drug free school efforts .
- There is nowhere near enough treatment space for the demand .
- This is about attitude and putting federal dollars to work .
When asked about medical marijuana community ( doctors , patients , AIDS and drug policy reform organizations ) , Rahm slapped his head with his hand and said …
-“ We oppose it [ cannabis ] because there is no doubt that the funding comes from those who advocate legalization .
We thought this was the first of many battles and needed to fight . ”
When asked about the high number of annual cannabis arrests in the US , Rahm said :
-“ I ’ve never heard of a police chief who says they waste their time on small time marijuana arrests .
I would be surprised if very many people are being arrested for small marijuana possession . ”
Further , “ For us regarding opposing drugs and any reforms , it is : harms criminal justice ; children ; the pharmaceutical process and the legalization stalking horse . ”
-“ I think there is a sadder side to all of this that McCaffrey has spoken eloquently about how people who have used drugs in the past should not be disqualified or attack for their pasts . ”
Regarding “ marijuana ” :
-“ Yes , we believe it is a genuinely dangerous drug when it comes to kids .
I ’ll show you data after data that kids who go onto to harder drugs started off with marijuana . ”
-“ Laws signal acceptability or not .
In this area we say its unlawful and we think that it helps parents say this is wrong . ”
Whew .
Well , there you have it , from NORML ’s huge archives and directly from the writer ’s notebook circa spring 1997 .
A couple of closing thoughts on Rahm and his views on cannabis …
Tactical and political savvy as Rahm clearly is , history proves the decisions President Clinton and he made regarding medical cannabis ( and decriminalization ) were demonstrably wrong .
Rather than yield any quarter or embrace science , compassion and the Constitution in being so rigid and recalcitrant on the public health / criminal justice conundrum of medicinal cannabis , Rahm actually helped accelerate , not retard , the state - based strategy of reformers .
From 1996 - 2000 , the Clinton Administration failed to stop grassroots efforts to pass state initiatives or legislation in eight states that ‘ legalized ’ medical cannabis ( Bush 2.0 and his Drug Czar John Walters have not faired much better opposing state medical marijuana laws , save for prevailing in the US Supreme Court twice , in 2001 and 2005 .
Though , despite the ‘ high ’ court ’s adverse rulings in these cases , the number of medical cannabis dispensaries , cooperatives and even automated medical cannabis machines have steadily increased .
If reformers lost at SCOTUS , functionally , what did we actually lose ?
My contention is not much as the court ’s rulings do n’t reflect the current political , public health and economic realities facing the respectable minority of Americans who , regardless of their state ’s laws , currently employ cannabis as a therapeutic , often with their physician ’s recommendation .
Reminds one of prior SCOTUS rulings in our nation ’s past regarding race , labor laws , women ’s rights , internment of Japanese Americans , gay and lesbian equality and sexual reproduction laws where society ( and often technology ) is leagues ahead of legislation , and ensuing appellate court action–both of which move at a glacial rate ( unless of course there is multi-billion dollar , taxpayer - funded ‘ bailout ’ to be performed , then federal legislative and court action is performed post haste ) .
Emanuel ’s new boss , and admitted past cannabis consumer President - elect Obama has repeatedly indicated that he does not support the use of federal law enforcement to harass medical cannabis dispensaries in states that have approved medical marijuana laws ; Obama historically supported decriminalizing small amounts of cannabis ( until the end of the contentious Democratic primaries this spring where Obama ‘ flipped - flopped ’ on the issue , and now claims to oppose the decriminalization of cannabis ) and believes that far too many young people are ensnared in an unwieldy and expensive criminal justice system .
Rahm is politically smart if nothing else , so I hope that he ’ll follow his boss ’ lead in the area of criminal justice reforms .
Also , to his credit , after voting years against the Hinchey - Rohrabacher Amendment , in 2007 , as member of Congress from Illinois , Rahm voted in favor of holding back federal funding from law enforcement ( read DEA ) to raid or harass medical marijuana cultivators and dispensaries .
Interestingly , and I do n’t think a coincidence , from 2005 forward Illinois ’ state legislature has held hearings on medical marijuana and prominent ( and compelling ) cases like medical marijuana patient Brenda Kratovil have been featured all over the major news media in the state .
My supposition is that Rahm , in fact a smart , keenly attuned politician , only came to support clipping the DEA ’s wings regarding medical marijuana raids on the west coast after paying close political attention to how citizens in his state — along with its editorial boards and prominent columnists — readily support seriously ill , dying or sense threatened medical patients with a physician ’s recommendation to access cannabis .
However , I fear that Rahm will continue to advocate for a politically cautious ( I ’d say paranoid ) path regarding cannabis law reforms ; is prone to engage in the most oft - trotted out , and easily deflated , myths and canards about cannabis ; and will be too centrist and deferential to law enforcement for political expediency sake .
I just hope his boss and can talk him out of it .
If not his new boss , maybe he should listen to his old boss , Bill Clinton , who has acknowledged that he was wrong to oppose harm reduction tenets : cannabis decriminalization and needle exchange efforts .
Attorney General Nominee Eric Holder
Much has been written and fretted about in the last few days about Obama ’s pick to be the nation ’s top law enforcement official , Attorney General nominee Eric Holder .
There are excellent and probing commentary penned regarding what prospects for criminal justice policy reforms the appointment of Holder portends .
My remarks to Reason ’s excellent ‘ Hit and Run ’ Blog :
“ NORML has serious concerns about the choice of Eric Holder as the next Attorney General because he has a long history of opposing drug policy reforms , perceiving cannabis smoking by adults as a public nuisance worthy of constant harrassment , promoting violent governmental intervention into the private lives of citizens who consume cannabis , supporting mandatory minimum sentencing and so - called civil forfeiture laws .
His attraction to the myth of ‘ fixing broken windows ’ and using law enforcement to crack down on petty crimes will swell an already overburdened , bloated , expensive and failed government prohibition against otherwise law - abiding citizens who choose to consume cannabis . ”
Vice - President Joe Biden
The pick of Joe Biden to be Obama ’s running mate was my first sign of digestive tumult regarding the prospect of ‘ CHANGE ’ for drug policy reform .
Suffice of to say here , because it was already said here , that Biden represents the decade and type of ‘ liberal ’ politician in the 1980s , who , rather than oppose the Reagan - inspired War on Some Drugs , decided to become an enthusiastic supporter and legislative booster .
Biden was at the center of creating the Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) , mandatory minimum sentencing , civil forfeiture laws , the Rave Act , funding for DARE in public schools and the ad campaigns for the Partnership for a Drug Free America .
When asked in Connecticut this past May of pain management , Biden exhorted that “ There ’s got to be a better answer than marijuana . ”
With Biden ( and Emanuel ) loyally by his side , from a purely political point of view , Obama ( like a fellow Baby Boomer - type Bill Clinton before him ) has wisely guarded against right wing attacks that he may be ‘ soft on drugs ’ .
ONDCP Transition Team Director Dr. Don Vereen
As amazingly as it seems to most who come to know that the ONDCP is a cabinet level office ( Thanks Joe Biden ! ) , all cabinet level offices need an official transition team .
So who is heading up the ONDCP transitional team ?
One of the principals is Don Vereen , a former ONDCP deputy director from 1998 - 2001 .
Is Vereen a reform - minded health care professional and ready to embrace ‘ change ’ ?
Unlikely in my view as Vereen told the Psychiatric News in 1999 that he believed that doctors who prescribe marijuana as irresponsible and actually advocated arresting medical patients caught with marijuana .
Yikes !
Vereen , like Emanuel ( and so many other selective prohibitionists ) , has adopted the same rote cited rationalizations why cannabis ca n’t be legally controlled and taxed like thousands of pharmaceuticals currently : marijuana ca n’t be thought of as a therapeutic treatment because it ’s usually smoked and because dosages are difficult to control .
Also , Vereen was on the losing side this past Election Day in Michigan where , in his capacity as director of Community Based Public Health at Univ. of Michigan , he claimed that a medical marijuana initiative ‘ sends the wrong message to children ’ .
These folks sure do stick to the same talking points ….
I hope Vereen does n’t pull a Cheney here and conclude that he is the best person for the job .
Former Congressman James Ramstad for Drug Czar ?
As one of my favorite policy writers and commentators Maia Szalavitz aptly points out in her November 21 Huffington Post article regarding Ramstad :
On paper , Jim Ramstad — who is rumored to be Obama ’s choice for drug czar — looks like the ideal man for the job .
He ’s a recovering alcoholic himself and a Congressman who championed legislation recently passed to provide equal insurance coverage for addictions and other mental illnesses .
Unfortunately , Ramstad may be a drug warrior in recovering person ’s clothing .
There is one issue that has consistently separated those who put science and saving lives in front of politics .
That is needle exchange programs for addicts to prevent the spread of HIV and other blood borne illnesses .
Even President Clinton now says he was “ wrong ” when he ignored the recommendations of every scientific and medical organization in the world that has examined the question — from the AMA to the World Health Organization — and refused to lift the federal ban on funding .
Needle exchanges have been shown repeatedly to reduce HIV and contrary to the claims of opponents , they help addicts get into treatment .
But Bill Clinton had a drug czar — Barry McCaffrey — who said that needle exchange “ sent the wrong message , ” and would make him seem soft on drugs .
McCaffrey fought against it and Clinton now says he “ regrets ” caving in to drug war politics .
Ramstad also — again , against the evidence – opposes medical marijuana and supports federal policing and prosecution of providers and patients in the states that have made it legal .
These states have not seen the rise in teen drug use that opponents like the Congressman predicted .
The opposite , in fact , happened — as is the case in countries that have decriminalized marijuana like Holland .
The UK’s “ downgrading ” of cannabis offense to a lesser status was also accompanied by a drop in use .
There ’s simply no evidence that allowing sick people to get needed medication conflicts with helping addicts .
Obama has said he does not support these prosecutions — will Ramstad push him in the wrong direction here , too ?
In an economic crisis , do we really want to spend federal time and money locking up medical marijuana providers and sick people ?
That ’s not change , President Obama — that ’s more of the same .
Do n’t make the mistake that Bill Clinton did and install a drug czar who will ignore science and push dogma .
Amen Maia !

The Senecavirus is a " new " virus , discovered several years ago by Neotropix Inc. , a biotech company in Malvern , Pennsylvania .
It was at first thought to be a laboratory contaminant , but researchers found it was a pathogen , now believed to originate from cows or pigs .
Further investigation found that the virus was harmless to normal human cells , but could infect certain solid tumors , such as small cell lung cancer , the most common form of lung cancer .
Scientists at Neotrophix say that , in laboratory and animal studies , the virus demonstrates cancer - killing specificity that is 10,000 times higher than that seen in traditional chemotherapeutics , with no overt toxicity .
The company has developed the " oncolytic " virus as an anti-cancer agent and is already conducting early phase clinical trials in patients with lung cancer .
The 3 - D structure of the virus , officially known as Seneca Valley Virus -001 , reveals that it is unlike any other known member of the Picornaviridae viral family , and confirms its recent designation as a separate genus , Senecavirus .
A new study reveals that the virus 's outer protein shell looks like a craggy golf ball¬ — one with uneven divets and raised spikes — and the RNA strand beneath it is arranged in a round mesh rather like a whiffleball .
" It is not at all like other known picornaviruses that we are familiar with , including poliovirus and rhinoviruses , which cause the common cold , " says the study 's senior author , Associate Professor Vijay S. Reddy , Ph.D. , of The Scripps Research Institute .
" This crystal structure will now help us understand how Senecavirus works , and how we can take advantage of it . "
But the researchers still did not know how the virus worked , so they turned to Reddy .
He and his Scripps Research team , especially Sangita Venkataraman , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral researcher , determined the Senecavirus crystal structure .
Reddy describes the differences they found between other picornaviruses and the Senecavirus as like variations among car models of the same manufacturer .
" The chassis is the same , but the body style is different , " he says .
" How the body of a virus is shaped determines how it infects cells . "
The structure of the Senecavirus is also depicted at http://viperdb.scripps.edu/, the " Virus Particle Explorer " developed at Scripps Research by Reddy and his colleagues .
The online database is a worldwide resource for information on the structure of viral particles ; it contains details of 253 viruses to date .

Once the structure of Seneca Valley Virus -001 was solved , researchers went on to identify several areas on the viral protein coat that they think might hook onto receptors on cancer cells in the process of infecting them .
The researchers are now conducting further investigations on this process .
" It will be critically important to find out what region of its structure the virus is using to bind to tumor cells , and what those cancer cell receptors are , " Reddy says .
" Then we can , hopefully , improve Senecavirus enough to become a potent agent that can be used with many different cancers . "
The current financial meltdown is the result of under - regulated markets built on an ideology of free market capitalism and unlimited economic growth .
The fundamental problem is that the underlying assumptions of this ideology are not consistent with what we now know about the real state of the world .
The financial world is , in essence , a set of markers for goods , services , and risks in the real world and when those markers are allowed to deviate too far from reality , “ adjustments ” must ultimately follow and crisis and panic can ensue .
To solve this and future financial crisis requires that we reconnect the markers with reality .
What are our real assets and how valuable are they ?
To do this requires both a new vision of what the economy is and what it is for , proper and comprehensive accounting of real assets , and new institutions that use the market in its proper role of servant rather than master .
The mainstream vision of the economy is based on a number of assumptions that were created during a period when the world was still relatively empty of humans and their built infrastructure .
In this “ empty world ” context , built capital was the limiting factor , while natural capital and social capital were abundant .
It made sense , in that context , not to worry too much about environmental and social “ externalities ” since they could be assumed to be relatively small and ultimately solvable .
It made sense to focus on the growth of the market economy , as measured by GDP , as a primary means to improve human welfare .
It made sense , in that context , to think of the economy as only marketed goods and services and to think of the goal as increasing the amount of these goods and services produced and consumed .
But the world has changed dramatically .
We now live in a world relatively full of humans and their built capital infrastructure .
In this new context , we have to reconceptualize what the economy is and what it is for .
We have to first remember that the goal of the economy is to sustainably improve human well - being and quality of life .
We have to remember that material consumption and GDP are merely means to that end , not ends in themselves .
We have to recognize , as both ancient wisdom and new psychological research tell us , that material consumption beyond real need can actually reduce our well - being .
We have to better understand what really does contribute to sustainable human well - being , and recognize the substantial contributions of natural and social capital , which are now the limiting factors in many countries .
We have to be able to distinguish between real poverty in terms of low quality of life , and merely low monetary income .
Ultimately we have to create a new model of the economy and development that acknowledges this new full world context and vision .
This new model of development would be based clearly on the goal of sustainable human well - being .
It would use measures of progress that clearly acknowledge this goal .
It would acknowledge the importance of ecological sustainability , social fairness , and real economic efficiency .
Ecological sustainability implies recognizing that natural and social capital are not infinitely substitutable for built and human capital , and that real biophysical limits exist to the expansion of the market economy .
Social fairness implies recognizing that the distribution of wealth is an important determinant of social capital and quality of life .
The conventional model has bought into the assumption that the best way to improve welfare is through growth in marketed consumption as measured by GDP .
This focus on growth has not improved overall societal welfare and explicit attention to distribution issues is sorely needed .
As Robert Frank has argued in his latest book : Falling Behind : How Rising Inequality Harms the Middle Class , economic growth beyond a certain point sets up a “ positional arms race ” that changes the consumption context and forces everyone to consume too much of positional goods ( like houses and cars ) at the expense of non-marketed , non-positional goods and services from natural and social capital .
Fore example , this drive to consume more positional goods leads people to reach beyond their means to purchase ever larger and more expensive houses , fueling the housing bubble .
It also fuels increasing inequality of income which actually reduces overall societal well - being , not just for the poor , but across the income spectrum .
Real economic efficiency implies including all resources that affect sustainable human well - being in the allocation system , not just marketed goods and services .
Our current market allocation system excludes most non-marketed natural and social capital assets and services that are huge contributors to human well - being .
The current economic model ignores this and therefore does not achieve real economic efficiency .
A new , sustainable ecological economic model would measure and include the contributions of natural and social capital and could better approximate real economic efficiency .
The new model would also acknowledge that a complex range of property rights regimes are necessary to adequately manage the full range of resources that contribute to human well - being .
For example , most natural and social capital assets are public goods .
Making them private property does not work well .
On the other hand , leaving them as open access resources ( with no property rights ) does not work well either .
What is needed is a third way to propertize these resources without privatizing them .
Several new ( and old ) common property rights systems have been proposed to achieve this goal , including various forms of common property trusts .
The role of government also needs to be reinvented .
In addition to government ’s role in regulating and policing the private market economy , it has a significant role to play in expanding the “ commons sector ” , that can propertize and manage non-marketed natural and social capital assets .
It also has a major role to play as facilitator of societal development of a shared vision of what a sustainable and desirable future would look like .
As Tom Prugh , myself , and Herman Daly have argued in our book “ The Local Politics of Global Sustainability , ” strong democracy based on developing a shared vision is an essential prerequisite to building a sustainable and desirable future .
CONCLUSION
The long term solution to the financial crisis is therefore to move beyond the " growth at all costs " economic model to a model that recognizes the real costs and benefits of growth .
We can break our addiction to fossil fuels , over - consumption , and the current economic model and create a more sustainable and desirable future that focuses on quality of life rather than merely quantity of consumption .
It will not be easy ; it will require a new vision , new measures , and new institutions .
It will require a redesign of our entire society .
But it is not a sacrifice of quality of life to break this addiction .
Quite the contrary , it is a sacrifice not to .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday there are too few black Americans in the State Department .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is greeted Monday by Stillman College President Ernest McNealey .
" I have lamented that I can go into a meeting at the Department of State -- and as a matter fact I can go into a whole day of meetings at the Department of State -- and actually rarely see somebody who looks like me .
And that is just not acceptable , " Rice said .
She was delivering the keynote speech at the annual Conference of the White House Initiative on National Historically Black Colleges and Universities .
" Like so many African - Americans who were fortunate enough to have the benefits of education and all the access that I have had , my story starts with parents and aunts and uncles , and indeed in my case a grandparent , who got their start at historically black colleges , " Rice said .

She praised partnerships between federal government departments and agencies and black colleges .
Last year , such colleges received $ 5 million in scholarships and grants from the State Department for language training , study abroad and exchange programs .
" It 's good for the students , but it is good for America , too , " she said .
" Because when I go around the world , I want to see black Americans involved in the promotion and development of our foreign policy .
I want to see a Foreign Service that looks as if black Americans are part of this great country . "

Sandia researchers Steve Bauer and Georgianne Peek look at equipment that will be used to analyze core samples from the potential Iowa aquifer compressed air energy storage site .
The data will provide necessary fundamental information used for the design and performance of the underground air storage vessel .

Peek thinks a possible solution to high energy costs lies underground .
And it ’s not coal or oil .
It ’s compressed air energy storage ( CAES ) .
“ Until recently energy has been relatively inexpensive .
But now prices are rising dramatically , and we need solutions , ” Peek says .
“ CAES and other storage technologies are not the only answer to our energy needs , but they can be an important part of the solution . ”
CAES facilities function like big batteries .
Electric motors drive compressors that compress air into an underground geologic formation during off - peak electric use times like evenings and weekends .
Then , when electricity is needed most during high - demand times , the precompressed air is used in modified combustion turbines to generate electricity .
Natural gas or other fossil fuels are still required to run the turbines , but the process is more efficient .
This method uses up to 50 percent less natural gas than standard electricity production .
While the concept of compressed air energy storage is more than 30 years old , only two such plants exist — a 17 - year - old facility in McIntosh , Ala. , located about 40 miles north of Mobile , and a 30 - year - old plant in Germany , both in caverns in salt domes .
A third is being developed near Des Moines , Iowa , in an aquifer .
In addition , the Public Service Company of New Mexico ( PNM ) and several other U.S. utilities are considering CAES to help mitigate potential problems associated with the high penetrations of wind generation in their systems .
Sandia is currently managing DOE money to support the design of the Iowa facility , called the Iowa Stored Energy Park ( ISEP ) .
Peek is the project manager .
Developers include more than 100 municipal utilities in Iowa , Minnesota , and the Dakotas .
ISEP will be a nominal 268 megawatt / 13,400 megawatts per hour CAES plant with about 50 hours of storage .
It will utilize the abundant wind generation already in Iowa to charge the plant .
When ISEP is up and running , it could account for 20 percent of the energy used in a year at a typical municipal Iowa utility and could save cities and their utilities as much as $ 5 million each year in purchased energy .
Peek says the Iowa project is pretty far along and is expected to be operational by 2012 .
“ One of the most important tasks that has to be done before a CAES facility can be built is to find a geologic formation that will support it , ” Peek says .
“ ISEP developers are 95 percent sure that they have the right formation , based on the seismic testing at the site , computer modeling , and data from a sister formation . ”
This summer multiple core samples from the potential Iowa aquifer CAES site will be taken and sent to Sandia for analysis by a team led by Steve Bauer .
The analysis will include collection and assessment of the geologic , hydrologic , and rock physics data in the geomechanics laboratory .
The data will provide necessary fundamental information used for the design and performance of the underground air storage vessel .
In 2000 Bauer did similar analysis of rock mechanics of a limestone mine in Norton , Ohio , that was being studied for a potential CAES facility .
That project is still under development .
Peek says that PNM is also studying the application of CAES in its New Mexico service territory to help manage its current renewable energy portfolio and foster the growth of renewable energy sources .
“ Wind often blows at night , ” she says .
“ As electricity is produced at night from the wind farms , it could be stored and eventually make its way into PNM ’s transmission lines during periods of higher need . ”
CAES technology development can trace its roots to the early 1960s when evaluation of gas turbine technology for power production began .
The technology gained momentum during the next decade due to its promising fuel efficiency and response capabilities to provide load - following and peaking power support .
Now utilities are starting to tie CAES technology to wind power — first with the Iowa plant and soon with possible facilities through the nation , Peek says .
“ The wind blows in some areas when electricity is not needed or where the transmission system can’t accept all of the energy , ” she says .
“ Storage enables delivery of the off - peak energy that has been saved in storage to be delivered when it is needed most or has the highest value .
Thus , more renewable energy can be delivered than might be possible without storage . ”

Barack Obama was telling tens of thousands of people how much Vice President Dick Cheney admires John McCain when rain started to fall from the nighttime sky .
“ You notice what happened when I started talking about Dick Cheney ? ” Obama deadpanned .
Obama was upbeat as he traveled across Ohio on the last Sunday before the presidential election .
He has long peppered his speeches at rallies with one - liners , usually at McCain ’s expense .
But on this day , Obama dwelled on them a little longer , punctuating his jokes with chuckles .
“ In the last couple of days , I ’ve just been feeling good , ” he told the crowd at the Cleveland Mall , a public park in the city ’s downtown .

Part of the good cheer , the Democrat said , came from the presence of his wife , Michelle , and the couple ’s two daughters , Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , on a weekend swing across Colorado , Missouri and Ohio .
But there ’s little doubt that polls showing the Illinois senator is favored to defeat McCain , after a grueling 21 - month campaign , also played a role .
Also helpful were the tens of thousands of supporters cheering and chanting his name at each of his three Ohio stops Sunday -- Columbus , Cincinnati and Cleveland .
In Cleveland , Bruce Springsteen was singing to a crowd that filled a plaza surrounded by skyscrapers when Obama ’s motorcade rolled up at nightfall .
Performing solo with an acoustic guitar and harmonica , the rock star led the crowd in singing Woody Guthrie ’s “ This Land Is Your Land . ”

Afterward , he strummed his guitar as he denounced the “ thoughtless , reckless and morally adrift administration ” of President Bush , and called America “ a repository for people ’s hopes ” around the world .
“ It remains a house of dreams , and a thousand George Bushes and a thousand Dick Cheneys will never be able to tear that house down , ” he said , calling the Iraq war , Hurricane Katrina and the economic crisis their legacy .
“ From the beginning , there ’s been something in Sen .
Obama that ’s called upon our better angels , ” Springsteen said .
“ And I suspect it ’s because he ’s had a life where he ’s had to so often call upon his better angels .
And we ’re going to need all the angels we can get on the hard road ahead .
So Sen. Obama , help us rebuild our house . ”
Springsteen went on to sing “ The Rising , ” the song that plays at Obama rallies when the candidate walks onstage .
The singer then introduced Obama and his family .

“ Give it up for Bruce Springsteen , ” Obama told the crowd .
Speaking moments later about his pledge to cut taxes for the middle class , Obama asked those who make less than “ a quarter million dollars a year ” to raise their hands , as he does at every stop .
“ Bruce , do n’t raise your hand now , ” Obama said with a glance offstage .
“ Bruce , you gotta keep your hand down . ”
Obama went on to poke fun at McCain for casting himself as a champion of Joe “ the Plumber ” Wurzelbacher , an Ohio man who spoke out against the Democrat ’s tax plan .
Obama insisted that “ 99.9 % of plumbers ” would get a tax cut under his proposal .
Advertisement
“ Do n’t be hoodwinked , ” he said .
“ Do n’t be bamboozled .
Do n’t fall for the okey - doke . ”
Obama aides said he was not taking the appearance of impending victory for granted .
“ We are totally focused on winning the election at this point , ” said Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass .
“ This is not a done deal . ”
Obama was careful to say as much .
Still , at the end of the speech , he echoed some of Springsteen ’s more expansive language .
Advertisement
“ If you will stand with me and fight by my side , then I promise you this :
We will not just win Ohio , we will win this general election , and together , you and I , we ’re going to change this country , and we will change the world , ” he said .
“ A rising is coming . ”
And as he left the stage , Obama broke into a few dance steps before he waved goodbye .

PHOTOS : OAKS DAY COMMUTER CHAOS
At least one train ground to a halt between stations and some frustrated commuters walked along the tracks to escape .
VRC chairman Rod Fitzroy yesterday said he was very disappointed in the breakdown of the train service from Flemington after the Oaks Day meeting .
He said it was a Connex and State Government matter .
" They refuse to put the necessary funding required to upgrade the service because it is only a spur line to Flemington , " he said .
The trouble started at 4.15 pm when a points failure near Kensington station caused a number of delays at North Melbourne and on the city loop .
About an hour later an empty train became tangled with overhead wires near North Melbourne station and power was cut , stranding a packed train between Kensington and North Melbourne .
Services on the Cragieburn and Upfield lines were also affected , along with some V / Line services .
Some racegoers were directed to Newmarket or Macaulay stations , where they found no trains operating ; some went by bus to Footscray station .
Mr Fitzroy said that after a small hiccup on Derby day he had been assured by Connex officials that the trains would run on schedule for the rest of carnival .
" The problem is they just do n't tell you the truth , " he said .
" Even today when the service broke down after the last race , they said it would be down for 20 minutes , and an hour later they said the trains had been cancelled . "
Paul Kearney , who was on a packed train that ground to a halt between Kensington and North Melbourne stations , said people waited helplessly , " sardine - style " , for a quarter of an hour before climbing off the train and walking .
" When the power went down , the doors unlocked and because people were leaning against the handles , the doors started to open and people almost fell out , " he said .
Trains began running again after 7 pm , but the chaos earlier meant long delays for commuters well into the night .
Connex spokeswoman Kate De Clercq said the delays could not be foreseen and were exacerbated because trains cannot run when there are people walking on the tracks .
" This is just not something we could have planned for , " she said .
" It happened at the worst possible moment . "
Jason and Lou Cochrane , from Tasmania , left the races early at 5 pm but were told to get off at Kensington station before finally catching a taxi an hour and a quarter later .
Mrs Cochrane said many people were forcing open the train doors and jumping off , and some people appeared close to passing out .
Mr Cochrane said the situation was frustrating .
" The fella said : ' Whoever wants to stay on the train , you can , but we 're not going anywhere ' .
" ( He said ) ' The lines have come down on the track and we do n't know how long it 's going to be ' , " Mr Cochrane said .
Yesterday 's Oaks Day crowd was down more than 5,000 on last year .
Mr Fitzroy put the smaller crowd down to the economic situation .
Loading " I think it 's simply a case of some bosses telling their staff that only two could perhaps go to the Oaks rather than four , which had been the case in previous years , " he said .

Monty Python 's Dead Parrot sketch has topped comedy polls
An ancestor of Monty Python 's famous Dead Parrot comedy sketch has been found in a joke book dating back to Greece in the 4th Century .
Philogelos : The Laugh Addict , which has been translated from Greek manuscripts , contains a joke where a man complains that a slave he was sold had died .
" When he was with me , he never did any such thing ! " is the reply .
In the Python sketch , written 1,600 years later , the shopkeeper claims the dead parrot is " pining for the fjords " .
The 265 jokes in Philogelos are attributed to a pair of jokers called Hierocles and Philagrius , about whom very little is known .
Similar themes
Their manuscripts have been published into a multimedia online e-book , which features video of veteran comic Jim Bowen bringing the old jokes back to life in front of a 21st Century audience .
Some of the jokes are strikingly similar to modern ones , with subjects including farts , sex , ugly wives and a dimwit referred to as " a student dunce " .
" One or two of them are jokes I 've seen in people 's acts nowadays , slightly updated , " said Bowen .
" They put in a motor car instead of a chariot - some of them are Tommy Cooper - esque , " he added .
Jim Bowen performed the old jokes in front of a 21st Century audience .
Some jokes are likely to baffle modern audiences , however - especially the ones about lettuce , which only make sense if you share the ancient superstition that the vegetable is an aphrodisiac .
The book has been translated by William Berg , an American professor of Classics .
" The text of Philogelos comes to us from several manuscripts ranging from the 11th to the 15th Centuries , " Berg said .
" All of them trace back to an earlier original , probably - judging from the content and language - from the 4th Century . "
Other jokes in the book include : • Someone needled a well - known wit : " I had your wife , without paying a penny " .
He replied : " It 's my duty as a husband to couple with such a monstrosity .
What made you do it ? " •
An Abderite sees a eunuch talking with a woman and asks him if she 's his wife .
The guy responds that a eunuch is unable to have a wife .
" Ah , so she 's your daughter ? " •
A misogynist is attending to the burial of his wife , who has just died , when someone asks : " Who is it who rests in peace here ? " .
He answers : " Me , now that I 'm rid of her ! "

The price of rat meat has quadrupled in Cambodia this year as inflation puts other meat beyond the reach of poor people , officials say .
With consumer price inflation at 37 per cent according to the latest central bank estimate , demand has pushed a kilogram of rat meat up to around 5,000 riel ( $ 1.48 ) .
Spicy field rat dishes with garlic thrown in have become particularly popular at a time when beef costs 20,000 riel a kilogram .
Officials say rats are fleeing to higher ground from flooded areas of the lower Mekong Delta , making it easier for villagers to catch them .
" Many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets , but they keep some for their family , " Ly Marong , an agriculture official said .
" Not only are our poor eating it , but there is also demand from Vietnamese living on the border with us . "
He estimates that Cambodia supplies more than a tonne of live rats a day to Vietnam .
Rats are also eaten widely in Thailand , while a state government in eastern India this month encouraged its people to eat rats in an effort to battle soaring food prices and save grain stocks .

Today , I sincerely and passionately honor our veterans .
So many have endured unimaginable hardship , trauma or injury .
Some have paid the ultimate price to defend our country .
Veterans are Against the Iraq War
You might assume veterans of the Iraq war support the war .
Overwhelmingly , that is false .
Talk to some of the veterans .
By and large , they think that the invasion of Iraq , or at least our continued occupation , is wrong .
They have seen first - hand the killing and maiming of innocent Iraqi civillians .
They have heard the cries of those falsely accused , who were shipped off to Abu Ghraib .
They have woken up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat , reliving the nightmares they experienced .
They know that the chicken - hawk civilians who started the war and their yes - men in the military leadership are wrong , that the war should be stopped , and the troops brought home .
Renewing My Commitment
That 's why on Veterans ' day , I am honoring the brave men and women who served in the military by renewing my commitment to end the Iraq war .

At the time radio stations banned their music and concerts were cancelled A Vatican newspaper has forgiven the late English singer John Lennon for saying four decades ago that The Beatles were more popular than Jesus .
In an article praising The Beatles , L'Osservatore Romano said Lennon had just been showing off .
Lennon told a British newspaper in 1966 - at the height of Beatlemania - that he did not know which would die out first , Christianity or rock and roll .
At the time , the comparison sparked controversy in the US .
The semi-official Vatican newspaper marked the 40th anniversary of The Beatles ' " White Album " with an article praising Lennon and the Fab Four from Liverpool .
Youthful joke
The paper dismissed Lennon 's much - criticised remark that the Beatles were more famous than Jesus Christ as a youthful joke .
The paper described the remark as " showing off , bragging by a young English working - class musician who had grown up in the age of Elvis Presley and rock and roll and had enjoyed unexpected success " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
L'Osservatore Romano recently got a new editor and now - apart from chronicling the Pope 's daily doings and printing the texts of papal speeches - it sometimes runs articles on entertainment on inside pages , together with extensive reporting on world affairs .
In a half - page illustrated article , the paper praised The Beatles for what it called their " unique and strange alchemy of sounds and words " .
The newspaper said The Beatles 's songs had shown an extraordinary capacity for survival and the White Album album remained a " magical musical anthology " .
In another article on the same page entitled " Twilight of the gods " the newspaper lamented the passing of the golden days of Hollywood and said the mysterious fascination of the star system of Hollywood in the 1950s had been superseded by the cult of so - called celebrities .
Although Pope Benedict has criticised many aspects of modern pop culture , he now allows the newspaper of the tiny independent Vatican state to reflect the reality of the world outside in a way that would have been unthinkable in the days of Pope Paul VI who reigned during heyday of The Beatles .

The fall in asset prices then hits banks ' balance sheets – both because they own many of these assets themselves and because some of their loans have gone sour .
Between the beginning of the crisis and the end of September , there had been $ 580bn of asset writedowns , according to the IMF .
But further falls in asset prices over the past six weeks mean there is more to come .

Jack Cafferty says the Republican party has lost track of what it stands for and is losing its hold on voters .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
This week the Republicans gather for their convention .
For four days , they will labor under the illusion their party is still relevant .
It 's not .
It is entirely fitting that the headliner for this masquerade is a feeble looking 72 - year - old white guy who does n't know how many homes he owns .
It 's more than symbolic that when a million Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure , the Republican candidate for president has lost track of his holdings .
McCain surrounds himself with people like former Republican Sen. Phil Gramm who called America a " nation of whiners " and said we are only suffering a " mental recession . "
That 's the same problem the Republican Party has .
It has lost track of what it used to stand for : small government , a disciplined fiscal policy , integrity .
In a way , the perfect storm of a rapidly changing population -- old white people are n't going to be in the majority very much longer ( and is n't that who most of the Republicans are ? ) -- has combined with the total abdication of principles , Republican or otherwise , of arguably the worst president in the nation 's history to mark the beginning of the end of the Republican Party as we know it .
Republican Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia said it best : " The Republican brand is in the trash can .
If we were dog food , they would take us off the shelf . "
It is so bad that more than 10 percent of the Republican members of the United States Senate are n't even bothering to attend their own party 's convention .
They recognize dog food when they see it .
And it almost does n't matter who the next president is .
We are witnessing the beginnings of a sea change in this country .
A wakeup call has sounded for young people who are suddenly interested enough in politics to make a difference .
New voter registrations across the country are making a mockery of the old polling models .
Voter turnout in the primaries was staggering .
Blacks and Hispanics feel they have a real stake in things -- and as their numbers continue to grow as a percentage of the population , their voice will only get louder .
The march of the next generation is underway and the older generation has no choice but to eventually get out of the way .
Watch for the signs this November .
Republicans stand to be turned out of office at every level -- from the U.S. Congress to governors ' mansions and state legislatures .
Republicans who remain in office will be rendered impotent by their shrinking numbers .
Republicans under George W. Bush have done a lot of damage to this country in the last eight years -- but they have done more damage to themselves .
It will take a good long while and a great deal of soul searching before their brand returns to the shelves in good standing .
Do n't look for it to happen in St. Paul , Minnesota .
This week , Republicans will be happy in the land of make believe .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

Biodiesel makers get subsidy as they sell fuel abroad Biodiesel tax break backfires
U.S. producers reap federal subsidy while selling most of the fuel overseas
Federal subsidies to the U.S. biodiesel industry were supposed to help wean the nation from foreign oil , and a new law in 2009 will bolster the effort , but the money has fueled a controversial side business .
Domestic producers of the renewable fuel have been selling huge quantities of biodiesel in Europe and in other foreign markets , where prices are often better , and then receiving a $ 1 - per- gallon tax credit from Uncle Sam .
Biodiesel , made in the U.S. mostly from soybean oil or recycled cooking oil from restaurants , is blended at low levels with petroleum diesel to reduce emissions and reliance on fossil fuels .
Today , American exports of biodiesel represent more than half of domestic output .
Biodiesel 's $ 1 - per - gallon subsidy , known as the " blender 's tax credit , " is available to U.S. companies that blend biodiesel with petroleum diesel and was intended to boost biodiesel production and encourage diesel marketers to buy the fuel .
Exports have helped some biodiesel companies survive a difficult period in recent years , when high costs and a weak U.S. market forced firms to close plants .
But exporting has been criticized as an abuse of a federal subsidy that was presented to the American public as a down payment on a future in which the U.S. would rely less on fossil fuels .
" This is a government boondoggle financed by the taxpayers , " said Tom Elam , an agricultural economist with FarmEcon in Carmel , Ind. , who estimates biodiesel exports could be costing American taxpayers several hundred million dollars a year .
Texas has more installed biodiesel production capacity than any other state , and several companies along the Houston Ship Channel participate in the export business .
Industry cites benefits
The industry defends exports as a temporary but important practice that has created thousands of " green " jobs and helped build a domestic infrastructure to make the fuel .
In 2009 , a new energy law will require blending of 500 million gallons of biodiesel into the nation 's fuel supply , growing to 1 billion gallons by 2012 .
" It is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of U.S. production will be needed to meet domestic use requirements , " said Manning Feraci , vice president of federal affairs at the National Biodiesel Board , a trade group based in Jefferson City , Mo .
For now , however , the business of exporting the renewable fuel is still going strong .
Through August , the nation 's biodiesel exports hit 511 million gallons , with most of that going to European Union nations and small quantities heading to Mexico and Canada , according to Census Bureau data tracked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
That 's 85 percent of the estimated 600 million gallons that American biodiesel producers will make this year — and that 's only for the first eight months .
In 2007 , the U.S. exported 291 million gallons of biodiesel , and domestic producers made 490 million gallons , government figures show .
Critics say the data highlight how little oversight there is over biofuels programs despite huge federal spending on them .
" It 's probably an indicator that our renewable energy strategy in the United States needs to be revisited , " said Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples , whose office oversees state biofuel initiatives .
But while the biodiesel industry acknowledges the fuel is going overseas , it contends government figures are not reliable and may overstate the issue .
Federal biodiesel export figures actually reflect exports of refined U.S. vegetable and animal oils , which mostly means biodiesel .
Current export data also do not draw a distinction between domestically produced biodiesel and foreign - produced biodiesel that passes through U.S. ports .
Through August , the U.S. had imported 232 million gallons of biodiesel , Census figures show .
Yet even if all the foreign fuel were included in the 511 million gallon export figure , domestic producers would still be sending about half their output abroad .
Like ethanol , biodiesel has been touted as a homegrown way to help reduce U.S. dependence on oil , cut tailpipe emissions and aid American farmers .
Ethanol , which is blended with gasoline , also is subsidized , but almost all of it is consumed domestically .
The $ 1 - per- gallon biodiesel tax credit was created under the 2004 American Jobs Act .
The tax credit had been set to expire at the end of 2008 , but recently received an extension for another year .
Vegetable oil costs
Today , the domestic biodiesel industry has more than 2 billion gallons of installed production capacity from more than 170 plants in 40 states .
Texas has 686 million gallons of production capacity in 31 plants .
More than half of that capacity is located along the Houston Ship Channel , said Jess Hewitt , president of the Biodiesel Coalition of Texas .
But many U.S. plants shut down temporarily this year after soaring vegetable oil prices made production too costly .
Some of those that kept working relied on exports to stay afloat .
John Kellogg , spokesman for World Energy , a Boston - based biofuel marketing firm that exports biodiesel out of the Ship Channel , said he sees no conflict with sending U.S. subsidized fuel overseas .
" Support from the federal government in the form of a tax credit is appropriate to allow biodiesel to become a global business and a global competitor , " he said .

The degeneration of journalism into “ infotainment ” has been bemoaned by the mandarins of the profession ever since the cable news revolution knocked the networks off their pedestal .
Now the Internet is overtaking the cable channels as the place news consumers go to get their infotainment fix  or , alternatively , where they go to find out what the mainstream media is n’t telling us .
In any case , the perception of a rapid degeneration of the news - gathering business into something other than journalism is not exactly a new complaint .
What is new is that this long - standing complaint has a fresh angle on it .
With the entire concept of reporting the “ news ” already endangered , the hysterical warmongering that followed in the wake of 9/11 completed the process of degeneration begun long ago .
In the post - 9/11 world , the news , as such , no longer exists : what we have now is a “ narrative . ”
Listen long and hard to the talking heads on TV and you ’ll hear that phrase echoing down through the cable - vision canyons , bouncing off the walls and endlessly repeated by reporters , bloggers , and water - cooler savants :
It ’s the narrative , stupid .
The meaning  and danger  of the narrative was masterfully demonstrated in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
The facts were tossed aside , or else cherry - picked and arranged in such a fashion as to mimic the truth while telling a brazen lie .
The tallest of tales were woven around a story line , in which the central figure was a power - mad dictator whose quest for “ weapons of mass destruction ” posed a danger not only to his neighbors , but to the whole world .
George W. Bush even suggested that Saddam was about to launch an armed attack on the continental United States .
Iraqi drones , specially made to launch biological and chemical weapons , were supposedly assembled and ready to drop WMD on American cities .
As dumb as this idea appears to be , some members of Congress apparently fell for it .
After the truth came out about the “ drones , ” however  they never existed  at least one vexed congressman found out that the photos he had been shown of these purported “ weapons of mass destruction ” were fakes , taken somewhere in the American Southwest .
That ’s not the only forgery that figures among the War Party ’s key bits of “ evidence ” against the Iraqi regime .
Do n’t forget the famous Niger uranium forgeries , a cache of documents so crudely faked that it took IAEA scientists only a few Google sessions to unmask the fraud .
Ahmed Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress , the source of most of the “ intelligence ” that lied us into war , reportedly maintained a forgery factory that churned out these productions with clock - like regularity .
( All of it paid for , incidentally , by you , the American taxpayers : we paid Chalabi millions to dupe us , thanks to Bill Clinton and his administration ’s sponsorship of the Iraq Liberation Act , which was supported by the leadership of both parties . )
The point is that no one seems to care about these forgeries , although their promulgation and distribution to members of Congress and U.S. government agencies is a federal crime .
Presidents have been impeached for less .
Yet I would n’t hold my breath until the indictments start coming down , because it is n’t going to happen , and only part of the reason is political .
The real reason is that lying is no longer considered beyond the pale .
It ’s expected , and near - universally accepted as normal , as long as it ’s done by the right people , in the right way .
Lying with style is certainly one way to describe the selling of the Iraqi WMD myth as “ fact , ” one dutifully reported by news organizations worldwide until the final evidence of their nonexistence was unveiled .
John Edwards lying about his relationship with a woman who is not his wife is a prime example of how not to do it : no style .
On the other hand , Franklin Delano Roosevelt lying us into war for our own good  now that ‘s style !
FDR gets a pass , and even a pat on the back , because the narrative of the farseeing father - figure who knew what was best for his people allegedly trumps any considerations of truth as a higher value .
As they passed off faked photos and forged documents as valid arguments for attacking Iraq , the War Party doubtless conjured FDR ’s example as a rationale and an inspiration .
After all , Saddam , according to them , was the modern - day equivalent of Hitler , so anything was justified in removing him from power , a task that only a war of “ liberation ” could accomplish .
The mainstream media turned itself into a transmission belt for this pack of lies , with the front page of the New York Times given over to Judith Miller and her pals in the administration to use as their personal bulletin board .
Certainly the neocons made the job of journalists a lot easier : in writing about Iraq , reporters always had plenty of colorful ( albeit improbable ) stories to relate , fully realized fantasies carefully constructed out of whole cloth by a talented ( if sometimes careless ) cadre of war propagandists .
Take , for example , the Mohammed Atta meeting at Prague airport with a high - ranking official of Saddam ’s intelligence service .
It never happened , yet it was an enthralling story , one that had all the elements of a good drama , which in part accounts for its persistence in spite of repeated debunkings .
It became a kind of urban legend , right up there with those giant alligators in the New York City sewer system .
The Iraq narrative of Mad Dictator Armed With Nukes was useful , as long as it lasted .
By the time it was finally and definitively debunked , we were already waist - deep in the Iraqi quagmire , with not much hope of getting out any time soon .
Outing a CIA agent was the least of the crimes committed by the pro-war cabal within the administration , but they ’ll never do jail time for the worst of their actions , because , after all , it was part and parcel of the narrative that everyone supposedly believed at the time .
Why , every intelligence agency in the world believed Saddam was hiding his WMD  that ’s the fallback position of the War Party these days , a curious tautology that makes one wonder whether they were prepared to believe anything else , and ignores the fact that all contrary evidence was systematically suppressed .
Which brings us to the primacy of narrative in the post - 9/11 era .
The story the government was telling us was certainly geared to the horrors of the post - 9/11 imagination , one peopled by monsters armed with the most terrible weapons , mercilessly stalking us .
Visions of mass death , imprinted on the popular imagination by the events of 9/11 , were projected on every surface , and Congress was stampeded by fear  and , for the War Party , a fortuitous episode of anthrax - in - the - mails  into passing the so - called PATRIOT Act .
The same mass hysteria bullied Congress into sitting quietly while the neocons took us to war and kept most opposition prostrate and halfhearted until it was far too late to reverse the tragic course of events .
That the media was also bullied into projecting the image of al - Qaeda onto a figure who had nothing to do with 9/11 was certainly demonstrated by the rather embarrassing polls that show huge numbers of people still believe Saddam was behind 9/11 , in spite of the complete lack of evidence to back up such a thesis .
The news media , in uncritically reporting the pronouncements of U.S. government officials , transmitted a fantasy and embedded it so firmly in the American consciousness that no amount of retrospective debunking is ever going to eradicate it completely .
The story the administration was telling reporters was a good one by the standards of Hollywood , but not any school of journalism I ’ve ever heard of .
And that was considered good enough .
One would think that , in view of how they were taken for a ride by their sources , reporters would have learned something from the experience of Iraq .
But no , they ’re doing the same thing when it comes to reporting Russia ’s mini-war with Georgia in the Caucasus .
Except in this case , their collusion with the administration seems not just the result of laziness , but of willful blindness .
I ’ve already noted the Bizarro World reportage coming out of the Western media that ignores or even denies the signal event that started this war : Georgia ’s invasion of South Ossetia , which had been de facto independent since the early 1990s .
The vicious assault on Tskhinvali , the South Ossetian capital , is slowly coming to light , but the War Party is ready to downplay the casualty numbers .
According to Human Rights
Watch , less than 50 were killed in the hours - long assault , although Peter Finn , writing in the Washington Post , compared the look of the devastated city to that of Stalingrad during the worst battles of World War II .
Yes , the Georgian government bombed its own alleged citizens , and , yes , many were killed , though how many is not yet known .
But whatever the numbers , they wo n’t be reported except very belatedly by the Western news media  with a few exceptions  because the facts get in the way of the narrative , the story line being laid out for the next round of warmongering , one that will be conducted , perhaps , by the next American president .
When a good narrative is overused , it becomes counterproductive , and the War Party ’s story line with a Middle Eastern background is surely getting a little frayed around the edges .
What ’s needed , therefore , is a new narrative , one involving an authoritarian dictator who poses an alleged “ threat ” to our national interests , and preferably one who already possesses weapons of mass destruction .
Vladimir Putin seems typecast for the role : his stern , unforgiving visage , the cult of personality that has grown up around him in Russia ( unlike our president , he ’s popular with his own people ) , and his background as a KGB officer who rose up through the ranks  he ’s perfect for the role of the New Hitler , albeit with a dash of Stalin thrown in the mix .
Villains are n’t enough to make a good narrative .
What ’s needed are heroes , the good guys , in this case the Georgians , whose president , Mikheil Saakashvili , claims to be a friend of “ freedom . ”
Of course , this concept has been used many times as a mask for tyranny , and Saakashvili might want to ask the owners of that television station he closed down on the eve of the last election what the word “ freedom ” means to them .
He might also want to ask the 500 demonstrators injured during protest demonstrations , beaten on the streets by Saakashvili ’s police for daring to speak out against his draconian crackdown on the opposition , the primary leaders of which were jailed before they could cast their votes .
Ah , but no matter : the War Party can make a sow’s ear into a silk purse , or reverse the process when necessary .
It ’s all about the ability to tell a good story and make it stick as long as possible .
So we have a villain and a hero .
What ’s needed are a few choice historical analogies , and more than a few have been thrown around : the annexation of the Sudetenland , the Munich pact , the run-up to World War II  and Hitler , always Hitler , haunting us with his long , dark shadow , loving conjured by the War Party as lessons for today .
Facts , real lives shattered , even thousands of deaths  none of it matters .
It ’s all blown away like so much detritus in the wind .
The gale force of the narrative carries us forward , by sheer momentum : NATO condemns the “ Russian invasion , ” and the Georgians are patted on the back , promised lots of taxpayers dollars , and told to bide their time .
The narrative marches on
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
but not without a few obstacles in its path , and one of them  one of the big ones  is this Web site .

Nir Barkat is on his second attempt to become Jerusalem mayor Israeli secular politician Nir Barkat has defeated an ultra-orthodox rabbi to become the new mayor of Jerusalem .
Mr Barkat won outright with 52 % of the vote while Meir Porush received 43 % , according to final results released by Israel 's interior ministry .
The hard - fought campaign has raised tensions between Israel 's religious and secular Jews .
Claiming victory , Mr Barkat promised to be " everybody 's mayor " , regardless of who people had voted for .
" I 'm aware of the depth of the challenge and the complexity of the mission .
Now is the time to work together for the good of the city , " Mr Barkat told his supporters .
The 49 - year - old 's victory ends a five - year rule of ultra-Orthodox Mayor Uri Lupolianski .
Major challenges
Mr Barkat opposes dividing Jerusalem as part of any peace agreement with the Palestinians and has promised to build extensively in what the rest of the world regards as occupied East Jerusalem .
NEW JERUSALEM MAYOR Former paratrooper High - tech entrepreneur Jerusalem city councillor Campaigned on a secular ticket
Profile : Nir Barkat
Holy city faces splits and decline Obstacles to peace : Jerusalem Most Palestinians and Israeli Arabs - who account for about a third of Jerusalem 's population - have not taken part in the election .
The status of Jerusalem is one of the most hotly - contested issues in Israeli - Palestinian negotiations .
Israelis see the city as their capital , and Palestinians want to locate the capital of a future state in the east of the city , which Israel occupied in the 1967 Israeli - Arab war .
Correspondents say that as well as handling the political tensions , the mayor faces major challenges improving traffic flow and cleanliness , tackling high property prices and attracting fresh business to the city .
Local elections took place in 160 other areas of Israel ahead of national polls on 10 February .

Somewhere , sometime today , the Early Ammonia Servicer ( EAS ) will drop to Earth at 100 mph .
A huge piece of space junk discarded from the space station in 2007 will drop through the atmosphere some time today ( Sunday ) .
The Early Ammonia Servicer , otherwise known as the EAS , was detached from the orbiting outpost as its services were no longer required .
The double - refrigerator - sized piece of equipment weighs 635 kg ( 1400 lb ) and is filled with toxic ammonia .
Although NASA believes most of its mass will disintegrate during re-entry , there ’s a real chance of up to 15 pieces of the EAS reaching the ground , the largest piece could weigh up to 17.5 kg ( 40 lb ) .
But here ’s the funny thing , as the EAS is currently skirting along the outermost reaches of the atmosphere , we are uncertain as to when , or where , the re-entry will take place .
NASA and U.S. Space Surveillance
Network scientists have done well to narrow the re-entry window down to one day .
Fortunately , 70 % of the planet is covered in water , so we should be fine .
But should any parts of the EAS find solid ground , NASA has warned that we should n’t approach any suspicious - looking ( and probably steaming ) bits of meteorite in case the EAS still has some ammonia on board …
The EAS was jettissoned from the space station on July 23rd , 2007 by Astronaut Clay Anderson and cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin during an EVA lasting nearly 8 hours .
The station ’s robotic arm ( operated by Oleg Kotov ) helped the space walking crew toss the EAS overboard .
It was n’t a simple task however ; as the EAS is so big , it was becoming a serious logistics problem .
Not only that , but the unit had to be pushed toward the Earth just before the station carried out a re-boost operation by a docked Soyuz spaceship .
That way , the station was promoted to a higher orbit , whilst the EAS began its long spiral toward the Earth ’s atmosphere , thus avoiding any chance of a troublesome re-encounter in a later orbit .
Although the EAS was predicted to stay in orbit for 300 days , it ’s lasted significantly longer , reaching the 15 month mark .
Back in July this year , it was reported by several astronomers that the EAS was clearly visible from the ground .
Unfortunately , any viewing opportunities are about to come to an abrupt end , with the EAS exploding into a speeding fireball at some point around the globe ( everythere , that is , except for Antarctica ) .
All going well , the EAS should explode , with any debris falling into the ocean .
Although the likelihood of the EAS landing even remotely close to a populated region is slim , let ’s hope this piece of space debris does n’t create any chance of becoming a health risk ( whether that be from sniffing ammonia or a twisted chunk of metal falling into your living room ) .

As the rain begins to fall on Tanzania 's Tarangire National Park , thousands of zebra , wildebeest and giraffe will begin one of the world 's greatest migrations .
But many of the herds trampling across the grass at the foot of the Rift Valley highlands are falling in number - and scientists do not know why .
To find out , they are using a new ' photo - fit ' system that can recognise individual animals by their unique skin patterns , which are as distinct as a human fingerprint .
The park , dotted with muddy water holes and ancient baobab and acacia trees , has the highest diversity of migratory hoofed mammal ( ungulate ) species in the world .
The animals move out of the park as the wet season begins , in search of new feeding and calving grounds .
They will make the return dry season journey in June , to take advantage of the permanent water of the Tarangire river .
Numbers of wildebeest have fallen from 50,000 to 6,000 in the past 20 years , and numbers of antelope species , such as hartebeest and oryx , have declined by 90 and 95 per cent respectively .
Confusingly some species - zebra , giraffe , gazelle and buffalo - have remained relatively stable .
To understand such contrasting fortunes , scientists from America 's Dartmouth and Utah universities are working to determine whether habitat loss , changed food sources , or hunting - or a combination of all - is responsible .
Traditionally animals have been tracked by being captured and tagged , but that is ' expensive and invasive ' , says Dartmouth 's Doug Bolger .
The aerial counts conducted every few years by the Tanzanian authorities do n't provide comprehensive data .
So the scientists have turned to computer - assisted photo identification - the first time the method has been used on such a large scale .
' This new technology allows us to get the best handle on what the population is doing , ' Bolger says .
' Is it increasing , declining , is our response sufficient to offset mortality , is high mortality happening in or outside the park , and what should management do ? '
The scientists hope that by helping to understand the impact of human activity , and studying birth rates and breeding sites , their research will provide strategies to help wildlife managers to conserve large mammal migrations throughout East Africa .
' What we 'd like to understand is why some migratory routes have shut down , ' says Bolger .
' By analysing the movement of certain species , we hope to understand what makes a landscape they will pass through and what wo n't . '
Other factors are whether animals always return to the same calving grounds , and what happens when a food source is blocked off .
The team identify an individual animal by its stripe width , colour and shape , the distance between the marks and whether it has unique characteristics such as scars or , in the case of some wildebeest , broken or deformed horns .
Only a handful of projects worldwide have used this individual pattern recognition technique so far , on work with marbled salamanders in the US and whale sharks off the coast of Australia .
' Photo mark - recapture has n't been used on wildebeest before , ' says PhD student Tom Morrison .
' There was some scepticism that it would work - but there are lots of animals with natural variability , so there is huge potential for using this technology . '
Large numbers animals are photographed according to strict criteria - a right - facing animal at a right angle to the camera , for instance .
To help , the environmental charity Earthwatch provides a stream of volunteers .
Hundreds of digital images are collected in the field each day and the animal 's stripe or spot pattern is mapped using a 3D model .
Custom - built software then extracts the pattern and compares it with a database of previously photographed individuals .
' What we 're interested in is the probability that this is an animal that we " captured " two years ago - if it is , that tells us that it 's still alive .
And if we do n't re-photograph it , then we can estimate what the survival rate is , ' says Bolger .
At a later stage the figures will be crunched through another computer program , to generate estimates of population size , survival and reproduction rates .
' We 're still at least a year away from being able to use all this data to come up with population estimates and survival rates , ' says Bolger .
But as more and more animals are added to the researchers ' photo albums , the difficulties the herds face on their trek across the picture - perfect savannah come a little closer to being understood - and protection is a step closer .
Great migrations under threat
Serengeti-Mara
The migration of wildebeest and zebra from Tanzania 's Serengeti national park into Kenya 's Masai Mara reserve is one of the greatest natural spectacles on Earth .
More than 2 million herbivores - about 200,000 zebra , 500,000 Thomson 's gazelle and 1,500,000 wildebeest - thunder up to 700 miles northwards across East Africa 's plains at the beginning of the dry season in June .
Today meat poaching to supply local food markets is considered to be the most serious threat , while agriculture is also encroaching upon the migratory routes .
Bison
The numbers of this ' American buffalo ' were once so high that their thundering stampedes across the prairies could be heard from great distances .
Hunted almost to extinction during the 19th century by white settlers who wanted their hides , they were also killed for posing a threat to the running of the growing railroad industry .
Thanks to conservation efforts introduced after their numbers dropped below 1,000 , the American bison now roams freely in protected areas , numbering around 200,000 .
Southern Sudan
In 2007 scientists discovered what they believed to be the biggest migration of wild animals on Earth .
An aerial survey revealed vast herds of gazelle and antelope on the move in southern Sudan in a region which had been assumed to have been denuded of its wildlife by years of civil war .
They put the total number of migratory animals at 1.3 million , but poaching , oil exploration and fighting in Sudan all pose a threat to the survival of the migration and its species .
Monarch butterfly
Every year thousands of these black and tan coloured butterflies fly up to 3,000 miles south from their home in the Rocky Mountains to spend the North American winter in the warmer climates of Mexico and southern California .
But illegal deforestation and habitat destruction in the highland fir forests of Mexico that are essential to the monarchs ' survival has led to a drop in numbers .

As you gorge on food this holiday season , you might not want to think about the fat content of all the goodies you 've indulged in .
Nevertheless , your brain will be keeping tabs directly , suggests a report in the November 26th issue of the journal Cell , a Cell Press publication .
Researchers have discovered in studies of rats that one type of lipid produced in the gut rises after eating fatty foods .
Those so called N - acylphosphatidylethanolamines or NAPEs enter the bloodstream and go straight to the brain , where they concentrate in a brain region that controls food intake and energy expenditure .
The good news is that the most abundant form of NAPE does n't seem to lose its effectiveness even when it is artificially administered over the course of several days .
That means treatments designed to boost NAPE levels might offer a new way to fight obesity .
" A lot of gut hormones have an effect on food , but when you give them chronically they lose their effectiveness , " said Gerald Shulman of Yale University School of Medicine .
Or , for instance , another nutrient - sensing , gut - derived peptide known as CCK leads animals and people to eat smaller meals , but they eat them more often , yielding no change in the overall calories consumed , he said .
" Here , we gave rats NAPE for five days and saw a continuous reduction in food intake and a decline in body weight , " Shulman said .
" It suggests NAPE or long - acting NAPE analogs may treat obesity . "
For that , however , much work remains to extend the new findings in rats to humans , he added .
The researchers focused in on NAPEs potential role as a fat intake signal after screening the blood for lipids that rise after a high - fat feeding .
Among the increased metabolites was a class of phospholipids , the NAPEs , of previously unknown physiologic function in plasma .
Now , they show that NAPEs are secreted into circulation from the small intestine in response to ingested fat and that systemic administration of the most abundant circulating NAPE , at doses naturally found in the bloodstream , lowers food consumption in rats without making food unappealing to the animals .
By injecting radiolabeled NAPE into the animals , they found that the lipid enters the brain and is particularly concentrated in the hypothalamus .
Infusions of NAPE directly into the brain also led the animals to cut back on calories , supporting the notion that its effects may be mediated through direct interactions with the central nervous system .
Curiously , they also found that NAPE left the animals in what is sometimes described as a food coma .
Animals fed a high - fat diet for 35 days lose the normal increases in circulating NAPE after a fatty meal .
That suggest that derangements in NAPE secretion associated with chronic high - fat feeding may contribute to diet - induced obesity precipitated by overexposure to triglyceride - rich foods .
However , those animals still responded to NAPE treatment .
" These results suggest that chronic C16:0 NAPE treatment is capable of generating a state of negative energy balance over multiple days and merits longer - term studies in rodents and nonhuman primates to examine its potential for treatment and prevention of diet - induced obesity , " the researchers wrote .
" In conclusion , these data support the hypothesis that circulating NAPEs , synthesized in the small intestine from ingested fat , may be part of an important physiologic negative feedback loop that serves to reduce food intake and arousal after a fat - containing meal . "

Australia 's water supplies under pressure
Australia 's second largest city , Melbourne , has uncomfortably low water storage levels , as most of the country faces a hot and dry summer , experts say .
Claude Piccinin , deputy executive director of the Water Services Association of Australia , delivered the update at a press briefing at the Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne today .
" The storage level is just below 34 % .
That is not a comfort zone , " says Piccinin .
" The picture is not pretty . "
Piccinin says around the same time last year Melbourne 's dam storage levels were 40 % .
" September and October is when Melbourne gets its best rainfall and it's been very very dry , " he says .
Melbourne received only 26 millimetres of rain during September and October - the driest on record .
According to Piccinin the long term average is 124 millimetres .
Piccinin says Melbourne 's daily water use during 2008 has been slightly higher than last year , because of people watering gardens dried out by the weather .
With predictions of a warmer summer , Piccinin says there is a great need for additional water sources , welcoming a planned desalination plant for the city and a new pipeline to bring water from the Goulburn Valley to the north .
Other cities
Piccinin says a number of Australian cities have improved their dam storage levels , but suggests it is no time for complacency .
For example , he says , Brisbane storage levels have recovered from a low of 20 % in 2007 to 42 % this year .
But , he adds the city 's largest dam is at only 27 % .
" They are certainly not out of jail at this point of time , " says Piccinin .
He says the nation 's capital , Canberra , has improved its storage , now at 52 % , in part relying on water from the Murrumbidgee River and elsewhere .
Sydney 's water supplies have improved from 59 % last year to a stable 66 % since February 2008 - in part this has been managed by transferring water from the Shoalhaven water system , says Piccinin .
He says Sydney 's planned desalination plant puts it in a " much better position than just about every other city . "
Perth has storage at 42 % , while Adelaide at the end of the River Murray , has storage of 73 % , relying more on drawing on the river than storage .
Darwin and Hobart , the only Australian cities without water restrictions , have storage levels of 90 % and 95 % respectively , says Piccinin .
He says Australians overall are using far less water than they used to thanks to water restrictions , recycled water , rainwater tanks , water efficiency measures and higher water prices .
" Some water utilities are starting to rate garden plants in the same way as washing machines , " he says .
But Piccinin says water efficiency gains are being more than offset by population growth which will increase by a third in Australia 's capital cities over the next 25 years .
" Between 2005 and 2030 Melbourne will have to accommodate another million people , " he says .
Hotter and drier food bowl
The briefing also heard an update on the state of the Murray - Darling Basin , Australia 's food bowl , and home to many sensitive environmental areas .
Bureau of Meteorology senior climatologist Dr Andrew Watkins says the basin has been suffering the results of overlapping dry periods and the second warmest seven - year period on record .
" This is the worst drought we 've seen over the Murray - Darling Basin , " he says .
" It 's very hard on the farmers . "
Watkins says while the rise in temperature is consistent with climate change , it is not possible at this stage to confirm whether the reduction in rainfall is directly linked .
Dr Wendy Craik , chief executive of the Murray - Darling Basin Commission told the briefing that internationally important wetlands such as the Lower Lakes and other " icon sites " are continuing to deteriorate due to low inflows to the basin .
" There 's no real relief in sight , " she says .
" There 's very little environmental water . "
Craik says only 2 gigalitres of river water will be available to maintain drought refuges and avoid loss of species .
She says water trading of hundreds of gigalitres has helped irrigators and communities survive by reducing the effect of drought by 50 % .
Craik says the Commission 's strategy is to continue to minimise evaporation and salinity while maximising water availability .
The media briefing was facilitated by the Australian Science Media Centre .
Sometimes , when a political campaign has run out of ideas and senses that the prize is slipping through its fingers , it rolls up a sleeve and plunges an arm , shoulder deep , right down to the bottom of the barrel .
The problem for John McCain , Sarah Palin , and the Republican Party is that the bottom was scraped clean long before it dropped out .
Back when the polls were nip and tuck and the leaves had not yet begun to turn , Barack Obama had already been accused of betraying the troops , wanting to teach kindergartners all about sex , favoring infanticide , and being a friend of terrorists and terrorism .
What was left ?
The anticlimactic answer came as the long Presidential march of 2008 staggered toward its final week : Senator Obama is a socialist .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
“ This campaign in the next couple of weeks is about one thing , ” Todd Akin , a Republican congressman from Missouri , told a McCain rally outside St. Louis .
“ It ’s a referendum on socialism . ”
“ With all due respect , ” Senator George Voinovich , Republican of Ohio , said , “ the man is a socialist . ”
At an airport rally in Roswell , New Mexico , a well - known landing spot for space aliens , Governor Palin warned against Obama ’s tax proposals .
“ Friends , ” she said , “ now is no time to experiment with socialism . ”
And McCain , discussing those proposals , agreed that they sounded “ a lot like socialism . ”
There has n’t been so much talk of socialism in an American election since 1920 , when Eugene Victor Debs , candidate of the Socialist Party , made his fifth run for President from a cell in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary , where he was serving a ten - year sentence for opposing the First World War .
( Debs got a million votes and was freed the following year by the new Republican President , Warren G. Harding , who immediately invited him to the White House for a friendly visit . )
As a buzzword , “ socialism ” had mostly good connotations in most of the world for most of the twentieth century .
That ’s why the Nazis called themselves national socialists .
That ’s why the Bolsheviks called their regime the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , obliging the socialist and social democratic parties of Europe ( and America , for what it was worth ) to make rescuing the “ good name ” of socialism one of their central missions .
Socialists — one thinks of men like George Orwell , Willy Brandt , and Aneurin Bevan — were among Communism ’s most passionate and effective enemies .
The United States is a special case .
There is a whole shelf of books on the question of why socialism never became a real mass movement here .
For decades , the word served mainly as a cudgel with which conservative Republicans beat liberal Democrats about the head .
When Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan accused John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson of socialism for advocating guaranteed health care for the aged and the poor , the implication was that Medicare and Medicaid would presage a Soviet America .
Now that Communism has been defunct for nearly twenty years , though , the cry of socialism no longer packs its old punch .
“ At least in Europe , the socialist leaders who so admire my opponent are upfront about their objectives , ” McCain said the other day — thereby suggesting that the dystopia he abhors is not some North Korean - style totalitarian ant heap but , rather , the gentle social democracies across the Atlantic , where , in return for higher taxes and without any diminution of civil liberty , people buy themselves excellent public education , anxiety - free health care , and decent public transportation .
The Republican argument of the moment seems to be that the difference between capitalism and socialism corresponds to the difference between a top marginal income - tax rate of 35 per cent and a top marginal income - tax rate of 39.6 per cent .
The latter is what it would be under Obama ’s proposal , what it was under President Clinton , and , for that matter , what it will be after 2010 if President Bush ’s tax cuts expire on schedule .
Obama would use some of the added revenue to give a break to pretty much everybody who nets less than a quarter of a million dollars a year .
The total tax burden on the private economy would be somewhat lighter than it is now — a bit of elementary Keynesianism that renders doubly untrue the Republican claim that Obama “ will raise your taxes . ”
On October 12th , in conversation with a voter forever to be known as Joe the Plumber , Obama gave one of his fullest summaries of his tax plan .
After explaining how Joe could benefit from it , whether or not he achieves his dream of owning his own plumbing business , Obama added casually , “ I think that when you spread the wealth around , it ’s good for everybody . ”
McCain and Palin have been quoting this remark ever since , offering it as prima - facie evidence of Obama ’s unsuitability for office .
Of course , all taxes are redistributive , in that they redistribute private resources for public purposes .
But the federal income tax is ( downwardly ) redistributive as a matter of principle : however slightly , it softens the inequalities that are inevitable in a market economy , and it reflects the belief that the wealthy have a proportionately greater stake in the material aspects of the social order and , therefore , should give that order proportionately more material support .
McCain himself probably shares this belief , and there was a time when he was willing to say so .
During the 2000 campaign , on MSNBC ’s “ Hardball , ” a young woman asked him why her father , a doctor , should be “ penalized ” by being “ in a huge tax bracket . ”
McCain replied that “ wealthy people can afford more ” and that “ the very wealthy , because they can afford tax lawyers and all kinds of loopholes , really do n’t pay nearly as much as you think they do . ”
The exchange continued :
YOUNG WOMAN :
Are we getting closer and closer to , like , socialism and stuff ?. . .
MCCAIN : Here ’s what I really believe :
That when you reach a certain level of comfort , there ’s nothing wrong with paying somewhat more .
For her part , Sarah Palin , who has lately taken to calling Obama “ Barack the Wealth Spreader , ” seems to be something of a suspect character herself .
She is , at the very least , a fellow - traveller of what might be called socialism with an Alaskan face .
The state that she governs has no income or sales tax .
Instead , it imposes huge levies on the oil companies that lease its oil fields .
The proceeds finance the government ’s activities and enable it to issue a four - figure annual check to every man , woman , and child in the state .
One of the reasons Palin has been a popular governor is that she added an extra twelve hundred dollars to this year ’s check , bringing the per-person total to $ 3,269 .
A few weeks before she was nominated for Vice - President , she told a visiting journalist — Philip Gourevitch , of this magazine — that “ we ’re set up , unlike other states in the union , where it ’s collectively Alaskans own the resources .
So we share in the wealth when the development of these resources occurs . ”
Perhaps there is some meaningful distinction between spreading the wealth and sharing it ( “ collectively , ” no less ) , but finding it would require the analytic skills of Karl the Marxist . ♦

In between lies a raft of household names , many formerly held up as blue chips , including Citigroup C.N ( $ 6.40 ) , Alcoa AA.N ( $ 8.16 ) , Xerox XRX.N ( $ 5.58 ) , Motorola MOT.N ( $ 3.44 ) , Starbucks SBUX.O ( $ 7.97 ) and Yahoo YHOO.O ( $ 9.14 ) , not to mention beleaguered automakers Ford Motor F.N ( $ 1.26 ) and General Motors GM.N ( $ 2.79 ) .
In all , the group makes up the greatest number of sub - $ 10 stocks in the index in at least 28 years , said Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst at Standard & Poor’s .
In fact , Silverblatt said it could be the most in the post - World - War II era , though he cautioned that his data reaches only as far back as 1980 .
“ This is definitely unusual , ” he said .
“ I think you ’d have to go back as far as the 1940s , when $ 10 was worth more to see a similar number , ” he said .
According to S&P data , 101 is almost double the 59 companies with share prices below $ 10 in October 2001 when the dotcom meltdown was in full swing and almost triple the 35 sub - $ 10 stocks in October 1987 .
Ten dollars is more than just a psychological barrier .
Some institutional investors cannot invest in shares below $ 10 and some bond contracts require companies above that level .
Some other gloomy facts : only five S&P 500 companies had share prices of more than $ 100 on Wednesday .
So far this year , the S&P 500 has plunged 45 percent .
It is now worth just over $ 7 trillion , the index ’s lowest collective market value in 11 years .
Twenty - five stocks , or five percent of the index , do n’t make the $ 1 billion mark in market cap , and just 11 exceed the $ 100 billion level .
In fact , a third of the entire index is not even qualified to be in the index -- 186 stocks have market caps under $ 4 billion , the minimum value for consideration for S&P 500 membership .
After a summer filled with horrifying testicular injuries in hockey and baseball , it appears Cleveland Browns tight end Kellen Winslow is also having his own nut trouble and will possibly sit out Monday Night 's game against the New York Giants .
Pro Football
Talk , quoting a league source , says that Winslow was admitted to the Cleveland Clinic " because his balls swelled to the size of grapefruits . "
It was first reported as an " undisclosed illness " and head coach Romeo Crennell seemed to think it was n't too serious , saying " his arms and legs are n't falling off or anything like that . "
Notice there 's no mention of the peach basket , though , which is could be in peril .
Hopefully he just slept on them the wrong way or is having some sort of odd physical reaction to new laundry detergent or something because nobody should have to be put through such torture and humiliation .
We 'll update as soon as there is further clarification ...
Winslow has swollen , um , parts ? [ PFT ]

Hatty has three months to prove the high - visibility vest works A dog barred from a pub for chewing beer mats has been allowed back in - but only if she wears a high - visibility vest .
Nigel McLelland , the landlord of the Jolly Sailor in Prestatyn , Denbighshire , said Hatty , a Lakeland Terrier , must be seen at all times .
He relented on his ban after he found out his regulars were going to start a petition to let her back in .
" I 'm going to lose trade so I let her in , " he said .
Hatty 's owner Jeff Hughes said his pet started chasing and chewing beer mats after the pub 's assistant manager threw one to her .

Advertisement " One night we went in there and it was packed , there had been football on or whatever .
She just went berserk , " said roofer Mr Hughes , 35 , who got Hatty from a rescue centre and takes her to work every day with him .
" Everybody was throwing them ( the mats ) , they were just all over the place .
He ( Mr McLelland ) got a bit annoyed about this and basically put her on the pub watch scheme . "
Hatty was banned last year but Mr McLelland said she can now come back in the pub if she wears a high - visibility vest , which she usually has on when accompanying Mr Hughes to work on building sites .
" I think it 's just so he can see where she is because she disappears and climbs on the tables and gets them ( the mats ) herself , " added Mr Hughes .
He said his dog loved going to the pub after work with him and would " sulk " if he left her in the van or took her home while he went there during her ban .
" A soon as we pull up ( at the pub ) she 's out of the van , " he said .
Hatty has been given her final warning by landlord Nigel McLelland " If the window 's open , as soon as we stop she 's straight out the window to the door .
" She loves it there because everyone plays with her . "
Mr McLelland said Hatty had often been encouraged by his regulars , who would throw her the mats .
" I came down one night and all the regulars were throwing beer mats for her so really speaking , we should n't be blaming Hatty , we should be blaming the regulars , " he said .
" I 'm saving a hell of a lot on beer mats but the regulars need her ( the dog ) to come in and I 'm going to lose trade so I let her in . "
He added : " I think the regulars were going to get a petition so rather than lose trade I 'm going to let her back in . "
Of the vest he said : " I can see her better now if she 's hiding away . "
Mr Hughes 's young daughter Annie said : " She ( Hatty ) likes everyone playing with her with the beer mats and shaking them about and throwing them .
" Nigel let her in because she 's nice and because she had a glow vest .
" She should be allowed to stay because she 's a nice and kind dog . "

Blake Fielder - Civil Out of Jail into Rehab
Trouble ridden singermust be thrilled now that her incarcerated husbandhas been released from the Highpoint Prison in Suffolk , England .
Blake was sentenced to 27 months behind bars for causing bodily harm and perverting the course of justice .
Released this morning , sources are saying that Blake has already entered a drug rehab facility in Surrey .
One would think with all the time spent in prison that he would have his drug problems under control but not so .
There have been numerous reports that he was still using substances while behind bars .
Word is that a deal was struck that enabled him to enter rehab in exchange for early release .
Winehouse has yet to see her husband because she has been dealing with her own health issues which include treatment for an lingering chest infection .
Amy is expected to see Blake by the end of the week .
" ... That 's all somewhat of a bummer considering the whole widget craze generally went out the door circa - 2006 ... "
I have to disagree with this assertion .
I think it 's more correct to say that * useless * widgets went out the door .
Speaking for myself , I can't imagine running my PC without at least a CPU load and temperature meter ; IMHO it 's like driving a car with no speedometer .

American military helicopters have tonight attacked an area along Syria 's border with Iraq , causing casualties , according to reports on Syrian state TV and from witnesses .
The Syrian foreign ministry has tonight summoned the US charge d'affaires in Damascus to protest at the raid , which took place near the Syrian border town of Abu Kamal .
Local residents told the Associated Press by telephone that two helicopters carrying US soldiers raided a farm in Hwijeh village , 10 miles ( 17 km ) inside Syria 's border .
An official Syrian spokesman confirmed eight people were killed in the attack .
Witnesses said five others were wounded ; one of the witnesses said five of the dead were from a single family .
The residents refused to allow their names to be given because they feared they would be harassed by authorities .
The US military in Baghdad had no immediate comment .
The area is near the Iraqi border city of Qaim , which had been a major crossing point for fighters , weapons and money coming into Iraq to fuel the Sunni insurgency .
Syria 's deputy foreign minister had informed the US official of " Syria 's protest and condemnation of this serious attack " , it said .
The Iraqi charge d'affaires had been summoned for the same reason , it said .
A Pentagon spokesman in Washington said he had no immediate information on the reported strike but would check further .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined to comment on reports of the attack , as did the CIA .
Iraqi insurgents seized Qaim in April 2005 , forcing US marines to recapture the town the following month in heavy fighting .
The area became secure only after Sunni tribes in Anbar turned against al - Qaida in late 2006 and joined forces with the Americans .
Mr Obama marked Veterans Day in Chicago US President - elect Barack Obama will introduce rules to restrict the role of lobbyists as he shapes his administration , says a senior official .
Transition chief John Podesta said Mr Obama would introduce " the strictest and most far reaching ethics rules of any transition team in history " .
He promised the " most open and transparent " ever handover of power .
Mr Obama 's defeated Republican rival John McCain , meanwhile , cracked jokes about his defeat on a US talk show .
In his first post - election TV interview , Arizona Senator McCain said that since being trounced by Mr Obama in last week 's election he had been " sleeping like a baby " .
" I sleep two hours , wake up and cry , " he added , repeating a gag he made after losing to George W Bush during the Republican primaries in 2000 .

Advertisement Appearing on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , Mr McCain ruled out another run for the presidency , saying : " I would n't think so , my friend .
It 's been a great experience and we 're going to have another generation of leaders come along . "
He also said his running mate Sarah Palin inspired people and predicted she " would play a big role in the future of this country " .
Both Mr Obama , who takes office on 20 January , and Sen McCain railed against lobbyists during the election campaign , accusing them of peddling favours and influence to sway Capitol Hill lawmakers in a culture of corruption .
At a briefing in Washington , Mr Podesta told reporters Mr Obama had " pledged to change the way Washington works and curb the influence of lobbyists " .
Interest groups have been offering recommendations on cabinet - level appointments to the Obama transition team .
But Mr Podesta gave no indication of when the key posts of treasury secretary and secretary of state would be filled .
' Mixed emotions '
Under the new measures , Mr Obama will not allow lobbyists actively petitioning the federal government to work with the transition , said Mr Podesta .
Clearly , this guy [ Mr Obama ] is going to bring a great sense of family to the White House
George W Bush
The guidelines will also prevent anyone who has acted as a lobbyist over the last 12 months from working on any policy area in the transition in which they had been active .
He added that anyone who works on the transition and then becomes a lobbyist will be barred from approaching the administration for 12 months in the area in which they worked .
New details emerged , meanwhile , in Mr Bush 's first post- election interview , of Monday 's visit by Mr Obama and his wife Michelle to the White House to meet the outgoing president and first lady .
Mr Bush told CNN that after their policy discussion , his successor had wanted to check out the future bedrooms of his two daughters .
" It was interesting to watch him go upstairs , and he wanted to see where his little girls were going to sleep , " Mr Bush said .
Mr Bush also told CNN : " I know I 'll miss certain things about the presidency .
I also know I 'm looking forward to getting home , so I 've got mixed emotions . "
Meanwhile the Associated Press news agency reported First Lady Laura Bush was in the early stages of talks with publishers about penning a memoir on her time in the White House .

Look to the southwest after sunset on Dec. 1 for a close conjunction between three bright solar system objects : the Moon , Venus , and Jupiter .
If you have binoculars , you might even be able to fit all three of them in the field of view .
Between now and then , you can see Jupiter and Venus getting closer together each evening .
The most spectacular celestial sight during these final days of November is reserved for the early evening sky , as Jupiter and Venus , the two brightest planets , draw closer together .
The waxing crescent moon will join the planets on the first evening of December for a striking celestial trio .
One of my astronomy mentors , Dr. Kenneth L. Franklin ( 1923-2007 ) , a former Chairman and Chief Astronomer at New York 's Hayden Planetarium , often made reference to our " dynamic and ever - changing night sky . "
Such an eloquent description certainly fits our current evening sky , as we now have a celestial summit meeting in the making in the western evening twilight .
For the remainder of November , evening skywatchers can watch as each evening Jupiter and Venus slowly converge on each other in the southwestern sky , right after sunset .
The two planets will appear a similar distance apart on both the evenings of Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 .
They will be so close you 'll be able to stretch your arm out and , with your thumb , blot both of them out .
After Dec. 1 , like two celestial ships passing in the night , the planets will slowly separate , but there will still be one more eye - catching sight to see .
For on that very same evening , those who gaze toward the south - southwest sky for up to about two hours after sunset arise will be treated to a spectacular sight as Venus , Jupiter and the crescent moon cluster closely together .
The trio will form a wide isosceles triangle , with Venus at the vertex .
It should prove quite a spectacle for naked eye , binoculars , or camera .
Imagine the astrological significance that the ancients might have ascribed to a celestial summit meeting such as this !
Moreover , for much of Europe , the moon will actually appear to cross in front of Venus resulting in a rare occultation .
Writing of this spectacular celestial configuration in Guy Ottewell 's 2008 Astronomical Calendar , Fred Schaaf calls the sight " stunning , " adding that " they will draw all eyes their way . "
The moment of closest approach for Venus and Jupiter will actually come during the early morning hours of Dec. 1 , unfortunately when this " dynamic duo " is below the horizon for North America .
They 'll be separated by just over 2 - degrees , which correspond to roughly one - half the distance that separates Pollux from Castor , the " Twin Stars " of Gemini ( The width of your fist , held at arm 's length roughly corresponds to 10 - degrees ) .
Generally speaking , at least for the next few years , conjunctions between Venus and Jupiter come in pairs .
The first conjunction takes place in the morning sky , usually followed about 10 months later by another in the evening sky .
Then , two and a half years later , Venus and Jupiter are again in conjunction , again in the morning sky .
On Feb. 1 of this year , Venus and Jupiter were paired - off in the morning sky .
After Dec. 1 , Venus and Jupiter will next get together again in the morning sky on May 11 , 2011 .
And ten months later , in March of 2012 they will again pair off in the evening sky right after sundown .

When I was 20 I caught the Epstein Barr virus which eventually resulted in debilitating chronic fatigue .
At the height of my war with chronic fatigue it was like my life was over .
I slept 17 hours a day and barely left my room during the rest of the time .
It took a long time and a lot off effort and fantastic support for me to finally become well again .
I only tell you this because I want you to know that I have extensive personal experience with the phenomena of fatigue in terms of experimenting and listening to my body .
My practical experience has taught me what makes fatigue worse and what helps overcome fatigue .
Today I ’m going to share with you what I ’ve learned so that you can avoid certain key energy zappers and , I hope , improve the quality of your life .
1. Processed Foods
If you ’re eating processed foods you ’re contributing to the toxicity of your body .
Consider why we have certain physiological detoxification processes maintained by organs such as the liver .
When our physiology was formed there were none of the man-made additives and chemicals in food that our ancestral humans consumed .
Up until about one hundred years ago the liver only had to deal with organic substances .
Today , if you ’re eating processed foods your liver is being overwhelmed by synthetic and organic chemicals it must process .
According to the book Food Allergies and Food Intolerance , if you ’re eating what passes for the average diet and drinking unfiltered tap water you are exposing yourself to at least 200 synthetic chemicals and chemical cocktails every single day .
All the extra work your liver and kidneys are doing requires a lot of energy .
2. Caffeine
If you ’re anything like most people in the western world you consume some form of caffeine .
Caffeine is something we reach for when we feel we need more “ energy ” .
Unfortunately caffeine does NOT give you energy .
What caffeine does do is stimulate your nervous system .
Stimulation is a very different animal to energy .
By using caffeine as a stimulant you ’re actually wearing your body out .
When you consume caffeine your body releases a hormone called Cortisol .
What you should know about Cortisol is that it is a stress hormone .
Think fight or flight .
It is the Cortisol in your blood that keeps you awake and pepped up after consuming caffeine .
Cortisol suppresses white blood cells , natural killer cells , and other features of the body ’s immune system as well as increasing blood pressure .
If you ’re already stressed and you ’re consuming things like caffeine you ’re probably well on your way to adrenal fatigue .
3. Sugar
Here sugar includes refined and processed simple carbohydrates .
That means white bread , white rice , pasta , and so forth .
This sort of food spikes your blood sugar as effectively as sugar itself does .
As always after a big spike in blood sugar levels comes a big crash .
When the body ’s blood sugar level crashes below a healthy equilibrium you feel tired and fatigued .
You ’ll also feel highly unmotivated , become irritated and snap at your loved ones , all because you ate something high in sugar or a highly refined carbohydrate .
For your reference the different names sugar parades under include lactose , sucrose , glucose , maltodextrose , maltose , dextrose , fructose , corn syrup , honey and maple syrup .
We all know ( at least I hope so ! ) that refined sugar is bad for us .
What you may not be aware of is that sugar is actually an anti-nutrient .
What that means is when you consume refined sugar and carbohydrates there are no vitamins and minerals in that food .
So in order to digest and process these things your body is required to draw from its own vitamin and mineral stores .
That is never going to be good for your energy levels , nor your long - term health and wellbeing .
4. Toxic People
We ’ve covered a lot of ground that has focused on the things we consume that are energy zappers .
So I thought we ’d finish with something a little different .
Toxic people are people who are always negative , down on themselves and easily disturbed by any minor event that does n’t go their way .
You know who they are .
They ’re the complainers .
The people who always criticize but never back that up with helpful solutions , the ultimate pessimists .
If you ’re around such people for very long you ’ll start to entrain to their energy level .
You ’ll enter into their headspace and essentially get dragged down , both emotionally and in terms of energy .
To counteract this you will want to limit the amount of time you spend in the company of this type of person .
Sometimes , such as in a work environment , it is impossible to be free of toxic people .
So in that case you will want to guard against spending your valuable energy complaining about these people to others and even to yourself .
Once you leave work make sure you do n’t bring it home with you .
Conclusion
Please give us your thoughts on the energy zappers presented here by leaving a comment .
Also feel free to tell us about other top energy zappers that you have experienced , and what you were able to do about it .

The Doré Bible Gallery
compiled by Felix Just , S.J. , Ph.D .
The Artist :
Gustave Doré was an Alsacian artist who specialized in book illustrations .
Born in Strasbourg , France , on January 6 , 1832 , he began his artistic career in Paris when he was only 15 years old .
His drawings and illustrations were groundbreaking and very popular , although he never won the acclaim of the artistic elite in France .
In his later years , he spent much time in London , where he also opened a very popular gallery .
He died on January 23 , 1883 , at the age of 51 .
Doré is probably most famous for his depictions of numerous scenes from the Bible , but he also produced illustrations for many other books , including Milton , Dante , La Fontaine , Don Quixote , Baron Munchhausen , etc .
[ See below for links to websites with a more detailed biography and some reproductions of his non-biblical illustrations and paintings . ]
The Bible Illustrations :
Doré and the artisans in his studios produced hundreds of different woodcuts illustrating scenes from a wide variety of biblical stories from both the Old Testament ( including the Apocrypha ) and the New Testament .
His biblical illustrations were first published in 1865 in France and reprinted in the late 1860 's in various German , English , and other editions .
These large - folio multi-volume Bibles ( with about 240 illustrations each ) were very heavy and expensive , but smaller editions were soon also published .
Most of the illustrations are identical in the various editions , but some illustrations are not found in certain language editions , and in other cases as slightly different illustration is found for the same biblical passage .
Doré 's illustrations were extremely popular in both Europe and America in the last decades of the nineteenth century .
For example , over 1.5 million people visited the Doré Exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1896 .
Several publishers also printed smaller collections of his biblical illustrations without the complete text of the Bible in so - called " Doré Bible Gallery " editions .
His artistic style greatly influenced some of the early biblical films , especially those of D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille .
In fact , some of the scenes from DeMille 's The Ten Commandments ( 1923 & 1956 ) look remarkably similar to the corresponding biblical illustration by Doré .
This website contains illustrations related both to the Old Testament ( esp. the prophetic books ) and to the New Testament ( esp. the Gospels ) .

A Note to Owners of The Doré Bible Gallery :
One of the most frequent questions people ask me by e-mail is , " Can you tell me how much my book is worth ? "
Since I am a professor of New Testament Studies , not an antique book dealer , I really cannot help you determine the value of your book .
A Doré Bible Gallery could be worth only $ 10 or over $ 100 , depending on the exact edition and the quality of preservation , while a complete Doré Bible could be worth several hundred dollars .
I suggest you search for your book at www.ebay.com, since some copies are auctioned there almost every week .

Electronic New Testament Educational Resoureces
A Wall Street sign is seen on the side of a building as people walk past in New York October 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
PUYO , Ecuador ( Reuters ) - Leftist Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa welcomed Wall Street investment analysts losing jobs in the financial crisis , calling them lazy yuppies who criticized governments without doing research .
“ One of the few good things to come out of this crisis is that we do n’t have to put up with those yuppies of Lehman Brothers , Standard & Poors and JP Morgan , ” the ex-economy minister said on Tuesday .
“ When I was minister , it was unbearable to have a line of those kids asking for an appointment so that I could do their job .
They ’d ask you for your analysis and then present it in a report as if were their own , ” he added as he hosted fellow South American socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
After years of being criticized by Wall St. analysts for avoiding some free - market policies , leftists in Latin America have crowed in recent weeks about the implosion of financial companies in a worldwide crisis that is bleeding jobs .
Lehman Brothers has collapsed , but JP Morgan and credit rating agency S&P remain in business .
Some Wall Street researchers study emerging market economies by monitoring policy moves in detail from afar and sometimes visit countries on fact - finding missions .
But leaders such as Correa and Chavez often complain the reports they produce advising investors where to put their money lack on - the - ground knowledge .
Correa and Chavez said Latin America needed to create its own regional solutions to the crisis rather than follow U.S. - prescribed policies .
“ For years , they said we were about to sink , sink , sink , ” Chavez said , giggling .
“ Now they have sunk . ”
Compare the images of US Army General Ann Dunwoody
Enlarge Image
The Pentagon has become embroiled in a row after the US Army released a photo of a general to the media which was found to have been digitally altered .
General Ann Dunwoody was shown in front of the US flag but it later emerged that this background had been added .
The Associated Press ( AP ) news agency subsequently suspended the use of US Department of Defense photos .
A Department of Defense spokeswoman insisted that the photo had not violated army policy .
Gen Dunwoody , the highest ranking US female military officer , was recently promoted to become a four - star general .
In an original photo of her , she appears to be sitting at a desk with a bookshelf behind her .
For us , there 's a zero - tolerance policy of adding or subtracting actual content from an image
Santiago Lyon
AP
The altered photo , distributed by the army and initially sent by AP to its clients around the world , shows Gen Dunwoody against a background of the stars and stripes .
When the digital alteration was discovered , AP immediately withdrew the photo and began an investigation .
AP says that adjusting photos and other imagery , even for aesthetic reasons , damages the credibility of the information distributed by the military to news organisations and the public .
" For us , there 's a zero - tolerance policy of adding or subtracting actual content from an image , " said Santiago Lyon , AP 's director of photography .
Mr Lyon said AP was developing procedures to protect against further occurrences and , once those steps were in place , it would consider lifting its ban on the use of US Department of Defense photos .
He said AP was also discussing the problem with the military .
Colonel Cathy Abbott , chief of the US Army 's media relations division , said the Dunwoody photo did not violate army policy that prohibited the editing of an image to misrepresent the facts or change the circumstances of an event .
She added that she did not know who had changed the photo or which office had released it .
" We 're not misrepresenting her , " Col Abbott said .
" The image is still clearly Gen Dunwoody . "
Second case
In September , AP banned use of a photo of Darris Dawson , a soldier who was killed in Iraq , in which his face and shoulders appeared to have been digitally altered .
Col Abbott said his unit did not have an official photo of him and wanted one that could be used for a memorial service .
" That photo was released to the public strictly by accident , " she said .
" We apologised for that . "
The Dunwoody incident is the latest example of pictures being apparently doctored before being presented to the world 's media .
In July , Iran was accused of altering an image of a missile test .
Correspondents say it was an apparent attempt to cover up the fact that one of the missiles had misfired .

Two bones and and a driver 's license with Steve Fossett 's name have been found near the site where Fossett 's plane crashed in eastern California , authorities said Thursday .
Adventurer Steve Fossett , shown here in 2006 , disappeared after a solo flight in 2007 .
The bones appear to be human , and DNA testing will determine whether they belong to the adventurer , Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said at a news conference .
But Anderson said he believes " our coroner 's investigation is over and the Fossett family will finally have closure . "
" We talked to the family and advised them that we possibly , most likely , found the remains of J. Stephen Fossett , " Anderson said .
Searchers found " two large bones , " the driver 's license , a pair of shoes and a $ 100 bill on Wednesday , Anderson said .
The discovery site was a little more than a half - mile from where Fossett 's plane wreckage was found on October 1 in a remote area of the Sierra Nevadas at an altitude of 10,000 feet .
Watch how the search yielded ' remains ' »
The site of Wednesday 's discovery also is about a quarter - mile from where a hiker reported finding aviation identification cards with Fossett 's name and $ 1,000 in cash in late September , Anderson said .
Fossett was last seen on the morning of September 3 , 2007 , when he took off from the Flying - M Ranch outside Minden , Nevada .
He was scouting locations for an attempt to break the land speed record in a rocket - propelled car .

Bone fragment from Fossett wreckage to be tested
Animal chew marks were found on the driver 's license and the shoes , Anderson said .
He said the marks indicate that " animals possibly [ moved ] the body . "
Previous DNA tests on what were believed to be bone fragments at and near the crash site showed that the fragments were n't human remains , Anderson said .
Before this week 's discovery , Anderson said , officials could not be certain that Fossett was dead .
" We could not categorically state that Steve Fossett perished in that crash because the only conclusive evidence our department had were those two aviation identification cards and $ 1,000 in cash , " the sheriff said in a written statement .
The National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating the wreck .
Fossett made his money in the financial services industry but became renowned for his daredevil exploits .
Fossett was the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon , in 2002 , and the first to fly a plane around the world solo without refueling three years later .
He also set world records in round - the - world sailing and cross-country skiing .

Apple has canceled plans to open an triple - decker retail store near the Empire State Building in New York City at the request of chief executive Steve Jobs , the New York Post is reporting .
The Cupertino - based company signed a 15 year lease for 21 - 25 West 34th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues back in 2006 for nearly $ 6 million in annualized rent .
Previous reports indicated that Apple would build a two - or three - story retail store in 18,000 square foot space , which sits diagonally across from the Empire State Building .
Renderings published last October showcased a potential design for what would have been Manhattan 's fourth flagship Apple shop — a three - story outlet with glass and steel facade , marked with a large white Apple logo .
However , the New York Post now claims that Apple is looking to sublease the space , which has sat vacant for the past two years , beginning in April .
The paper cited an unnamed source as saying that Jobs looked at a run-down building across the street and said , " This is not for Apple . "
The claims are similar to those published last year by the Forbes / Slatin Real Estate Report , which noted that Mac maker was having second thoughts about the location 's " coolness " and was considering putting the site up for sublease .
Ismael Leyva 's proposed design for an Apple retail store at W. 34th Street .
" Apple had doubts about the compatibility of its leading - edge image with that of middle - America 34th St. , at least as it currently stands , " the report said .
It noted that while retailers like Gap , American Eagle Outfitters and Forever 21 are happily situated along the row , " unfortunately , a lot of the old 34th Street — third - rate tourist merchants and rip - off artists — still remain . "
Remember the days when a fifty basis point cut was big news , something that would be debated by pundits and economists and fuel speculative , anticipatory trading ?
Those days are behind us for as long as the Federal Reserve and the Treasury continue to use their new " tools " to manipulate rescue our banking system and , fingers crossed , our economy .
So let 's relive those days .
What do you think of today 's Fed move ?
Also , congratulations .
52 % of you correctly predicted this move by the Fed in our reader poll .
Tied for second place were a 75 basis point cut and the Fed emailing pdf files of $ 10,000 bills so banks can simply print their own money .
Here 's the Fed 's statement .
It emphasizes the " intensification of financial stability " and the global economic slowdown .
Inflation concerns absolutely crushed .
No dissenters .
For immediate release
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent .
The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly , owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures .
Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months , and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports .
Moreover , the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending , partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit .
In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity , the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability .
Recent policy actions , including today ’s rate reduction , coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks , extraordinary liquidity measures , and official steps to strengthen financial systems , should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth .
Nevertheless , downside risks to growth remain .
The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability .
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were : Ben S. Bernanke , Chairman ; Timothy F. Geithner , Vice Chairman ; Elizabeth A. Duke ; Richard W. Fisher ; Donald L. Kohn ; Randall S. Kroszner ; Sandra Pianalto ; Charles I. Plosser ; Gary H. Stern ; and Kevin M. Warsh .
In a related action , the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50 - basis - point decrease in the discount rate to 1 - 1/ 4 percent .
In taking this action , the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston , New York , Cleveland , and San Francisco .

The Durable Internet : Preserving Network Neutrality without Regulation
[ Press ] Posted Nov 12 , 2008 16:26 UTC ( Wed ) by corbet
Timothy Lee has posted a lengthy paper on the network neutrality debate .
One can guess its conclusions simply by noting that it is hosted at the Cato Institute , but those conclusions are backed up by substantial research and reasoning .
" Yet many deregulationists underestimate the importance of the Internet 's end - to - end architecture and are too cavalier about abandoning the neutral network for a tiered , filtered , more centrally managed one .
The decentralization made possible by the Internet 's open architecture is the key to its astonishing growth , and there is little reason to think that it would be improvement for the Internet 's decentralized ' dumb ' architecture to be replaced by a more centralized ' smart ' one . "
Worth a read for those who are interested in this subject .

Finance troll :
We need to make drastic budget cuts .
The boss : Let 's not get all dramatic .
Just tell me how much to cut and I 'll make it happen .
Dilbert :
On the plus side , , the buzzards seem selective .
NBC executives are closing in on a decision about who will take over “ Meet the Press , ” its venerable Sunday morning political talk show , with the announcement coming possibly on Dec. 7 .
According to network sources , that may be Tom Brokaw ’s last day on the air as interim moderator of the program , a post he assumed after the sudden death of longtime host Tim Russert in June .
People close to the process said that they did not yet know who would be ultimately named to the job , arguably Washington ’s most powerful journalistic perch .
The deliberations have been closely guarded by NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker and NBC News President Steve Capus , who have not yet made a decision , said spokeswoman Allison Gollust .
Barring a last - minute surprise , network insiders and television news observers expect the new moderator -- or moderators -- will be drawn from a short list of candidates that include NBC chief White House correspondent David Gregory , PBS anchor Gwen Ifill , NBC chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell and NBC political director Chuck Todd .
Dark horses include CBS anchor Katie Couric , whose name was floated in internal discussions , according to two sources , but is apparently not interested .

Veteran ABC anchor Ted Koppel has also been mentioned as a contender .
But Koppel , who announced Tuesday that he was leaving his post at Discovery Channel , said he had not spoken with NBC and had little interest in getting into “ a weekly grind again . ”
Network executives have been wrestling with not only who would be best to lead the 61 - year - old show for a coming generation but what format the program should take .
In an interview , Ifill said that she had informal conversations about the job with NBC officials several weeks ago , but no offer has been made .
“ I had the impression that they did n’t know what they wanted the show to be yet , ” she said .
“ I think they were trying to figure out how I would fit .
But I do n’t know if they ’ve figured it out yet .
If they have , they have n’t told me . ”

At stake is not just the program ’s legacy , but its dominance over the Sunday morning competition .
After Brokaw took over , as viewers ’ interest in the election peaked , “ Meet the Press ” increased its lead over ABC ’s “ This Week ” and CBS ’ “ Face the Nation , ” according to Nielsen Media Research .
Since the end of June , the NBC program has averaged more than 4 million viewers , up 27 % from the same period last year , while ABC has drawn just under 3 million viewers , up 22 % , and CBS has attracted 2.8 million , up 19 % .
NBC executives hope the next iteration of “ Meet the Press ” maintains momentum .
In its early days , “ Meet the Press ” had a moderator and a regular panelist who occasionally filled in for the host .
Later , the show came to be defined by a singular moderator -- most recently Russert , the longest serving host , who helmed the show for 17 years until he had a heart attack in the network ’s Washington bureau .
Instead of simply naming a successor to Russert , a larger - than - life figure whose death was keenly felt at NBC , executives are considering the possibility of multiple hosts , including a trio of panelists .

That could help address any shortcoming in gravitas seen in Gregory or Todd , each of whom is still in his 30s .
According to a network source familiar with internal thinking , it appears unlikely that Todd , in particular , would be named solo anchor , despite the high regard for him , because he has not had substantial television experience .
But in some ways , the relative youth of both men is an asset .
“ I think they want a franchise that has some potential for longevity , and that ’s where Chuck and Gregory are good choices , ” said another newsroom employee .
Ifill ’s presence would also help signal a new era at “ Meet the Press . ”
Currently the moderator of “ Washington Week ” on PBS , the anchor would be the first African American moderator of the NBC program , a timely milestone that would coincide with the inauguration of the country ’s first black president .
Ifill worked at NBC for five years covering Washington and was a favorite of Russert , who frequently had her on the program , which she called a “ national treasure . ”

On Tuesday , she said she would be honored to be tapped for the show , “ but if not , I have a job that I ’m happy with . ”

" This is a moment where [ scientists ] are trying to harness electricity for practical purposes , but the general public was kind of skeptical , " said Corey Keller , curator of the Brought to Light exhibit .
" Their experiences with electricity were generally through lighting , which they knew could burn things down and kill you , if you were n't careful .

THE CIRCUMCISION REFERENCE LIBRARY
E P I S P A S M
C i r c u m c i s i o n i n R e v e r s e
R O B E R T G. H A L L
" Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised on the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people ; he has broken my covenant . "
So said God to Abraham , establishing the covenant of circumcision , a covenant " between me and you and your descendents after you " ( Genesis 17:10,14 )
For centuries , Jewish boys have regularly been circumcised when they are eight days old ( Genesis 17:12 ) .
An unusual challenge to circumcision developed , however , in the Hellenistic period ( after about 133 B.C.E * ) .
Hellenistic and Roman societies widely practiced public nakedness .
But they abhorred baring the tip of the penis , called the glans .
To expose the glans was considered vulgarly humorous , indecent or both .
This combination of attitudes could be — and often was — devastating for circumcised Jews .
Enjoying oneself in a Greek gymnasium or Roman bath , where nudity was de rigueur , was a popular and stylish pastime .
Here politics was discussed and business deals concluded .
Athletic contests and exhibitions were also conducted in the nude .
Participation in athletics was often a prerequisite for social advancement .
Yet a circumcised penis effectively precluded this participation .
Consequently , for hundreds of years some Jews underwent a surgical procedure known as epispasm — an operation that " corrected " a circumcised penis .
Some might call it circumcision in reverse .
From references and allusions to the procedure in classical and rabbinical literature , it appears that epispasm [ CIRP Note : επι σ πασμοσ , epispasmos ] reached its peak of popularity in the first century C.E .
The New Testament reveals bitter conflicts over circumcision among the followers of Jesus , conflicts expressed also in attitudes towards epispasm practiced by Jews .
Paul , who thinks circumcision useless , nevertheless forbids epispasm : " Was any one at the time of his call already circumcised ?
Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision , " he advises the Corinthians ( 1 Corinthians 7:18 ) .
Numerous written sources from the second century B.C.E. to the early sixth century C.E. speak about epispasm and attitudes toward it .
During these centuries , foreskins assumed an importance they have rarely had before or since .
The Roman emperor Hadrian ( 117-138 C.E. ) loathed circumcision as much as castration — both were unnatural , an offense against the Greek idea of natural beauty of the human body — and outlawed both .
1
Males who wished to conceal an exposed glans had several options .
Dioscorides , a first century C.E. physician to Nero 's troops and master of herbal lore , helped those who , though not circumcised , had a defectively short foreskin .
He suggested applying thapsia , an herb that causes swelling .
2 this would not work , Dioscorides recognized for those who were circumcised .
Soranus , author of a second - century C.E. medical text , prescribed a different method for correcting defectively short foreskins in infants :
The baby 's nurse should pull the foreskin forward over the glans and tie it with a thread .
" For if gradually stretched and continuously drawn forward , it easily stretches and assumes its normal length an covers the glans and becomes accustomed to keep the natural good shape . "
3
A simple surgical procedure called infibulation , was another option for a defectively short foreskin .
A surgeon would pierce the foreskin to receive a light wooden pin called a fibula .
4
With the fibula inserted the foreskin was held neatly closed .
Infibulation was supposed to improved the voice and health of adolescent boys , but Celsus , the author of a medical text from the first century C.E. , doubts the therapeutic value of infibulation for this purpose .
Infibulation could also be used by those who had been circumcised .
Some circumcised Jews concealed their circumcision by drawing the skin around the penis forward and securing it with a fibula — or with twine .
Martial , the Roman poet , ridiculed an infibulated Jewish slave5 and derided another Jew whose fibula fell out at the bath .
6
The Cadillac of correctives , however , was clearly epispasm : " If the glans is bare and the man wishes for the look of things to have it covered , that can be done , " Celsus assured his readers .
7
It was a variation of an operation recommended for congenitally short foreskins .
For congenitally short foreskins , the surgeon would tie forward the foreskin , Soranus recommended , and cut the sheath of skin around the penis just in front of the pubic bone .
When the wound healed , the surgeon would remove the twine .
Epispasm on a circumcised penis required a somewhat more difficult operation :
The surgeon would cut around the glans freeing the sheath of skin surrounding the shaft of the penis , pull the skin forward and dress the wound carefully so that the skin would reattach to the glans leaving a foreskin .
At a time before effective anesthesia , a man inclined to try this procedure had Celsus ' assurance that it was " not so very painful . "
8
Epiphanus , the fourth century C.E. churchman , tells of a man who was circumcised twice , once as a Samaritan and again as a Jewish proselyte .
In the course of the discussion , Epiphanus mentions a spouthisteros , a special implement for performing epispasm .
He tells up , " If you can make circumcision uncircumcision , do not marvel at some being circumcised twice . "
9
Some Jews probably submitted to epispasm because they shared the common Greek and Roman revulsion toward circumcision .
Even if they did not , however , societal institutions and attitudes exerted strong pressure against remaining circumcised .
Jews of means naturally wanted to participate in gymnasium and bath .
Not only were these a chief means of recreation , they also functioned as hubs for business .
If Jews exercised or bathed while circumcised , they offended their gentile neighbors and submitted themselves to incredulous ridicule ; if they did not attend , everyone knew why — and talked about it .
Either way their business would suffer .
Other factors also encouraged epispasm .
Athletics constituted a chief avenue of social advancement for underclass boys .
Greek cities competed with each other to grant citizenship to promising boys and to sponsor them at the games .
Since athletes exercised and competed without clothes , this avenue was denied to those who were circumcised .
What city would sponsor an obscenity ?
After the Jewish revolt against Rome in 66 - 70 C.E. , punitive measures against Jews were more easily enforced against those who could be identified because they were circumcised .
Suetonius tells of an old man claiming exemption from the most hated of these measures , a two drachma tax to fund the worship of Jupiter .
The court stripped the old man in court , found him to be circumcised and fined him .
10 A Jewish man could escape such oppressive measures and the stigma attached to them by submitting to epispasm .
Obstacles to citizenship in Greek cities like Alexandria also encouraged Jews to undergo epispasm .
11
In Alexandria and perhaps in other cities formed on the Greek model , citizenship and the important privileges that went with it were granted only to ephebes , those trained for citizenship in the ephebaion .
Since local law forbade Jews becoming citizens and since ephebes regularly exercised naked in the gymnasium , a Jew who appeared naked with a circumcised penis was unable to circumvent the law .
Some Jews did evade the law , however ; a Greek delegation from Alexandria complained about this to the emperor .
12
Greek and Roman abhorrence of circumcision produced a variety of predictable reactions among Jews .
Those who stood vigorously against Greek culture asserted the necessity of circumcision in stronger terms than ever .
The Jewish author of Jubilees interpreted Greek culture as the product of the demonic world ; circumcision he tells us , lifts Jews out of the evil realm and places them directly under God 's rule .
13
Other Jews who accepted Greek culture attempted to explain circumcision to the Greeks — and to themselves .
A certain Jew named Artapanos ( third to second centuries B.C.E. ) took a novel approach : Moses founded the religion of Egypt and gave circumcision to Ethiopia .
14 If Egyptians and Ethiopians in following their ancestral practices still keep the teachings of Moses , why should Hebrews not keep them as well ?
The first century C.E. Jewish philosopher Philo defends circumcision in Greek terms by listing physical and allegorical advantages .
Circumcised men are more fertile , less vulnerable to disease and being cleaner , are more fittingly set aside as a nation of priests .
In addition the heart begets the thought , which is the highest human excellence ; therefore penises should be circumcised to resemble the godly heart .
Moreover , circumcision represents the excision of the pleasure of sex , which bewitches the mind .15
Some Jews , faced with overwhelming societal repugnance toward circumcision , probably neglected it .
Many of these Jews ceased to practice Judaism at all and quietly faded into the surrounding culture .
Other neglected circumcision but actively claimed their Jewish heritage .
The evidence for uncircumcised yet practicing Jews is indirect but unequivocal .
For example , Ananius , after successfully convincing Izates , prince of Adiabene , to become a Jew , argued that he should not be circumcised .
16 The Jewish author of the Fourth Sybylline Oracle urged gentiles to repent and immerse themselves in water but found no need to mention circumcision .
Rabbis debated whether circumcision or immersion in water really made a proselyte .
17 Philo tells us that the real proselyte circumcises not his foreskin but his passions .
18 Such statements are readily explained if some authorities were contending that a person could be or become a Jew without being circumcised .
Philo rebuked Jews who allegorize the law to abolish Sabbaths , feasts , the Temple and circumcision .
19 The Jews interpreted the Torah to justify their neglect of circumcision , which suggests that in their own eyes they remained observant Jews .
Both confirming that many Jews neglected circumcision and affirming the rabbinic commitment to it , the Talmud tells us that Jerusalem fell to the Romans and the Temple was destroyed because Jews " broke the covenant by failing to circumcise their sons .
"
20
Some Jews practiced a form of circumcision that did not show .
The reaction can be seen in the Mishnah 's * requirement that valid circumcision must bare the glans .
21
The need for this ruling implies that some Jews practiced a form of circumcision — perhaps by simply nicking the foreskin — in a way that did not bare the glans .
Removing only a little of the foreskin might obviate the need either for infibulation of epispasm .
Jews who circumcised in this manner did not set out to abrogate the covenant of circumcision ; they merely tried to keep the covenant without offending their gentile neighbors by baring the glans .
That epispasm was fairly widespread among Jews also seems evident from 1 Maccabees 1:11 - 15 , where we are told that some built a gymnasium in Jerusalem and " made themselves uncircumcised . "
As might be expected , the rabbinic references to epispasm condemn it ( while at the same time reflecting that it must have been a fairly widespread phenomenon ) .
In Pirkei Avot ** 3.16 , we are told : " The one who voids the covenant of Abraham has no portion in the world to come . "
According to the Talmud , † even Yom Kippur , the Day of Atonement , cannot eliminate the transgression of epispasm .
22
In various midrashim†† several notorious biblical sinners , such as Jehoiakin , 23 Achan24 and Adam , 25 are said to have submitted to epispasm .
As late as the 12th century , The Rambam ( Moses Maimonides ) stated that " anyone who elongates his foreskin [ to conceal his circumcision ] " is denied a share of the world to come .
26
On the other hand , some talmudic rabbis are less harsh .
They consider whether one who has undergone epispasm ( a mashuk ) should be recircumcised when rejoining the rabbinic fold :
" Rabbi Judah says , ` One who has his prepuce drawn forward [ i.e. , who has submitted to epispasm ] should not be recircumcised because it is dangerous . '
They said to him , ` Many were circumcised [ after epispasm ] in the time of Ben Koziba and they had children and did not die . '27
The references to epispasm here date from the second century B.C.E. to early in the sixth century C.E.
As we have seen , however , epispasm was only one reaction to the Greco - Roman abhorrence of circumcision .
Some Jews who rejected Greek culture heightened the religious and social importance of circumcision : Circumcision delivered one from evil .
Others , like Philo , impressed by Greek philosophy , used arguments consonant with Greek presuppositions to support the practice of circumcision .
Still others thought their religious obligation was fulfilled if only a minute part of the foreskin was removed .
Those who interpreted the Torah by Greek methods and sensitivities , argued that the law , when properly understood , did not require literal circumcision .
Such a wide spectrum of views allowed plenty of room for Jewish men to practice epispasm while still living as Jews .
Many of these men never thought they had violated the covenant .
They only wanted to live in both worlds .
They had received circumcision ; the second operation only made their circumcision less conspicuous .
28
Readers of ) will remember how central the debates over circumcision were to the development of early Christianity .****
Since the early church was part of the Jewish community , the Christian debate can be seen as part of the Jewish discussion about circumcision .
Like the Jewish community at large , the church was divided between those who required circumcision and those who did not .
Many Christians despised the arguments of those who in their view sought to gain the approval of their gentile neighbors by neglecting the covenant of Abraham .
If circumcision defines the sphere where God acts on behalf of his people and uncircumcision defines the sphere of demonic control , then Jesus must act among the circumcised ; circumcision is required .
When Paul in Galatians ( 6:15 ) claims that circumcision is irrelevant or when Luke asserts that gentiles entering the people of God need not circumcise themselves ( Acts 15:19 - 29 , they enter a debate that has already solidified .
All the arguments have already been made and answered ; the two sides glower at one another across an unbridgeable gulf .
Merely repeating well - known arguments would hardly convince anyone .
Paul and Luke can persuade only by transcending the former arguments ; they can obtain a hearing only from the party whose arguments they adopt .
Paul enters the fray accepting the arguments of the circumcision party .
Paul agrees that the world has been divided into two spheres , the sphere of the circumcised where God has acted , and the sphere of the uncircumcised " gentile sinners " where demons rule ( cf. Galatians 2:15 ) .
But for Paul the world is where this distinction rightly applies is passing away : " [ Christ ] gave himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God the Father " ( Galatian 1:3 - 4 ) .
Distinctions between circumcised and uncircumcised , proper to the old world , do not apply in the new .
Since in Christ Christians are leaving the old world , circumcision has no relevance for them : " But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world .
For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision , but a new creation " ( Galatians 6;14-15 ) .
Luke also begins by accepting circumcision : he carefully depicts the circumcision of both John the Baptist and Jesus ( Luke 1:59 , 2:21 ) .
But after the resurrection Jesus reveals a new plan of God to a very puzzled group of disciples ( Luke 24:36 - 49 ) , a new plan that includes gentiles ( Luke 24:47 ) .
In Acts , Luke works out the consequences of this plan and chronicles the revelation to the disciples that under the new plan gentiles do not require circumcision ( chapter 15 ) .
By accepting as valid the arguments of the circumcision party , Paul and Luke could hope that their argument would be heard .
By tying their conclusion that circumcision is no longer necessary to the new thing Christ has done , they could hope that the might convince Christians of the circumcision party who , of course , agreed that God had done something new by sending the Messiah .
By denying the necessity of circumcision they could expect to attract gentiles to belief in Jesus .
How well Paul , Luke and others like them succeeded appears from the result : Eventually the Church abandoned circumcision .
The ancestors of modern Judaism did not ; the wide variety of Jewish views on circumcision evidently died with the Hellenistic civilization that gave them birth , and Jews returned to the almost universal practice of the ritual of circumcision .

Strange things are afoot at the Tevatron particle collider at Fermilab , and the aging U.S. particle smasher is getting an unexpected moment in the spotlight while physicists wait for the repairs of the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland .
Researchers say experiments at the Tevatron have produced particles that they are unable to explain using the standard model of physics , and say it ’s possible that they ’ve detected a previously unknown particle .
If the result does turn out to be due to some unexpected new process , it would be the most significant discovery in particle physics for decades [ Physics World ] .
Bloggers and theorists are already lining up explanations that involve unseen particles , hypothetical strings , or modifications of conventional physics .
The finding is so controversial that about one - third of the 600 - person experiment that detected it are refusing to put their names on the 69 - page paper purporting its discovery [ Nature News ] , which was posted in advance of publication on the server arXiv .
The mysterious particles were detected in the course of the Tevatron ’s collisions of protons and anti-protons ; researchers were using the Collider Detector at Fermilab ( CDF ) to study the particles created by those smash - ups .
In certain experiments the CDF detected an excess of particles called muons , and researchers could n’t explain where they came from .
“ It just does n’t add up , ” says Jacobo Konigsberg , … a CDF spokesperson .
Konigsberg says that the collaboration struggled for months to explain away the effect , but in the end felt it was better to publish their data for others to see and debate .
“ It would n’t have been responsible to sit on this for much longer , ” he says [ Nature News ] .
Some researchers think the extra muons indicate that the collisions created an unknown particle , which then decayed into the muons .
Theoretical physicist Neal Weiner says the finding could back up a theory he ’s developed with a colleague on dark matter – the enigmatic stuff thought to make up a large proportion of the universe … .
Their model posits dark matter particles that interact among themselves by exchanging “ force - carrying ” particles with a mass of about 1 gigaelectronvolts [ New Scientist ] .
But these suppositions ( and others involving string theory ) are very preliminary , and researchers say they may still find a perfectly mundane reason for the presence of the mysterious muons .
When the Large Hadron Collider gets back up and running in 2009 , researchers hope it will work on solving the puzzle .

A longer excerpt from the book is available on Hen and Harvest .
A Nation of Farmers is being published by New Society Publishers , and is expected to appear in the Spring of 2009 .
The excerpt begins below the fold .
Today is World Food Day .
To celebrate the day , we are publishing an excerpt from Aaron Newton 's and Sharon Astyk 's forthcoming book , A Nation of Farmers .
We are publishing two sections from this book :
Industrial Agriculture : Stealing from the Future
Whenever people say , “ We must n’t be sentimental , ” you can take it they are about to do something cruel .
And if they add , “ We must be realistic , ” they mean they are going to make money out of it .
— Brigid Brophy
The price of industrial agriculture is uncalculated quantities of food that future generations will not have to eat .
How is this so ?
Well , for example , though cities grew up in good spots for trade , they also by necessity grew in areas surrounded by fertile , productive agricultural land that could support large populations .
The displacement of large populations of agrarian people into cities has meant that all over the world , more and more land is transformed into city and suburb , paved over and no longer producing .
As the ability of soils to hold water decreases because of erosion and climate change , arable land becomes desert .
As soils are depleted of nutrients and the price of natural - gas - based nitrogen fertilizers rises , untold people will find the cost of growing their own food in their depleted environment prohibitive .
We are seeing this already .
As artificial fertilizers produce nitrous oxide and feedlot meat production warms the planet with methane , millions risk losing the sources of water that allow them to grow food .
As we deplete aquifers by growing inappropriate crops in regions that cannot sustain them over the long term , we risk future hunger .
That said , however , we should not underestimate the resilience and power of local , indigenous , sustainable agriculture .
For example , in Bringing the Food Economy Home , Helena Norberg - Hodge , Todd Merrifield and Steven Gorelick cite several World Bank and FAO papers that indicate that as recently as the mid-1990s , 2 billion people — 35 percent of the world ’s population — were being fed by traditional agriculture with minimal or no fossil fuel inputs .
1
Often these farmers do so on marginal land , because the best agricultural land in the Global South has been turned to non-food or luxury food items .
Shrimp farms displace rice farms in coastal India ; coffee displaces small polyculture farms or food providing forests in Latin America and Africa ; flowers displace food in much of Latin America and Asia ; cotton to feed our endless appetite for cheap clothing displaces food in many nations .
It will be a non-trivial problem to return this land to sustainable food production , but it is possible .
These statistics , along with the others here should at least raise some significant questions in those who believe we know what the earth ’s proper carrying capacity is .
That does not make the issue of population irrelevant , but it does mean we may have time and choices that we did not know we had .
And if 2 billion people can feed themselves on the poorest available land organically and with minimal inputs , how many could do it if sustainable agriculture received the same supports commercial agriculture now does ?
Vandana Shiva describes ( and we will quote this at some length , because it is very important ) what the Green Revolution has done in the third world , but it is important to remember that the loss of calories that occurred there also happened to us .
For us , the cost came in the form of our loss of nutrition .
That is , though we had more calories than we needed , we replaced nutritious foods with non-nutritious ones , to our detriment .
For the poor of the world , it came as a significant loss of food value , as well as nutrition .
Industrial agriculture has not produced more food .
It has destroyed diverse sources of food , and it has stolen food from other species to bring larger quantities of specific commodities to the market , using huge quantities of fossil fuels and water and toxic chemicals in the process .
It is often said that the so - called miracle varieties of the Green Revolution in modern industrial agriculture prevented famine because they had higher yields .
However , these higher yields disappear in the context of total yields of crops on farms .
Green Revolution varieties produced more grain by diverting production away from straw .
This “ partitioning ” was achieved through dwarfing the plants , which also enabled them to withstand high doses of chemical fertilizer .
However , less straw means less fodder for cattle and less organic matter for the soil to feed the millions of soil organisms that make and rejuvenate soil .
The higher yields of wheat or maize were thus achieved by stealing food from farm animals and soil organisms .
Since cattle and earthworms are our partners in food production , stealing food from them makes it impossible to maintain food production over time , and means that the partial yield increases were not sustainable .
The increase of yields in wheat and maize under industrial agriculture were also achieved at the cost of yields of other foods a small farm provides .
Beans , legumes , fruits and vegetables all disappeared both from farms and from the calculus of yields .
More grain from two or three commodities arrived on national and international markets , but less food was eaten by farm families in the Third World .
The gain in “ yields ” of industrially produced crops is thus based on a theft of food from other species and the rural poor in the Third World .
That is why , as more grain is produced and traded globally , more people go hungry in the Third World .
Global Markets record more commodities for trading because food has been stolen from nature and the poor .
2
This may be the most important point we can make — drawing down future food , and starving our children and grandchildren should not be an option in an agricultural system .
High yields for us now and hunger for them later is not a viable choice in a growing world — period .
There is , in truth , no way to be certain what we gained and what we lost in the Green Revolution .
What is virtually certain is that its gains were overstated , and that allocation of resources , whether from future generations or from poor to rich were inequitable .
When someone makes the statement that grain yields rose by so much , that looks impressive .
But the practical realities of that are very different .
We have to ask whether those yield increases actually made it from field to the mouths of the hungry , and whether it was possible to duplicate them through any other method .
Organic Agriculture Can Feed the World Better
It ’s really very simple , Governor .
When people are hungry they die .
So spare me your politics and tell me what you need and how you ’re going to get it to these people .
— Bob Geldof
To discover whether we can feed the world , first we need to ask whether increased yields have actually meant more available food and nutrition .
In fact , this question has been answered — even the World Bank admitted in 1986 that more food does not mean less hunger .
Access to food is the primary issue — if it were not , the US would have no hungry people instead of 35 million food - insecure people .
Food access is the most important issue in feeding the world , as economist Amartya Sen , among other people , has discussed at length .
In Donald Freebairn ’s analysis of more than 300 research reports on Green Revolution results , he found that 80 percent of them showed that inequity increased with the adoption of Green Revolution techniques .
3
If the Green Revolution had responded to real material shortages of food worldwide , the environmental costs might be worth it .
But it did not .
As Freebairn documents , the food supply was sufficient to feed the world ’s population in 1950 , just as it is now .
Claims that Norman Borlaug and the Green Revolution saved “ a billion lives ” are almost certainly wildly overstated — there was sufficient food to go around before the Green Revolution , had equitable distribution been in place , just as there is now .
In fact some analysts have suggested , whether rightly or wrongly , that population growth itself is a product of that growth .
( That last is a subject we ’ll return to shortly . )
And , as we ’ve noted , industrial agriculture actually undermines our ability to continue to feed the world , by contaminating soil , increasing global warming , depleting water stocks and promoting erosion .
Dissecting figures about hunger in World Hunger : 12 Myths , Lappé , Collins , et al. note that though figures at first seem to suggest that the Green Revolution made real gains in hunger reduction because total food available between 1970 and 1990 rose by 11 percent and the estimated number of hungry people fell from 942 million to 786 million , this is not really true .
If you take China out of this discussion , the figures look very different .
Removing China from the equation , the number of hungry people in the developing world rose from 536 to 597 million .
And ,
In South America , while food supplies rose almost 8 percent , the number of hungry people also went up , by 19 percent . …
In South Asia there was 9 percent more food per person by 1990 , but there were also 9 percent more hungry people .
The remarkable difference in China , where the number of hungry dropped from 406 million to 189 million almost begs the question : which has been more effective at reducing hunger , the Green Revolution or the Chinese Revolution ?
4
This suggests that first of all , though absolute food availability is relevant , it is not as relevant as distribution and economic justice .
And because China was a comparatively late adopter of Green Revolution seeds and techniques , it also suggests that the Green Revolution itself may be less important than improved agricultural techniques that apply just as much to organic agriculture as to chemical agriculture .
It is commonplace to assume that organic agriculture yields less than conventional agriculture and that we would have to endure enormous losses in yield were we to give up chemical inputs .
The yield increases of the Green Revolution are commonly articulated in isolation , without discussion of comparisons with organic yields .
To determine how important the Green Revolution was , then , we need to go through the outputs of the Green Revolution and ask whether increased agricultural yields depend upon Green Revolution techniques .
If , for example , agricultural yields depended on mechanization , we would expect mechanized agriculture to consistently out - yield hand labor .
If they depend upon chemical inputs , we would expect organic agriculture to be heavily out - yielded by conventional industrial agriculture .
And if they depend on plant breeding , we would expect older varieties to be out - yielded by newer ones .
Are these things true ?
Well , not in absolute terms .
That is , small farms , which generally speaking use much less mechanization , fewer inputs and are more likely to use older plant varieties and save seed than large ones , actually are more productive per acre in total output than large farms .
At the extreme ends of this , we can see this disparity in Ecology Action ’s biointensive gardening methods , which offer yields per acre much , much higher than industrial agriculture can achieve — without fossil fuel inputs , using open - pollinated seeds .
But on a larger scale this is true as well .
In Deep Economy , Bill McKibben argues that the 2002 Agricultural Census confirms this greater productivity of small farms using more hand labor — small farms produce more food per acre by every measure , whether calories , tons or dollars .
5
What mechanization does do is reduce the amount of human labor required .
However , in a world with 6.6 billion humans and growing , human labor is a widely available resource .
It is also true that organic agriculture as a whole can consistently match yields with conventional agriculture , suggesting that we do not depend on artificial fertilizers or pesticides .
In a 2007 paper , “ Organic Agriculture and the Global Food Supply , ” the authors demonstrated that organic methods would offer a substantial net increase in yields in the Global South , while continuing comparable yields in the Global North .
In a world - wide organic only policy “ farms could produce between 2,641 and 4,381 calories per person per day compared to the current world equivalent of 2,786 calories per person per day . ”
In other studies , agronomist Jules Pretty studied 200 sustainable agricultural projects in 52 countries and observed that , per hectare , sustainable practices led to a 93 percent average increase in food production .
Grain yields , as discussed in his volume Agri-Culture , had average yield increase of 73 percent over studies including 4.5 million farmers .
6
The Rodale Institute has been running test plots of conventionally farmed corn and soybean rotations ( the practice of most Midwestern farms ) against organically grown plots , where soil is maintained wholly by cover crops , and another where a fodder crop is grown and fed to cows whose manures are returned to the soil .
The difference in total yields between the three plots is less than 1 percent .
And during drought years , the organic plots dramatically out - yielded conventional ones because of higher organic matter in the soil .
The cover - crop - fed plots produced twice as many soybeans as the conventionally farmed ones .
7
As we go into increasingly difficult times , one of the great strengths of organic agriculture is its resilience in the face of less - than - optimal conditions ; when fertilizer prices spike , in drought or flooding years , organics can continue to produce successfully .
In times of stress , organic agriculture tends to out - yield conventional — and what is coming is many more stressful years .
8
Even the much touted problem of lowered yields as fields stripped by conventional agriculture are converted to organics can be overcome , as a German study found .
Making the first crop a nitrogen - fixing legume can prevent an initial drop in yield .9
Moreover , most of those assuming that industrial agriculture must " feed the world " are assuming that a few grain exporting nations — the US , Canada , Brazil — must feed the poor world .
But yields could be doubled in poor nations .
Not with commercial fertilizers , already out of the reach of many poor farmers , but organic cover crops , composting and new techniques could have dramatic results in enabling poorer nations to feed themselves and also in creating an agriculture of richer soil , higher in humus , that can withstand difficult weather .
For example , in Benin in the 1990s , the government experimented with subsidizing seed for cover cropping , and found that eroding soils could be repaired with a comparatively small investment in velvet beans , which also reduced weeding .
Maize production tripled , without the importation of expensive commercial fertilizers .10
So although , seen in isolation , the Green Revolution did increase yield of grain , organic and sustainable agriculture have kept pace and in some cases exceeded the results of Green Revolution techniques .
We need not depend on chemical agriculture , mechanization or any other fossil ( or eventually renewable ) fueled technology to feed ourselves .

Martha Stewart Loves Rappers
Some may think it 's odd that talk show hosttakes a fond liking to rappers .
andare some of her favorites .
When Martha was released from the clink back in 2005 , her very first guest on the relaunch of her show was none other than P Diddy .
Last week Snoop Dogg was on , showing Martha how to make his secret ' cognac potatoes ' .
We have the video below - check it out .
Martha did n't get to the top of the money train because she 's stupid .... she knows what sells and has the guest list to prove it .
People love to see Martha interacting with her polar opposites .
Her uptight personality has been a great source of comedic interaction with some very hip guests .
Personally , we like to think that it is because they all have criminal pasts and the common attraction is to hang with your own kind .
Haha !
We do n't really believe that but could n't help but throw it out there .
Check out Martha and Snoop below .

Everyone complains that young people do n’t vote , but consider the experience of students at Kenyon College in Ohio in the 2004 election .
Officials in Knox County , Ohio , provided just two voting machines for the school ’s 1,300 voters .
Some students waited in line for 10 hours , and the last bleary - eyed voter did not cast a ballot until nearly 4 a.m .
That same day in Columbus , voters in black neighborhoods waited as long as four hours , often in the rain .
Many voters there and in other urban areas  including Toledo and Youngstown  left their overcrowded polling places in disgust , or because they could not wait any longer , without casting a ballot .
In many of Ohio ’s white - majority suburbs , the lines were far shorter .
Troubles in Ohio drew the greatest attention in 2004 , but that state was hardly alone .
There were complaints of long lines in other states , including Colorado , Michigan and Florida , where elderly voters endured waits in blistering heat .
I was in Ohio on Election Day 2004 .
The night before the voting , rumors spread that there would be a major effort by Republican operatives to challenge the registrations of voters in majority - black precincts .
Those large - scale challenges did not materialize .
But tens of thousands of votes were suppressed by something so mundane that no one thought to focus on it : long lines .
When people think of some of the earliest mosques in the world , they think of places like Mecca , Medina , Damascus , and Jerusalem .
One place most people do n’t think of is Xi’an ( Chang’an ) .
This port city in the province of Shaanxi , is home to China ’s oldest mosque , the 1,300 year - old Huaisheng Mosque .
The mosque was given the name Huaisheng , meaning “ remember the sage ” , in remembrance of the Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) .
It was allegedly built and named by his maternal uncle Sa’ad ibn Abi Waqqas ( Wan Gesi ) .
Hadhrat Uthman ibn Affan ( ra ) is reported to have sent the envoy in 650 A.D. to invite the Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty to join Islam .
The Emperor declined the invitation , but respected Islamic teachings , and believed it to be compatible with his Confucian life philosophy .
He even granted permission for the Muslim envoy to build a mosque in the city .
The Huaisheng Mosque became the first in China , and made Xi’an an important settlement for the Arab ( Ta’ Shi ) a nd Persian ( Po’ Shi ) merchants who travelled there along the Silk Road .
The buildup of the settlement populations , and the mixing with the ethnic Turks and Chinese created an integrated populace that now forms the base of the Hui ethnic group .
The mosque has undergone a few rebuilds over its history , notably in 1350 , when it was entirely rebuilt under the orders of Zhizheng ( 1341 - 1368 ) , the last Emporer of the Yuan Dynasty .
It was again rebuilt in 1695 under the orders of Emperor Kangzi , of the Qing dynasty , after being destroyed in a fire .
Most recently , in 1935 , the prayer hall underwent reconstruction , when the halls floor was converted from a dirt floor to concrete .
During the reconstruction in 1350 , an inscription was added to the mosque baring the following , “ beneath white clouds and where the mountain turns , there stands a brilliant stone pagoda in the style of the Western Regions .
Handed down by Emperor Gaozu of the Tang dynasty to the present , its style is unknown in the Central Region ” .
It suggests a minaret was built at the site of the mosque , in the style of a pagoda , sometime between 650 and 700 .
The minaret stood at 36 feet tall , and instantly became the earliest free - standing minaret in China .
It also was the tallest structure in Xi’an for centuries , and became the main architectural landmark for the city .
While the minaret , with it ’s balcony atop , served mainly as the location for the azhan ( call to prayer ) , over time , it began to serve a dual role as a lighthouse .
The light from the balcony helped to guide the boats on the Zhujiang River at night .
It is said that ships sailing along this segment of the river considered the tower as the sign that they had arrived at the beginning of the " maritime silk road " .
Sailors often climbed up top the minaret to observe the weather conditions .
While this fact may seem insignificant unto itself , consider that the first western - style lighthouse in China was not built until sometime between 1864 and 1865 at the Guia Fortress .
This secondary function became so popular with the people ; the mosque took on the name , Lighthouse Mosque .
The mosque constitutes an area of 30002 m ( 322922 ft ) , and true to feng shui architectural design , is built along a north - south axis , with the red - bricked gate entrance at the south end , facing the Zhujiang River .
The entrance is a U - shaped corridor enclosing a courtyard with a large Bangke tower to the north , followed by the prayer hall .
The gateway tower bears an inscriptive plaque in Mandarin that reads : " Religion that holds in great esteem the teachings brought from the Western Region . "
Huaisheng mosque features six important buildings , the Imam Hall , the Wangyue Attic , the Covered Corridor , the Storehouse of Islamic Scripture , the Stone Steles Pavilion and the Minaret .
It is also recognized as one of the four most well - known mosques in China , the other three being Yangzhou Crane Mosque , Quanzhou Kylin Mosque and Hangzhou Phoenix Mosque .
Huaisheng Mosque still plays a very important role in Muslim life in Shaanxi , welcoming Muslims from all over the world , including many of the businessmen who attend the Chinese Export Commodities Fair - Canton Fair , to worship .
Today , it stands as an icon of Islam in a country generally not recognized for its Muslim population .
Huaisheng stands tall among the 30,000 + mosques , and thousands of halal restaurants and grocery shops that now litter the streets of China .

Questions are being asked in Orange Country , Florida after a Sheriff 's Deputy apparently confiscated a man 's Xbox 360 in lieu of a speeding fine .
I Am Not A Lawyer , and my knowledge of Florida traffic law is pretty minimal , but is n't this a bit ... unorthodox ?
Orange County deputies seized Kenyatta Hillman 's Xbox and 8 games after stopping him for speeding and allegedly smelling marijuana in his car .
Although a serial number check did not reveal the Xbox as being stolen , a deputy took the console anyway , telling Hillman that he wanted to make sure that nobody stole it ( ! )
When Hillman tried to claim his console back , the sheriff 's office were unable to locate either the Xbox or the games .
A spokesman later confirmed that the console would be returned ' On Friday ' .
After they finish Left 4 Dead , presumably .

Possible ?
I do n’t know , but the collapse of oil prices should give us a shot .
But let ’s use our leverage smartly and not exaggerate Iran ’s strength .
Just as I believe that we should drop the reward for the capture of Osama bin Laden  from $ 50 million to one penny , plus an autographed picture of Dick Cheney  we need to deflate the Iranian mullahs as well .
Let them chase us .
Karim Sadjadpour , an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , compares it to bargaining for a Persian carpet in Tehran .
“ When you go inside the carpet shop , the first thing you are supposed to do is feign disinterest , ” he explains .
“ The last thing you want to suggest is ‘ We are not leaving without that carpet . ’
‘ Well , ’ the dealer will say , ‘ if you feel so strongly about it ...’ ”
The other lesson from the carpet bazaar , says Sadjadpour , “ is that there is never a price tag on any carpet .
The dealer is not looking for a fixed price , but the highest price he can get  and the Iran price is constantly fluctuating depending on the price of oil . ”
Let ’s now use that to our advantage .
Barack Hussein Obama would present another challenge for Iran ’s mullahs .
Their whole rationale for being is that they are resisting a hegemonic American power that wants to keep everyone down .
Suddenly , next week , Iranians may look up and see that the country their leaders call “ The Great Satan ” has just elected “ a guy whose middle name is the central figure in Shiite Islam  Hussein  and whose last name  Obama  when transliterated into Farsi , means ‘ He is with us , ’ ” said Sadjadpour .
Iran is ripe for deflating .
Its power was inflated by the price of oil and the popularity of its leader , who was cheered simply because he was willing to poke America with a stick .
But as a real nation - building enterprise , the Islamic Revolution in Iran has been an abject failure .
“ When you ask young Arabs which leaders in the region they most admire , ” said Sadjadpour , they will usually answer the leaders of Hamas , Hezbollah and Iran .
“ When you ask them where in the Middle East would you most like to live , ” he added , “ the answer is usually socially open places like Dubai or Beirut .
The Islamic Republic of Iran is never in the top 10 . ”

Jobs report smacks the Street … way worse than expected , unemployment at 14 - year high
So why is the market rallying ?
Fed reveals another peak at its balance sheet … can you say , “ $ 2 trillion ” ?
Byron King with a probable Obama energy policy … and how it will likely fail
Ed Bugos with 5 reasons why gold should be outperforming , but is n’t
The American economy lost 240,000 jobs last month .
6.5 % of the American work force is now unemployed , a 14 - year high , says the government this morning .
61 % of grown adults are working , the lowest level in 15 years .
Interestingly , adult men with jobs is at its lowest level since the BLS started keeping track in 1948 .
For the whole year , we ’ve lost over 1.18 million American jobs .
If all those people were to create a city of their own , a new age Hooverville , it ’d be the 10th biggest city in the U.S .
And we add , as always , these are government numbers …
“ September ’s employment report — the last before the election , ” comments John Williams , “ showed a less - severe - than - expected drop in employment and an unchanged unemployment rate .
Now with October ’s reporting ( the first since the election ) , September ’s payroll data underwent extreme negative revisions , and October showed a much - larger - than - expected surge in unemployment .
“ History would suggest this pattern is more a function of catch - up following political manipulation of the data than it is of normal variation in monthly reporting .
Also , as suggested by the ongoing seasonal bias , misreporting of the data continues . ”
For their part , quants on the Street expected 200,000 lost jobs … and 6.3 % unemployment .
Even so , the market took the news in stride this morning .
The Dow opened up 115 points , just about 100 points lower than it was heading before the BLS report .
Mr. Market must have purged most of the employment grief yesterday .
Most indexes fell 5 % .
Factor in Wednesday ’s post-election rout and you ’ve just lived through worst two - day stretch since Black Monday 1987 .
The S&P 500 has fallen over 10 % since Wednesday morning .
Like a transvestite dressed up as Marilyn Monroe for Halloween skipping over an exhaust outlet on the sidewalk , the Fed gave us another sneak peak at its balance sheet this morning .
Can you say , $ 2,000,000,000,000.00 ?
Ben Bernanke ’s balance sheet expanded to a record $ 2 trillion this week — $ 2.058 trillion , if those billions even matter any more .
That ’s more than twice its size at this time last year .
The Fed ’s loan portfolio is so bloated , we hardly know where to begin : Average DAILY bank borrowing from the Fed exceeded $ 359 billion last week … the Fed ’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility has nearly doubled , and now holds $ 243 billion in “ no one else will buy it ” cooperate debt … primary dealers and brokers are running a $ 71 billion tab … AIG still owes $ 81 billion … it just keeps going and going .
Over a third of the balance sheet is made up of some sort of bank loan or toxic asset .
Who ’s paying for it ?
The U.S. Treasury has set up a supplementary funding account with the Fed , which is fueled by T - bill sales .
That fund now exceeds $ 558 billion .
" I would not be surprised ” said Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher , “ to see [ the Fed ’s balance sheet ] aggregate to $ 3 trillion … by the time we get to the new year . "
That would be by January … or another trillion bucks in the next two months .
Finance industry employees — the ones that still have jobs — can expect significantly lower bonuses this year , says a study by the consulting firm Johnson Associates .
Bonuses are expected to drop 20 - 35 % across the industry .
Executives are expected to get hit the hardest , with 70 % average declines .
The firm suggested that 2009 might be even worse , as the combination of a slow economy and increased banking regulation might squeeze financial revenues even tighter .
The dollar rallied yesterday as stocks sold off , but gave back most of its gains after this morning ’s jobs report .
The dollar index is now hovering around its weekly average of 85.3 .
Most of the world ’s currencies are at yesterday ’s levels .
Oil , on the other hand , got shelled yesterday .
The price of the front - month contract dipped as low as $ 59 , its first trip below $ 60 since March 2007 .
With all the signs of severe consumer retrenchment surfacing this week , the “ demand destruction ” argument is back in the limelight .
We saw reports from the IMF and Deutsche Bank both lowering their demand forecasts for 2009 .
Plus , yesterday ’s bout of dollar strength only seemed to make matters worse .
Oil has since rebounded a bit , but barely .
It goes for $ 62 a barrel as we write .
The national average for a gallon of gas reached $ 2.31 overnight , marking the 50th straight daily decline .
Gas is down a remarkable 44 % from its July 17 high and at its lowest level since February 2006 .
Jet fuel prices have fallen quite a bit too .
In fact , they are even cheaper than they were this time last year , by about 22 % .
Heh … but we ’re yet to see a single airline take back any of the industry ’s recently added surcharges .
In fact , Delta added a “ first bag fee ” of $ 15 Wednesday .
“ The new Obama administration will probably focus on controlling carbon emissions , ” says Byron King , just back from his energy and resource scouting adventure in South Africa .
“ That was part of the campaign .
That , plus the fact that there are many serious carbon controllers in the U.S. Congress .
“ Carbon control is the whole basis for confronting the global warming issue .
It ’s a growing trend within the developed world — although certainly not within the developing world .
This is a critical distinction .
Just remember that in our world when you control carbon , you also control people .
Ultimately , carbon control is people control .
By controlling carbon , you control behavior in a way that George Orwell ’s Big Brother never imagined ( or maybe he did ) .
“ When you control carbon , you are constraining life and mobility to a so - called ‘ renewable ’ level of technology .
Yet renewable energy technology is neither fully developed , nor built out to supply more than 3 % ( at most ) of current world energy demand .
A world of carbon control is a world that will limit your options in many respects — maybe in every respect .
It ’s certainly not all sunshine ( literally ) and happiness .
“ Let ’s put it in perspective .
If the next U.S. administration controls too much carbon — with carbon taxes , cap - and - trade regulations , sequestration efforts and the like — the U.S. economy could soon suffer the same kinds of brownouts and blackouts that I experienced in South Africa .
“ Sure , we can build a lot of windmills and solar installations .
More geothermal would be great , too .
But the U.S. and world industrial base is limited in what it can turn out , and at what rates .
There are constraints in manufacturing , in materials , in systems integration , in the grid , in the labor force and in the regulatory system .
And we are going to overcome this in 10 years ?
By comparison , putting Neil Armstrong on the moon in the 1960s was a piece of cake .
“ So will the U.S. — let alone the world — abandon carbon sources of energy in the next 10 years ?
You just gotta be kidding me .
That ai n’t going to happen .
If it does happen , your world will turn upside - down .
Count on it . ”

Gold fell hand in hand with oil yesterday , plummeting $ 30 , to $ 730 an ounce .
The spot price has stabilized since , to around $ 740 as we write .
“ I do n’t think the bull market in gold is over , ” insists Ed Bugos , “ and history says that as it matures , it increasingly outperforms other asset classes and commodities . ”
Ed sent along another of his lists arguing on behalf of gold investors … this time on why gold is still performing below expectations .
Without further ado :
1 . I think the markets are too bullish on the deflation hype and fail to appreciate the extent to which central bankers can determine that outcome , or how the Fed ’s policy itself has changed in the past two months .
2 . The amount of liquidity central banks are injecting is unprecedented .
3 . Neither the politicians nor the public seem willing to stop the printing presses now or anytime in the near future .
4 . The dollar is teetering on the edge of disaster that the current rally continues to obscure .
5 . It ’s hard to rationalize buying any asset , even in this environment , given the amount of damage to the economy at present and in future from the new regulatory climate .
Even the pope is tightening up his belt , says a recent Bloomberg report .
The Vatican is now requiring its staff to clock in for work .
The Vatican abandoned the punch clock 50 years ago , but his holiness ’ servants have n’t been working full days and reintroducing the clock will reduce costs .
Even the world ’s smallest state ca n’t survive on faith alone .
“ ‘ We ca n’t afford any waste , ’ Bishop Renato Boccardo , secretary of the Governatorate of Vatican City State , told La Stampa newspaper .
‘ There is a lot of work that needs doing , and the financial situation does n’t allow us to hire more staff . ’ ”

“ I believe your RNC leanings are showing , ” writes a reader .
“ Your chart of post - Election Day results makes it appear that the greatest losses occurred under the Democrats , when exactly the opposite is true .
“ The stock market and the standard of living have all increased far more under Democrats than Republications .
1932 is a good example .
FDR ’s election happened as the country was slipping into the Great Depression , thanks to Mr. Hoover .
Within a year , that bottomed and the stock market along with the standard of living both began to improve , and did so throughout the FDR administrations .
“ As a matter of fact , the greatest increase in the standard of living in the United States continued to rise from the 1930s throughout a period of Democratic domination .
That tremendous increase basically ended with the election of Ronald Reagan .
Those are the facts . ”
The 5 : Hey , Einstein , the chart compared the biggest one - day losses in the stock market for the day after the election versus historic one - day gains .
Two of the historic gains were following election of Democrats .
The chart does n’t say anything about “ standard of living . ”
On Wednesday , we ran a chart showing the economy growing by an average 1 % faster under Democratic administrations … does that reveal our DNC leanings too ?
If you ’re going to jump to conclusions , you might want to actually read the letter first .
“ Your comments about the future of robotics , ” writes another , “ leaves out the unintended - consequence elephant in the room … the end of employment opportunities for low - skilled workers .
“ I ’ve long expected fast - food restaurants to become automated , and it amazes me that they are still so labor - intensive .
But if you ’re right ( and I suspect you are , though you may be optimistic about the timing ) , not just restaurant work , but pretty much every job that immigrants and unskilled Americans perform will be gone , along with a lot of repetitive skilled work .
“ They wo n’t all end up as robot installers .
What do you think will happen to them ?
I do n’t have any idea , but I suspect it wo n’t be pretty . ”

The 5 Min. Forecast
P.S. Hmmmn … at times , it seems like the gods are arrayed against our getting the film out to the general public .
We got this e-mail this morning :
“ Hi . We just got back from seeing the movie in Concord .
Really liked how it has turned out .
Ca n’t say the choice of theaters was great , however .
I know you have nothing to do with this , but thought you might like to hear about it .
“ To start with , the I.O.U.S.A .
Web site said Merrimack Cinema 1 - 6 in Concord .
The place it was shown at is called Concord Entertainment .
So the newspaper ad touted Merrimack 1 - 6 , which nobody would be able to find — and then no one would think to look at the Concord Entertainment shows , etc. , because you would n’t know that that was where the movie was showing .
And if you did figure it out , the times listed were n’t the actual times or were subject to change at the whim of the management .
“ We went to the 4:45 show , but were told that it really would n’t be shown until 7:20 .
When the attendant said that he had heard it was a good documentary , but it had n’t done well at that theater , it was no wonder .
Only a mother intent on seeing her son ’s movie would persevere enough to wait three hours to see the film .
Especially as the theater looked like it would be ready for the wrecking ball at any time .
The sign by the street that announced which movies were playing was only half lit up and you could n’t even see the letters I.O.U.S.A. , as they were in the shadows .
The parking lot was n’t lit , so the place looked closed , and there were n’t but a few cars in the parking lot .
I ’d say that none of the movies shown there did well , at least not on this rainy Thursday afternoon / evening . ”
Thanks for trying , Mom .
P.P.S. Also , after hitting No. 1 on Amazon Election Eve , we ’ve been informed that many of the orders for the book are sitting in a queue waiting to be processed .
We ’re working with the staff at Amazon diligently … but uh , if the orders do n’t get processed , the books are not getting shipped .
Hmnn …
You can still order your copy of the book or DVD here .
After our systems blew earlier this week , we ’ve repaired them and everything appears to be working fine .
Oy .
Sean Penn Gives Madonna a Shoulder to Cry On
If this is n't odd news ... word on the street or should I say People magazine is reporting thatand her ex-husbandwere seen having drinks together at Greenwich Hotel in Manhattan last Wednesday .
Do n't get too excited .
Onlookers said that they were not affectionate in any way but did seem to be good friends .
It 's funny but we do n't ever remember hearing about Madonna and Sean chumming around before or being friends on any level , for that matter .
A friend close to the Material Girl said that she in not heartbroken and that she is handling the divorce with Guy Ritchie very well .
With her Sticky and Sweet tour well on it's way , she has thrown herself into her work and is spending time with her three children .
Madonna and Guy were married for eight years and we are guessing it was probably eight very long years for Guy .

We 're not sure what 's more frightening about this , the fact that the Russians figured out how to do it or that WiFi networks are effectively now completely insecure .
ElcomSoft claims they can " recover " WPA and WPA2 encypted passwords using any NVIDIA - based graphics subsystem in a workstation , desktop or even a notebook , to crack WPA encyption over 100 times fastest than with a standard CPU .
This might not mean much to the average home user because , let 's face it , serious thugs are n't bothering to hack into your home network to leech your bandwidth or steal a single user 's personal information .
However , for the corporate sector , this " press release " is a huge wake - up call .
You had best tunnel those WiFi networks over a VPN if you have anything at all that is worth securing , because that scruffy looking kid in the office suite over from you might not be playing Call of Duty 4 on the gaming rig he 's plunking around on all day ...
Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery supports both WPA and the newer WPA2 encryption used in the majority of Wi-Fi networks , allowing breaking Wi-Fi protection quickly and efficiently with most laptop and desktop computers .
The support of NVIDIA graphic accelerators increases the recovery speed by an average of 10 to 15 times when Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery is used on a moderate laptop with NVIDIA GeForce 8800 M or 9800 M series GPU , or up to 100 times when running on a desktop with two or more NVIDIA GTX 280 boards installed .
Governments , forensic and corporate users will benefit from vastly increased speed of breaking Wi-Fi protection provided by Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery .
Source : ElcomSoft
The software also supports " password recovery " from operating systems , Microsoft Office apps , Adobe PDF , Zip and RAR files .
For $ 599 , a license of ElcomSoft Distruted Password Recovery supports up to 20 clients .
So now , the average LAN meet ( especially over yonder in Russia ) may just be one big distributed computing hack - a- thon .
You think they 'll support AMD ATI Radeon GPUs eventually ?
Nah ....

Domestic drilling advocates label carbon sequestration as unproven while “ renewable only ” energy champions criticize it as shortsighted .
Nonetheless , it is an energy option that the Department of Energy ( DOE ) wishes to pursue .
The Big Sky Partnership of Montana State University won a $ 66.9 M grant from the DOE this week to complete carbon capture research in southern Wyoming to determine if carbon dioxide can be safely stored underground or if other storage means are necessary .
Carbon sequestration is an alternative energy technology designed to mitigate the harmful environmental effects of burning fossil fuels .
Rather than releasing the carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil fuel into the atmosphere , it captures and stores the harmful greenhouse gas .
Tests are needed to determine where and how carbon dioxide can be safely stored .
With this study , MSU hopes to show that the carbon dioxide gas can be liquefied and injected into porous , underground rock for long - term storage .
If carbon sequestration is proven to deliver safe , permanent and economical results , coal - rich states like Montana could continue to enjoy abundant energy from their own fossil fuel - rich natural resources without risk of damaging the environment .
The DOE award will fund a commercial - scale , eight - year carbon sequestration study that could begin as early as next year .
Two years will be spent building infrastructure and drilling an 11,000 - foot well into the sandstone rock layer west of Big Piney , Wyoming .
Once the infrastructure is in place , researchers will inject more than a million metric tons of CO2 into the underground formation .
Lee Spangler , director of the Big Sky Partnership and head of MSU 's Energy Research Institute , said the award opens up important opportunities for the region , state and university .
" It provides the opportunity to validate carbon sequestration as one of the technologies to reduce greenhouse gases and help reduce climate change , and it illustrates the potential to use the region 's vast energy resources as a path to energy independence in a climate - friendly fashion , " Spangler said .
Recently re-elected Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer has fought loudly for funding to study the usefulness of carbon sequestration in Montana .
Schweitzer is considered a leading proponent of clean carbon technologies and has touted the potential of carbon sequestration since taking office in 2004 .
" This project is one of the most important things to the governor , " said Eric Stern , senior counselor to Gov. Schweitzer .
" We believe that this is the first step toward making Montana a major energy center , " Stern said .
We in Montana share our Governor ’s optimism for this project and are proud of the great work being done by the Big Sky Partnership at MSU .
So , on that note , go Cats !!
Obama campaign : McCain will ' waste time ' going negative in debate RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 15 , 2008
Print This Email This
With the final presidential debate just a few hours away , Barack Obama 's campaign released a memo setting up expectations for a show - down in which John McCain will launch personal attacks instead of talking about voters ' concerns .
" But after two debates in which John McCain didnt mention the middle class once  and after his campaign declared openly that they want to turn the page on talking about the economy  the real question is not how many attacks McCain can land in the debate , but whether he can finally communicate a vision to turn this economy around , " Press secretary Bill Burton wrote in the memo released to reporters Wednesday morning .
" And while McCain has promised to attack Obama in the debate , every minute that he ignores the economy and the middle class is not just a minute wasted but time spent on attacks that even some of those closest to him have said dont work . "
The full memo is reprinted below .
TO : Interested Parties
FR : Bill Burton , Obama - Biden Campaign National Press Secretary
RE : John McCains plan to whip   That Ones  you - know - what 
DA : October 15 , 2008
In tonights debate , Chuck Todd of NBC News says , McCain needs to figure out how to disqualify Barack Obama . 
Time Magazines Mark Halperin writes , McCain will have to produce a major memorable moment .
The NY Daily News says the debate is  do - or - die for McCains campaign . 
However they put it , people agree , John McCain needs a game - changer .
On the big issues , this debate is one last chance for John McCain to do what he has failed to do throughout this entire campaign : explain to the American people how his economic policies would be any different at all than the failed Bush agenda he has supported every step of the way .
It s his last chance to somehow convince the American people that his erratic response to this economic crisis doesnt disqualify him from being President .
Just this weekend , John McCain vowed to whip Obamas you - know - what  at the debate , and hes indicated that hell use Bill Ayers to attack Barack Obama .
Even though Senator McCain has said he doesnt give a damn about Bill Ayers , his campaign has admitted that if he talks about the economy , hell lose .
But perhaps the NY Times explained the peril of McCains negative strategy best this morning when they wrote :
After several weeks in which the McCain campaign unleashed a series of strong political attacks on Mr. Obama , trying to tie him to a former 1960s radical , among other things , the poll found that more voters see Mr. McCain as waging a negative campaign than Mr. Obama .
Six in 10 voters surveyed said that Mr. McCain had spent more time attacking Mr. Obama than explaining what he would do as president ; by about the same number , voters said Mr. Obama was spending more of his time explaining than attacking .
[ NYT / CBS Poll , NY Times 10/15/08 ]
Senator Obama is going to use the debate to discuss his plan for the economy .
That s what hes been doing this entire campaign .
And on Monday , he built on his proposals in a new Rescue Plan for the Middle Class .
That s the kind of steady leadership and real change Americans are looking for  not John McCains erratic handling of the crisis , his constant character attacks , and the same Bush policies that have failed us for eight years .
But after two debates in which John McCain didnt mention the middle class once  and after his campaign declared openly that they want to turn the page on talking about the economy  the real question is not how many attacks McCain can land in the debate , but whether he can finally communicate a vision to turn this economy around .
And while McCain has promised to attack Obama in the debate , every minute that he ignores the economy and the middle class is not just a minute wasted but time spent on attacks that even some of those closest to him have said dont work .

Some McCain campaign officials are becoming concerned about the hostility that attacks against Sen. Obama are whipping up among Republican supporters .

Anti-American
After saying , about Barack Obama , that “ I ’m very concerned that he may have anti-American views , ” Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) calls on the media to investigate which members of Congress are anti-American :
That ’s revolting .
Though perhaps not surprising , coming from someone who says : “ Ronald Reagan has been a tremendous hero of mine , as has Ann Coulter .
I just adore Ann Coulter . ”
According to Pollster.com , there have only been two polls of Rep. Bachmann ’s district .
However , the last one , from a week ago , shows her only four points ahead of her Democratic challenger , Elwyn Tinklenberg
The DCCC has added Tinklenberg to its ‘ Red to Blue ’ campaign , and the NRCC is putting up ads for Bachmann .
That means that both sides think this race is competitive .
Besides Bachmann ’s willingness to call people who disagree with her anti-American , she has a number of other peculiar views .
When she ’s not blaming the current economic crisis on the Community Reinvestment Act , she says this :
“ Rep. Michele Bachmann , a Republican , is telling voters that “ hyper- regulation ” by the federal government created a chain of events that caused bank failures and credit freezes . ”
She also seems to have a thing about incandescent light bulbs :
“ How many members of Congress does it take to change a light bulb ?
Americans may soon find out , courtesy of a contrarian piece of legislation introduced this month by Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota .
Titled the “ Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act , ” the bill seeks to repeal the nationwide phase - out of conventional light bulbs , the kind that have been used for more than a century — pretty much since the invention of the incandescent light bulb .
Bachmann , a first - term Republican , is challenging the nation ’s embrace of energy - efficient compact fluorescent lights , saying the government has no business telling consumers what kind of light bulbs they can buy . ”
And then there was the time she said she knew of a secret agreement by Iran to partition Iraq and use part of it as a training ground for terrorists ( a statement she later retracted ) :
“ Iran is the trouble maker , trying to tip over apple carts all over Baghdad right now because they want America to pull out .
And do you know why ?
Itâ€™s because they ’ve already decided that they ’re going to partition Iraq .
And half of Iraq , the western , northern portion of Iraq , is going to be called the Iraq State of Islam , something like that .
And I ’m sorry , I do n’t have the official name , but it ’s meant to be the training ground for the terrorists .
There ’s already an agreement made .
They are going to get half of Iraq and that is going to be a terrorist safe haven zone where they can go ahead and bring about more terrorist attacks in the Middle East region and then to come against the United States because we are their avowed enemy . ”
And that ’s in addition to trying to ban gay marriage , voting against an increase in the minimum wage , and supporting the partial privatization of Social Security , etc. , etc. , etc .
Many say that religious faith and reason are essentially incompatible -- that theological faith and sensible reason function as largely separate modes of mental and emotional behavior .
LDS people , though , very often say that the Mormon faith is unusually reasonable and sensible .
Is it ?
As a test , let 's consider the Jaredites and their ocean - going barges , described in Ether of the Book of Mormon .
If you 've read it , did you do it with the " eye of faith , " or with the " eye of reason " ( and common sense ) ?
The LDS eye of faith normally reads this account unfazed .
But what if we read it with the eye of reason and common sense ?
What if we read it as if we were jury members evaluating a witness 's testimony ?
Shall we give it a try ?
First , calmly think about what your own planning would entail if you were told that you and some friends would have to hand - build small , submersible boats in which you and your family would be taking a year - long ocean voyage , accompanied by flocks and herds of animals .
Would you want to be confined to the inside of a small submersible boat for a year without planning how to care for and live with flocks and herds of animals on board , and related supplies -- for over eleven months ?
I do n't know how acquainted you are with construction engineering , especially forms of shipbuilding .
While I lived in Annapolis , Maryland ( teaching at the US Naval Academy ) , I visited shipbuilding companies and studied the history of various historical shipbuilding techniques .
I 've also looked into Thor Heyerdahl 's Kon Tiki and Ra construction as well as whaling ships at Mystic Seaport , the ex-whaling town in Connecticut , and so on .
Ocean - going craft must be carefully designed and strongly built .
As we pay close attention to Ether 2 and 6 in the Book of Mormon , we need to keep in mind that the Jaredite ships are described as built following the direct personal instructions of God himself .
The LDS church has always taught that the Lord of the Jaredites ' Old Testament times was Jehovah , the same deity described as having created the earth and all of the plants and animals , employing all the intelligent planning and management that that necessarily implies .
In Ether 2 , note the order of procedure : FIRST , for a water voyage prior to the ocean crossing itself , the Lord had instructed Jared and his brother to build boats in which , according to the account , their families and friends " did cross many waters , " ( 2:6 ) carrying with them " seeds of every kind , " flocks ( " male and female , of every kind " ) , " fowls of the air " , " swarms of bees , " and " fish of the waters . "
( 2:1-3 ) According to the account , this boat trip was accomplished successfully .
NEXT , four years later , the Lord again ordered the men to build similar boats " after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built " ( 2:16 ) , this time for an ocean crossing of nearly one year 's duration .
These boats , similar to the ones built four years earlier , are described as " small , and they were light upon the water , even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water " ( 2:16 ) , with structural integrity such that they were " exceeding tight , " top and bottom , entirely leakproof and air - tight ( " tight like unto a dish " ) ( 2:17 ) because they were going to be " many times buried in the depths of the sea " ( 6:6 ) by " mountain waves " ( 2:24 ) during many violent storms .
To be both ( a ) light ( " like a fowl upon the water " ) , and ( b ) able to carry flocks and herds with food supplies for a year , the construction would obviously have to be carefully planned and organized because of the known challenges of combining lightness with strength ( which still applies : boats , airplanes , bicycles and helmets , race cars , even suitcases , etc. ) .
Following the Lord 's specifications , the workmen built each boat with just one tight - fitting door , and no window or other opening .
Construction of all eight boats was completed , per the Lord 's personal instructions ( " I have made the barges according as thou [ the Lord ] hast directed me . " 2:18 ) .
NEXT , the Brother of Jared looked at the finished boats and wondered for the first time , Whoa !
How will we breathe in these things ?
Specifically , quoting him : " . . .
I have made the barges as thou hast directed me .
And behold , O Lord , we shall perish , for in them we cannot breathe , save it is the air which is in them ; therefore we shall perish . "
( 2:19 ) It was only then , that is , that he noticed that the boats were air - tight .
( He also noticed they were totally dark inside : " O Lord , in them there is no light ; whither shall we steer ? " ( 2:19 ) Now let 's pause to consider :
How do the eyes of faith and reason interpret this account ?
The LDS eye of faith typically accepts the story unfazed .
But consider the following " Eye of Reason and Common Sense " questions : 1 . Is it reasonable that men smart enough to build such watertight and airtight boats , following divine instructions , would do all the planning , material gathering and construction , and finish all eight before the question of breathing and seeing occurred to any of them ?
At that time ( Tower of Babel period ) , working with hand tools , such a large project would have required at least months of labor .
How could they not have noticed this problem for months ?
Remember that these shipbuilders were experienced .
They had already built very similar people / animal / cargo - carrying boats just four years earlier .
2 . Stated most succinctly , how could shipbuilders build eight air - tight boats without noticing that they were air - tight ?
Visualize men walking around inside boats " tight like unto a dish , " with only one door that was to be kept closed at sea .
Can you imagine them finishing all of the inside walls on all eight boats before noticing that it 's suffocating in there ?
3 . And what about seeing ?
Is it sensible that the workmen could have finished all eight interiors without noticing that there was insufficient light to see -- no windows ?
How could they have worked inside without seeing ?
When asked about the light problem , note that the Lord answered with a question : " What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels ?
For behold , ye cannot have windows , for they will be dashed in pieces . " ( 2:23 ) 4 . " Dashed in pieces ? " Dashable ( shatterable ) windows were not invented until thousands of years later , by a different civilization .
How would Jared 's brother have been able to understand the Lord 's reply ?
Why would a deity have said something that would have had no meaning for Jared 's brother ?
5 . How many boats would you have to finish before noticing no air and no light ?
Could you finish all eight boats before that dawned on you ?
Especially if you had built several similar boats and traveled in one of them four years earlier ?
6 . Is it sensible to finish even one before noticing ?
Do you know any carpenter who would do that ?
7 . Would the Lord himself not think of the need to breathe and to see , and then wait until the end to be asked about these life - or - death issues ?
8 . Would a person of common sense build even a mountain cabin , finishing all walls inside and out , before thinking to make a window hole , without thinking about breathing and seeing inside ?
9 . Is it sensible that all of these shipbuilders , described as previously experienced in carrying flocks and herds of animals inside of boats , waited until the end to realize , Oh , wait !
We forgot that our animals will need to breathe in here .
And we need to see in order to feed them and clean up .
Despite the common - sense requirements of structural integrity of ships that will be on the ocean carrying flocks and herds of animals and their feed for a year , all boats are finished , and then , as an afterthought , holes are hacked into that finished structure , one in the top and one in the bottom ( because when it flops upside down in stormy seas , the bottom becomes the top ) .
( 2:20 ) 10 .
Would n't the Lord think that the sensible time to plan and build windows for air and light was during construction , not waiting to hack holes after finishing all boats , as a " whoops ! " reaction ?
Would a sensible deity or human do that ?
11 . Is this not similar to teaching a work crew how to build automobiles for an extremely long trip without mentioning steering ?
Then , AFTER all the cars are built , the chief builder asks , " We have built all of the cars exactly as you have directed , but how shall we steer , for the wheels and axles are built so that they do not turn ? "
And the master planner replies , " Well , you can just make a hole in the dashboard and stick in a steering wheel .
Then , when you need to steer , just turn the wheel . "
12 . Is it fair to ask how this differs from the following ?
Mormon elders , after following the Lord 's exact instructions on building and painting the Celestial Room in the Salt Lake Temple , discovering that they 've painted themselves into a remote corner , pray , " We have done as thou hast instructed us , oh Lord , but thy instructions have resulted in our painting ourselves into a corner . "
What would you think if the answer were , " Behold , ye shall make a hole in the granite temple wall , and after ye have escaped , ye shall stop the hole . "
Does the following improve the faith / reason problem , or worsen it ?
" When thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air . " ( 2:20 ) 13 .
If you were taking your family on a car trip , would you tell them , " Wait until you notice you 're suffering for lack of air , THEN open the window . "
Is n't it the case that people who need air often do n't notice it until too late , because oxygen shortage has caused them to pass out ?
Do n't we read that people who suffocate often do n't know it 's happening ?
Pilots at altitude undergoing oxygen deprivation experience the same hazard .
Their awareness drops below the level needed to know they lack " air . " 14 .
How is the Jaredite level of planning and knowledge different from that of men described in current news articles , who carelessly suffocate illegal aliens by transporting them in unventilated trucks ?
( And that problem occurs in just a few days , not a year . )
If we ask ourselves whether the following is sensibly reasonable , what is the answer ?.
" They did lay snares and catch fowls of the air . "
( Also see 6:4 : " fowl that they should carry with them " )
Birds are the first animals to die from inadequate oxygen , canaries in coal mines being a famous example .
15 . How were the birds to notify Jared that they " suffered for air ? "
For the reasoning person , it gets worse .
People and animals obviously keep breathing at night , while sleeping .
16 .
What if they " suffer for air " while everyone is asleep ?
Is that a good time to need to " unstop the hole ? " 17 .
Did the Jaredites have " Hole Unstoppers " on guard while everyone else slept ?
Did the unstopper continually check to be sure that sleeping people and animals , especially birds , were still breathing ?
How well does the eye of reason and common sense fare with the following problem ? " . . . unstop the hole . . . "
Also , " thou shalt make a hole in the top and also in the bottom . "
( 2:20 ) Note that it says the hole , that is , a hole , as in one hole .
( The hole at the bottom clearly does n't count except when the ship flops upside down in high seas . )
Now picture in your mind traveling with flocks of flatulent sheep and herds of flatulent goats and cattle ) in a boat with ONE functioning air hole .
18 . What about air movement for ventilation ?
19 .
How would air enter and exit the same single hole supplying the entire barge / boat ?
There 's a related problem :
Air does n't readily enter a closed space .
Why not ?
Because the space is already full of air --
In the Jaredites ' case , warmer , body - heated air that exerts greater - than - outside pressure thus resisting incoming air .
People taking car - trips with kids partially open at least two windows for air movement .
20 . In these Jaredite boats , reported as designed by the highest divine intelligence , why is there no cross ventilation for three hundred and forty - four days ?
The eye of reason tries to visualize people and animals struggling to vent their body gases and heat through just one hole .
Now let 's apply the eye of reason to general animal care : 21 .
How much does even one goat , sheep or cow eat in a year ?
These are grazing animal , but they can't graze on the ocean ; and they do n't eat fish .
Their grasses and grains have to be stored on board .
A goat eats 2 - 3 pounds / day .
Even a pony eats about 8 pounds / day .
Let 's sensibly use 3 pounds X 344 days .
That 's 1,032 pounds of feed per animal .
That 's a lot of bulky weight to lash down to prevent it crashing around when the ships roll , and even flip upside down .
22 .
How do you fit 1,000 pounds of feed per animal in the small boats , along with people , flocks and herds of animals , and birds ?
23 .
And how about carrying a year 's supply of drinking water for each person and animal ?
They could n't drink ocean water , and in boats of the type described they could n't gather significant rain water .
How could they load and carry sufficient fresh water ?
Even the most illiterate people have learned how important ventilation is for food items , especially without refrigeration .
People and animals exhale moisture with every breath .
The numerous animals could n't be taken outside to urinate and defecate .
Such a year - long , high - moisture , low - ventilation environment breeds bacteria , yeast , fungus and molds , and rots food .
24 .
So , what about food spoilage ?
Could it get worse ?
The voyagers are reported to have sung praises to the Lord day and night .
( 6:9 ) 25 .
How likely does day - and - night singing and praising seem after months of close confinement in small boats with urinating , defecating , flatulent flocks , herds and fowls , with only one air hole per drum - tight boat ?
Could it get worse ?
Ether describes heavy seas ( " . . . they were many times buried in the depths of the sea , because of the mountain waves which broke upon them " 6:6 ) .
So these boats were crashing around under water , occasionally flipping upside down ( thus the need for a hole in the bottom which could be opened as an air hole when the boat flopped over ) .
26 .
Can you visualize adults , children , flocks and herds , rocking , tossing and flipping over , traveling that way for a year ?
Could you ride for 344 days and nights with your children on a boat , repeatedly buried in the depths of the sea with flocks and herds crashing over each other , with urine - soaked " litter box " material spilling into their food as the ship flopped upside down ?
27 .
How would you pour all the urine and feces out of one hole -- for a year ?
Could reason and common sense be additionally battered ? " . . . fierceness of the wind . . . the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters ; and thus they were driven forth before the wind . "
( 6:6 - 8 ) This testifies to three major factors : ( a ) wind force , ( b ) wind constancy , ( c ) wind direction .
" And thus they were driven forth , three hundred and forty and four days upon the water . "
28 .
If the wind was ( a ) constant , ( b ) strong , ( c ) always toward the promised land , how could this force require 344 days ?
But wait !
Could the shape of the boats , the front and back " ends thereof were peaked " ( 2:17 ) , have presented insufficient flat surface at the back for the wind to blow against , causing the trip to last longer ?
29 . But then why would an intelligent divine designer choose such an inefficient shape ?
Could it get worse for the sensible eye of reason ?. " . . . terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind . "
( 6:6 ) 30 .
Beyond the fact that a tempest is not caused by a fierce wind , but rather IS a fierce wind , why would an intelligent deity think that so much wrenchingly violent motion , even overturning stored goods , animals , their bedding and feed , be an intelligent thing to do ?
31 . Would n't an exhorbitant amount of water in the flocks ' and herds ' drinking containers be lost as the boats pitched , rolled and flipped over ?
32 . How did the Jaredites mop and dry this constant sloshing spillage for a year ?
33 .
How could they have carried enough fresh water to offset the constant sloshing spillage ?
34 .
Could you keep your family food and belongings together with that kind of flailing around ?
Were the people and animals secured by ropes ( analogous to seatbelts ) ?
Today , even seatbelted people in slow - speed vehicle rollovers are often seriously injured .
But at least their vehicles then stop .
Ocean storms , though , last for hours or days .
The Jaredites and their animals would have been thrown around ( a ) many times longer and ( b ) in a vastly larger interior than in a car rollover .
The sliding and falling collisions of people , animals , food and water supplies would often have gone on for hours or days at a time .
And if tied down , in a rollover they'd have been left hanging from the ceiling .
The food supplies , and especially the water supplies , would have had to be lashed down to prevent lethally crushing slides into people and animals .
35 .
But then , when the boat turned upside down , how did the people access the food and water , which would now be secured to the ceiling ?
36 .
How would the Jaredites have been able to prevent or deal with orthopedic injuries and concussions as animals and people crashed into each other ?
37 .
When the boats were upside down , did the people and animals just walk around on what had been the ceiling , outside of pens ?
" And thus they were driven forth , three hundred and forty and four days upon the water .
And they did land upon the shore of the promised land . "
( 6:11,12 ) That is , the account directly implies that all the boats landed at approximately the same time .
38 .
Is it sensible that after 344 days of such violent tossing and sloshing , the boats would have arrived on essentially the same day ?
How could eight ocean - going vessels tossed by violent storms maintain near - identical speeds , remaining near each other over such an extremely long time period ?
39 .
Would the " eye of reason " perceive the ocean trip in Ether to be a fitting example of famed LDS general authority and historian Elder B.H. Roberts ' notable assessment of the Book of Mormon " as if it were a tale told by a child , with utter disregard for consistency " ? ( Studies of the Book of Mormon , p. 251 )
The eye of faith apparently does not perceive the Jaredite ocean voyage to be a nutty fictitious story .
40 .
How does the eye of sensible reason see it ?
It seems to me that all 40 of the above questions are honestly , fairly and sensibly stated .
by Michael Tracey
In his essay , “ The White Negro , ” Norman Mailer references Marxist thought with a level of respect but pointed to its failure in application because , as he put it , “ it was an expression of the scientific narcissism we inherited from the 19th century , ” motivated by the “ rational mania that consciousness could stifle instinct . ”
I have this awful feeling that he is right , that we are driven not by the profound harmonies and profundities of evolved consciousness , but by base instinct that is primitive , not modern .
The Delicious Occupation of Gossip
In Civilization and its Discontents , Freud writes of this question which Mailer was addressing , that the fundamental instinct of the species is aggression :
“ Men are not gentle , friendly creatures wishing for love , who simply defend themselves if they are attacked , but that a powerful measure of desire for aggression has to be reckoned as part of their instinctual endowment .
The result is that their neighbour is to them not only a possible helper or sexual object , but also a temptation to them to gratify their aggressiveness on him , to exploit his capacity for work without recompense , to use him sexually without his consent , to seize his possessions , to humiliate him , to cause him pain , to torture and to kill him .
Homo homini lupus ; who has the courage to dispute it in the face of all the evidence in his own life and in history ?
This aggressive cruelty usually lies in wait for some provocation , or else it steps into the service of some other purpose , the aim of which might as well have been achieved by milder measures .
In circumstances that favour it , when those forces in the mind which ordinarily inhibit it cease to operate , it also manifests itself spontaneously and reveals men as savage beasts to whom the thought of sparing their own kind is alien .
Anyone who calls to mind the atrocities of the early migrations , of the invasion by the Huns or by the so - called Mongols under Ghenghiz Khan and Tamurlane , of the sack of Jerusalem by the pious Crusaders , even indeed the horrors of the last world - war , will have to bow his head humbly before the truth of this view of man .
The existence of this tendency to aggression which we can detect in ourselves and rightly presume to be present in others is the factor that disturbs our relations with our neighbours and makes it necessary for culture to institute its high demands .
Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another .
Their interests in their common work would not hold them together ; the passions of instinct are stronger than reasoned interests .
Culture has to call up every possible reinforcement in order to erect barriers against the aggressive instincts of men and hold their manifestations in check by reaction - formations in men ’s minds . ”
Nietzsche got there first in his own bleak rendition of the nature of the human condition , the brute forces that drive it and that mangle the Paulinian notion that love will triumph :
“ To see others suffer does one good .
To make others suffer even more : this is a hard ( saying ) but an ancient … all too human principle , to which even the apes might subscribe … without cruelty there is no festival : thus the longest and most ancient part of human history teaches …and in punishment there is festival . ”
Perhaps it is then simply part of what we are , that we have an inherent disposition to vent , to aggress , to hate , feelings that require that we seek someone or something against which to vent , aggress , hate .
However since we also have pretensions to being civilized , caring , human , decent , it is difficult to face up to such a loathsome disposition , so we deal with it by rationalizing it away , justifying with whatever pretext is available .
Peter Gay , in his monumental work , The Cultivation of Hatred ; the Bourgeois Experience , Victoria to Freud , pours over the vast , long literatures that have sought to come to grips with this condition .
He notes that :
“ Aggressive acts , to begin with , are not all primitive pugilism , wanton cruelty , or routine murder .
They range across a broad spectrum of verbal and physical expression , from confident self - advertisement to permissible mayhem , from sly malice to sadistic torture .
They emerge as words and gestures – less fatal , to be sure , than physical violence , but little less unmistakable …
The practice of invidious social comparisons is awash with aggressive impulses .
So is the delicious occupation of gossip … ”
It is clear , however , that no one will ever admit to arbitrary or instinctive aggression – the project of Modernity has at least been successful in convincing us of the impropriety of such a disposition .
We are , after all , the Children of Reason .
So how do we go about this business of aggressing , of hating ?
Why , of course , we find an excuse , a reason .
As Gay notes , “ Every culture , every class , every century , constructs its distinctive alibis for aggression . ”
I think that Gay is getting close to a very uncomfortable truth about who we really are , and reminds me of Gandhi ’s response when asked his opinion about Western civilization : “ … it would be a good idea . ”
Better Angels of Our Nature
As for me and Karr , I suppose one issue I need to deal with is why I did it , why did I spend do much time helping to find him , and why was I willing to put myself through what was , in all honesty , a terrible experience .
I say “ suppose , ” because for much of the time I have been writing this piece I had no intention of addressing these questions .
Part of this was to do with a certain stubbornness in refusing to respond to the commentaries that were oh so prissy and righteous , verbal and written exemplars of how it was all so inappropriate , not what a journalist should do , not what they would do .
I had this feeling that being lectured by those who covered the case was not unlike being nagged about the dangers of promiscuous sex by a nymphomaniac .
It is also a bit rich to hear these critiques from a profession that in the whole saga of covering the Ramsey story were only too ready to share bodily fluids with law enforcement – in at least one case , so it is said , literally .
In the end I have relented and want to take on the issue , in a very particular way .
But first let me say something that my friend and colleague Len Ackland was quick to point out to those who asked for his thoughts .
I am not , nor have I ever claimed to be , a journalist .
I am a media scholar who has spent a lifetime studying journalism , who has done some journalism , numerous opinion pieces here and in the UK and , most notably , working with David Mills on the documentaries , but I have not sought the mantle of “ journalist . ”
However , even if I were I would still have done what I did , because in the end what is important , vital and necessary is that we define ourselves not as this or that professional but as moral beings , that our humanity should be defined by such and that when we are not guided by moral systems , by an ethical compass , then we let loose not those “ better angels of our nature ” that so entranced Lincoln but that dark side , that cruel and exploitative instinct that so haunted him .
By an ethical compass I mean the literal definition :
“ Ethic ‘eth - ik n : the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation ; a set of moral principles or values ; a theory or system of moral values ; the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group . ”
I do n’t want to be misunderstood here .
I ’m claiming no high moral ground and recognize that I have vices galore and that , for example , some of the women in my life have decent grounds for a war crimes tribunal .
I understood that life is a constant struggle between the competing sides of our nature , and that in fact the whole issue of cultural identity , of the dialogue about what is good and bad in culture is an enlarged version of this agonizing struggle about personal identity , and the vexing question of , is this who I am , is this who I should be ?
In this instance , from that first stirring of empathy for the Ramseys to the decision to find Karr , for good or ill , I sought to do the right thing , and I am perplexed that there were those who chose not to see it that way .
“ It was truly intimate and very sexual . ”
Let me make the point by taking you , the reader , to one moment in time , one place : July 19 , 2006 , Bangkok , Thailand .
On that day I received an email from Daxis , with a Word document attached .
Earlier in this piece I wrote of how when he first went to the school where he would be teaching he saw a number of young girls , one of whom in particular he lusted after .
On the 19th he wrote a long note about her .
Here it is ( I have changed the names of the children ) :
[ EDITOR ” S NOTE : S&R has received a cease - and - desist request from John Mark Karr in which he alleges that his e-mail to Michael Tracey , subject “ About Melanie , ” enjoys copyright privilege .

He Has His New Target
There was by the time I received this nothing that particularly surprised me , and I have no doubt that he genuinely believed that the child was attracted to him , nor that given the opportunity he would have had sex with her .
Note how he talks about his interaction with her , the flirty playfulness , her attraction to him , his declaration of his patience in being willing to wait until she was in his charge in a year .
In his fevered imagining she , like JonBenet , would be saying , “ I love you Daxis . ”
This was his new romance and in his mind it was all consensual and come hell or high water she would be his .
When I read this I simply said to Tom Bennett , “ he has his new target . ”
The idea that anyone would not wish to stop what was going to happen to the child because of an over - inflated sense of their “ professionalism I find disgustingly dangerous .
And if there are those who would still say it was all wrong to do what I did , just close your eyes and imagine that it is your five year - old child whose belly button he wants to eat and about whom he expresses his lust .
And how did it feel for me ?
Dealing with the media was not difficult .
I ’ve been doing that on and off since 1998 .
However , there is no doubt that 2006 turned into an awful , dark year .
By its end I was exhausted .
The idea of teaching in the Fall was dreadful , not because I dislike teaching since ordinarily it is , more often than not , a delightful experience .
In all my many years in Colorado I have never bought out of a course or sort relief , even at the busiest times .
Yet over the summer break I went to my Dean , Paul Voakes , and asked if I could buy out of at least one course .
As the words left my lips I understood that he would have to say no .
He agreed to discuss this with the Provost , Phil DiStephano .
I also knew that Phil would have to say no .
The reason was simple , since that group of people who hated me and the Ramseys – and the degree of their vitriol is truly splendid to behold – would be watching me like a hawk and at the first sign of special treatment ( even though buying out of a course and banking courses is routine ) they would be screaming holy hell .
I managed to get through the Fall semester , even though I knew I was missing a beat , and in fact found the classroom pleasantly therapeutic .
What I did come to understand was that while being attacked publicly and viciously is never pleasant , I was used to it and could handle it without too much difficulty ( my therapist disagrees ) .
The mood of deep despair , anxiety , sadness that descended on me like a thick , cold , clinging fog came from the experience of having to deal with dark intelligence day in day out , for months on end .
I will never forget the Saturday night following the phone conversation in which Daxis had , at great length , described how he killed her .
I sat in my study until the sun set .
It was dark , and I sat there thinking about what I had just heard , not knowing if it was true or not , but ethically feeling that I had to continue to believe that it might be , and knowing that , true or not , something similar to what he had described had happened to that child , as evidenced in the awful autopsy photos .
In my mind ’s eye the images of his description ran constantly , like a permanent reel of film , replaying over and over .
I could not get rid of one image in particular , that of his tying the ligatures to her wrists and then hanging her from the window .
I do n’t know how long I sat there , but there came a point when I could hold it inside no longer and , for the first time in almost a decade of thinking about and talking about the appalling things that were done to JonBenet and to her family , I started to sob .
Not just tearing up , not just tears running down my cheeks but a flood and a wail of anguish and sorrow .
In that sense Karr may not have killed JonBenet , but he sure as hell came close to destroying me .
He Cries for Understanding and Forgiveness
Patsy Ramsey died in the early hours of June 24th , 2006 .
The funeral service was on June 29th at the United Methodist Church , Roswell , Georgia .
I had flown there with Pete Hofstrom , former number two in the Boulder DA ’s office , Bryan Morgan , John ’s attorney and Pat Burke , Patsy ’s attorney .
Lou Smit was there as was Hal Haddon , Morgan ’s law partner , and Trip DeMeuth who had , when he was an assistant DA , fought passionately to get other people to take Lou Smit ’s “ intruder ” argument ( I refuse to call it a theory anymore ) .
Mary Lacy and her husband were also there , as was Ollie Gray , who for several years had been working with Lou on their own , private investigation of JonBenet ’s death .
I think for everyone it was simply important to show a kind of solidarity for this poor woman .
The service lasted about 40 minutes and was a celebration of her life , with passing reference to , but no lingering on , that wretched Christmas night almost ten years before .
Her sisters were there , wearing large summer hats , a silent , colourful reminder of Patsy ’s love for her own hats .
After the funeral a long line of cars proceeded on the drive to St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta , where Patsy would be laid to rest alongside her mother Nedra , her step daughter , Beth ( John ’s child , who had been killed in a car crash in 1992 ) and but a few paces from JonBenet ’s grave .
The drive from church to cemetery took about 30 minutes and police and state troopers cleared the roads , closing off side streets , to allow the cortege to proceed unhindered .
As I looked out of the car windows there was a surprising , moving sight .
The officers were standing to attention , some saluted , troopers held their hats over their hearts .
I do n’t think it is too much of an exaggeration to suggest that they were not just paying their respects , they were acknowledging what the rest of us there knew with a passion , that the only thing that Patsy had ever done to JonBenet was love her .
There would of course be those who continued to believe in her guilt , even if they no longer cared .
And then there are the remnants of the mob that would continue to hate her , but for them hating is what oxygen is to the rest of us .
The press coverage the following day was unusually caring , not dwelling on the accusations against this most maligned of women .
The coverage noted that cops were taking video tapes of all the car plates , reporting that they had been told that this was because the case remained open and this was just a precaution .
In reality they were looking for Daxis .
In April 2007 , I received an email from “ Daxis . ”
It was written in German and apparently asked the question of where deception begins .
A few more came as he expressed his desire to talk , again .
In July he wrote : “ I ache for her , Michael .
I feel such confusion .
I am so utterly confused about what happened . ”
In a later one in July , he asked me if I had seen an interview he had done with Fox News ’ Greta Van Susteren .
I had , and realized that he was still trying to convince the world that he was responsible for JonBenet ’s death .
At one point Van Susteren , clearly bewildered by this , asks him if he understood the difference between first and second degree murder , to which he instantly replied , “ of course , first implies intent . ”
There it was again , what I had spent months listening to – it was an accident , it was n’t meant to be .
I replied , briefly , that at least he was consistent .
He replied : “ Thank you , Michael .
I shall continue to be consistent when it comes to my darling JonBenet .
I am glad you saw that interview .
I ’ve regrets about some of the things I said only to protect myself .
For instance , I think of her every day .
There is not a time when I am not thinking of her .
I wanted to say that so bad but was not afforded such .
I look forward to the day when you can respond with more than a sentence or two .
Michael , listen to me carefully – nothing has changed .
I am the same man you knew me to be .
Law enforcement ’s worst mistakes cannot change that .
We ’ll talk about it all more on Friday . ”
No we wo n’t , I thought .
John Ramsey today lives with his son Burke in Charlevoix , Michigan .
John Mark Karr lives in the Atlanta area and has a fiancé who lives in Las Vegas with her young daughter .
He visits regularly the graves of Patsy and JonBenet .
In the early summer of 2007 he placed by her grave a large angel holding chimes .
He also placed a pot of violets , a small crystal bear and her August birth stone .
He sits and cries , and asks , as always , for understanding and forgiveness .
Next : Postscript
INDEX
Lincoln County , an hour 's drive north - west of St Louis , is where Mark Twain learned to navigate the treacherous shoals of the Mississippi as a steamboat captain .
It also has a proud tradition of picking winners in US presidential elections : it has been wrong only once in more than 100 years .
But this year , nothing is guaranteed .
In the 2000 and 2004 elections , the 60,000 people of this rural county in the bellwether state of Missouri were enthusiastic supporters of George Bush .
Today , the state is on a knife edge , with Barack Obama ahead but by only a narrow margin .
Lincoln County , too , is divided down the middle .
Mr Bush 's former aide , Karl Rove , used to say he could tell if a community would vote Republican by looking at the map to see if it was within commuting distance of a city and close to a Wal - Mart .
That describes the town of Troy , but Tom Burkemper , a retired farmer , lawyer and leader of the local Democratic Party , believes its politics are as unpredictable as the winding Mississippi river .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Although certain that Mr Obama will be elected president , he is not sure about Lincoln County , despite its near - unblemished record in picking winners .
He recalls that Twain could never figure out the state 's confusing political landscape , in which the descendants of Democrats who once owned slaves – including his own family – voted Democratic in local elections but often chose Republican candidates in presidential contests .
What seems to divide voters in Troy and its surrounding areas these days has little to do with race .
If Mr Obama 's colour was ever an issue , it has faded away as the economy has worsened .
Local evangelical churches have done their best to turn voters away from the Illinois Senator , says Mr Burkemper , with some preachers even calling him the Antichrist .
But opinion polls show that Missouri voters are far more interested in the Democrat 's healthcare policies and whether their taxes will go up or down .
In the past 10 years , the population of Troy has almost doubled to about 11,000 as cornfields have been turned into housing estates and white , working - class families have moved in to get a foot on the property ladder .
But things are a bit more difficult in the current economic downturn .
That 's how Holly Hagger finds things at her house at the spanking new Ashleigh Estates , just outside town .
There are half - finished houses all around her and as many " for sale " signs as there are signs for Mr Obama and John McCain .
" We 're not hurting , yet , " she says , although she does n't want to speculate about what her neighbours are thinking .
" We have a rule around here , do n't talk jobs , politics or religion , and we all get along just fine . "
She has decided to vote Obama because of the state of the economy , even though her husband Robbie is still not fully convinced .
" I keep my ear out and , from what I know , most of Troy will go for Obama , " he says .
By contrast , the Hair Design Team salon is a hive of political discussion .
Teri Peasel , 43 , is plunging her client Ann McKinstry 's head under the tap as she tells me : " I 'm strongly for Obama and I feel all this talk about him not being against abortion is such nonsense .
As for Obama , I feel he is for the people and he 's worried about the middle classes .
" But we 're not really supposed to talk politics here and I 've probably lost a few clients as a result .
I 've even argued with my mother - in - law so much I could have spun her out of the chair . "
Her colleague Kim Cannon , 27 , is just as big an Obama supporter and says that , of the salon 's 19 staff , only one is backing Mr McCain .
" Even the owner supports the Democrats , " she adds .
" I think it 's all about working women finally showing our opinions count .
What 's really interesting is that race is not an issue here any more .
I really believe [ Obama ] has got the right ideas and people around here are really fed up with the economy being so down in the dumps . "
Although the road to St Louis is still clogged with pick - up trucks and cars , there is little doubt many working families are overextended .
A food charity which opens once a week to help those in need is overwhelmed .
Instead of the usual 30 or so cars pulling up looking for a box of canned goods to see them through a tough time , there were 90 cars in line this week .
There might have been a riot had Donald Thompson , owner of the Troy People 's Bank , not come over with $ 3,000 in cheques to help the needy .
Some of the money was from the bank and the rest from his own pocket .
" There are a lot of people hurting around here and I lived through the Great Depression , so I know a thing or two about bad times , " he says .
His bank has had to repossess only one property , however , because he did not take part in the lending frenzy of the past 10 years .
" There was too much greed around , " Mr Thompson explains , " and now we are paying the price . "
Some of the banker 's biggest admirers congregate every day at a table in the Landmark Café .
A hand - made sign overhead says the " College of Knowledge " and members of the informal club are , for the most part , retired .
Some are millionaires , having made their fortunes developing shopping malls outside the town .
Others are retired blue - collar workers , living on pensions that have collapsed along with the stock market .
All are white and they include a handful of bigots who do n't mind using racist terms when talking about Barack Obama .
But , yesterday at least , they were evenly split in a straw poll .
Their self - appointed spokesman is Gene Tucker , a retired Teamster union member who drove trucks for years .
That was before he started his own landscaping business , which he has since sold .
His political views could have come from a Mississippi swamp .
" I grew up in a mixed neighbourhood and let me tell you I have never met a black man I could trust , " he declared as his friends looked away in some embarrassment .
A quick vote around the table revealed more Democrats present than Republicans , although some " Democrats " said they were voting McCain this time .
The result was four Democrats and five Republicans with two still undecided , which is probably how the entire county feels .
By Ben Cohen
Ron Paul 's libertarian views became somewhat of a phenomenon amongst disaffected Republicans and independents during the presidential elections because of his willingness to stand up for true conservative principles .
Paul 's critique of the Republican Party in an article for CNN is spot on , pointing out the parties failure to adhere to traditional conservative values :
During the debates in the Republican Presidential primary , even
though I am a 10 - term sitting Representative Member of Congress , I was
challenged more than once on my Republican credentials .
The fact that I
was repeatedly asked how I could be a Republican when I was talking a
different language than the other candidates answers the question of
how the Republican Party can slip so far so fast .

My rhetorical
answer at the time was simple :
Why should one be excluded from the
Republican Party for believing and always voting for :
• Limited government power
• A balanced budget
• Personal liberty
• Strict adherence to the Constitution
• Sound money
• A strong defense while avoiding all undeclared wars
• No nation - building and no policing the world
Paul 's solution for the imploding party is to return to traditional conservative values may sound good on paper , but there is zero chance Republicans will listen to him .
The GOP has been bought , lock - stock by corporate America and as we have recently seen , these companies rely heavily on welfare when times are hard .
Paul 's vision for America is an interesting one , but ultimately a fantasy .
Economic wealth has been built through protectionism , central planning and a heavy dose of state investment ( despite conservatives adamant insistence that the ' free market ' has created all the wealth ) .
Ron Paul 's Republicanism would be great in an alternate reality , but not in this one .
Only in Hello Kitty
Hell can a man be sent to the couch for the night for using the wrong toilet paper .
Now , if you are in the bathroom and you finish up only to find that there is no toilet paper on the toilet paper roll , what do you do ?
All normal people ( ie not Hello Kitty fanatics ) reach for a new roll of toilet paper and that is the end of the issue , but I knew that things were n’t going to be quite that easy as soon as I realized that the only toilet paper I could find was Hello Kitty toilet paper .
While the rest of the world views toilet paper as just that , Hello Kitty fanatics view toilet paper as a display item .
So I sat on the toilet pondering my predicament .
I had two choices : 1 ) I could open the bathroom door , hobble down the hallway with my pants at my ankles desperately trying to salvage any dignity I had by covering up the best I could until I got to the storage closet where I knew we had non Hello Kitty toilet paper .
I would then grab a roll , hobble back with my pants still around my ankles until I reached the bathroom where I could finally wipe myself properly .
2 ) I could grab a roll of Hello Kitty toilet paper right next to me , use it without losing any dignity , but have to face the Hello Kitty Hell wrath for actually using a Hello Kitty product the way it was supposed to be used .
For any regular person , the obvious choice is quick and simple , but not so in Hello Kitty Hell .
5 minutes , 10 minutes , 15 minutes , 20 minutes passed with me still debating which was the lesser of two evils : humiliation & embarrassment or facing the wrath of a Hello Kitty fanatic .
The tables were tipping in favor of the walk down the hall and I even opened the bathroom door , but realizing it was the dead of winter and there was no heating in the hallway , the tables quickly tipped back toward the Hello Kitty toilet paper .
I must admit it took quite a bit of courage for me to finally decide that Hello Kitty toilet paper was going to be the choice ( urged on by the fact that after 20 minutes of debating the issue , certain areas were beginning to crust … well , let ’s just leave those gory details to your imagination … )
Now even the choice of Hello Kitty toilet paper did n’t free me to wipe away .
I then had to choose which of the 4 patterns of Hello Kitty toilet paper we had I was going to use .
Would it be the 1974 Hello Kitty Design :
The 1977 Hello Kitty Design :
The Berry / Flower Wreath Winking Hello Kitty Design :
The Tropical Flower Hello Kitty Design :
This was far from an easy decision due to the fact that all the patterns came in pairs and the use of one would certainly unbalance the display .
It took another 10 minutes before I came up with my brilliant idea : I would carefully open the Hello Kitty toilet paper , use a few sheets and then re-wrap it .
Nobody would ever know , I ’d keep my dignity and would n’t freeze my butt off ( literally ) and there would be no Hello Kitty fanatic wrath to face .
Perfect …except …
I put my plan into motion and it worked perfectly .
I congratulated myself for insightful thinking in an extremely delicate Hello Kitty Hell situation .
I was still self - congratulating myself when :
wife : “ Honnnney … ”
me : “ … ” ( thinking that does n’t sound like the good “ honey ” but like the “ You did something terrible honey ” )
wife : “ Honnnney , can you come here a minute … ”
me : “ Yes dear . ” ( thinking uh - oh , this is not going to be good )
wife : ( looking into the bathroom ) “ There is something not quite right here … ”
me : “ Everything looks fine to me . ” ( thinking “ woohoo , she ca n’t figure it out ” )
wife : “ Why is the Hello Kitty toilet paper out of order ? ”
me : “ … ” ( thinking WTF ???
Hello Kitty toilet paper has an order ??? )
wife : “ They should all be in the order of their release .
Why is the 1977 style Hello Kitty toilet paper placed before the 1974 style Hello Kitty toilet paper ? ”
me : ( quick thinking ) “ Oh . I ’m sorry .
I accidentally bumped the shelf and they fell down and I just placed them back up . ” ( thinking “ order ??? why does everything Hello Kitty have to have an order ??? )
wife : ( sighs ) “ You need to be more careful .
You know that Hello kitty is precious . ” ( shakes her head as if talking to a 6 year old )
Then it happened .
The instant she touched the roll that I had used , she knew .
I still do n’t understand what power Hello Kitty fanatics have that can make them instantly know that 5 squares off a full roll of toilet paper are missing just by the feel of the roll , but they can …and that is when the “ you ’re on the couch in the Hello Kitty sleeping bag ” look came ( I ’d try to describe this look , but it would be useless .
Think back to when you were a little kid and you did something that made your parents so mad that they could n’t even speak .
Multiply this by 1000 and you begin to see the tip of the iceberg on the “ you ’re on the couch in the Hello Kitty sleeping bag ” look ) .
I must admit that I did get a bit of satisfaction out of being sent to the couch which is a rarity in Hello Kitty Hell .
While a brief and fleeting moment , Hello Kitty got to see what I live with 24 / 7 when I took those 5 sheets of toilet paper and used them as they should properly be used … I should have used more .
Update :
It should come as no surprise that the evil feline continues to come out with toilet paper in her image :

Stealing virtual goods is a crime , according to a ruling handed down by a judge in Leeuwarden , the Netherlands , this week .
The decision came in the case of a 16 - year - old boy charged with beating another teenager in the victim 's room and stealing virtual property .
On Sept. 6 last year the defendant forced the 13 - year - old victim to log in to RuneScape and hand over the money and virtual goods he possessed in the virtual world , according to the charges .
The victim resisted and ended up in a fight with the suspect and a friend who was also in the room .
The defendant was charged with kicking the victim's head and body and trying to strangle him .
The victim claims he was threatened with a knife and said he would have been killed if he did n't obey .
After the fight the defendant took the victim 's virtual money and goods , moved it to his account , then logged out , according to the charges .
The lawsuit only dealt with the theft of the goods -- a virtual amulet and a virtual mask in RuneScape -- but it 's the first time a judge in the Netherlands has ruled that the theft of virtual property is illegal and should be treated like stealing real - world objects .
It was clear the goods were stolen because the items were owned by the victim until the incident , after which the defendant had possession of the property , according to the judge , who ruled the goods have value .
The judge ruled that " goods do n't have to be material for the law to consider them stolen . "
The prosecutor demanded 180 hours of unpaid work or 90 days of jail time .
Although the defendant is denying the charges , the judge sentenced him to 160 hours of unpaid work , or jail time of 80 days .

Are you a green geek ?
Would you like to be one ?
There ’s always more we can do to help the environment , or at least reduce our environmental footprints .
Tina at MakeUseOf wrote a really good article about the meaning of environmental footprint and mentioned a lot of great non-technical steps we can take to reduce ours .
But what about us , geeks , living surrounded by machinery ?
What can we do ?
Well , the Green Festival was in Washington , DC recently , so I headed over and learned quite a bit while I was there .
This is going to be a three - part series , focusing on the three parts of being environmentally friendly : Reduce , Reuse , Recycle .
This one is focusing on reduction .
Purchasing Decisions
Power consumption is the biggest thing you can reduce .
Of course , buying an Energy Star - certified computer is a great first step .
But there ’s a great deal more you can do .
If you own many computers , how many of them do you really use at once ?
And how many are powered on at once ?
You probably do n’t need more than one system .
If you ’ve got a few running different OSes and you need access to each and every one of them , you can always use VirtualBox to virtualize each system under a single machine .
Do you still use a big CRT monitor ?
Ever notice how they have a tendency to build up static electricity and shock you when you touch the screen ?
They use a lot of power .
According to the LCD Industries Research Committee , switching from CRT to LCD means a significant reduction in power usage .
That ’s nice for the Earth , your wallet , and hey , you get a nice flatscreen .
But do n’t throw that old CRT away .
There ’s no reason for it to go into the landfill , and you ’ll see why in part two of this article .
When You ’re Gone
When you ’re away from your computer , do you leave it on ?
Some instant messaging services have the ability to send you messages you missed while signed off .
I believe AIM does this .
Your email will be there when you get back , too .
If you do n’t want to lose the system state by shutting down , why not suspend or hibernate your computer ?
And when you walk away , instead of a CPU and GPU intensive screensaver , how about just letting the screen turn off ?
Remember , the days of CRT burn - in are long gone , so having a screensaver really is n’t necessary .
Last month , Kiltak wrote here about phantom power , the usage of electricity by appliances which are turned off .
Your computer is one of those appliances , and since it is probably plugged into a power strip / surge protector , why not switch the strip off when you ’re not using your system ?
This will prevent it from gobbling all that energy uselessly
While You Work
There are plenty of other ways to lower your computer ’s power consumption while you ’re using it .
The less your CPU is doing , the less power it ’s drawing .
Turn off any CPU - instensive tasks running in the background .
If you use a laptop , try switching to a wired internet connection at home , and turn off your wireless card ( many laptops have a hardware kill - switch for wireless ) .
The wireless card , even when it ’s just scanning for beacons from nearby access points , is a major power drain .
One thing I do n’t understand is keeping the lights on at night when on the computer .
My mom would always ask why I ’m sitting in the dark , but really , the screen lights up , so why should I need another source of light ?
If the bright screen in a dark room hurts your eyes a bit ( I admit , it can be like staring at a lightbulb ) , well , take advantage of this next idea : lower the brightness settings on your monitor .
I find that having the brightness set to about half of what my laptop screen can do feels about right .
Intel created Less Watts so they could share power - saving tips with Linux users .
Yahoo !
Tech has some other tips for Windows as well .
On the Go
Oh , and here ’s a nice gift idea for a geek - on - the - go : solar power .
There are certain electronics that you really use the most when away from the desk , like an iPod or a PDA .
Well , you can use Solar Style ’s Solar Charger to charge any of those small electronics .
At $ 45 , it ’s not really a bad price .
And as of this writing , it ’s on sale on top of that .
If you want to be able to charge those gadgets while you ’re carrying them in your bag , try Noon Solar ‘s solar - charger purses and messenger bags .
Also , if you ’re carrying a laptop , PDA or some other electronic device with you all the time , why print anything out ?
Just save the document to your device , and you can help save a lot of trees .
Geek Fuel
Hey , and why not try to lower your own usage while we ’re at it ?
When you ’re sitting there , chowing down in front of the computer , try eating more eco-friendly food .
Try to avoid foods that come wrapped in plastic , paper , etc .
Papers contaminated with food waste , such as pizza boxes , cannot be recycled .
How about some locally grown fruit instead ?
A diet that focuses more on veggies and less on meat will also reduce your environmental footprint .
Reduce your Carbon Footprint and Save Money
The Daily Green has an excellent guide listing 30 ways you can save money by going green !
Check it out !
What other ways have you tried to reduce your consumption ?
Do you have a minimum lifespan for electronics before replacing them ?

There is a video of the talk , and a more comprehensive account of the associated shenanigans is included below .
The talk was controversial , and drew a mixture of boos and applause .
In a bar later that night , one of the other conference presenters tried to punch me , and he had to be restrained .
The talk challenges the digital art community to start making more meaningful and longer - lasting work , so that our creations may resonate more deeply with the rest of the ( non-technical ) world .
Beyond Flash is a talk I gave as the closing keynote of the 2008 “ Flash on the Beach ” conference ( now called “ Reasons to be Creative ” ) , in Brighton , UK .
Introduction
It is not often that I am invited to a Flash conference , and I seem to operate more on the periphery of the “ Flash community ” than from within it , so what I am about to say might be difficult for some to hear , but it has been on my mind for some time , and I feel it needs to be said .
I ’m going to talk about some things I have observed over the past eight years , and about some things I see as important going forward .
The evolution of new mediums
New mediums tend to evolve in more or less the same way .
They tend to begin with a spark , a technical innovation , usually coming from the fringe , often from the world of science .
At first there are just a handful of practitioners of the new medium , experimenting with and testing it .
Photography , film , and the Internet began this way .
The second stage is an awkward adolescence , defined by lots of groping .
Businesses grope with how to use the new medium to make money .
Hobbiests grope with how to use the new medium to have fun .
Artists grope with how to use the new medium to say something about the world .
In the third stage , a number of visionaries and virtuosos emerge , who have learned the new medium so completely that it has become an extension of themselves , and they are then capable of using it to produce incredible beauty , insights , or riches .
Robert Frank , Stanley Kubrick , or Steve Jobs would be good examples .
When I look at our medium , not just Flash but the broader world of online self - expression in general , it seems to me that we are still in the awkward adolescence ( which can be a good thing – think of the opportunity ! ) .
The importance ( and limitations ) of language
Language is basically a system for expressing ideas .
There are all sorts of languages .
There are obvious ones like English , Spanish , and Mandarin , and less obvious ones like dance , music , photography , film , politics , and programming .
Learning a language is important .
Without a language you cannot say anything , and I believe it is important for us as humans to speak and to say something .
But languages can be dangerous too , for they can become addicting , and it can be easy to forget that learning a language is not enough .
Once you have learned a language , then comes the far more difficult and far more important moment when you have to decide what to say .
And this might be the only decision that really matters .
Otherwise , you can end up like the schoolboy who spends his whole life memorizing the dictionary , occasionally forming the odd sentence , sometimes a paragraph , but never a poem or a play , not to mention a novel .
When I look at the Flash community today , I see too many of us who are stuck like that schoolboy .
And believe me , I 've been there too .
We speak a new and powerful language , capable of saying things no other language can say , but few have realized this , and even fewer have found what to say .
When I look around this room and see the audience , and some of the people who have graced this stage over the last few days , I see some of the most amazingly talented communicators alive today .
The blending of math , design , programming , physics , practicality and poetry is amazing .
We speak a language that is capable of producing messages that reach vast numbers of people , and that expresses those messages in ways never before possible .
I believe our community can create some of the great poets of the next 50 years .
The talent and potential is incredible and inspiring .
But I am saddened by how that talent and potential is being wasted .
Because I also see a community whose true capacity for self - expression is largely kept at bay by the people who pay our bills , expecting us to continue to pump out mediocre projects of other people ’s mediocre design .
There is incredible pressure , from clients , employers , and even companies like Adobe , to stay up to date with the latest and greatest developments to the technology .
This impulse is fine in spirit , but in practice , when the technology evolves so quickly , staying up to date becomes a full - time endeavor .
Furthermore , I see a community that is distracted by relentless experimentation ( experimentation is great , in moderation ) , constant tinkering ( tinkering is great too , in moderation ) , advertising , games , purely aesthetic design , but most of all by the dizzying evolution of technology .
Technology is just a language , just a tool .
And tools will always evolve .
There will always be stronger chainsaws , faster computers , newer plugins , better features , and the faster these improvements occur , the more distracting they can become .
But it is important to remember that tools are just the language – you still have to decide what you will use the language to say .
When I look at the Flash community , I see an incredible amount of output , a ton of production , but not a lot being said .
There have been no masterpieces
I define a masterpiece as a beautiful idea , fully realized , taken as far as it can go .
In my view , there have been no masterpieces yet in the online world , my own work included .
Time might prove me wrong , as masterpieces only reveal themselves with time , but this is my sense .
With a number of notable exceptions , most of the work I see coming from the Flash community is largely devoid of ideas .
There is great obsession with slickness , surface , speed , technology , and language , but very little soul at the core , very little being said .
I believe that in the long run , ideas are the only things that survive .
Questions
I know many of you might not agree with these claims , so I ’d like to pose a number of questions to help illustrate my frame of mind .
These are questions I often ask myself about my own work ( and to which I can rarely answer yes ) .
They are difficult questions , but I believe they are worth asking .
Can it make someone gasp or cry ?
Does it feel as special as a love letter ?
Does it truly represent our time ?
Will it still feel relevant in 25 years ?
Does it say something that ’s never been said before ?
Does it compare to the masterpieces of other mediums ?
Could it have gone further ?
Lessons
Finally , I ’d like to share a few insights I 've picked up along the way .
These are partly about work and partly about life .
Maybe you ’ll find them interesting or useful .
You will become known for doing what you do .
This may sound obvious , but it is a useful thing to realize .
Many people seem to think they must endure a " rite of passage " which , once passed , will allow them to do the kind of work they want to do .
Then they end up disappointed that this day never comes .
Find a way to do the work you want to do , even if it means working nights and weekends .
Once you 've done a handful of excellent things in a given way , you will become known as the person who does excellent things in that given way .
And that 's the person you want to be , because then people will hire you to be that person .
The personal is powerful .
Trust your own experience .
It ’s the only thing that ’s really yours , and that ’s really unique .
Putting yourself in your work can be powerful .
Do your own thing .
If you imitate , you ’ll only ever be a bad example of the thing you ’re trying to imitate .
An artist I like very much , Donald Judd , said that what you have to do is to find the same level of inventiveness as the person you ’re trying to imitate .
That does n’t mean you should n’t incorporate elements of other people ’s work .
As Picasso said : “ Bad artists copy ; great artists steal . ”
What he meant is that it can be OK to steal an idea from somewhere else , as long as you steal the idea and do something new with it , make it your own , and move on .
If you copy it outright you ’ll only get stuck in the past .
Ideas are the only things that survive .
Execution is important too ; a good idea poorly executed probably wo n’t go anywhere .
But if something is going to last , it ’s because there ’s a good idea at its core .
It ’s got to start with the idea .
Experience is the only way to learn .
Pain , joy , fear , risk , love , firsthand experience .
You can learn so much from these things , and the experience will end up affecting your work in ways you do n’t even realize .
But it ’ll be based on a real thing .
Only fools get trapped by tools .
Tools exist to serve you .
Not the other way around .
There is a long - standing unspoken pact between tools and their owners , which says that tools should disappear the moment you stop needing them .
This is the way that pencils , hammers , and leaf - blowers behave .
But many of our technological devices – iPods , cellphones , laptops , Blackberries – have violated this pact and overstepped their boundary , asserting themselves onto the lives of their owners , becoming constant distractions .
Do n't let your tools trap you .
Tools are not the idea .
Tools are tools .
Go outside .
It ’s important to get away from technology and experience the world .
You 've got to see your world , see your community , see what 's not being said what needs to be said .
That ’s probably the best way to figure out what you ’re going to say .
For me at least , it ’s impossible to have any good ideas while sitting behind a computer .
Ideas come from life .
As Hemingway said , “ I have to live to work . ”
Once you have learned how to speak , what will you say ?
This is really the central question .
If I can leave you with one idea from my talk , this would be it .
Postscript : a video of this talk is here .
Beyond Flash , An Addendum
After observing all the commotion my closing talk at last week ’s FOTB conference seems to have caused , I would like to clarify my intentions , my beliefs , and my message , in my own words .
On blogs and in bars , I have read and heard much speculation as to my motivation for giving this talk , and most of that speculation is wrong .
My objectives have been described as selfish , arrogant , myopic , unfeeling , unempathetic , close - minded , fame - seeking , intentionally controversial , and all sorts of other unsavory things , but the truth is that I gave this talk simply because I felt it needed to be given , and it was n’t clear to me whether anyone else was going to give it , or if so , when .
For some of the best traits of the “ Flash community ” – enthusiasm , playfulness , experimentation , and mutual support – can also become weaknesses , if overdone .
Too much enthusiasm can become an opiate , too much playfulness can inhibit serious thought , too much experimentation can distract from making finished works , and too much mutual support can lead to codependence .
As in all things , a balance is best .
But in the prevailing climate of blind positivity and technological exuberance , it seemed that a dissenting voice was missing and needed .
I believe the community of online artists / designers / creators , while still marginalized by the mainstream world ( my Mom , my sister , my neighbor ) , is approaching a moment when the work we create may be taken as seriously as novels , movies , music , photographs , and plays .
I believe our medium – the online medium – has the potential to become the next great way of processing and expressing our world .
Some would say it has already reached this point , but I believe it still inhabits an awkward adolescence , with no real virtuosos and no real masterpieces , and that the only way for it to mature is for its leaders and practitioners to push themselves to make better work , which will , in turn , reach a larger and less insular audience .
If the work is purely technological , it will be less likely to reach this larger audience , for it wo n’t resonate with as many people .
If it connects on a more human level , on the level of ideas , it stands a better chance of touching people deeply and spreading widely , like a Toni Morrison novel or a Steven Spielberg movie .
My reasons for wanting all this are partly selfish – it is my medium and I want it to flourish – but also inherently communal , as rising tides raise all ships .
I believe that everyone has something important to say ( even programmers ) , and my talk was aimed at reminding a community largely unaccustomed to expressing opinions and ideas through their work that doing so is possible , and will probably one day be common .
Of course this path is not for everyone .
There will be many who prefer to be purely technological pioneers , hired guns , salaried engineers , or weekend dabblers .
This is only natural , and these people play an important role too , especially in advancing technical innovation .
But there will be a few who love the idea that the poets of today and tomorrow can write beautiful and provocative poems in code and publish them online .
And this talk is really for them .
This talk is not meant to be scolding , condescending , or belittling to anyone in particular .
It is simply a challenge to myself and to my peers to keep pushing ourselves to make more meaningful and relevant work .
This talk is as much for me as it is for you .
And it comes from a place of ( admittedly tough ) love , from wanting to see all of our work be the best it can be .
Several people complained that the talk came across as rudely " professorial " , condescending , or arrogant .
I apologize if it did .
I was trying to talk straight .
And I 'm not a funny person .
So I humbly ask you to focus more on the message , and less on the delivery , which probably could have been better .
Several people asked for the slides from the talk , so I have posted them along with notes ( above ) on each slide , summarizing approximately what I said with each one .
Thanks for your time and interest .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Staring into the abyss always focuses the mind , which can help you avoid falling in .
So let 's take a look at the potential catastrophe that awaits us once we survive our current crisis .
At the dawn of the 21st century the U.S. had $ 5.7 trillion in total debt .
As we approach the end of George W. Bush 's presidency only eight years later , that sum has nearly doubled , thanks to war costs , tax cuts , spending increases , expanded entitlement programs , and now a welter of government bailouts and rescues .
This year was particularly bad .
The federal budget deficit for fiscal 2008 hit $ 455 billion , up from $ 162 billion last year .
That figure does not include the cost of the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 , which has an initial pricetag in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
In fairness , some of that money presumably will come back to the Treasury , since the new rescue - related sums will be used to acquire preferred stock , mortgages , and other assets that someday could be sold at a profit .
Yet any such calculations are penny ante compared with the fiscal disaster that is bearing down on America .
It 's no longer an event in the misty future .
It officially began earlier this year when teacher Kathleen Casey - Kirschling of Maryland became the first baby - boom retiree to collect Social Security benefits .
She will be followed by about 78 million more boomers over the next 17 years .
The entitlements due from Social Security and Medicare present us with that frightening abyss .
The costs of these current programs , along with other health - care costs , could bankrupt our country .
The abyss offers no assets , troubled or otherwise , to help us cross it .
Yes , some have suggested less - than - revolutionary measures that could help .
Among them : budget savings that would accrue from repealing the Bush - era tax cuts , ending the Iraq war , or expanding the economy after the current downturn runs its course .
But even if the economy were to grow at the level of 3.2 % a year , as it did in the 1990s , and these other savings were achieved , they would n't come close to addressing our federal financial problem .
Nor can we be complacent about timing .
The costs of these programs start to threaten our solvency in the next several years .
The only way to get across the chasm is to begin making tough choices now to change our current course .
Delay will make the problem worse .
In fact , the deteriorating financial condition of our federal government in the face of skyrocketing health - care costs and the baby - boom retirement could fairly be described as a super - subprime crisis .
It would certainly dwarf what we 're seeing now .
The U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , noting that the federal balance sheet does not reflect the government 's huge unfunded promises in our nation 's social - insurance programs , estimated last year that the unfunded obligations for Medicare and Social Security alone totaled almost $ 41 trillion .
That sum , equivalent to $ 352,000 per U.S. household , is the present - value shortfall between the growing cost of entitlements and the dedicated revenues intended to pay for them over the next 75 years .
Why call it a super - subprime crisis ?
Besides its gigantic scale , there are very disturbing similarities between the current mortgage - related crisis and our next potential disaster .
First , like the securitized investment vehicles that blew up , federal programs were launched without adequately thinking through who would bear the ultimate cost and related risk .
Just as originators of mortgages let themselves off the hook by unloading packages of dubious loans onto others , lawmakers have increased spending , expanded entitlement programs , and cut taxes while expecting future generations to pay the bill .
Second , just as a lack of transparency associated with mortgage - backed securities resulted in big surprises and large losses for investors , our nation 's huge off - balance - sheet obligations for Social Security and Medicare present a threat wrapped in camouflage .
After all , the government 's " trust funds " do n't really provide much security since they do n't hold anything but more government debt .
Third , in the same way that private sector " risk management " executives failed to prevent the subprime mortgage crisis , overseers in Congress and the executive branch have turned a blind eye to costs associated with entitlement programs and tax cuts .
While lax regulation of banks fed the current subprime crisis , a lack of statutory budget controls has led to a widening gap between the government 's revenues and costs .
At the heart of these problems is our leaders ' collective failure to act in the face of known challenges .
Our country has veered from its founding principles , which held to individual responsibility and accountability today in order to create more opportunity tomorrow .
When our constitution was written , the concepts of thrift and prudence were no less at the center of the American spirit than liberty and justice .
Erlang : A Generalized TCP Server
In my last few articles about Erlang we 've covered the basics of network programming with gen_tcp and Erlang / OTP 's gen_server , or generic server , module .
Let 's combine the two .
In most people 's minds " server " means network server , but Erlang uses the terminology in the most abstract sense .
gen_server is really a server that operates using Erlang 's message passing as its base protocol .
We can graft a TCP server onto that framework , but it requires some work .
The Structure of a Network Server
Most network servers have a similar architecture .
First they create a listening socket that listens for incoming connection .
They then enter an accept state in which they loop until termination , accepting each new connection as it arrives and starting the real client / server work .
To see this in action recall the simple echo server from my network programming article :
- module ( echo ) .
- author ( ' Jesse E.I. Farmer < jesse@20bits.com >' ) . - export ( [ listen /1 ] ) .
- define ( TCP_OPTIONS , [ binary , {packet , 0} , {active , false} , {reuseaddr , true} ] ) .
% Call echo:listen ( Port ) to start the service .
listen ( Port ) -> {ok , LSocket} = gen_tcp: listen ( Port , ? TCP_OPTIONS ) , accept ( LSocket ) .
%
Wait for incoming connections and spawn the echo loop when we get one .
accept ( LSocket ) -> {ok , Socket} = gen_tcp:accept( LSocket ) , spawn ( fun ( ) -> loop ( Socket ) end ) , accept ( LSocket ) .
% Echo back whatever data we receive on Socket. loop ( Socket ) -> case gen_tcp : recv( Socket , 0 ) of {ok , Data} -> gen_tcp:send ( Socket , Data ) , loop ( Socket ) ; {error , closed} -> ok end .
As you can see , listen creates a listening socket and immediately calls accept .
This waits for an incoming connection , spawns a new worker ( loop ) that does the real work , and then waits for the next incoming connection .
In this code the parent process owns both the listen socket and the accept loop .
As we 'll see this does n't work so well when we try to integrate the accept / listen loop with gen_server .
Abstracting The Network Server
Network servers come in two parts : connection handling and business logic .
As I described above the connection handling is basically the same for every network server .
Ideally we'd be able to do something like
- module ( my_server ) . start ( Port ) -> connection_handler:start( my_server , Port , business_logic ) . business_logic( Socket ) -> %
Read data from the network socket and do our thang .
Let 's go ahead and do just this .
Implementing A Generic Network Server
The problem with implementing a network server using gen_server is that the call to gen_tcp : accept is blocking .
If we were to call this in the server 's initialization routine , for example , the whole gen_server mechanism would block until a client connected .
There are two ways to get around this .
One involves using a lower - level connection mechanism that supports non-blocking ( or asynchronous ) accepting .
There are then a whole family of functions , most notably gen_tcp : controlling_process , that helps you manage who receives what messages when clients connect .
A simpler and , in my opinion , more elegant solution is to have a single process that owns the listening socket .
This process does two things : spawns new acceptors and listens for " connection received " messages .
When it receives a message it knows to spawn a new acceptor .
An acceptor is free to call the blocking gen_tcp : accept since it 's running in its own process .
When it receives a connection it fires an asynchronous message back to the parent process and immediately calls the business logic function .
Here 's the code .
I 've commented where appropriate , so hopefully it 's readable .
- module ( socket_server ) .
- author ( ' Jesse E.I. Farmer < jesse@20bits.com >' ) . - behavior ( gen_server ) . - export ( [ init / 1 , code_change /3 , handle_call/3 , handle_cast/2 , handle_info/2 , terminate / 2 ] ) . - export ( [ accept_loop /1 ] ) . - export ( [ start / 3 ] ) .
- define ( TCP_OPTIONS , [ binary , {packet , 0} , {active , false} , {reuseaddr , true} ] ) .
- record ( server_state , { port , loop , ip=any , lsocket=null} ) .
start ( Name , Port , Loop ) ->
State = # server_state {port = Port , loop = Loop} , gen_server : start_link ( {local , Name} , ?
MODULE , State , [ ] ) . init( State = # server_state{port=Port} ) -> case gen_tcp: listen ( Port , ? TCP_OPTIONS ) of {ok , LSocket} -> NewState = State#server_state{lsocket = LSocket} , {ok , accept ( NewState ) } ; {error , Reason} -> { stop , Reason} end .
handle_cast ( {accepted , _ Pid} , State=#server_state{} ) -> {noreply , accept ( State ) }. accept_loop ( {Server , LSocket , { M , F}} ) -> {ok , Socket} = gen_tcp:accept( LSocket ) , % Let the server spawn a new process and replace this loop % with the echo loop , to avoid blocking gen_server : cast ( Server , {accepted , self ( ) } ) , M:F( Socket ) . %
To be more robust we should be using spawn_link and trapping exits accept ( State = # server_state{lsocket=LSocket , loop = Loop} ) -> proc_lib : spawn (?MODULE , accept_loop , [ {self ( ) , LSocket , Loop} ] ) , State . %
These are just here to suppress warnings .
handle_call( _Msg , _ Caller , State ) -> {noreply , State} . handle_info( _Msg , Library ) -> {noreply , Library} . terminate ( _Reason , _ Library ) -> ok .
code_change( _OldVersion , Library , _ Extra ) -> {ok , Library} .
We use gen_server : cast to pass asynchronous messages back to the listening process .
When the listening process receives the message accepted it spawns a new acceptor .
Right now this server is not very robust because if the active acceptor fails , for whatever reason , the server will stop accepting connections .
To make it more OTP - like we should be trapping exits and firing off a new acceptor in the event that a connection fails .
A " Generic " Echo Server
The echo server is the easiest server to write , so let 's do it using our new abstract socket server .
- module ( echo_server ) .
- author ( ' Jesse E.I. Farmer < jesse@20bits.com >' ) .
- export ( [ start / 0 , loop / 1 ] ) . % echo_server specific code start ( ) -> socket_server :start (?
MODULE , 7000 , {? MODULE , loop} ) .
loop ( Socket ) -> case gen_tcp : recv( Socket , 0 ) of {ok , Data} -> gen_tcp:send ( Socket , Data ) , loop ( Socket ) ; {error , closed} -> ok end .
As you can see the " server " becomes nothing more than its business logic .
The connection handling has been generalized and pushed off into its own socket_server .
The loop in our generic server is actually identical to the loop in our original echo server , too .
Hopefully you all can learn from this as much as I did .
I finally feel like I 'm starting to understand Erlang .
Also , feel free to leave a comment , especially if you have any thoughts on how I can improve my code .
Cheers !
note :
There seems to have been a WordPress bug .
For some reason , the extended release notes on OCaml Batteries Included were replaced by something quite unrelated .
My apologies for this .
Dear programmers , I am happy to inform you that the second alpha release of OCaml Batteries Included has landed .
You may now download it from the Forge .
A GODI package is also available and a Debian package should follow soon ( you should be able to find the old one here ) and you can read the documentation on - line .
So , what ’s new in this release ?
Documentation
All the quirks , bugs and erroneous links which plagued the documentation of Alpha 1 should now be gone .
Documentation has been extended , with more explanations regarding the use of Input / Output , more explanations on common functions of Pervasives , etc .
The top - level now has a on - line help feature .
You should try it , it ’s nice .
New examples , including an 8 - liner gzip .
Toolchain
The top - level now works .
We now have a custom version of ocaml , ocamlc , ocamlopt and ocamlcp .
To invoke them , use ocamlfind .
For instance , for the new top - level , invoke ocamlfind batteries / ocaml .
This should make your life simpler if you do n’t use OCamlBuild .
Fundamentals
Improved Input / Output .
In particular , inputs and outputs may now be garbage - collected , automatically closed by higher - order functions , closed manually , closed by their dependencies , or closed automatically when program stops .
Speed of key I/O operations was also largely improved .
We now have a set of standard combinators for function composition .
You wo n’t need anymore to redefine your |> , < | , etc .
Numerous improvements to Unicode , including improved type - safety , Unicode characters on par with Latin - 1 characters , etc .
We are now very close to being completely rid of legacy channel_in and channel_out , in favor of the more abstract , more composable , safer and more feature - rich IO .
In particular , the Unix module and the Standard module are now completely rid of these pesky channels .
Utilities
We now have transparent on - the - fly gzip compression / decompression — more formats are coming .
A nice little parser combinator library has been added .
It works with either Latin - 1 , Unicode or custom tokens .
An OCaml program may now open a web browser to display a URI .
In the future , this will be extended to opening arbitrary files with system - specific tools .
Appearance of a foreach loop ( which is actually nothing more than Enum.iter , but we do n’t have to tell that to beginners ) .
Boilerplate
Most data structures now support serialization to / deserialization from S - Expressions .
Most data structures now support printing to arbitrary outputs .
What now ?
Well , now , we ’d appreciate if you could download and install this library .
We ’d appreciate if you could test your programs against it .
And we ’d appreciate if you could file bug reports and request for features .
What ’s next ?
We ’re already at work on the next version .
Here ’s an overview of what you can expect in the relatively near future :
Re-designed , simpler , module hierarchy ( by the way , if you have suggestions , please drop us a line ) .
More syntax extensions , including the long - awaited finally .
Exception - less error management in addition to exceptions .
More on - the - fly ( de ) compression formats .
Further documentation .
Bindings for Camlp4 .
Unicode transcoding I/O .
Further examples .
In - memory ( de ) compression .
File and directory management .
Shell programming .
Pattern - matching on lazy lists .
List ( and other data structures ) comprehension .
Compatibility with OCaml 3.11 .

MSNBC is reporting that John Decker was bitten by Bush 's little doggie .
Arf !
Come on , that 's not a story .
Reporter bites dog ... nowa story !
I have been continuing very slowly with my Haskell blog .
Yesterday I properly pulled out the Django - inspired framework I am writing alongside it , and called it Ella , after another jazz genuis ( though a vocalist — I much prefer vocal jazz ) .
There were a number of reasons I did n’t like the existing Haskell CGI package , but one of the biggest was the lack of explicit request and response objects .
Instead of that it did everything inside a CGI monad , which makes it impossible to do things like reusable pre-processing of the request and post - processing of the response , both of which I will want to be able to do .
I wanted something much more in the style of Django , with explicit request and response objects , something , ironically , much more functional instead of imperative — it is a surprise that I got this from a Python web framework .
There were also things about the CGI API itself I really did n’t like ( e.g. did n’t differentiate between GET and POST inputs ) .
Plus , I wanted to have a go at some real Haskell , so I rolled my own .
It is very early days at the moment , and many big things are missing from the API ( like proper access to GET and POST parameters , handlers for file uploads , any kind of HTML helpers for form handling etc ) .
I realised that the API for all of that should only be implemented as I needed it in my actual software , otherwise I would just get it wrong .
What is implemented so far is a strongly - typed routing mechanism , and not much more .
It is enough , though , to implement a useful app — I wrote a very simple 80 - line script that handles ( via clickable URLs in emails ) subscription to a personal mailing list I ’m organising for myself .
It also acts as an example at the moment — see ConfirmCgi.hs
Currently there is no home page , though there is some good documentation , and you can get the source .
All of the API is subject to change at any time , but I think what I ’ve done so far is a reasonable basis .
Oh my God , does no one see this for the scam that it is ?
Right now , Tucker argues , most American teenagers slide through high school , viewing it as a mandatory pit stop to hang out and socialize .
Of those who do go to college , half attend community college .
So Tucker 's thinking is why not let them get started earlier ?
New Hampshire announces plans for a set of state board exams for 10th graders -- think the French -- which would allow those who want to to graduate high school two years early and go on to technical , community or regular college .
Those who want to may still follow a traditional 12th grade curriculum , and then go onto college .
1 . New Hampshire is too far for me to go and start punching people .
2 .
Let me understand : high school is mostly pointless , so the solution you 've come up with is not to improve it , but to graduate them faster .
If you think there 's an education gap between rich and poor kids now , wait until this passes .
You think rich kids will -- will beto -- do this ?
This is for poor kids , bored , disinterested and looking to get out , and it legitimizes it , depriving them of two years of high school .3 .
This is Bizarro Robin Hood , this is a massive transfer of wealth from individuals to the state .
Think about the type of kid who would leave high school after 10th grade and aactually go on to college .
Is he going to Harvard ?
No , he 's going to a state school .
Do you think an at - average student , with two yearshigh school , is going to finish college in four ?
So here we have a system where a kid is going to leave a free school to go to a college he has to pay for , for longer .
The state saves two years on high school -- $ 60 billion , nationally -- and gets an extra year out of the college tuition .
I do n't need to point out that tuition is going up , faster than the inflation rate ?
Especially at state schools ?
These people do n't care about students , they care about themselves .
That 's why they want to remove teacher accountability .
Why , in bold red 20pt font in the sidebar of the report is the description of how , with all the money they 'll save , they can pay teachers up to $ 110 k a year .
4 .
Do n't tell me it will reduce dropout rates -- that 's a scam , too .
They 've simply been graduated .
5 . Reducing the number of years in school is actually a great idea , but you 're reducing the wrong years .
If they really wanted to help " " -- see ?
that 's what they think of you , what they think high school education is for -- then they should try to find a way to make high school so good that you need less .
But where 's the money in that ?
A real solution would be to cut college down to 2 years .
Or even zero : straight to professional school or work .
College is reducing our country 's productivity and infantilizing young adults .
Hi .
Is this thing on ?----
