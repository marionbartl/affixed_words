French president says ' guns must fall silent ' before Tel Aviv can strike deal on new border terms with UN 's backing
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , today led intensifying international efforts to force a ceasefire in Gaza , despite Israel insisting it was not yet ready to call a halt to its eight - day offensive .
Signs have begun to emerge of the shape of a potential deal on a truce and new border arrangements , though analysts said these were still unlikely to be agreed quickly .
Sarkozy flew to Israel after a meeting with the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , about the Gaza crisis .
After talks in the West Bank town of Ramallah , the French leader said he would tell Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , that " violence must stop " .
" We in Europe want a ceasefire as quickly as possible , and that everyone understands that time is running against peace , " Sarkozy said .
" The guns must fall silent , there must be a humanitarian truce .
Everyone must understand that what is at stake here is not just an issue of Israel and Palestinians , it is a global issue and it is the whole world which will help you find a solution . "
Egypt also invited a delegation from Hamas , the Islamist movement fighting Israel , to visit Cairo .
Such a visitwould be Hamas 's first contact with a key regional player since fighting began 10 days ago .
Sarkozy will tomorrow go on to Syria , Hamas 's main Arab supporter .
In other signs of frantic activity , diplomats said Turkey was playing a significant role behind the scenes .
Ankara has already publicly offered to convey any Hamas ceasefire proposal to the UN .
It is understood senior Turkish officials met the leaders of Hamas and the smaller , more militant Islamic Jihad faction in Damascus last week .
Both are boycotted as terrorists by all western countries .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Turkish prime minister , is trusted by Hamas because of his Islamist credentials .
" The Turks have been talking to all the right people , " said one diplomat based in the region .
" They are seen as a neutral broker .
They are professional and sincere . "
Underlining the role played by Turkey , Syria sent its foreign minister , Walid al - Mualim , to Ankara today .
" I came to discuss ways to bring about an immediate ceasefire , a removal of the [ Israeli ] blockade and the opening of all crossings , as well as finding a mechanism to achieve these goals , " he said after talks with Ali Babacan , his Turkish counterpart .
In a further development , the UN 's special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process , Robert Serry , was summoned to New York where Arab countries were drafting a security council resolution demanding an immediate end to " Israeli aggression " in Gaza .
With UN forces already deployed on Israel 's borders with Syria and Lebanon , one possibility being mooted is creating a new one for the border between Gaza and Egypt .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , is flying to New York tomorrow to take part in the UN debate on the crisis .
" If Sarkozy has something that can pass the security council then the pressure may start on both sides , " Ali Jarbawi , a professor of political science at Birzeit University , told the bitterlemons.org website .
But there are signs that hard bargaining lies ahead .
Israel wants its offensive to end with an agreement imposed on Gaza by the international community rather than a new ceasefire directly with Hamas .
" We do n't sign agreements with terror , " Tzipi Livni , the foreign minister , insisted after meeting an EU delegation yesterday .
" We fight terror . "
Israel wants Egypt to prevent smuggling into Gaza from its border and its crossings into the territory operating under international supervision .
It insists on the presence of the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , run by Abbas 's West Bank - based Fatah movement , Hamas ' bitter rival .
" The international community will initiate the agreements and impose it on Hamas , " the Ha'aretz newspaper quoted a senior political source in Jerusalem as saying .
" The agreements will be with both the PA and Egypt and then if Hamas will not agree it will pay the price , mostly by even greater isolation . "
Israel has suggested the US might help Egypt by sending combat engineers to reinforce the border .
As well as EU and PA officials deployed at the Rafah crossing into Egypt , as in the past , it also wants US , French and Arab support for a UN - backed resolution granting Israel the right to respond to any Hamas violations .
Above all , it wants to avoid a situation under which Hamas could rearm after a ceasefire , as Lebanon 's Hezbullah was able to do soon after the end of the 2006 war .
Under a 2005 agreement , Rafah can only be opened to normal traffic if EU observers and PA forces are at the border , which is also monitored by Israel .
But the PA presence ended when Hamas took over Gaza from Fatah in June 2007 .
The challenge now will be to find a way to allow them back at a time that relations between the two factions are at a nadir .
Western diplomats said the US , EU and Arab League were now looking at a four - point agenda :
• Stopping arms smuggling into Gaza
• Financial support for Egypt in controlling the border and detecting tunnels
• International monitoring , with the UN , EU and Arab forces assisting Egypt
• Reopening of all crossing points into the Gaza Strip - a key Hamas demand .
Further signs of a mounting international backlash against Israel came with an unusally strong condemnation from Saudi Arabia .
" The international position is feeble in dealing with unprecedented Israeli violations , " said a cabinet statement .
" To say that Israeli barbarity is self - defence is to close one 's eyes to the history of Israeli occupation and settlement of Palestinian territories , practices of closure and terror , and the massive imbalance in power between the two sides , " it said .
Mauritania said it was recalling its ambassador to Tel Aviv for consultations .
Egypt and Jordan , the only two other Arab countries which have peace treaties with Israel , have strongly condemned the Gaza offensive .
Posted on the Libertarian Party of Colorado blog :
An investigation into the arrest of nearly 100 protesters on the first night of the Democratic National Convention revealed no “ provable ” police misconduct , the city ’s Office of the Independent Monitor said today .
Rocky Mountain News :
No police misconduct found in arrest of DNC protesters
Wow , who would have thought that when the police investigate the actions of the police they would have trouble finding any wrongdoing .
Maybe they did not do anything wrong , but really , can the findings of a self investigation really be trusted ?
Fallow highly recommends reading " America 's Defense Meltdown " ( pdf ) .
Here 's a bit from Chapter 11 : Understand , Then Contain America 's Out - Of - Control Defense Budget :
... it is not that the defense budget adequately supports our irrelevant , even counterproductive forces .
For that to be the case would be a significant improvement .
Instead , to promote armed forces that fight the wrong type of war in the wrong places  liberals , moderates and conservatives in the Pentagon , Congress , think tanks and the White House have over time constructed an edifice that makes our forces smaller , older and less ready to fight , all at dramatically increasing cost .
And , we have done so with a system that , quite literally , does not know  or apparently care  what it is doing .
There are 271 more pages where that came from .
It 's just as well we face no serious global rival , is n't it ?

One of these sets of carrots is illegal to sell
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
Regulations that stop strange - shaped fruit and vegetables being sold are being changed by the European Union .
But are we willing to eat wonky veg ?
When you see a carrot with two prongs , a knobbly potato or a blemished strawberry , does your stomach turn ?
Are you transported back to memories of That 's Life by the slightest morphological oddity in anything you eat ?
HAD WONKY VEG ?
SEND YOUR PICS E-mail : yourpics@bbc.co.uk , subject WONKY MMS from UK : 61124 Int MMS : +44 7725 100100
Terms and conditions
If so , you are not going to like what the European Commission ( EU ) is now doing .
" Marketing standards " for 26 vegetables are being repealed .
If there has been one truly effective stick to beat the EU with over the years , it has been the bizarre and Byzantine reams of regulation it is accused of promulgating .
The classic anti-EU story is that " faceless eurocrats " were banning the curved cucumber .
It was all the more powerful for having a solid basis in truth .
Namely , Commission Regulation ( EEC ) No 1677 / 88 of 15 June 1988 .
Blemishes and discolourations Class I cucumbers must " be reasonably well shaped and practically straight ( maximum height of the arc : 10 mm per 10 cm of the length of cucumber ) " .
Class II " slightly crooked cucumbers may have a maximum height of the arc of 20 mm per 10 cm of length of the cucumber " .
These are allowed to have some blemishes and discolourations .
Any cucumber more crooked must be packed separately and must be otherwise cosmetically perfect .
This potato is said to be one of the tastiest , but would you eat it ?
So if a cucumber is crooked and has a blemish on it , it can not be sold in a shop or market .
It is allowed to go for processing , but often the cost of transport to a manufacturer is prohibitive and the produce is simply allowed to rot .
Carrots are in the same boat .
Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 730/1999 of 7 April 1999 says they must be " not forked , free from secondary roots " .
Commission Regulation ( EC )
No 85/2004 of 15 January 2004 , any apple under 50 mm in diameter or 70g in weight cannot be sold .
Every year tonnes of perfectly - edible produce across the EU is thrown away so that when you walk into the supermarket all you see is rank after serried rank of cosmetically perfect fruit and vegetables .
The first regulations were introduced across the EU in the 1980s and have been amended and supplemented since .
Amusing carrots Michael Mann , the European Commission 's Agriculture spokesman , notes that when the rules on fruit and vegetable standards were brought in 20 years ago the eurocrats were not inventing a new category of regulation , but merely seeking to standardise already existing laws across Europe .
And of course , member states have been responsible for deciding how to police and punish the fruit laws .
HOW RULES WILL CHANGE Rules for 26 fruit and vegetable scrapped Rules for 10 retained But sub - rule produce can be sold in shops if labelled as " for processing " or similar formulation Scrapped 26 are : Apricots , artichokes , asparagus , aubergines , avocadoes , beans , brussels sprouts , cauliflowers , cherries , courgettes , cucumbers , cultivated mushrooms , garlic , hazelnuts in shell , headed cabbage , leeks , melons , onions , peas , plums , ribbed celery , spinach , walnuts in shell , watermelons , witloof chicory 10 retained are : Apples , citrus fruit , kiwi fruit , lettuces and endives , peaches and nectarines , pears , strawberries , sweet peppers , table grapes , tomatoes " We would n't encourage people to come down too heavily on people selling amusing carrots , " says Mr Mann .
In the UK , enforcement is administered by the Rural Payments Agency .
They deal with breaches of the marketing standards mainly by educating and warning the offending traders and suppliers , but there are " four or five " prosecutions a year .
Rotten produce for sale may be more likely to result in action than oddities of shape , but it remains the case that both are against the law .
Only in June , a trader in Bristol was stopped by the RPA from selling 520 kiwi fruit that were slightly too small .
In recent years , even supermarkets have been kicking against the regulations .
Waitrose launched an " ugly " range of Class II produce for jam - making and cooking in 2006 .
More recently Sainsbury 's withdrew a promotion of discount Halloween - themed vegetables , saying they had realised managers could get a criminal record for selling non-standard produce .
The supermarket also launched a campaign to " Save our Ugly Fruit and Veg " .
It estimated that , to take one example , 20 % of British onion production is wasted because it fails to meet the standards .
They lobbied EU Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel over the issue .
But Ms Boel already decided some time ago that the marketing standards had to be radically changed .
By next summer , once member states have had time to put the changes into effect , wonky veg will be on supermarket shelves .
That is not to say , of course , that consumers will be rushing to buy this imperfect produce .

Supermarkets are frequently blamed for pushing standardisation .
Varieties are chosen for their durability or their appearance , and if size and shape are uniform , packaging is easier to make .
" People have been brainwashed into believing everything has to be a uniform size , " says Geoff Stokes , secretary of the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners .
" It has always struck me as more to do with the supermarkets wanting to package things easier , if everything is the same shape and the same size , " But we 've had years of cosmetically perfect vegetables .
And the supermarkets which have chosen to sell only the most aesthetically pleasing items might argue they were only serving the desires of their customers .
And how many people always pick the cheaper , less cosmetically pleasing , Class II vegetables when they 're out shopping ?
Avoiding waste
If there 's anything that can break our conditioning for liking regular - shaped vegetables , it 's the current economic climate and the increasing awareness of the environmental cost of food production .
" The idea is to avoid waste , " says Mr Mann .
" Economic times are hard .
Why should n't people be allowed to go into supermarkets and get apples that are smaller and cheaper ? "
The looming recession could well spark a market for misshapes when the law changes next summer , says Michael Barker , fresh foods correspondent of the Grocer magazine .
" When people are short of money the last thing we want to be doing is to be restricting the amount of fruit and vegetables we can sell .
It may be stuff with blemishes , slightly misshapen , not that there 's anything wrong with it .
" There is all sorts of anecdotal evidence that people are really much more interested in the authenticity and heritage at the moment . "
Cookery shows have started paving the way for wonky veg , with many emphasising taste over presentation , realness over blandness and variety over conformity .
The regulations that are being repealed say nothing about taste .
But once prejudices are set to one side , that is probably what most people want from their produce , however knobbly .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I think its about time this stupid rule is abandoned .
I grow my own veg , and grew some Pink Fir Apple spuds , which are all lumpy and knobbly ( and take a little more time and trouble to prepare as , horror of horrors , they are all dirty ! ) , but they were really tasty , because they were grown in real dirty dirt , not some worn out over - farmed sandy soil , and then pumped full of chemical fertilizers and tonnes of water .
Some of my carrots ' forked ' , but we still ate them .
In no way was the quality impaired .
Every time I go into Tesco its like looking at a Village Hall annual vegetable show .
Everything is perfect .
And considering how much fertilizer the farmers are putting on their fields , which washes into the rivers as Nitrates and Phosphates ( an environmental nightmare ) , for them to then turn round and dump perfectly good food , is absolutely scandalous .
I think people have forgotten how hard it was even 50 years ago , when wonky veg was quite often the norm , and we as a people wasted far less than we do now .
Kev Girling , Cotton , Suffolk I think people who do n't eat something just because it " looks a bit different " are pathetic .
So long as it does n't glare at me or say " hello " , I 'll happily eat just about anything , be it wonky , discoloured or " out of date " ... setting standards is just purely wasteful .
Laura Harman , Sheffield To a Canadian used to shopping at a local farmers ' market , this is all extremely silly .
If it 's edible and not a health risk , what 's wrong with eating it ?
A little variety in texture , shape or colour just makes it more interesting on your plate .
If it 's trickier to ship , that 's up to whoever 's paying for the shipping ; I can't see why regulation is needed .
Kevin , Kitchener , Ontario , Canada
Yes , lets have all wonky fruit and veg on sale .
It is stupid to only sell fruit and veg that looks perfect .
I am only interested in quality and price and not the shape .
Marina McGuire , West Drayton , Middlesex , England
This obsession with the shape of vegetables has led to a paucity of choice and a complete lack of taste in those vegetables that are available .
I find it difficult to blame the EU , however , as there is never a problem finding decent food in France and Spain .
Vegetables are all shapes and sizes , and often more damaged than in the UK .
Their taste , however , is far superior .
These days , I am more likely to bring home meat , cheese , fruit and veg from my holiday than booze .
Luckily we have a camper and can stock up .
Helen , Bournemouth , England I 'm so glad this ban has been lifted .
I really do n't like to see food wasted .
It 's curious that , although this is an EU ruling , I 've noticed whenever I 'm in Spanish supermarkets ( especially in rural areas ) , the fruit and veg is all sorts of weird and wonderful shapes and sizes , which I have always liked ( and they taste better ) .
Sue Uttley , Sheffield Food is food and is going to end up in the same place .
As we live on a budget we do n't really care about shape more the price / kg .
But it 's nice to hear we 'll be able to buy amusingly shaped vegetables .
Overall a good thing if it reduces food wastage even before the end consumer has had a chance to chose .
Duncan Smallman , Edinburgh
This is discrimination .
Fruit and vegetables have feelings too !
You can't judge them on the way they look or the way their shaped .
Equal rights for food !!

Ice build - up may squeeze greenhouse gas from cold soil .
As the Arctic tundra freezes it releases more methane .
Punchstock
As the autumn cold begins to bite in the Arctic tundra , the freezing ground releases a large and unexpected burst of methane into the air .
The emissions , thought to be squeezed out by the growth of surface frost , match up with an atmospheric methane surge that had previously gone unexplained .
Scientists already knew that microbes breaking down organic debris in the northern wetlands emit considerable amounts of the greenhouse gas methane , a process that has been carefully measured for decades during the growing season .
But it was widely assumed that methane production drops to nearly nothing over the winter , because colder soil can absorb more methane and falling temperatures slow the decay processes .
So the research teams that maintain automated methane - monitoring stations in high northern latitudes tended to abandon them around September , explains Torben Christensen , a biogeochemist at Lund University in Sweden .
But last year , as part of the research push for the International Polar Year , a field station in northeastern Greenland stayed open two months later than usual .
In those months , Christensen and his colleagues measured cumulative emissions as large as those recorded over the summer – with peak rates at some collection points higher than had ever been seen in tundra ( see ' A sudden surge of methane ' ) .
" I would have predicted the exact opposite finding , " says Merritt Turetsky , a tundra expert from the University of Guelph , Canada , who was not involved in the study .
If all wet meadow tundras release a similar methane burst , the authors estimate , a previously unanticipated 4 million tonnes of the gas may be emitted each winter .
That amount would not affect established estimates that Arctic wetlands release 30 million to 100 million tonnes of the gas annually .
But the finding , reported this week in Nature1 , fills a formerly puzzling gap .
Strange hump
Atmospheric scientists measuring methane above the Arctic always saw an unexplained rise in methane levels around autumn , says Edward Dlugokencky of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , a co-author of the paper .
When the researchers updated models of methane production with emissions from freezing soils throughout high northern latitudes , the results replicated the seasonal emissions hump .
The freezing process itself may squeeze out the surprising burst , the team suggests .
As cold sets in , methane - saturated soil is sandwiched between spreading frost at the surface and a floor of permafrost below .
Under pressure , the gas could escape via plant stems and roots , which perforate the layers like chimneys , says Christensen .
This is a far cry from the simple relationship between methane production and temperature usually used to model emissions , Turetsky notes .
Chris Field , an ecologist from the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Stanford , California , suggests an alternative mechanism , pointing out that an icy ceiling could block oxygenation of the soil , encouraging slow , methane - producing decay in the unfrozen layer , as opposed to the respiration processes that produce carbon dioxide in well - oxygenated soil .
" It seems to me that we do n't exactly know the relative contribution of the squeezing mechanism they describe , compared with changes in the oxygen concentration , and the continued activity of the microorganisms that are still active in the non-frozen parts of the soil profile , " says Field .
" None of those explanations are inconsistent with the data they present . "
ADVERTISEMENT
But whatever the mechanism behind the new results , says Field , they add detail to geochemical models of Arctic processes .
" One of the really important things we 've learned about high - latitude processes over the last decade is that clearly a lot of stuff happens during what we had considered to be the wintertime , when everything is frozen and shut down . "
Pinning down such details of the natural methane cycle , adds Christensen , could help to predict how climate change - induced thawing in the Arctic may release dangerous amounts of the greenhouse gas .
" This will help us understand the starting point for those types of changes . "
Since the App Store launched this past summer , it was odd to me that none of the big social - voting sites have launched iPhone apps .
Sure , all work on the iPhone ’s Safari web browser , and some , like Digg , are even optimized for it , but given how devoted some of those sites ’ users are , it would seem logical to create slick apps for the services .
Now there is one — unofficially — for Reddit .
The app , made by developer Joseph Pintozzi , showcases the most popular stories on Reddit at any given time in a view optimized for the iPhone .
It ’s pretty nice , the main page shows the top headlines and clicking on any of them loads the actual story in the Reddit app ’s own browser .
Clicking on the blue arrows to the right of the headline gives you more options such as seeing all the comments on a story and which Reddit user submitted it .
In fact , the Reddit iPhone app only seems to lack one thing : Voting !
Well , technically you can vote if you view the comments on the story and scroll up to the main headline and push the up or down arrow ( how you vote on Reddit ) .
You ’ll have to log in of course , and really this is just the same as using reddit.com in the web browser .
There should be an easy way to vote right within the app , but since it ’s not official , Reddit likely is n’t allowing you to do that .
[ Update below . ]
But it should .
The company announced over the summer that it was open - sourcing its service so that developers could help make it better .
So far , not much has come of this , but a full - featured Reddit iPhone app with voting functionality would be a great start .
I ’ve contacted Reddit about the app , but have yet to hear back .
Update : Pintozzi writes on the application ’s App Store page that “ the ability to vote on a submission is currently being added . ”
Nice !
Also a bit frustrating is while there is some “ Subreddit ” support , that is , topic - specific Reddit pages , only the most popular ones are currently supported .
But more Subreddit support is coming , according to the application ’s App Store page .
It ’s nice to see at least one of the social voting sites finally get an iPhone app .
Now , where ’s the Digg app ?
The Reddit app is $ 0.99 in the App Store .
We need to do more to get children outside to explore and learn about their natural world .
And we need an environmentally literate citizenry to face the challenges posed in the 21st Century .
That means making sure that Congress passes the No Child Left Inside Act , legislation that ensures that more children receive high - quality lessons at school about the environment and environmental challenges .
The Act would provide much - needed new funding to help states provide teacher training and expand high - quality environmental education programs .
Environmental lessons will engage kids with the great outdoors and foster a lifelong appreciation of the environment .
Please sign the on - line petition below urging Congress to pass the NCLI Act .

Scientists from Sweden claim death rate for golfers is 40 per cent lower than for other people of the same sex , age and socioeconomic status , which correspond to a 5 year increase in life expectancy .
Golfers with a low handicap ( i.e. the best golfers ) are the safest .
Golf and impact on health
It is a well - known fact that exercise is good for the health , but the expected health gains of particular activities are still largely unknown .
A team of researchers from Karolinska Institute has now presented a study of the health effects of golf a low - intensity form of exercise .
The study shows that golf has beneficial health effects .
The death rate amongst golfers is 40 per cent lower than the rest of the population , which equates to an increased life expectancy of five years .
There are several aspects of the game that are proved to be good for the health .
According to the researcher , a round of golf means being outside for four or five hours , walking at a fast pace for six to seven kilometers and that is known to be good for the health .
People play golf into old age , and there are also positive social and psychological aspects to the game that can be of help .
The study does not rule out that other factors than the actual playing , such as a generally healthy lifestyle , are also behind the lower death rate observed amongst golfers .
However , the researchers believe it is likely that the playing of the game in itself has a significant impact on health .
Benefits of golf
Golf and exercise
Golf is a game that burns up calories , reduces cholesterol and can reduce stress .
It is great for keeping you in trim .
Everyone knows that walking is the most fundamental of all exercise programs .
So it makes sense that walking a golf course would be considered good for you .
Every round that ’s played makes one walk between four and eight miles , and burns around a thousand calories .
Cardiovascular work out
Brisk walking is known to increase cardiovascular capacity , improve your lung capacity and your blood flow .
When playing golf , heart rate pumps away at between 90 and 120 beats per minute .
This low intensity workout is perfect for gently burning off fat .
Even the simple act of swinging club or bending down to place a ball on its tee or pick up a ball helps keep joints supple and muscle groups in trim .
Mental health
Playing golf is not just physically good , but it also releases powerful , natural , mood enhancing drugs called endorphins into the bloodstream .
It offers a mental challenge .
Counting endless shots , working out the Stableford score or just calculating yardages and club selection are all mental exercises .
Find new friends
Golf is a social game , a chance to get to know someone better , that 's why so many business people play golf .
A round of golf can take around four hours where individual differences disappear as playing the game becomes the common focus .
Most golfers play with family or friends but most are happy to join up with a single golfer to make a three or four ball group .
Also , the etiquette and rules of golf encourage care and respect of others and the course .
Sleep better
Study after study has shown that regular exercise increases the positives that sleep brings .
You ’ll fall asleep faster and remain in a deep sleep for a longer period of time with regular exercise , which includes activities like golf .
Sleep is important because it allows time for your muscles to repair themselves .
Playing a round of golf by day will likely increase the quality of your restfulness by night .
A great leveler
Golf is a great leveler - its handicapping system is designed in such a way that enables the beginner to play competitively against the highly skilled .
There are not many sports where one can compete fairly against the super star !
Good for the course
Walking a golf course is a good thing to do for the sake of the course itself - it saves wear - and - tear and damage to sensitive areas , which creates a better golfing environment .
Suggestions for people not yet in shape
Walk alternate holes during a round , so that by the end of your round you 've walked nine holes .
Walk one set of nines , ride the other .
If you are at a course that requires carts , walk down the fairway to your ball while your partner brings the cart up .
If playing with a partner who rides , ride only on the cart path and walk to and from the cart to your ball on every hole .
Advice for avoiding injuries :
Stretch at least three times a week , paying particular attention to your back , shoulders , and arms .
Be sure to warm - up for 10 - 15 minutes before play .
Take lessons .
Good technique is your best defense against injuries .
Use good equipment including shoes , socks , gloves , and clothing .
Spot problems early and treat them aggressively .
Ice down aching tissues directly after playing .
Use the PRICE ( protection , rest , ice , compression , and elevation ) approach to treat more serious problems , and get help from a professional if you do n't improve promptly .

Conclusion
Golf provides a stimulating challenge combined with a healthy walk in pleasant surroundings and can be played by people of all abilities and ages .
Playing golf regularly can help you stay fit , improve muscle tone and endurance , and lose weight and body fat .
Also , it is a very social and enjoyable sport .
While you compete against others , you can also compete with yourself to better your previous best score .
Even before Liberal member of Parliament Marc Garneau won his riding of Westmount - Ville - Marie , the former astronaut was no stranger to politics , having served as head of the Canadian Space Agency from 2001 until 2006 and then losing a bid to win a seat in the House of Commons in the 2006 federal election .
Now Garneau , who for years distinguished himself as a scientist and Canada 's first man in space , finds himself in an unusual position of trying to bring science and technology issues to the forefront , not as an administrator , but as a critic .
Garneau , the Liberal party science and technology critic , will be asked to weigh in on the Conservative government 's policies on familiar topics such as space and research funding , but also , alongside new industry critic Gerrard Kennedy , on areas such as internet neutrality and copyright reform .
CBCNews .ca spoke with Garneau about science and technology policy , areas he'd like to see the government focus on , and what role space has in Canada 's future .
Obviously , given your background , the direction Canada takes in space is of interest to you and I know you 've expressed in the past that Canada should have a space policy .
What should that policy look like ?
When I was pushing for a space policy , I was a private citizen , and I still feel that way but I will obviously have to work with my party to see they share that opinion .
But a space policy should essentially answer the fundamental question , which is what can space offer to us here in Canada ?
We have a whole bunch of government departments here in Ottawa , but there 's never been a coherent space policy put together .
We were the third country in space , but it 's been more ad hoc than it should be , and a space policy can bring it all together .
Ultimately , it will decide our priority .
Is earth observation our first priority ?
Is developing our space manufacturing sector our first priority or is space science our first priority ?
We currently spend about $ 300 million a year on space , and if we look at other countries , they spend a certain amount .
Are we spending the right amount ?
This is something that crosses many , many boundaries and essentially the space agency has been working with these groups on a one - to - one basis , and to some extent , there has been a bit of a silo mentality .
We need to bring it all together .
How that is best brought together and who takes charge of co-ordinating it , well , it could be done in any number of ways and by any number of people , but the important thing is that we do it .
Can you extend that line of thinking to the question of what our science policy should look like ?
There has been an assumption that our science strategy should be focused ultimately and almost exclusively on what ends up being able to make us competitive in terms of export markets and services , by what it can do to expand our industrial capability , as opposed to being also important because it advances knowledge .
But I want to make the point that all science , whether it 's applied or pure science , has value .
I think we have to be careful about zeroing in on things that we say OK , if we focus on this science , we 'll develop products and services that we can sell abroad .
I think if you look at Industry Canada , there is a minister of state for science and technology [ currently Conservative MP Gary Goodyear ] but it 's under Industry Canada , the implication being that it 's ultimately being driven by industrial considerations .
I think it 's a bit misleading to have that .
It 's my personal view , and this has n't been discussed in great detail with my party , but I would like to raise the stature of science within Canada .
I think it needs to be given a more prominent role , almost in a sense that it stands by itself .
I was certainly dismayed when the government eliminated the national science advisor position and I did n't understand the reasoning for the Conservatives doing this .
[ Former science advisor Arthur Carty ] was somebody who was the apex of the pyramid and he had the ability to speak to the very top leaders , including the prime minister , and give them the unvarnished truth of where our shortcomings were in science and where our strengths and priorities should be .
I 'm sorry that the link has been killed because I think it is important that the scientists of this country have that kind of voice .
You mentioned that science and technology is currently under the banner of the ministry of industry .
But from 1971 to 1990 , it had its own ministry in the government .
Would you like to see a return to that ?
I personally feel it needs to be a strong voice at the table , at cabinet , and that 's my personal feeling .
I 'll admit I 'm biased because of my background .
But having worked with scientists a good part of my professional life , I believe that science really is one of the things that we need to focus on in government for the future of the country .
Now if the minister of state has that voice , then that 's fine .
But I 'm not quite sure it is the case .
What I feel is most important is that a strong voice exist at the table to champion it and make everyone else see how important science is .
There are a number of hot - button issues that cross into both industry and technology , particularly the issues of net neutrality and copyright reform .
Let 's consider net neutrality : do we need legislation or regulation to enshrine net neutrality principles , or should service providers be trusted to not interfere with what people use their internet connections for ?
I 'd rather not comment on it but I 'm certainly aware of the issue and I want to , before I say anything , be able to speak more intelligently about it and need to understand both sides .
Related to that is the issue of the copyright bill , and that is one that I 'm more familiar with .
There was a great deal of interest within my riding on the proposed Bill C - 61 so I did have a chance to look at that more clearly .
The Liberal position is established on that , in that we would , before putting forward a bill , would consult widely , because there were a surprising number of people who contacted me who had questions and reservations about the current bill .
It 's a complex issue , and obviously we want to achieve the right balance between allowing people who create material to earn a living but also at the same time allow the consumer to have access to things that are for their own particular use .
More of an industry question , but how do you feel about foreign ownership restrictions on Canadian companies , both for individual companies , as in the case of MDA , or for industries as a whole , such as the telecommunications industry ?
I was one of the people who appeared in front of the industry science and technology committee on the potential sale of MDA and I was against the sale and one of the points I wanted to emphasize was that Canada Investment Act , which the Conservative government has looked at and has modified , is an important act that must go beyond just looking at the economical considerations of a foreign takeover .
It is my opinion that we need to look at a number of factors that must come in that will help us make the right decision about whether foreign ownership is in the best interests of Canada , and some of those issues deal with security and strategic considerations which I think need to be brought in .
I 'm not a protectionist ; I do believe one should try and avoid that , but I also believe we need to be intelligent about certain areas .
For example , I would n't be surprised in the years to come to see environmental considerations brought in when the Canada Investment
Act is invoked , to see what the environmental ramifications are of foreign takeovers .
That 's not something that 's been brought up until now , but I think the fact that the government blocked the sale of MDA indicated that they were looking beyond simply economic interests of the country .
Specifically , do you have an opinion on foreign ownership rules for the telecommunications industry ?
At this point , I can't say that I 'm familiar with both sides of the argument in detail enough to speak intelligently , but I hope to be very soon .
How should we address Canada 's declining status in global broadband ?
How do we get it to rural areas ?
When I was at the CSA , one of the things that happened that the CSA was involved with was related to the launch with Telesat of the Anik F2 satellite , which brought broadband capability to rural areas .
So yes , I believe very strongly in it .
Having said that , there has to be a business case for it and , to some extent , education to make people aware that this kind of service is now possible .
I think this is an area [ where ]
Canada has been very consistent .
We want to be the most connected country in the world and that has been for a very long time federal government policy .
All of these things ultimately have to compete for dollars with the federal government and we 're hearing the words recession and deficit right now .
How does one get across these ideas and put forth the notion that these things are important and we need to spend money on them at a time when government is already talking about cutting back and tightening belts ?
Well , the idea is you start doing things when things are going well so that you can be prepared for the future .
I strongly believe that if we focus more heavily on investment in science and technology , then we will be more able to weather downturns in the economic cycle because we will be less dependant [ on ] our traditional economic base .
It 's easier to do when we 're flush but , at the same time , any economic plan needs to have a long - term strategy and science and technology falls into long - term strategy .
Back in the '90s , when the Liberal party said we got to get a grip on these deficits and started to wrestle them to the ground , it was at that same time that they created the Canada Foundation for Innovation , they put in the Canada Research Chairs , they started up Genome Canada .
They recognized back then that they needed to revitalize the scientific community in this country , particularly in our universities , to modernize our infrastructure to try and attract leading scientists into Canada and to keep them .
I certainly hope the current government has some strategy and has some vision to continue to take us in that direction because the fact is that today we are slipping in terms of our innovation , our productivity and in our manufacturing sector relative to our competitors , so we are not doing well enough .

Hollywood needs a fresh model for storytelling .
Behold , the Brown Ziggurat ! *
Illustration : Matias Vigliano * Brothers and sisters , we are gathered here today to mourn the death of Story .
As you may have heard , it 's kaput — or , at the very least , terminally ill , wracked by videogames , wikis , recaps , talkbacks , YouTube , ADD , and the rise of a multiplatform , multipolar , mashup - media culture .
Hollywood , vendor of Story in its most denatured form , is most at risk :
The film industry is slowly but steadily being forced to part with quaint artifacts like the " hero 's journey , " Joseph Campbell 's so - called Monomyth .
( Which is just so ... well ... mono . )
Beginnings , middles , and ends are headed for the attic , next to the box marked VCR Rewinders / Beastmaster Franchise .
And Tinseltown can kick this chestnut to the curb .
You may remember it from high school English :
Concocted 146 years ago by a German philologist , Freytag 's pyramid was long held aloft as the one - size - fits - all narrative template , despite the fact that it describes the tidy Aristotelian side of storytelling ( Ben - Hur ) far better than its frayed quantum fringes ( Memento ) .
Techniques like open - ended conclusion , audience interactivity , and nonlinear chronology " were part of the avant - garde 30 or 40 years ago , " says UCLA film school dean Robert Rosen , " but they 're taken for granted now . "
Fortunately for Western civilization , I 've developed a new model .
Allow me to introduce Brown 's Ziggurat ( in 4 - D ! ) tm .
It accounts for all the time - shredding , symmetry - defying , viewer - inclusive wackiness of New Story .
To stress - test this innovative system , we revisit one of our most basic , most fundamental narratives .
A classic hero 's journey .
The ur - Story .
I speak , obviously , of Die Hard .
The Freytag Pyramid In Freytag -ese , Die Hard unfolds thusly : NYC cop John McClane arrives in LA to reunite with his estranged wife , Holly ( exposition ) , but terrorists raid her office tower , taking everyone hostage except McClane ( inciting incident ) , who escapes unseen and starts picking off the goons ( rising action ) .
The terrorists finally realize they 're holding McClane 's wife and gain the upper hand ( climax ) , but McClane frees the other hostages ( falling action ) , goes toe - to - toe with the terrorist chieftain , and prevails ( resolution ) .
He celebrates by making out with his wife in the back of a limo .
( Awww !
And ... denouement !)
A little square , no ?
With the snazzy Brown Ziggurat , however , Die Hard will look like this : John McClane , NYC cop , arrives in LA to reconcile with his estranged wife — but we already know all about their failing marriage from the ARG we 've been obsessed with for the six months leading up to the movie 's release .
( McClane 's potemkin Tumblr blog was especially illuminating . )
With exposition rendered obsolete , we open instead on a Sprite commercial , which transitions seamlessly into furious gunplay .
We do n't even see McClane in the flesh , but our handsets are buzzing with his real - time thumb - tweets : " in the air duct .
smelz like dead trrist in here lol . "
The film then rewinds to McClane Googling " terrorists " to read up on his adversaries .
We then flash - cut to the baddies ' POV , which we 're familiar with ( and sympathetic to ) thanks to the addictive Xbox hit Die Hard : Hard Out There for a Terrorist .
This is all part of the Action - Happening Plateau , an intensifying mass of things and stuff leading up to the Mymaxtm .
The Mymax is not a lame old Freytag climax but a hot Escher mess of narrative possibilities suggested by you , the audience .
With a mere click of your handset ( and a charge of 99 cents ) , you furnish a Youclusiontm to your liking .
This is how McClane somehow ends up defeating terrorists — and winning American Idol — with his ultrasonic melisma .
McClane and Holly then celebrate by making a sex tape .
( Awww ! )
Voilà !
The future of storytelling .
Hollywood , I await my royalty checks .
And you , dear reader , can thank me by providing a Youclusion for this column .

A government official said Mr. Obama ’s order on the C.I.A. would still allow its officers abroad to temporarily detain terrorism suspects and transfer them to other agencies , but would no longer allow the agency to carry out long - term detentions .
Since the early days after the 2001 attacks , the intelligence agency ’s role in detaining terrorism suspects has been significantly scaled back , as has the severity of interrogation methods the agency is permitted to use .
The most controversial practice , the simulated drowning technique known as water - boarding , was used on three suspects but has not been used since 2003 , C.I.A. officials said .
But at the urging of the Bush administration , Congress in 2006 authorized the agency to continue using harsher interrogation methods than those permitted for use by other agencies , including the military .
Those exact methods remain classified .
The order on Guantánamo says that the camp , which received its first hooded and chained detainees seven years ago this month , “ shall be closed as soon as practicable , and no later than one year from the date of this order . ”
The order calls for a cabinet - level panel to grapple with issues including where in the United States prisoners might be moved and what courts they could be tried in .
It also provides for a new diplomatic effort to transfer some of the remaining men , including more than 60 that the Bush administration had cleared for release .
The order also directs an immediate assessment of the prison itself to ensure that the men are held in conditions that meet the humanitarian requirements of the Geneva Convention .
That provision appeared to be a pointed embrace of the international treaties that the Bush administration often argued did not apply to detainees captured in the war against terrorism .
The seven years of the detention camp have included four suicides , hunger strikes by scores of detainees , and accusations of extensive use of solitary confinement and abusive interrogations , which the Department of Defense has long denied .
Last week a senior Pentagon official said she had concluded that interrogators at Guantánamo had tortured one detainee , who officials have said was a would - be “ 20th hijacker ” in the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The report of Thursday ’s announcement came after the new administration late Tuesday night ordered an immediate halt to the military commission proceedings for prosecuting detainees at Guantánamo and filed a request in Federal District Court in Washington to stay habeas corpus proceedings there .
Government lawyers described both delays as necessary for the administration to make a broad assessment of detention policy .
A good 10 years after we started to accept that the world wide web might have some conceivable use , the process of getting a website up and running is still seen by many as some kind of black art .
In the same way that we 're happy to turn on the shower but have little interest in the process by which the water arrives , most people are unconcerned about the genesis of websites – up to the point where they 'd like one of their own .
There 's no shortage of resellers who are only too willing to exploit this yawning gap in our knowledge ; you 'll often see ads urging you to part with hefty sums for your " very own " website – deals which represent a significant profit margin for very little action .
People spend years forking out well over the odds for their online presence , but mulling over a few questions before you take the plunge could save a lot of money and effort in the long run .
Do I need my own website ?
Established online services cater pretty well for people 's web egos – depending on whether you 're happy to be merely an appendage of an existing website .
A budding photographer by the name of Hortense McCreedy could showcase her work perfectly adequately by getting herself a Flickr account , uploading her photos , and making flickr.com / hortense her online home .
Equally , if words were Hortense 's thing , a blog service such as LiveJournal could establish her a home at hortense.livejournal.com , free of charge .
The advantage of using these services is that there 's often a like - minded community ready and waiting to welcome you .
But the pages are often branded , or contain advertising , and customisation options tend to be limited .
In short , your web identity could be slightly diluted .
Some people do n't mind ; others would rather have a space that 's theirs and theirs alone .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
So how do I get my own domain name ?
You 've decided that you 'd like to own hortense.com , or hortense.co.uk , or hortense.biz or similar .
Avoid buying it from your ISP , even if they 're offering a special deal , and be wary of companies that say you can have one for free – it could mean pain further down the line .
Go direct to one of the big players who specialise in domain registration : there 's ukreg.com , freeparking .co.uk or names .co.uk ( all of whom give good deals on co.uk domain names ) or godaddy.com or enom.com ( who usually work out cheaper for generic domains such as .com , .biz or .info ) .
Either way , you should pay somewhere between £ 5 and £ 10 each year , and you 'll always be in control of it ; indeed , if you merely wanted it to whisk visitors off to your Flickr page or your LiveJournal , these services will let you set this up with the click of a mouse .
Who should host my website ?
Unless your website idea is guaranteed to attract tens of thousands of visitors each day downloading lots of media files ( i.e. pornography ) , it 's unlikely to put the internet 's infrastructure under colossal strain , and you should n't have to pay through the nose .
Shop around ; there 's no reason to consider only British providers ( although the current exchange rate dictates that you might get a better deal from people such as uk2.net or fasthosts .co.uk ) .
Some of the domain - selling services mentioned above might offer a good hosting deal , so check their prices , too .
Clubbing together with others can save money ; dreamhost.com has a $ 6 / month package which includes hosting for an unlimited number of websites .
Find half a dozen of you , and you 'll each be paying less than £ 8 per website per year for hosting – and this is precisely how those resellers mentioned at the top of this piece make money out of people who are n't in the know .
Of course , companies depending on websites for the survival of their businesses will pay more money for greater bandwidth and zero downtime – but most of us are served perfectly well by the " shared hosting " model that Dreamhost and its ilk provide .
Once you 've signed up for a hosting package , you just go back to the website you bought the domain from , log on to your online account , and punch in the name server settings your new hosting provider has given you .
A few hours later ( often only a few minutes ) , anyone typing your domain into a browser will be directed to your webspace .
Now all you have to do is put something there for them to look at .
What about designing it ?
While the procedure so far is relatively painless , creating a website that does n't look like a dog 's breakfast is more difficult .
The well - trodden route for DIY site - builders has been to use HyperText Markup Language ( HTML ) and Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) - generating software – of which Dreamweaver is the most well - known – to create the pages and upload them for the world to see .
But maintaining such a website can be a headache , and these days most new sites are generated by content management systems ( CMSs ) .
You install the CMS on your server space , choose a template , add the content – be it text , images or other media – and the pages are generated automatically .
Installing software on a server is n't always as straightforward as installing an application on your computer , but some hosting companies make it easy by offering a range of CMSs which can be installed via a one - click system .
These CMSs are usually free and open - source .
A good example is WordPress – software that 's generally associated with blogging , but is actually an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to build all kinds of websites .
The key is the template , or theme ; there are hundreds of free WordPress themes available online , and it 's likely that you 'll find one to suit you – but if you can't , you can either be brave and learn the rudiments of the PHP programming language , or find someone who 'll do it for you .
Spending £ 200 on getting someone to tweak a WordPress template to your requirements is money far better spent than forking out excessive amounts for domain and hosting services .
Check out freelance auction sites such as php-freelancers.com to find someone to do the job .
WordPress is by no means your only CMS option .
Joomla ! , Drupal and Mambo are three others for general website production , with Mambo particularly suitable for those without much technical knowledge .
Pligg can be used to build websites similar to digg.com , where a community of users can vote for , comment on and rate other content from around the web .
Moodle is targeted at educators who are looking to produce online courses for students on a small budget ; phpBB can be used to construct forums and message boards , MediaWiki for Wikipedia - style collaborative websites , Gallery for photographers or image creators looking to show off their talents , WebCalendar for online diaries , Zen Cart for online stores – the range is incredibly wide , and most are designed to be used by people who are n't experienced in burrowing through mountains of code .
Of course , there 'll always be a trade - off between the ease of getting a site built and its professional sheen .
But these days , it 's easier and cheaper to create a functioning , good - looking site than ever before .
And do n't let fly - by - night resellers tell you any different .
Better by design :
How to have a hit site
Do n't go colour crazy
Think of your website as you would your own home ; if you can't live with seizure - inducing animations and garish colours on your bedroom ceiling , do n't put them on your web page .
Check out stexps.com for an example of how not to do it – then head to colourlovers.com , the web 's equivalent of the Dulux colour wheel .
White space is your friend
Google 's exquisite simplicity demonstrates importance of white space – but you still see sites such as havenworks.com or 5 safepoints.com , whose creators sneer at the idea of " less is more " , and prefer the idea that " too much is better " .
Symmetry is n't a solution
Web design is n't easy .
Things will often refuse to sit properly on a page – but resist the temptation to centre - align everything in the mistaken belief that making things symmetrical will help .
It wo n't .
It 'll just make things even more difficult to read .
see the astonishing arrangement of text at shakespeares - sonnets.com for a good example of what not to do .
Do n't get excited by fonts
Your font folder may be rammed with futuristic or picturesque fonts , but save them for party invitations and stick to seasoned choices such as Arial , Georgia or Trebuchet – as many of the best sites do .
And take time to learn some CSS – it 's the key to making text look beautiful online .
Avoid audio
It 's hard to believe , but not everyone enjoys an unexpected and deafening rendition of the ' Knight Rider ' theme tune when they arrive at a website .
Help them avoid distress by quietly disposing of any extraneous sounds .
Optimise your images
Save your images as 72dpi , and at the size they 'll appear on your site .
There 's nothing more infuriating than watching a 100 pixel wide image of a giraffe taking 15 seconds to load because it 's 8 Mb in size ( ie , around 1,000 times too big ) .
Navigation is everything
You might whizz around your own site effortlessly – but that 's because you 've spent four weeks constructing it .
Sit someone else down in front of it – a technophobic parent is always a good option – and if they have trouble using it , do n't blame advancing senility .
Change it .
Check it with all browsers
You might hope everyone coming to your site uses Internet Explorer , but it 's becoming less and less likely as Firefox and Google Chrome become more popular .
They 're free to download , so there 's no excuse not to check that they can cope with your magnificent new creation .
1948 July 26 President Truman signs Executive Order 9981 , which states , " It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race , color , religion , or national origin . "
1954 May 17 The Supreme Court rules on the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , Kans. , unanimously agreeing that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional .
The ruling paves the way for large - scale desegregation .
The decision overturns the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling that sanctioned " separate but equal " segregation of the races , ruling that " separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . "
It is a victory for NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall , who will later return to the Supreme Court as the nation 's first black justice .

Two white men , J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant , are arrested for the murder and acquitted by an all - white jury .
They later boast about committing the murder in a Look magazine interview .
The case becomes a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre of the civil rights movement .
Dec. 1 ( Montgomery , Ala. )
NAACP member Rosa Parks refuses to give up her seat at the front of the " colored section " of a bus to a white passenger , defying a southern custom of the time .

The SCLC becomes a major force in organizing the civil rights movement and bases its principles on nonviolence and civil disobedience .
According to King , it is essential that the civil rights movement not sink to the level of the racists and hatemongers who oppose them :
" We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline , " he urges .
Sept. ( Little Rock , Ark. )
Formerly all - white Central High School learns that integration is easier said than done .

Four black students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College begin a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth 's lunch counter .
Although they are refused service , they are allowed to stay at the counter .
The event triggers many similar nonviolent protests throughout the South .
Six months later the original four protesters are served lunch at the same Woolworth 's counter .
Student sit-ins would be effective throughout the Deep South in integrating parks , swimming pools , theaters , libraries , and other public facilities .
April ( Raleigh , N.C. )
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) is founded at Shaw University , providing young blacks with a place in the civil rights movement .
The SNCC later grows into a more radical organization , especially under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael ( 1966â 1967 ) .

1961 May 4
Over the spring and summer , student volunteers begin taking bus trips through the South to test out new laws that prohibit segregation in interstate travel facilities , which includes bus and railway stations .
Several of the groups of " freedom riders , " as they are called , are attacked by angry mobs along the way .
The program , sponsored by The Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , involves more than 1,000 volunteers , black and white .
1962 Oct. 1 James Meredith becomes the first black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi .
Violence and riots surrounding the incident cause President Kennedy to send 5,000 federal troops .
1964 Jan. 23
The 24th Amendment abolishes the poll tax , which originally had been instituted in 11 southern states after Reconstruction to make it difficult for poor blacks to vote .
Summer The Council of Federated Organizations ( COFO ) , a network of civil rights groups that includes CORE and SNCC , launches a massive effort to register black voters during what becomes known as the Freedom Summer .
It also sends delegates to the Democratic National Convention to protestâ and attempt to unseatâ the official all - white Mississippi contingent .
July 2 President Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
The most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction , the Civil Rights
Act prohibits discrimination of all kinds based on race , color , religion , or national origin .
The law also provides the federal government with the powers to enforce desegregation .
Aug. 4 ( Neshoba Country , Miss . )
The bodies of three civil - rights workersâ two white , one blackâ are found in an earthen dam , six weeks into a federal investigation backed by President Johnson .
James E. Chaney , 21 ; Andrew Goodman , 21 ; and Michael Schwerner , 24 , had been working to register black voters in Mississippi , and , on June 21 , had gone to investigate the burning of a black church .
They were arrested by the police on speeding charges , incarcerated for several hours , and then released after dark into the hands of the Ku Klux Klan , who murdered them .
1965 Feb. 21 ( Harlem , N.Y. )

1967 April 19 Stokely Carmichael , a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) , coins the phrase " black power " in a speech in Seattle .
He defines it as an assertion of black pride and " the coming together of black people to fight for their liberation by any means necessary . "
The term 's radicalism alarms many who believe the civil rights movement 's effectiveness and moral authority crucially depend on nonviolent civil disobedience .

In the Supreme Court case Ricci v. DeStefano , a lawsuit brought against the city of New Haven , 18 plaintiffsâ 17 white people and one Hispanicâ argued that results of the 2003 lieutenant and captain exams were thrown out when it was determined that few minority firefighters qualified for advancement .
The city claimed they threw out the results because they feared liability under a disparate - impact statute for issuing tests that discriminated against minority firefighters .
The plaintiffs claimed that they were victims of reverse discrimination under the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
The Supreme Court ruled ( 5â  4 ) in favor of the firefighters , saying New Haven 's " action in discarding the tests was a violation of Title VII . "

2013 June In Shelby County v. Holder , the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act , which established a formula for Congress to use when determining if a state or voting jurisdiction requires prior approval before changing its voting laws .
Currently under Section 5 of the act nineâ mostly Southernâstates with a history of discrimination must get clearance from Congress before changing voting rules to make sure racial minorities are not negatively affected .
While the 5â4 decision did not invalidate Section 5 , it made it toothless .
Chief Justice John Roberts said the formula Congress now uses , which was written in 1965 , has become outdated .
" While any racial discrimination in voting is too much , Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions , " he said in the majority opinion .
In a strongly worded dissent , Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg said , " Hubris is a fit word for todayÃ ¢Â Âs demolition of the V.R.A. "

What is pyjs ?
pyjs is a Rich Internet Application ( RIA ) Development Platform for both Web and Desktop .
With pyjs you can write your JavaScript - powered web applications entirely in Python .
pyjs contains a Python - to - JavaScript compiler , an AJAX framework and a Widget Set API .
pyjs started life as a Python port of Google Web Toolkit , the Java - to - JavaScript compiler .
What is pyjs Desktop ?
pyjs Desktop allows the exact same Python web application source code to be executed as a standalone desktop application ( running under Python ) instead of being stuck in a Web browser .
For Free Software platforms , most Linux Distributions now come with pyjs and pyjs Desktop pre-packaged : Debian / Testing , FC13 , ArchLinux and Gentoo .
For Windows , pyjs Desktop uses MSHTML .
Since MSHTML comes pre-installed on Windows ( as part of IE ) , there is very little extra to download ( other than Python itself ) .
Why should I use pyjs ?
You can write web applications in Python - a readable programming language - instead of in HTML and JavaScript , both of which become quickly unreadable for even medium - sized applications .
Your application 's design can benefit from encapsulating high level concepts into classes and modules ( instead of trying to fit as much HTML as you can stand into one page ) ; you can reuse - and import - classes and modules .
Also , the AJAX library takes care of all the browser interoperability issues on your behalf , leaving you free to focus on application development instead of learning all the " usual " browser incompatibilities .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell was named special envoy for the Middle East during an event at the State Department on Thursday afternoon .
President Obama , left , with George Mitchell , right , who was named special Middle East envoy Thursday .
The move could signal that Obama plans to get involved in the Mideast peace process early in his term .
It was announced just before 3 p.m. at an event with President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Also Thursday , former U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was named special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced .
Holbrooke , who worked as a diplomat , journalist and investment banker , became one of the most influential diplomats in U.S. history when he worked in the mid-90s to end the brutal fighting in the Balkans .
He was the main architect of the Dayton Accords that ended the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
After he was officially named Obama 's envoy , Mitchell said , " I do n't underestimate the difficulty of this assignment . "
" The situation in the Middle East is volatile , complex and dangerous .
But the president and the secretary of state have made it clear that danger and difficulty cannot cause the United States to turn away , " he said .
Watch Mitchell accept his appointment »
Mitchell said that along with Obama and Clinton , he believed a goal of a Jewish state and a Palestinian state living side by side was possible and the conflict , even if centuries old , could end -- a lesson , he said , he learned during his negotiations in Northern Ireland .
" From my experience there , I formed the conviction that there is no such thing as a conflict that can't be ended , " Mitchell said .
" Conflicts are created , conducted and sustained by human beings .
They can be ended by human beings . "
In recent days , Obama officials talked to Israeli , Palestinian and Arab diplomats about the choice , sources close to the administration and diplomats told CNN .
After Mitchell was introduced Thursday , Obama said , " Time and again , in public service and private life , he has acted with skill and acted with integrity .
He will be fully empowered at the negotiating table , and he will sustain our focus on the goal of peace . "
Mitchell served as a Mideast envoy for the Bush administration , writing a 2001 report that called for a halt to Israeli settlements and greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on terror .
Do n't Miss Mitchell will make a seasoned Mideast envoy
He also was a peace broker on Northern Ireland for President Clinton .
Sallai Meridor , Israel 's ambassador to the United States , released a statement Thursday saying , " Israel holds Sen .
Mitchell in high regard and looks forward to working with him on taking the next steps towards realizing a future of peace and security for Israel and her neighbors . "
Meridor also said Holbrooke was a " longstanding friend of Israel and we wish him every success . "
Holbrooke called his mission " a very difficult assignment . "
" Nobody can say the war in Afghanistan has gone well , and yet , as we speak here today , American men and women and their coalition partners are fighting a very difficult struggle against a ruthless and determined enemy without any scruples at all , " he said after his appointment was announced .
But Holbrooke said , " If our resources are mobilized and coordinated and pulled together , we can quadruple , quintuple , multiply by tenfold the effectiveness of our efforts there . "
Mitchell and Holbrooke are two of several envoys who will work in the new administration .
Sources say Dennis Ross , a former Mideast peace envoy for several previous administrations , will be an envoy in charge of engaging Iran , but it 's unclear what role he 'll play in light of Mitchell 's appointment .
CNN 's Ed Henry and Elise Labott contributed to this report .

Christian denominations and homosexuality Statements by the Society of Friends ( Quakers ) Sponsored link .
Quaker congregations are almost completely autonomous .
There exists no central general assembly or main authority within the Society of Friends which can make definitive statements of policy for the entire denomination .
Instead , Quakers have regional " meetings " at which a group of congregations gather .
Most Christians and Christian groups can be sorted into three categories : conservative , mainline and liberal .
Quakers cover the full range .
This is displayed in their beliefs about homosexuality and bisexuality .
The following are excerpts taken from their statements on the topic , sorted in chronological order : British Quakers :
In 1963 , British Quakers published a book " Towards a Quaker View of Sex " .
10
It put forth the argument that it was not the gender and sexual orientation of a person that mattered ; it was the depth of feeling they have for each other .
" Where there is a genuine tenderness , an openness to responsibility , and the seed of commitment , God is surely not shut out .
Can we not say that God can enter any relationship in which there is a measure of selfless love ? "
2 Subsequently , the Quakers of Westminster Meeting in the UK published a statement : " We affirm the love of God for all people , whatever their sexual orientation , and our conviction that sexuality is an important part of human beings as created by God , so that to reject people on the grounds of their sexual behaviour is a denial of God 's creation . "
Quaker Life published an essay on " Quaker Views - Close Relationships , " which commented : " This tolerant attitude probably reflects the view of most British Quakers .
No discrimination is found among Quakers in terms of employment policies .
However , there are some Quakers who are very unhappy about the subject of homosexuality . "
" What would Quakers say to people who point to teachings in the Bible against homosexuality ?
Most British Quakers , while finding much inspiration in the Bible , would not use it as the final or only authority .
We believe in obedience to the same spirit of God that inspired the writers of the Bible and that we feel can speak directly to people today .
We remember that the writers of the New Testament accepted the institution of slavery but Christians no longer keep slaves .
Parts of the New Testament seem to support the argument against the ordination of women but several churches now ordain women .
How the Christian Church decides which of the teachings in the Bible are eternal and which were ' of their time ' is an important issue .
Within Quakerism we feel it is very important for ideas to be treated by careful and prayerful consideration by the larger Quaker community - which may take a long time . "
9 Hartford , CT :
The meeting issued the following statement on 1986 - MAR : 4 " The Meeting affirms the goodness of committed , loving relationships and offers recognition and support to those who share this ideal and desire to enter into a permanent relationship based upon it .
By tradition , the Meeting recognizes committed union in a celebration of marriage under the care of the Meeting .
The same loving care and consideration should be given to both same - sex and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice . "
Beacon Hill , MA :
The meeting issued the following statement on 1988 - MAR : 4 " We , the members and attenders of Beacon Hill Monthly Meeting , affirm our belief in that of God in every person .
Furthermore , we attest that this belief embraces all persons regardless of sexual orientation . "
" Beacon Hill affirms that all couples , including those of the same sex , have equal opportunity to be married within the framework of the meeting process .
The love between these couples , as it grows , will enrich their relationship , the Meeting , and the world at large .
The Meeting is committed to supporting these couples according to their needs . "
" Beacon Hill acknowledges the Certificate of Marriage signed by the couple and those present at the ceremony as the witness of Friends to the couples ' spiritual union .
Mindful that only the heterosexual couples among us currently have the right to legally sanctioned marriage and its privileges , the Meeting asks Friends , and particularly couples preparing for marriage , to examine how best to respond and bear witness to the inequalities still present in the system . "
Friends Church Southwest Yearly Meeting [ This is a Meeting in the southwest of the U.S. , and is not the Yearly Meeting in the Southwest of England :
They issued a statement on 1992 - JAN - 24 which says in part : " We declare that our sexuality is God 's gift , and that sexual intercourse is to be enjoyed , as the Scriptures teach , only within the marriage of one man and one woman .
We reject and utterly oppose homosexual activity , especially the " blessing " of same sex unions , as sinful and displeasing to our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
Right reason , Holy Scripture and the Spirit of Christ within us unitedly testify that homosexual practice is contrary to God 's will .
We also observe that homosexual practice is portrayed in the Scriptures as one of the awful consequences of humanity 's pursuit of idolatry .
( Romans 1:18 - 32 ) " " We want to be clear that we welcome those who struggle with homosexual temptation .
The gospel of Jesus welcomes all who turn to Him in the hope of a new and remade life .
Our Lord Jesus offers that power for real change .
We must also be equally clear , however , that we cannot welcome or tolerate the teaching that homosexual or extramarital sexual activity is acceptable to Friends .
Without hate or fear we must reject these behaviors because they are both sinful and displeasing to our Lord , and because they are ultimately hurtful and destructive to those who participate in them . "
1 Sponsored link : Evangelical Friends Church - Mid America Yearly Meeting :
They approved a statement on homosexuality on 1992 - AUG - 02 : " The Scriptures declare that God creates us male and female .
Furthermore , the biblical record shows that sexual union was established exclusively within the context of a male - female relationship ( Genesis 2:24 ) , and formalized in the institution of marriage .
The partner for man was woman .
Together they were to be one flesh .
In the New Testament , the oneness of male and female in marriage pictures the relationship between Christ and His church ( Ephesians 5:22 - 23 ) .
Everywhere in Scripture the sexual relationship between man and woman within the bonds of marriage is viewed as something natural and beautiful .
We believe that homosexuality is not an expression of the Creator ’s plan for human sexuality . "
" Homosexual activity , like an adulterous relationship , is clearly condemned in the Scriptures .
In Leviticus 18:22 , God declares the practice of homosexuality an abomination in His sight .
In Romans 1:26 - 27 , the practice of homosexuality is described as a degrading and unnatural passion .
I Corinthians 6:9-10 identifies the practice of homosexuality as sin that , if persisted in , brings gave consequences in this life and excludes one from the Kingdom of God . "
" We as evangelical Friends believe that sexuality has moral implications unlike race , gender , or national origin .
The Apostle Paul , strong in his condemnation of the practice of homosexuality , also testifies that those once engaged in homosexuality were among those who were forgiven and changed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ ( I Corinthians 6:11 ) .
Individual Christians , pastors and congregations need to maintain the believe that all human beings have sinned , and that all Christians have received God ’s mercy while helpless , ungodly and hostile to God .
In the name of Christ we proclaim forgiveness , cleansing , restoration and power for godly living for all who repent and believe the gospel ( I Corthinthians 10:13 ) . "
8 Quakers in Madison WI :
Quakers were one of the denominations from the Madison WI area , which issued a statement in 1997 , titled : " Madison Affirmation On Homosexuality and Christian Faith " .
3
It states : " Jesus Christ calls us to love God and our neighbor as ourselves .
As Christian clergy we embrace gay and lesbian persons as our neighbors .
From our reading of scripture and from our pastoral experiences , we believe there is sufficient evidence to conclude that homosexuality is neither sickness nor sin .
For too long , homosexual persons have been condemned and mistreated by the followers of Jesus Christ .
Sadly , the Bible has been misused in support of this condemnation .
This abuse of scripture must end .
Heterosexual and homosexual persons are children of God , created in God 's image .
...
We believe it is time to eliminate all policies and practices which create barriers and restrictions to the full participation of gay and lesbian Christians in all of the privileges and responsibilities of church membership .
Recognizing that our churches still speak and act out of our long - standing prejudices :
We hope and pray that we will acknowledge our sin and be forgiven for our ignorance , fear , arrogance and self - righteousness ; ...
We rejoice in the refusal of many gay and lesbian Christians to abandon or be forced out of their church homes ; ...
We consider these sisters and brothers to be a unique , holy and precious gift to all of us who struggle to become the family of God . "
New Zealand : The Quaker meeting in Aotearoa is called " Te Hahi Tuhauwiri . "
This was the name gifted to them by the Maori Language Commission in 1994 .
It means " The people who are moved by the winds of the Spirit . "
In 1999 , they published their Statement of Affirmation and Reconciliation about the inclusiveness of sexualities , especially gays and lesbians .
It had been adopted in 1995 .
Portions read : " The Religious Society of Friends ( Quakers ) in Aotearoa New Zealand commits itself to be a community of reconciliation , responding to the love of God in equality of participation and service , and recognizing the gifts of God in one another .
A cornerstone of Quaker belief is ' that of God ' in everyone which makes each person precious , and of value to God , to the planet , and to her or his community .
Each individual 's journey through life is unique .
Some will make this journey alone , others in loving relationships - maybe in marriage or other forms of commitment .
We need to ponder our own choices and try to understand the choices of others .
Love has many shapes and colors and is not finite .
It can not be measured or defined in terms of sexual orientation .
We are now called : to welcome publicly and explicitly the participation and service of lesbian and gay Friends ; to help one another develop loving and equal adult relationships and friendships ; to explore ways in which we can , through worship and cherishing , mark the joys and sorrows of one another 's relationships and life circumstances ; to seek formal ways of recognizing a variety of commitments , including gay and lesbian partnerships .
We realize in making this present affirmation we oblige ourselves to face and deal with our own homophobia and unconscious prejudices , together with society 's limitations and denials of human rights and justice .
We acknowledge that as individuals we are as fallible as anyone else .
When put to the test , we may each fall short . "
These statements probably reflect the range of beliefs of most Quakers .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it was lending billions of additional funds to cash - strapped American International Group Inc .
Under the program , the New York Federal Reserve Bank will provide $ 37.8 billion in additional cash to certain domestic life insurance subsidiaries of AIG AIG , - 1.23 % in return for investment - grade , fixed - income securities .
AIG already has an $ 85 billion line of credit with the Fed .
As of last week , AIG had used $ 60 billion of this loan , according to Fed data .
This new program will allow AIG to replenish liquidity , the Fed said .
At the same time , the securities will provide enhanced protection to U.S. taxpayers , the central bank said .
In a separate statement , AIG said the New York Fed is prepared to borrow securities to extend AIG 's currently outstanding lending obligations where those obligations are not rolled over or replaced by transactions with other private market participants .
The arrangement will help AIG secure funds on an as - needed basis , the company said .
AIG recently put many of its businesses up for sale to try to repay the government loan .
The insurer , which had to be saved from bankruptcy last month by a Fed , said it wants to keep its main property and casualty insurance businesses in the U.S. and abroad .
AIG came under fire in Washington this week as members of Congress , the White House and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said the firm should not have spent $ 200,000 on an expensive retreat at a luxury hotel after receiving the government bailout .
AIG said the event was for independent life insurance agents , not for AIG executives .
Revealed : Star Wars - style ' light sabre ' to destroy cancer cells
Scientists have developed a Star Wars - style ' light sabre ' which could fight cancer cells .
Above , Ewan McGregor in The Phantom Menace
A revolutionary laser which could fight cancer has been developed by British scientists .
The device , which has been compared to a Star Wars light sabre , could be routinely used on patients in NHS hospitals within the next five years , according to the researchers .
The machine - a couple of millimetres square - fires a laser beam so accurately that it can puncture a hole in an individual cell , allowing drugs to enter and do their work much more effectively .
Drug companies are often confounded by the problem that it can be easy to get a medicine into the body by injection or pill - but much harder to get the drug molecules into the cells themselves .
It could mean , for example , that the cells surrounding the spot where a tumour has been removed by surgery would be holed by the device .
This would allow chemotherapy drugs to enter and kill any remaining cancer cells .
It would be particularly useful for hard - to - reach cancers such as that of the pancreas .
The team from the University of St Andrews has managed to mount the ' light sabre ' on an optical fibre .
The next step is to develop it for use on endoscopes , the tubes used by surgeons to pass miniature cameras through the body .
The device was developed by Professor Kishan Dholakia from the university school of physics and Dr Frank Gunn - Moore from the school of biology .
Dr Gunn -Moore said : ' You could think of these as tiny light sabres like they had in Star Wars inside your body .
' We can use lasers to punch tiny holes exactly where we want them .
We can produce a rod of light that can even go round objects . '
' We can produce a rod of light - sometimes described as a sword - that can even go round objects .
It really does sound like science fiction . '
The new device relies on a method called ' photoporation ' , allowing insoluble compounds such as genes and drugs to be injected into individual cells with the assistance of light .
The developers hope it could be used to develop medication by making it easier to test how drugs work in cells .
Dr Gunn -Moore said it would be especially useful in his area of expertise - Alzheimer 's disease .
Professor Dholakia said : ' This method has , to date , been hampered as it was necessary to focus the laser beam to a very precise and extremely small point at the cell surface - a place hard to locate !
' However our novel technique uses a laser beam shape that does not spread : it stays narrow and elongated . '
“ Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD , to do evil in his sight ?
thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon ” ~ 2 Samuel 12:9 George Bush is worried about his legacy .
At his last press conference , he acknowledged that he made mistakes and suffered disappointments .
“ I think it ’s a good , strong record , ” he said of his eight years in office .
The most disgusting thing about Bush ’s last press conference was how he aggressively defended his baby , the war in Iraq .
But because Bush ’s war is aggressive , unnecessary , unconstitutional , senseless , immoral , unjust , and even worse , his legacy , at least for those of us who treasure liberty and peace , will be that of a war criminal in chief .
I have been harshly critical of U.S. troops killing for the state in Iraq ( see “ Who Is Responsible ? and “ The Blame Game “ ) .
The ones doing the actual bombing , shooting , maiming , and killing in this most criminal of wars are certainly culpable .
Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Gates , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff never destroyed any property in Iraq or killed any Iraqis .
And the same goes for the Congresses that have continued to fund this most expensive of wars .
But before Bush leaves office I want to make one thing perfectly clear : George Bush is just as responsible for turning Iraq into a killing field as the U.S. troops who invaded and occupied the country .
He is the war criminal in chief and the chief war criminal .
I base my assessment on the aftermath of the account of David and Bathsheba found in the Bible — a book that President Bush professes to believe .
The account is well known .
For those with a Bible handy , it can be found in 2 Samuel chapter 11 .
King David , who was supposed to be leading his troops in battle , saw the beautiful Bathsheba , the wife of Uriah the Hittite , washing herself .
Lust then gave way to sin as David had her brought to him for a sexual encounter .
When Bathsheba came up pregnant , the king tried to get her husband to leave the battle and go home .
Naturally , the returning soldier would then think that his wife ’s pregnancy was his doing .
Such was not to be the case , however , because Uriah refused to go home out of loyalty to his fellow soldiers .
David then had Uriah sent to the front where he knew he would be killed by the enemy .
After Uriah ’s death and a period of mourning , David took Bathsheba to wife , and she bore the king a son .
“ But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD ” ( 2 Samuel 11:27 ) .
God then sent Nathan the prophet to King David .
Nathan told the king a story :
There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds :
But the poor man had nothing , save one little ewe lamb , which he had bought and nourished up : and it grew up together with him , and with his children ; it did eat of his own meat , and drank of his own cup , and lay in his bosom , and was unto him as a daughter .
And there came a traveller unto the rich man , and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd , to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him ; but took the poor man ’s lamb , and dressed it for the man that was come to him ( 2 Samuel 12:1 —4 )
David was , of course , furious .
The man that did this thing “ shall surely die ” ( 2 Samuel 12:5 ) and “ shall restore the lamb fourfold ” ( 2 Samuel 12:6 ) , said the king .
Nathan then said to David : “ Thou art the man . ”
The Lord explained to David through his prophet : I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ;
And I gave thee thy master ’s house , and thy master ’s wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD , to do evil in his sight ?
thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon ( 2 Samuel 12:7 - 9 ) .
Like President Bush , King David did n’t actually kill anyone , but he was still guilty .
But even worse than David unnecessarily sending one of his soldiers to his death is the fact that Bush unnecessarily sent thousands of his soldiers to their deaths .
David was also told that what he did gave “ great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme ” ( 2 Samuel 12:14 ) .
How many enemies of Christianity were given great occasion to blaspheme because of Bush ’s “ crusade ” and “ great mission ” in Iraq ?
If anyone deserves a Nuremberg trial it is George Bush .
Yet , the great majority of Christians have been silent about Bush ’s war crime that is the war in Iraq .
How many Christians believe that Bush has the blood of thousands of American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians on his hands ?
How many Christians believe that Bush has given great occasion to God ’s enemies to blaspheme ?
How many Christians believe that Bush despised the commandment of the Lord ?
How many Christians believe that Bush did evil in the sight of the Lord ?
How many Christians even believe that what Bush did in Iraq displeased the Lord ?
Sadly , not enough .
George W. Bush : war criminal in chief — thou art the man .

An impression of the TSSM orbiter set against a classic Cassini image
Ambitious plans to send probes to the outer planets are being considered by US and European space officials .
One proposal envisages sending an orbiter to Saturn which would also drop a lander and a balloon on to the haze - shrouded moon Titan .
The other sees two separate orbiters despatched to investigate Jupiter and its icy moons - Europa and Ganymede .
Space agency officials will meet next week to decide which of the two plans should go forward for further study .
The respective space agencies ' two top science executives , Ed Weiler ( Nasa ) and David Southwood ( Esa ) , are expected to announce a " winner " in February .
TITAN SATURN SYSTEM MISSION Mission leaves Earth in 2020 on Atlas heavy - lift rocket Would take 9 years to reach Saturn with Venus fly - by Nasa : responsible for 1.6 - tonne instrumented orbiter Esa : would provide balloon and hydrocarbon lake lander ( above ) Orbiter to tour Saturn system before entering Titan orbit Tour allows further studies of Enceladus and its plumes
Will need to raise the high scientific bar set by Cassini
The mission , which would cost several billion dollars / euros to build and execute , would not get to the launch pad before 2020 ; and may never fly if the agencies decide there are other space missions in their future portfolios that they consider to be a higher research priority .
Reports from the two competing definition teams were published online this week by Esa .
The documents provide detailed descriptions of the science rationale and goals of the different mission concepts , and how Nasa and Esa would dovetail their participation .
The Titan Saturn System Mission ( TSSM ) , as it is currently known , would follow up the remarkable discoveries made by the Nasa / Esa Cassini - Huygens mission which continues to operate at the ringed planet .
The concept envisages another multi-instrumented orbiter that would make the moons Titan and Enceladus its chief targets .
Cassini has sent back data that indicates Titan is akin to a primitive - albeit frozen - Earth .
It has a thick atmosphere and is rich in organic ( carbon - rich ) molecules .
Recent revelations at Enceladus include the discovery that its southern polar region has hot spots that spew huge jets of water - ice into space .
Scientists think there may be an ocean of liquid water beneath the moon 's surface .
Crashing finale
The TSSM orbiter would dip into Titan 's atmosphere and the plumes at Enceladus to " taste " their chemistry .
The orbiter would also drop a lander on to Titan to float on one of moon 's lakes of liquid ethane and methane .
In addition , a balloon would be injected into the atmosphere to take pictures and sample the " air " as it drifted with the wind .
The Europa Jupiter System Mission ( EJSM ) proposes Nasa and Esa combine efforts in the Jovian system .
Major targets here would be the Galilean moons Europa and Ganymede .
Europa in particular has long been at the top of scientists ' wish lists to visit with sophisticated instrumentation .
The ice moon 's crack - riven surface is also thought to hide a sub-glacial ocean ( but on a larger scale to Enceladus ) .
Researchers would love to get close enough to start to assess the habitability of this strange world .
EUROPA JUPITER SYSTEM MISSION Nasa : Jupiter Europa Orbiter could launch on an Atlas in 2020 Esa : Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter ( above ) lofted by an Ariane Probes use Venus gravity assist to arrive 6 years later Orbiters conduct joint observations at other Jupiter moons
Would finally settle into orbits around dedicated targets Studies will focus on Europa 's and Ganymede 's interiors End destructions will allow unique measurement opportunities The EJSM team suggests the US and Europe both send orbiters .
Nasa would despatch the Jupiter Europa Orbiter ( JEO ) ; Esa would send the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter ( JGO ) .
The two spacecraft would conduct joint observations on occasions but only Nasa 's probe would spend time around Europa which is known to have a severe radiation environment .
The spacecraft will need specific shielding to protect sensitive electronic systems .
The JEO and JGO would end their missions by crashing into their respective moons .
The concepts have risen out of several years of discussion on both sides of the Atlantic .
US inspirations have been channelled through Nasa 's Outer Planets Assessment Group ( Opag ) .
The European initiative comes under Esa's Cosmic Vision programme which seeks to map out space science endeavours through to 2025 .
Initial ideas evolved under titles known as Tandem ( now incorporated into TSSM ) and Laplace ( now in EJSM ) .
The Paris - based agency has set aside 650 m euros ( at 2007 prices ) for a large class mission .
The TSSM and EJSM concepts would fall into that category .
But whichever is chosen to go forward for further feasibility work will ultimately have to compete with concepts in astrophysics .
There are joint Esa / Nasa proposals on the table for a next - generation X - ray telescope , known as the International X - ray Observatory ( Ixo ) ; and for a mission to study gravitational waves in space , known as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ( Lisa ) .
These concepts are trying to win the same funding opportunity .
Peter Falkner , who leads the planetary exploration studies section at Esa , told BBC News : " The [ planetary missions ] will go to down - selection with Ixo and Lisa ; and then - under the current plan - two will be selected for definition phase in parallel , still in competition , and out of that will emerge a winner that will go forward to implementation .

When George Thomas was eight he walked everywhere .
It was 1926 and his parents were unable to afford the fare for a tram , let alone the cost of a bike and he regularly walked six miles to his favourite fishing haunt without adult supervision .
Fast forward to 2007 and Mr Thomas 's eight - year - old great - grandson Edward enjoys none of that freedom .
He is driven the few minutes to school , is taken by car to a safe place to ride his bike and can roam no more than 300 yards from home .

Even if he wanted to play outdoors , none of his friends strays from their home or garden unsupervised .
The contrast between Edward and George 's childhoods is highlighted in a report which warns that the mental health of 21st - century children is at risk because they are missing out on the exposure to the natural world enjoyed by past generations .
The report says the change in attitudes is reflected in four generations of the Thomas family in Sheffield .
The oldest member , George , was allowed to roam for six miles from home unaccompanied when he was eight .
His home was tiny and crowded and he spent most of his time outside , playing games and making dens .
Mr Thomas , who went on to become a carpenter , has never lost some of the habits picked up as a child and , aged 88 , is still a keen walker .
His son - in - law , Jack Hattersley , 63 , was also given freedom to roam .
He was aged eight in 1950 , and was allowed to walk for about one mile on his own to the local woods .
Again , he walked to school and never travelled by car .

By 1979 , when his daughter Vicky Grant was eight , there were signs that children 's independence was being eroded .
" I was able to go out quite freely - I 'd ride my bike around the estate , play with friends in the park and walk to the swimming pool and to school , " said Mrs Grant , 36 .
" There was a lot less traffic then - and families had only one car .
People did n't make all these short journeys . "
Today , her son Edward spends little time on his own outside his garden in their quiet suburban street .
She takes him by car to school to ensure she gets to her part - time job as a medical librarian on time .
While he enjoys piano lessons , cubs , skiing lessons , regular holidays and the trampoline , slide and climbing frame in the garden , his mother is concerned he may be missing out .
She said : " He can go out in the crescent but he does n't tend to go out because the other children do n't .
We put a bike in the car and go off to the country where we can all cycle together .
" It 's not just about time .
Traffic is an important consideration , as is the fear of abduction , but I 'm not sure whether that 's real or perceived . "
She added : " Over four generations our family is poles apart in terms of affluence .
But I 'm not sure our lives are any richer . "
The report 's author , Dr William Bird , the health adviser to Natural England and the organiser of a conference on nature and health on Monday , believes children 's long - term mental health is at risk .
He has compiled evidence that people are healthier and better adjusted if they get out into the countryside , parks or gardens .
Stress levels fall within minutes of seeing green spaces , he says .
Even filling a home with flowers and plants can improve concentration and lower stress .
" If children have n't had contact with nature , they never develop a relationship with natural environment and they are unable to use it to cope with stress , " he said .
" Studies have shown that people deprived of contact with nature were at greater risk of depression and anxiety .
Children are getting less and less unsupervised time in the natural environment .
" They need time playing in the countryside , in parks and in gardens where they can explore , dig up the ground and build dens . "
The report , published by Natural England and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , also found that children 's behaviour and school work improve if their playground has grassy areas , ponds and trees .
It also found evidence that hospital patients need fewer painkillers after surgery if they have views of nature from their bed .
As shown during ABC's Potter marathon , sneak peak for Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince features new footage from the film while showing interviews with cast and crew .
The topic is the film 's story .
AROUND THE WEB
March 25 , 1998
BLAME EL NIÑO FOR A LONGER DAY
" When you fire a .22 caliber rifle , the bullet gets about halfway down the barrel in 0.6 milliseconds , so we are talking about an extremely short period of time .
It is a tribute to the accuracy of VLBI that we are able to notice such a small change in day length , " said Gipson .
The sum of the extra day lengths over the entire El Niño cycle to date is approximately 1/10 of a second , about the period of an eye blink .
The peak in day length occurred around Feb. 5 , 1998 .
The extra day length has decreased slowly as El Niño has diminished in intensity ; currently , it is at 0.4 milliseconds .
" The reason for the change in day length is that the Earth system , which includes its atmosphere and oceans , was spinning when it was formed .
This rotational energy , called angular momentum , is fixed -- you can't get any more or take any away without applying a force .
This is like living on a fixed income .
Let 's suppose you make 10,000 dollars per year , and spend 5,000 on rent and 5,000 on food .
If your rent increases to 6,000 dollars , you only have 4,000 dollars to buy food .
The same thing is happening with the Earth 's spin .
As the atmosphere speeds up during El Niño , the Earth must slow down to conserve the combined angular momentum .
Conversely , after El Niño dissipates , the atmosphere will slow down , and the Earth will speed up again , making the day shorter , " said Gipson .
The 1982 El Niño had a peak effect of 0.9 milliseconds per day , concentrated in a much shorter time period .
The extra day length was above 0.3 milliseconds per day for three months .
The current El Niño has been above 0.3 milliseconds per day for most of last year .
Other atmospheric phenomena , such as hurricanes , can change the day length as well , although the effect is much smaller than that of El Niño .
The change in day length due to a typical hurricane is less than two microseconds ( 2/1,000,000 of a second ) per day .
The normal seasonal fluctuation is about one millisecond per day , peak to peak .
The VLBI network , coordinated at Goddard , determines the Earth 's rotation speed from differences in the arrival time of radio signals from quasars , extremely bright objects at the edge of the observable universe .
Because the radio telescopes are widely separated , the radio signal from a given quasar reaches some telescopes before others .
As the Earth speeds up or slows down , this timing difference changes by a minuscule amount .
The difference is measured in picoseconds , or trillionths of a second .
These precise measurements also permit accurate determination of the distances between antenna within the network .
Relative changes in the antenna locations from a series of measurements are used to indicate motion in the Earth 's crust due to plate tectonics .
Local deformations may reveal stress buildup as a precursor to earthquake or volcanic activity .
High precision VLBI measurements of the Earth 's orientation began in 1980 , and have continued about once per week since then , even in the current El Nino cycle .
Under the Continuous Observations of the Rotation of the Earth ( CORE ) program these measurements would be made continuously .
Measurements of the Earth 's orientation and rotation are essential for satellite navigation , and for communication with deep space satellites .
The Global Positioning System requires Earth orientation measurements to provide precise measurements of longitude .
The Ministry of Defence confirmed today that it has suffered virus infections which have shut down " a small number " of MoD systems , most notably including admin networks aboard Royal Navy warships .
The Navy computers infected are the NavyStar ( N* ) system , based on a server cabinet and cable - networked PCs on each warship and used for purposes such as storekeeping , email and similar support functions .
N* ship nets connect to wider networks by shore connection when vessels are in harbour and using satcomms when at sea .
The system is supplied by Fujitsu , with most of the Navy 's fleet being equipped in the early years of the century .
N* is intended to stay in service , coming under the Defence Information Infrastructure now being rolled out .
N* hardware varies in detail depending on when a ship had the system installed and when it has last had dockyard maintenance , but is based on industry - standard PCs with ruggedised cases and shock mounting ( to cope with combat damage ) and strict emissions certification to avoid interference with other systems .
Various MoD computers and N * nets aboard warships including the carrier Ark Royal have suffered N* outages over the past fortnight , caused by virus infection .
A major impact has been the loss of email service , which in recent years has come to be a routine way for sailors to stay in touch with friends and family .
An MoD spokesperson supplied the Reg with a statement this afternoon :
Since 6 Jan 09 the performance of the MOD IT systems in a number of areas was affected by a virus .
Immediate action was taken to isolate the problem to stop the virus from spreading .
This meant that some people were without regular IT access ( i.e. email , internet ) .
There have been no infections detected on any networks with sensitive information .
A solution to prevent re-infection has been tested and implemented .
The majority of systems are working normally .
This is an ongoing process which we are working urgently on so for those people who are still off line normal business will resume as quickly as possible .
The MoD insisted that no command or operational systems had been affected , though many of these are based on similar hardware .
Spokespersons also stated that " no classified or personal data has been or will be at risk of compromise " due to " pre-existing security measures " .
The MoD refused to discuss details of the virus , transmission methods , countermeasures or other specifics of the incident " for security reasons " . ®

Will Diving Dollar Force Acceptance of ‘ Amero ’ Currency ?
By Victor Thorn FINANCIAL EXPERTS ARE SPEAKING loud and clear .
“ The dollar is a doomed currency , thanks to Washington , ” well - known investor Jim Rogers said on Nov. 25 .
Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital and adviser for Ron Paul ’s 2008 GOP primary campaign , took it one step further .
“ This is just not a financial crisis .
This is an economic collapse .
Our entire phony economy is collapsing around us .
There is nothing the government can do to stop it .
They should just get out of the way and let it happen . ”
David Tobin of Mission Capital Advisers agrees , stating on November 24 , “ The banking system is bankrupt . ”
Economic problems could n’t be more evident .
Shockwaves from a burst housing bubble still linger , Detroit ’s auto industry is on the verge of collapse , Wall Street investors have lost over $ 23 trillion in the past few months , socialist - style bailouts became the trend in 2008 , while the dollar ’s value is plummeting once again .
As a result , William Engdahl of Global Research reported on December 15 , “ In November , U.S. companies cut jobs at the fastest rate in 34 years .
Some $ 1.9 million U.S. jobs have vanished so far in 2008 . ”
Could this situation deteriorate to such an extent that Americans will actually beg for a new currency to replace the dollar ?
If globalist planners have their way , such a collapse is precisely what they ’re trying to orchestrate .
On Nov. 27 , Unfit for Command author Jerome Corsi wrote about billionaire investor Stephen Jarislowsky , who recently told the Canadian House of Commons , “ Canada and the United States should both abandon their national dollar currencies and move to a regional North American currency as soon as possible . ”
Jarislowsky continued , “ We have to really start thinking of the model of a continental currency .
The idea would be a European Union - type setup with a North American central bank that would issue the new currency and sit over the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve in the United States . ”
This new currency has popularly been called the “ amero . ”
It was first officially proposed in 1999 by Canadian economist Herbert Grubel , who is a senior member of the “ free - trade ” oriented Fraser Institute and author of The Case for the Amero .
His view on the erosion of national borders is apparent : “ Sovereignty is not infinitely valuable . ”
In March , 2005 , the U.S. came one step closer to this reality when President Bush , Mexico ’s Vicente Fox , and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin met in Waco , Tex. to announce their plans for a Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SSP ) — step one in the creation of a North American Union .
With illegal immigration virtually unimpeded and threats of false - flag terrorism ever present , the recipe for disaster looms large .
Ben Steil , director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations , wrote an article in the May / June 2007 issue of Foreign Affairs entitled The End of National Currency .
His primary thesis was unambiguous .
“ National currencies and global markets simply do not mix .
In order to globalize safely , countries should abandon monetary nationalism and abolish unwanted currencies . ”
Setting the stage for such a move are two recent events of monumental importance .
First , Bloomberg reported on Dec. 15 that “ U.S. policy makers are flooding the world with an extra $ 8.5 trillion . ”
John Taylor , chairman of New York ’s FX Concepts Inc. , observed , “ The dollar will go to new lows as the U.S. attacks its currency . ”
These are strong words , prompting many to warn of the second variable , Weimar - style hyperinflation , especially since the Fed is now virtually giving money away for free .
In mid-December , the Fed cut its funds rate to 0.25 % , leading Michael Feroli of JP Morgan Chase to predict that the central bank will “ cut the overnight lending rate to zero in January , and hold it there throughout the year . ”
To make matters even more perilous , no one knows where all the money under our government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) is going .
According to conservative commentator Saundra McDavid on December 22 , “ The Associated Press contacted 21 banks which received over $ 1 billion of federal bailout money , and none of them were able or willing to disclose the use of the funds . ”
Or , as JP Morgan spokesman Thomas Kelly so arrogantly put it , “ We ’ve lent some of it .
We ’ve not lent some of it .
We have not disclosed that to the public .
We ’re declining to . ”
Considering our fiscal climate , could we be teetering on the edge of financial Armageddon ?
Robert Pastore thinks so .
Known as “ Father of the North American Union , ” he ’s spent years planning a merger between Canada , Mexico , and the U.S. Chillingly , in an October 2006 speech , he declared , “ A 9 - 11 crisis might be just the type of catastrophe needed to overcome governmental inertia in advancing the type of economic integration necessary to form a North American community . ”
He added , “ In a fiscal 9 - 11 crisis triggered by a dollar collapse , the amero might then look reasonable . ”
With economic collapse , chaos would ensue ; a scenario not deemed unlikely by Igor Panarin , a professor at Russia ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
On November 24 , he announced that the U.S. could potentially split into six separate regions following a financial crisis .
“ The dollar is n’t secured by anything .
The country ’s foreign debt has grown like an avalanche .
This is a pyramid which has to collapse . ”
He also anticipates that moves are underway to “ replace the dollar with a common amero currency as a new monetary unit . ”
Is this where Barack Obama enters the picture ?
Since his mantra for the past two years has been change , publisher Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster fits the final piece to the puzzle .
“ Creating the amero will be presented to the American public as the administration ’s solution for dollar recovery . ”
To do so , could an emergency be declared where the U.S. is reorganized under some form of Chapter 11 bankruptcy , with the entire banking industry nationalized , including the Federal Reserve ?
In an Oct. 7 column , documentary filmmaker Patrick Henningsen considered the possibility .
“ The dollar will become basically worthless after the exchange for the Amero , and will have little international value .
If you understand who owns the Fed , you will know that U.S. dollars are essentially printed by the same private institutions who print the euro .
The amero is about expanding this bank ’s operation out of Mexico and Canada , essentially allowing European central banks ( and their U.S. Federal Reserve “ franchise ” ) to gain complete control over the entire money supply of North America .
The amero will simply bring us one step closer to a global currency ; and one step closer to a global government . ”
One ca n’t help but be reminded of Vice President Joe Biden ’s words at an Oct. 19 Seattle fundraiser : “ Mark my words .
It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy .
We ’re going to have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy .
And he ’s going to need help because it ’s not going to be apparent initially ; it ’s not going to be apparent that we ’re right . ”
Was he referring to suspending the Constitution , then instituting the amero ?
Tragically , we ’re only one major event away from finding out .

The value of shares in the big three Irish banks more than halved in Dublin today after the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank late last week failed to ease concerns about their future .
The fresh plunge came as Bank of Ireland announced that its chief executive Brian Goggin would retire this summer .
Shares in AIB closed down almost 60 % to 60 cent .
Bank of Ireland ended down 55 % at 34 cent .
Both of these were new low points .
Irish Life & Permanent also fell 50 % to € 1.10 .
Today 's falls come in the wake of market suggestions that Bank of Ireland and AIB look unlikely to be able to raise extra cash from private investors to top up a proposed state investment in the banks .
They also came as banking shares across Europe also fell sharply after Britain launched a second bank rescue plan and Royal Bank of Scotland signalled the biggest loss in UK corporate history .
Meanwhile , a Bank of Ireland statement said its board of directors had started the process of looking for a new chief executive .
It said the search would include internal and external candidates .
Mr Goggin , 56 , has been chief executive since June 2004 and has been with Bank of Ireland for 40 years .
In a statement , Mr Goggin said the most recent period had been difficult , but said the Government 's decision to support the bank 's recapitalisation ' provides a basis on which the future of the bank can be built ' .
BoI Governor Richard Burrows said Mr Goggin always had the best interests of the bank at heart .
' I believe this has motivated his decision to seek retirement this summer to make way for fresh leadership , ' he added .

Researchers long ago established a link between inflammation , cancer and the compound nitric oxide , which may be produced when the immune system responds to bacterial infections , including those of the colon .
However , the exact nature of the relationship was unknown -- Â until now .
Scientists from MIT 's Division of Comparative Medicine and Department of Biological Engineering have found that nitric oxide produced by inflammatory cells during bacterial infection can cause colon cells to become cancerous .
The finding suggests that blocking the compound may help prevent or treat colon cancer , the third most common form of cancer in the United States .
The researchers , led by James Fox , director of the Division of Comparative Medicine ( DCM ) , report their findings in the Jan. 19 online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Many years ago it was discovered that gastrointestinal infection by H. pylori is often linked to cancer in humans ; a related bacteria called H. hepaticus has similar effects in mice .
Nitric oxide is produced during the inflammatory response to such bacterial infection , but it has been unclear whether it was damaging cells or protecting them .
By studying mice , the MIT team found that nitric oxide produced by different types of cells has different effects .
" Nitric oxide delivered by inflammatory cells , in particular , is important in causing changes in intestinal epithelial cells , setting the stage for cancer development , " said Susan Erdman , principal research scientist in the Division of Comparative Medicine and lead author of the PNAS paper .
In mice infected with H. hepaticus , the researchers found that blocking an enzyme needed to produce nitric oxide reduced colon cancer rates .
More work is needed to study the exact effects of nitric oxide and develop potential clinical therapies for colon cancer , Erdman said .
" Therapies will need to be targeted to inhibit the damaging effects of nitric oxide while preserving as many of the protective elements of nitric oxide as possible , " she said .
" This study is a wonderful example of the value and final product that results from an interdisciplinary team effort , " said Fox .

Jackson , research technician in the DCM ; Zhongming Ge , molecular biologist in the DCM ; David Schauer , professor of biological engineering ; Gerald Wogan , professor emeritus of biological engineering ; and Steven Tannenbaum , professor of biological engineering .

According to reports from The Wall Street Journal , Dell has been working on smartphone prototypes for more than a year .
The prototypes include a device with a touch - screen keyboard , similar to the Apple iPhone , and another device with a full slide - out QWERTY keyboard , similar to the recently announced Palm Pre .
But the computer giant is joining the party a little too late to actually make a splash .
The smartphone market is already crowded , with the likes of BlackBerry , Apple and Palm jockeying for market share .
Can
Dell get into the market this late and be successful , while also offering innovative products ?
Probably not .
Sure , Dell has been innovative in other facets of the high - tech biz , but when it comes to smartphones , establishing yourself as a major player in an overcrowded field seems more like a waste of time .
Here are five reasons
Dell should pack up its toys and go home , before a smartphone flop blows up in its face .
1 . You can't beat the Apple iPhone
Many have tried to dethrone the iPhone from its high perch as king of the touch - screen devices .
The BlackBerry Storm has yet to reach the summit , and other competitors from the likes of Sprint , T - Mobile and more are still tackling the first hundred feet .
Word is Dell is looking to build its own iPhone clone , a touch - screen smartphone that would rival Apple 's consumer device darling .
Fat chance , considering Apple managed to unload 2.4 million iPhone 3G models in just its first quarter .
Success like that would take something more than a rip - off , and we doubt that Dell has what it takes .
2. Is n't Dell trying to save money ?
Granted , smartphones are relatively inexpensive to manufacture , with the iPhone costing around $ 174 and the BlackBerry Storm costing about $ 203 per unit , according to a recent iSuppli report .
And , oftentimes , smartphone margins are pretty high .
But in this time of economic uncertainty , branching into a new market could work against Dell , especially when the company recently revealed a plan to cut $ 3 billion in operating expenses to combat slumping PC sales .
3. Remember what happened to the Axim ?
Dell already tried to crack into the lucrative mobile device market with its Axim line of Windows Mobile - based PDAs .
Dell 's Axim Pocket PC play , an early iteration of a true smartphone , was short - lived , fizzling out about five years after it made its debut in 2002 .
The Axim family , which saw several models , was officially discontinued in April 2007 amidst declining sales of PDA form - factor devices , a similar fate suffered by Palm 's original line of handhelds .
The difference , however , is that Palm forged on , and forged on quickly , capturing early smartphone sales .
Dell , on the other hand , let the Axim line die and left it dead for a while before going back to the drawing board .
This much time out of the market could work against Dell as it tries to gain traction in a market it abandoned once already .
Does any smartphone user want to hang their hat , or their data , on a device made by someone that has already failed in the market ?
4 . No one likes a Johnny - come- lately
You got to start somewhere , but unless Dell is bringing something new and innovative to the smartphone market , it should n't even bother .
Of course , Dell has n't officially made its smartphone intentions known or even confirmed that a smartphone is on its product road map .
But if one is , it darn well better be good .
If Dell builds a touch - screen , it 's already been done .
If Dell tries its hand at a 3G device , it 's been done ad nauseam .
Is there really anything new that Dell can add that has n't been done already or is n't currently under development by market masters Research In Motion ( RIM ) Ltd. , Apple or a host of others that want their piece of the smartphone pie ?
Doubtful .
5. Dude , you 're gettin ' a Dell
Dell has become somewhat notorious for its customer service , or lack thereof .
Just this month , Dell reached a $ 3.85 million settlement with 46 states that complained of customer service abuses by the company .
In a statement , Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called Dell 's abuses " significant , " noting " customers faced unacceptable obstacles obtaining warranty service on their Dell computers and others said they never received promised rebates .
" Dell must hit delete and then reprogram and restart customer relations by keeping all its promises .
More than the money , this agreement provides profoundly important business practice reforms , " Blumenthal continued .
Dell , however , said the issues brought in the legal settlement affected only a " small percentage " of customers , and many of the business practices raised in the complaint had been eliminated by the computer manufacturer before the settlement .
Still , that was n't the first time Dell was in hot water for shady practices .
In May 2008 , a New York State Supreme Court Judge said Dell was running a classic bait - and - switch scheme and denying customers promised deals .
" Dell has engaged in repeated misleading , deceptive and unlawful business conduct , including false and deceptive advertising of financing promotions and the terms of warranties , fraudulent , misleading and deceptive practices in credit financing , and failure to provide warranty service and rebates , " the judge wrote .
Lawsuits based around customer service issues are n't too enticing to the smartphone - buying public , which is always wary of someone trying to pull a fast one .
If Dell expects to succeed in the smartphone market , it had better keep everything above board , or the initiative will go bust before it begins .
When people say the name " Starship Troopers , " the first thing that often comes to mind is the 1997 B movie directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Casper Van Dein as the intrepid hero Johnny Rico .
It 's one of those films , you either love it or you hate it -- I can't speak for everyone , but I think you have to be in a certain mood ( or mindset ) to enjoy a movie filled with angry , yelling soldiers and drill instructors .
The book , however , was alot more interesting and appeals to a much larger audience ( in my opinion ) .
It 's philosophical , it 's gritty , it 's real .
When Johnny Rico goes through boot camp , it is n't the glorious ride through co-ed showers and laser ranges that we see in the movie -- it 's closer to the reality , it 's harder , much harder , and every minute keeps you right there through it all .
When Rico talks about stealing crackers from the kitchen to stay alive , Heinlein 's writing makes you feel his hunger , the cool calm with which he overrides any sense of desperation .
Sticking with Rico through bootcamp in this novel changes you , gives you a new appreciation for life , and does it in such a way that you might find yourself making different choices in day to day life .
You might find yourself waking up an hour earlier to get a few more things done in a day , or you might let it roll right off your back as unimportant next time the barista at Starbucks gets your order wrong .
It 's that kind of book -- sure , most of us never go through the kind of mind - altering survival training Johnny Rico does in the pages of " Starship Troopers " , but this book will definitely get you thinking about how you live your life .
Needless to say , Heinlein's Starship Troopers does not disappoint .
It 's another excellent example of how amazing a writer he is , and a wonderfully timeless piece of literature .
Written in 1959 , it 's use of technology is left vague enough to keep it fresh and applicable even with today 's scientific knowledge , but he also explains it just enough to amaze .
Heinlein's Mobile Infantry suits are undoubtedly the grandfather of all " Powersuits " and " Power Armor " to appear in science fiction , and they work in a fashion that 's still very believable .
And all this in 1959 !
Heinlein is another genius of the written word .
Perhaps the best part of " Starship Troopers " is still the philosophy Heinlein pushes through in it .
It is n't really 100 % politically correct , but the way he slashes apart our modern system of citizenship and correctional institutions and replaces them with a simple " serve and earn the right to vote " and the idea of instituting public lashings as punishment for crimes does have it 's simplistic appeal .
Of course , it 's this aspect which makes the book so controversial , and I can only imagine how controversial it was coming out in 1959 .
All in all , I give it a good four and a half stars .
Maybe four and three quarters .
It 's not the perfect book , but it 's darn good , and definitely a recommended read regardless of how you feel about the film " Starship Troopers " or it 's atrocious sequel " Hero of the Federation . "
The prime minister of Antigua wants to rename the island 's highest mountain Mount Obama in honour of the US president - elect .
Boggy Peak , as it is currently known , rises more than 1,300 ft ( 396 metres ) over the island 's southern point and serves as a transmission site for broadcasting and telecommunications .
It also is a popular hiking spot .
The prime minister , Baldwin Spencer , announced the plans on Wednesday in a congratulatory letter to Barack Obama .
Antigua 's attorney general , Justin Simon , said he would find out if parliament needed to approve the name change .
The political analyst Avel Grant said it could draw more tourists to the island .

Why Businesses Need to Have a Professiona
l Photographe
r Shoot Their Products
When marketing products , it is critical that a business presents in depth imagery , else their interested clients might end up purchasing from a rival .
While it is conceivable for a business owner to take the photos themselves , it wo n't up to par with professional photography , and could cause a business to lose the edge on the market .
Imagery does n't just enhance the clarity of the item for customers , but the value as well .
When a true professional is taking photographs , they can locate that angle that makes your product shine , glow , or whatever it may need to be .
The quality of a professional photograph is typically something that stands out .
These sorts of photographs can increase the reputation and value of a business , giving it the edge .
Developing a portfolio is essential for a company , it builds up their reputation , but having subpar photographs can counteract the effort .
When showing off projects , it is necessary to establish authority and capability .
Having low grade images ... ( more )
I used to take comfort in seeing you every now and then .
You made it possible for my flowers to bloom and would wash away the grime of the day .
You 'd offer a gentle sound as a backdrop to life .
But now , you 've taken so much away , you constantly threaten us and you continue to make me uneasy .
How ironic that we need you to live but at the same time despise you for being here .

VMware 's Mobile Virtualization Strategy Calls for Open Source Responses
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 10 , 2008
Proprietary virtualization player VMWare has just announced its VMWare Mobile Virtualization Platform ( MVP ) designed to bring virtualization to mobile phones .
It 's due to ship in 2009 , and is a lightweight software layer that can run even on memory - constrained phones .
For several reasons , this virtualization platform could have an impact on mobile phones running open source operating systems , and on application development for mobile open source operating systems .
As LinuxDevices notes VMWare MVP appears to be based largely on Trango 's hypervisor .
VMware acquired Trango last month , and Trango 's virtualization technology runs on PowerPC , ARM and MIPS platforms .
In addition to reaching out to several types of processors , VMware MVP will support Linux 2.6x , Symbian 9.x , and Windows CE 5.0 and 6.0 , among other operating systems .
“ By abstracting the applications and data from the hardware itself , we expect that virtualization will not only enable handset vendors to accelerate time to market but can also pave the way for innovative applications and services for phone users , " said VMware CEO Paul Maritz .
Here is a key thing to note , from the announcement :
" VMware MVP will virtualize the hardware , enabling handset vendors to develop a software stack with an operating system and a set of applications that is not tied to the underlying hardware . "
And this item directly addresses the impact that virtualization could have on open mobile platforms :
" Increasingly , handset vendors and carriers are looking to migrate from proprietary operating systems to rich , open operating systems to enable their customers to access the widest selection of applications .
With this transition to open operating systems , protection of trusted services such as digital rights management , authentication , billing , etc. is becoming an increasing concern .
VMware MVP will allow vendors to isolate these important trusted services from the open operating system and run them in isolated and tamper - proof virtual machines so that even if the open environment is compromised , the trusted services are not impacted . "
I 've written before about the considerable threats that VMware faces from open source virtualization , which is increasingly found in operating systems .
The overall strategy of providing virtualization on open source phones is very sound .
It has the potential to increase the security of phones and applications , allow developers to write to one common software stack , and more .
Those are areas where embedded , free open source mobile virtualization solutions could become best - of - breed .
I wo n't be surprised to see competitive open source solutions show up quickly , focused on these same goals .
I was brushing off my Java skills the other day .
It 's been a little while and I ran into a task I could not , from memory , recall how to write .
So I turned to Google and quickly came up with this post from 1996 ( ! ) on the subject :
From : Lawrence Page
I have a web robot which is a Java app .
I need to be able to set the User - Agent field in the HTTP header in order to be a good net citizen ( so people know who is accessing their server ) .
Anyone have any ideas ?
Right now , Java sends a request that includes something like :
User -Agent : Java/1.0beta2
I 'd rather not rewrite all the HTTP stuff myself .
I tried just searching in the JDK for the Java / 1.0 bet a2 figuring I could just change the string , but I could n't find it .
Perhaps it is stored as a unicode string ?
An easy method of setting the User - Agent field should probably be added to Java , so people can properly identify their programs .
Thanks , Larry Page
Hmm , I wonder what kind of " web robot " this Larry Page was working on and hope his project was successful !
Does it bode well for me that I ran into the same question ?
WASHINGTON  President Bush deflected a secret request by Israel last year for specialized bunker - busting bombs it wanted for an attack on Iran ’s main nuclear complex and told the Israelis that he had authorized new covert action intended to sabotage Iran ’s suspected effort to develop nuclear weapons , according to senior American and foreign officials .
White House officials never conclusively determined whether Israel had decided to go ahead with the strike before the United States protested , or whether Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel was trying to goad the White House into more decisive action before Mr. Bush left office .
But the Bush administration was particularly alarmed by an Israeli request to fly over Iraq to reach Iran ’s major nuclear complex at Natanz , where the country ’s only known uranium enrichment plant is located .
The White House denied that request outright , American officials said , and the Israelis backed off their plans , at least temporarily .
But the tense exchanges also prompted the White House to step up intelligence - sharing with Israel and brief Israeli officials on new American efforts to subtly sabotage Iran ’s nuclear infrastructure , a major covert program that Mr. Bush is about to hand off to President - elect Barack Obama .
This account of the expanded American covert program and the Bush administration ’s efforts to dissuade Israel from an aerial attack on Iran emerged in interviews over the past 15 months with current and former American officials , outside experts , international nuclear inspectors and European and Israeli officials .
None would speak on the record because of the great secrecy surrounding the intelligence developed on Iran .

BBC News , Texas
Hilmar Moore is probably the longest - serving elected official in the US In 1949 , around the time the Berlin airlift was ending , Britain was winding down clothes rationing and George Orwell was publishing 1984 , the townspeople of Richmond , Texas , took a momentous step of their own - they elected Hilmar Moore to the job of mayor .
Mr Moore , a rancher and businessman , has remained in office ever since , making him almost certainly the longest - serving elected official in the United States .
He is , I think , the only person I have ever seen standing beside a statue of himself .
The merchants of Richmond recently paid for a slightly - larger - than - life bronze likeness of the mayor which stands proudly just a short distance from the front door of his office .
Mr Moore , a frugal guardian of the public purse , is quick to point out that the statue did not cost a cent of local taxpayers ' money .
Words of advice Harry Truman was just beginning his second term as president when Mr Moore was first elected , and America is about to inaugurate its twelfth president since then , so it seemed like a good idea to ask him what advice he would offer the new incumbent in the White House .
Do the most good you can for the most people , with the money you have
Hilmar Moore , Mayor of Richmond Mr Moore , an independent in a largely Republican state , is impressed by Barack Obama 's intelligence and fluency and scathing of what he sees as the reckless adventurism of his fellow - Texan George W Bush in Iraq .
He has had time to think about the essence of government and over the years he has boiled it down to this : " Do the most good you can for the most people , with the money you have . "
That is a kind of catechism for pragmatists , but we had travelled to Texas to see how a state which voted Republican again ( as it nearly always does ) had reacted to what amounts to a resounding defeat in a battle of ideas .
In Campaign 2008 , America essentially rejected a familiar offering from Republicans - small government and smaller taxes - in favour of a rather different vision from Barack Obama , an intelligent technocrat who represents the belief that government , properly directed , can be a force for good .
' No atheists in foxholes '
Two factors helped him : first George W Bush was not very good at producing smaller government .
He did cut taxes , but if you do that without cutting spending at the same time you end up with huge budget deficits .
Luxury goods are still in demand in Houston
And then of course , during the sudden banking crisis very few voices were raised in favour of letting every bank brought low by its own greed or folly simply go bust .
In the same way that it 's said there are no atheists in foxholes , it turns out there are not too many swashbuckling free - marketeers in recessions either .
Many of the voices that did advance that brutal philosophy though were raised in Texas .
Congressman Ted
Poe attacked the original concept of the banking bailout with the words : " Small businesses , mom and pop grocery stores do n't get this break when they make bad financial decisions - they go out of business .
But the rich and famous Wall Street fat cats expect Joe Sixpack to buck it up and pay for all this nonsense . "
Texas is still Texas and while Democrats can point to good returns in the presidential race in some key areas ( including Houston ) this is still a red state .
So there are still plenty of Republican voters to defend the ideas which underlie American conservative politics ( even if none of them seemed prepared to argue that Mr Bush had done a good job with the economy ) .
' Trickle - down ' economics I met the businessman Frank Jordan at a Chamber of Commerce lunch in the town of Liberty Texas .
I do n't believe that the government has demonstrated that it does anything all that incredibly well from education to welfare to anything other than the defence of the country
Frank Jordan , businessman
He is still a stout defender of the philosophy behind " trickle - down " economics which is the theory that if the state leaves money untaxed in the hands of wealthy private citizens then they will spend money and spread prosperity .
The idea may have crashed to a resounding defeat at the ballot - box but Mr Jordan is undaunted .
" I 'd rather have trickle - down prosperity than trickle - up poverty .
I do n't believe that the government has demonstrated that it does anything all that incredibly well from education to welfare to anything other than the defence of the country , " he argues .
The bottom line in all of this is that Republicans lost the election for a whole variety of reasons .
An unpopular outgoing president , a tired - looking candidate , and the iron fact that incumbent parties do not win during recessions all spring to mind .
But the circumstances of the moment were surely an overwhelming factor .
Pendulum swings
The depth of the financial crisis prompted even George W Bush 's administration into planning to use vast amounts of state money in an extensive programme of intervention .
A voter could be forgiven for concluding that if state intervention is going to be the order of the day then you may as well elect a political party that believes in it , and a presidential candidate who can provide a thoughtful rationale for it .
Downtown Houston has avoided the economic downturn so far
The political scientist Bob Stein who has been analysing the results of the election has detected an interesting trend among the data which reflects the mood of the times and puts it like this : " Attacking government per se is not going to advantage any candidate any more .
" People are going to want to know , ' What are you going to do to fix it ? ' and Obama simply was at the right place at the right time and was the most articulate of spokespersons on this , " says Mr Stein .
So this time around Texas remained defiantly Republican while the pendulum of American politics swung the other way .
There is no telling when the pendulum will move back but it is clear that for now outside the Lone Star State America is a cold house for ideas of small government , small tax and limited state regulation which for now at least , are seen to have failed .

Bolivia 's Indian ethnic groups are largely supportive of Mr Morales ' plans
Bolivians have backed a new constitution that aims to empower the country 's indigenous majority , partial results from a referendum show .
With about 30 % of the vote counted , some 53 % of the voters supported the changes , electoral officials said .
But at least four of Bolivia 's nine regions voted " No " .
President Evo Morales claimed victory in the referendum that would also allow Bolivia 's first indigenous leader to stand for a second consecutive term .
Addressing supporters outside the presidential palace , he said the result marked the birth of a new Bolivia .
" Brothers and sisters , the colonial state ends here , " President Morales , an Aymara Indian , told crowds in front of the presidential palace in La Paz after results emerged .
" Now Bolivia is being re-founded , " he said .
" Here we begin to reach true equality for all Bolivians . "
Evo Morales is Bolivia 's first indigenous president Support for Mr Morales was highest in the western highlands where indigenous people form the majority .
" A new era is starting now in which indigenous people will be the citizens of this country .
I think this is the most important part of this constitution , " said Elisa Canqui , who represents one of the Indian communities in La Paz .
Only some 50 years ago Indians of Aymara and Quechua descent were not allowed to walk in the central square of La Paz .
Now the new charter will give sweeping rights to Bolivia 's 36 indigenous groups in the areas of government , the judiciary and land holdings .
Opponents
But the polarisation that has dogged the country since Mr Morales took office in 2006 is unlikely to diminish , says BBC Latin America analyst James Painter .
Many Bolivians of European or mixed - race descent in the fertile eastern lowlands , which hold rich gas deposits and are home to extensive farms , rejected the charter .
KEY REFORMS Re-election : Allows Mr Morales to stand for re-election in Dec 2009 Indigenous rights : Stresses importance of ethnicity in Bolivia 's make - up .
A whole chapter devoted to indigenous rights Autonomy : Power decentralised , four levels of autonomy - departmental , regional , municipal and indigenous Resources :
Sets out state control over key economic sectors , state sovereignty over vast natural gas fields Judiciary : Indigenous systems of justice same status as official existing system .
Judges will be elected , and no longer appointed by Congress .
Land : New limit on ownership 5,000 hectares ( 12,355 ) .
But measure not retroactive .
Reform struggle ahead
The referendum was badly defeated in the opposition strongholds of Santa Cruz , Tarija , Beni and Pando , early results suggested .
" The ' No ' vote has put the brakes on the fools who wanted to destroy our country , " said opposition leader and Santa Cruz Governor Ruben Costas .
The original draft of the constitution was more radical but Mr Morales made concessions after violent protests against his rule , including a promise that he would not try to win a third term in 2014 .
Elections are set for December , when the president , vice - president and Congress will be chosen .
Under pressure from wealthy ranchers , who feared their farms would be broken up and handed over to the poor , Mr Morales also revised the charter so that limits on land holdings will only apply to future land sales .
The new constitution enshrines state control over key economic sectors , and grants greater autonomy not only for the nine departments but also for indigenous communities .
But these clauses regarding layers of autonomy could lead to a raft of competing claims , correspondents say .
The exact implementation of the new charter is also far from certain .
Several articles have to be approved in Congress where Mr Morales does not have a majority in the Senate .
Analysts say that another problem facing the Morales administration is that in the last three years it has benefited from the commodity boom but is now facing a major fall in the price of its main exports , minerals and gas .
Final results are expected in about 10 days .

O.J. Simpson has been sentenced to 15 years in prison , with consecutive terms that could extend his time behind bars 2 ½ years or more .
A Las Vegas jury had found the former gridiron star , 61 , guilty of armed robbery and kidnapping on Oct. 3 – 13 years to the day after his acquittal in the so - called trial of the century for the 1994 murders of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , in Los Angeles .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
The conviction that led to Friday ’s sentencing resulted from a six - minute incident in 2007 that took place in a down - market Las Vegas hotel room , where Simpson struggled with two sports memorabilia dealers over items that Simpson claimed were his possessions .
Simpson remained calm while his tough sentence was delivered by Nevada judge Jackie Glass .
The judge stressed that she was not sentencing him for any previous actions besides those for which he was currently on trial – an obvious reference to the deaths of Brown and Goldman .
The judge added that she respected the decision of the jury in the current case .
“ The problem is that I ca n’t ignore that the behavior at the time … was reckless … A gun was used … property was stolen … and now I will sentence you , ” Judge Glass said .
Simpson – who made a disjointed statement to the court apologizing for his actions , but denying he knew they were illegal – was denied bail and was led from the courtroom in dark blue prison attire .
Speaking outside the courthouse , Fred Goldman , the father of Ron Goldman said , “ There ’s never closure , Ron is always gone , but what we have is satisfaction that this monster is behind bars where he belongs . ”
Neither Simpson nor his co-defendant and former golfing buddy , Clarence “ C.J. ” Stewart , testified at the Las Vegas trial .
Simpson ’s lawyer , Yale Galanter , argued that investigators targeted Simpson and filed overblown charges and that there was no criminal intent .

Enlarge By Dave Getzschman LinkedIn founder and CEO Reid Hoffman expects more growth next year .
LIVING UP TO ITS NAME LIVING UP TO ITS NAME LinkedIn is one company that appears to live up to its name , according to an independent study of 2,000 of its users and their annual income .
For example : Nearly 60 % have high personal incomes and either executive or consultant titles .
Users with incomes of $ 200,000 and $ 350,000 are seven times more likely than those with lower incomes to have more than 150 Linked In connections .
Executives make up 28 % of users , with an average annual income of $ 104,000 .
Consultants comprised 30 % of users , with an average salary of $ 93,000 .
Casual or new users had incomes of $ 88,000 or less .
Source : Anderson Analytics MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . 
Where everyone else sees economic gloom and doom , Reid Hoffman sees opportunity .
As the freshly minted CEO of LinkedIn ( and its founder ) , he is shepherding a moneymaking tech company in battered Silicon Valley .
And he anticipates more growth next year .
That is no small achievement .
The social - networking site , which lets business professionals create online profiles to seek jobs and network , is adding members faster than ever despite its own recent layoffs and a management shake - up .
" LinkedIn is the office , Facebook is the barbecue in the backyard , and MySpace is the bar , " says Hoffman , referring to the three major social - networking sites battling it out for millions of consumers and billions of dollars in online ads .
" Every individual is a small business or brand , " Hoffman says .
This month , he succeeded Dan Nye as CEO , whose two - year stint as chief executive was underscored by dramatic gains in members and revenue .
About 1 million people flock to the network every two weeks now , compared with 1 million per month earlier this year .
( The site has 33 million members from 8 million two years ago . )
Gaining momentum
The surge accelerated in early September , when murmurs of recession began to take hold and business professionals intensified their networking efforts .
Since then , LinkedIn has experienced a 14 % surge in recommendations its members make about each other , an 11 % increase in number of connections made between Linked In users , a 10 % jump in invitations sent , and a 9 % bump in page views .
Many of the gains have come from employees and laid - off workers in financial industries such as investment banking .
" I use it as a recruiting tool and as a way to network as more people use LinkedIn , " says Tim Whitman , a 36 - year - old public - relations specialist in Boston who has 335 connections .
" The economy is a factor .
But it is a great business - networking tool in today 's unstable work environment . "
With fewer jobs available , Hoffman and others expect a rush in online business networking .
" Many people — employed or not — will do project work as consultants , and look for clients , " he says .
Hoffman , meanwhile , expects good tidings in 2009 .
" We are poised to drive the company to the next level , " he says .
" Many ( potential members ) do not know how LI can help them , week after week . "
To reach the unfamiliar , Linked In this year revamped its site .
It unfurled a recruiting service for human - resource departments , a survey application for market research firms and several advertising services .
It launched a new search platform , mobile service , company profiles and a redesigned home page .
And it served up Spanish and French versions of the site .
LinkedIn's new additions have made it easier for its members to collaborate not just with co-workers but people outside of their jobs , says Jeremiah Owyang , an analyst at Forrester Research .
Big changes at the top
No tech company is immune to the economic downturn that has cost the industry tens of thousands of jobs this year .
Linked
In laid off 36 people , about 10 % of its staff , last month .
At the same time , LinkedIn has undergone an executive makeover for its next phase of growth .
It hired movers and shakers from Internet heavyweights Yahoo and Google — most notably former Yahoo executive Jeff Weiner , who had been mentioned as a possible candidate to replace departing Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang .
Weiner , who will report to Hoffman , will join as interim president for an unspecified time to oversee daily operations .
Earlier this month , Dipchand " Deep " Nishar , the former Google executive behind the search giant 's mobile business and other products , was picked to oversee LinkedIn 's development of products and services .
He replaces Hoffman in that role .
The changes come at a time when Linked In thinks it can add more members — and analysts say the site can do a better job of getting its millions of current members to use the site more .
" Linked
In has n't quite figured out how to encourage frequent participation , " says Marissa Gluck , an analyst at Radar Research .
Dave McClure , a start - up adviser and angel investor in Silicon Valley , thinks Linked In can improve its retention of customers .
But he says it remains " tops " among social - networking sites in creating revenue because it is the business network of choice .
" I 'm pretty confident they 'll go public in the next four to eight quarters unless someone makes them an absolutely huge offer , " McClure says .
Indeed , LinkedIn has not suffered a dip in advertising , which accounts for about 20 % of its revenue , and for which it commands some of the highest online ad rates .
This is especially impressive given an expected slowdown in online ad spending .
Spending grew 25 % , to $ 7.66 billion in 2008 , but growth should taper to 22 % in 2009 and 19 % in 2010 , Forrester Research says .
The business - contact site has prospered through banner ads from the likes of Porsche and Microsoft ; premium subscriptions for members ; job postings charged to corporations and small - business owners ; and corporate sales to Symantec , MTV and others .
Much of the growth came under the auspices of Nye , a veteran software executive who raised about $ 80 million in funding during his tenure as CEO .
He said he will remain aboard through January and continue to advise the company .
He characterized his departure as right for him and for Linked In .
" I am incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished — our business model , balance sheet and infrastructure are strong , " Nye says .
Nye leaves a legacy of a profitable company that has gobbled up revenue from advertising , online subscriptions , job listings , corporate sales and surveys .
Though company officials are now mum , six months ago , Linked In said it expected $ 75 million to $ 100 million in revenue this year .

With the holiday travel season coming upon us , we at
Of Cabbages and Kings
want to make your trips to visit family and friends as easy as possible .
And --
No
, we 're not going to send you Valium to drop into the family punch bowl at Thanksgiving ...
And
no ,
we are not creating an Private Impersonations business , where someone poses as an exact likeness of you for holiday gatherings so that way you , meanwhile , can go off to sunny Puerto Vallarta , to enjoy surf , sand and coladas ...
Nope , the way we plan to make your life easier , is by giving you some
helpful tips for getting through airport security without annoying them -- and molesting you .
As you know , tighter security restrictions at airports all over the world have made us safer , more secure , and less likely to put plastic explosives in our shoes .
But with those restrictions , come new processes .
And by knowing and understanding them in advance ,
you
can help keep the line moving ...
Get to your destination quickly and safely ...
And avoid any embarrassing body cavity searches by large men with small flashlights .
Based on my own personal airport travel experiences , I offer you the following tips :
_____________________________________________________________________________________
HOW TO DRESS FOR AIRTRAVEL
When dressing to travel by air , it 's helpful to think of yourself as a mental patient .
How would someone in a dangerous psych ward have to dress ?
That 's right -- no sharp objects , no metal , no sense of personal style .
To be more specific ...
Do n't wear a belt .
Belts can beep in the metal detectors and thus require you to be patted down and scanned by large men named Mongo .
It is better to lose your trousers and moon citizens of 19 different countries , than it is to meet Mongo , who is in a bad mood because his own family is sitting down without him to a giant turkey feast as we speak , and his obnoxious cousin Ray is getting the drumstick .
As alternatives to your traditional wardrobe , consider wearing :
Sweats
Draw string lounge pants
Homer Simpson pajamas
All of these are appropriate airport wear , and will only cause people to giggle and point once you reach your final destination .
In fact , just roll out of bed and go to the airport .
Jeans and dress slacks have rivets and may need belts .
So remember : they = Mongo
Do n't wear a metal watch .
You think you need to know the time regularly in order to make your connections .
But this is really just a rumor .
The metal wristwatch is the single largest reason metal detectors beep and passengers are taken into small backrooms by people dressed in black suits and sunglasses and then seen again 12 days later bruised and amnesic .
So , does being able to track every little iddy bitty moment of your trip seem that necessary now ?
Somehow I bet it does n't .
Forgo jewelry and metal hair accessories
. " It 's gold , " you say , indicating your bling , and insisting the detectors will ignore it .
Or " I need to see where I 'm going , " you reply , touching the barrette securing the bangs from your eyes .
Ah , but a single forgotten barrette going through security can mean the difference between making your destination , or spending quality time in a small glass booth in the airport .
Sure , people may admire your name written in giant fourteen carat gold lettering under normal circumstances .
But no one will be noticing it when you 're pressing your nose against that glass booth , steaming up the window with your screams , wondering when someone , anyone , is going to scan you so you can make your plane .
_____________________________________________________________________________________
HOW TO PACK FOR AIR TRAVEL
Packing smartly for your trip can make things easier for yourself as you go through airport security .
Regarding bringing fluids with you .
New airport regulations do not allow fluids in carry - on luggage over 3 ounce bottles in a quart sized Ziploc bag .
This means you must drain your entire body of blood and urine before passing through security .
Every person walking through the secure area must be a dry husk by law , so they cannot possibly use their bodily fluids to build any sort of detonation device .
See , what you may not be aware of is , urine contains ammonia .
And under the proper conditions , ammonia can be a very noxious gas .
Dehydration is the only way to absolutely ensure everyone remains safe .
Remember to cut off all fluids two days before any air travel plans .
Three ounce cup - sized beverages will be served on the plane .
NOTE :
You will now be charged $ 10 for all three ounce cup - sized beverages .
Regarding Carry - on Luggage .
Each passenger is allowed two pieces of carry - on luggage .
One must fit under the seat in front of you .
The other must be stowed in the overhead compartments .
Due to recent cutbacks , the size of the overhead compartments is now the size of a child 's lunchbox .
So remember -- your case must now be no larger than a nine inch by nine inch square .
Also , because recent flights may be overbooked , the seat width now comfortably fits actor Verne Troyer ( AKA " Mini - Me " ) .
You will want to slim down accordingly .
_____________________________________________________________________________________
HOW TO FOLLOW AIRPORT PROCEDURES
The process of getting through airport security is an important one , and it is as much about having the proper attitude as anything else .
The best overall advice I can give you is to approach all security agents as if you were approaching the Soup Nazi .
Polite , forward - moving , quiet , and no unnecessary greetings to startle them ...
Specifically , we recommend the following :
Do n't wait for that elderly lady who tries to merge in front of you .
You will " hold up the line . "
And security will yell at you for this .
Politeness does not matter in our secure world of today .
Run the elderly lady over .
Do n't get too eager about going through the metal detector , even if you 're the next in line .
Stay next to your own items on the conveyor belt and walk with them until they are scanned .
Or else , security will yell at you .
Remember , you could inadvertently stand next to the belongings of a person who has the nerve to carry 6 ounces of shampoo instead of 3 .
And that is a threat to our nation .

IT IS a measure of the prevailing gloom that the worst economic performance in 26 years could still be described as better than expected .
Real gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 3.8 % in the fourth quarter , below the decline of 5 % or more that many economists had anticipated .
However , there is precious little reason for optimism .
Almost all the unexpected growth came from a small rise in business inventories .
This is almost certainly because firms did not reduce production quickly enough to keep pace with slumping orders .
To get inventories back in line , more production cuts in the current quarter are likely .
Morgan Stanley had expected GDP to fall by 4.5 % in the current quarter , but now thinks it will fall by 5.5 % .
Other details are no less grim .
Consumer spending sank at a 3.5 % annual rate , similar to its third - quarter drop , despite a big rise in real after - tax income , thanks to the huge drop in petrol prices .
Spending and incomes went in opposite directions because once - profligate consumers are now trying to save more .
They put aside 2.9 % of their income ( after tax ) in the fourth quarter , the highest rate since the beginning of 2002 .
They are doing so either by choice , because retirement savings have been devastated and they fear losing their jobs , or by necessity , because it has become so difficult to borrow .
Businesses are cutting back more savagely .
Their investment sank by 19 % , worse than any quarter in the 2001 recession which was , after all , a business investment - led slump .
And that was despite some firms boosting spending to exploit a temporary tax benefit that expired at the end of the year .
Both exports and imports fell sharply , leaving no net impact on GDP ( lower imports raise the calculation of GDP , while lower exports reduce it ) .
Matters are likely to get worse .
The dollar has strengthened in recent months and much of the rest of the world is in worse shape than America .
According to JPMorgan , the economy in Britain probably shrank at an annual rate of 5.9 % in the fourth quarter , the euro - area by 5 % , and Japan by a heart - stopping 9 % , in a country with no housing bubble or banking crisis .
If there is any silver lining , it is that while the recession was a year old in December , its first half was not especially deep : net GDP actually rose in the first half , and the downturn is actually a bit milder than the median post - war recession after 12 months .
But the typical post - war recession was over ( or close to it ) by this point ; this one is getting worse .
Claims for unemployment insurance were high in January , sales of new homes slumped in December , and several big companies , most recently Starbucks , Boeing and Sprint Nextel , have announced thousands of job cuts .
Faint though it is , there is a glimmer of hope in financial markets : interest rates on short - term loans between banks and on longer - term corporate debt have fallen notably since the autumn , and there has been a flood of new bond issues .
But that may simply be evidence that investors no longer expect a catastrophic wave of bankruptcies .
It does not mean that either companies or consumers are about to open their wallets .
What could turn this around ?
Most recessions end as companies clear excess inventories and as households , with a boost from lower interest rates , release pent - up demand for cars and houses .
This time is different .
Tightened credit severely limits the ability of consumers and companies to spend even if they were so inclined .
More than usual , an end to this recession will depend on policy .
Enormous hopes are riding on Barack Obama 's $ 819 billion stimulus package , which has passed the House of Representatives and is now being debated in the Senate .
Of that sum , just $ 170 billion will find its way into the economy before this fiscal year ends on September 30th , largely in the form of expanded unemployment insurance benefits and reduced income tax which will make their mark within months .
But most of the impact will be next year because infrastructure funds , even once the money is available , takes a long time to be spent as federal , state and local governments secure the necessary approvals and seek bids for the work .
“ Even ‘ shovel ready ' projects will not need shovels for some time , ” notes Economics from Washington , a consultancy .
Still , the package will help .
The Congressional Budget Office thinks that GDP by the end of 2009 will be between 1.3 % and 3.6 % higher than it otherwise would have been , thanks to the stimulus .
It had thought that the unemployment rate would rise from 7.2 % in December to 9 % by the end of this year ; with the stimulus in place , it thinks it will only rise to between 7.9 % and 8.6 % .
But more must be done .
“ The real problem is a feedback loop from the economy to credit losses , ” says Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley .
The fiscal stimulus will achieve little until that is fixed .
Thus the administration 's real work lies ahead : coming up with a bigger and more comprehensive plan for recapitalising banks and relieving them of bad loans .

Meiron Gestman , a computer engineer from Ramat Gan , discovered to his surprise on Monday that he could not purchase a scarf online from the London - based Pashmina company .
The reason for this was that the company which he wished to order from had joined a boycott against Israel due to the military operation in Gaza .
FreedomCall No Longer Free British telecom firm severs ties with Israeli counterparts Meir Orbach UK 's FreedomCall informs Israeli company of decision via email , blames Gaza operation British telecom firm severs ties with Israeli counterparts
Behind the boycott is a British organization of Muslim consumers , who have imposed a boycott on Israel as well as all Jewish - owned American companies in protest against the fighting in Gaza and the US 's support for Israel in the battle .
The boycott received a warm welcome by many British internet sites , especially those related to Islam , and reports have been published by British newspapers .
However Pashmina stressed to Gestman that it was only boycotting Israel , not all Jews .
' Pashmina ' is not the only British company to have joined the boycott .
Last week ' FreedomCall ' , a telecom company based in the UK , terminated all communications with the Israeli MobileMax following the Gaza operation .
The British - Muslim websites recommend boycotting a number of large firms , most of which manufacture products in Israel and all of which sell their products in Israel .
Among these are AOL , Coca - Cola , Delta - Galilee , Estee Lauder , Johnson and Johnson , Marks and Spencer , Revlon , Starbucks , McDonalds , Danone , Disney , IBM , Kimberly , Nestle , Nokia , and Intel .
' Captives of Arab propoganda '
" I tried to convince the person who sent the email that he 's wrong , " Gestman told Ynet .
" They 're just captives of the successful propaganda of the Arab side , and I wanted to help explain our side .
They see things very superficially and one - sidedly .
" I asked him whether he boycotted American products because of what they did in Iraq or whether he was boycotting Palestinian products because they were firing missiles on kindergartens in Israel .
He did n't really know what to say and answered pretty stupidly . "
The email sent to Gestman in reply to his questions said the company had boycotted other countries , such as Myanmar .
It said the boycott was imposed out of shock at the number of civilians killed by Israel , but did not wish to undermine the suffering of Israelis or any victims wherever they may be .
The company did not respond to any of Ynet 's emails .
Britain has been known for a number of boycotts against Israel , among these an academic boycott and a consumer boycott .
The boycotts have had few economic ramifications , and the British government has consistently opposed them .
They cannot win on the arguments ; indeed , they have been proven so catastrophically wrong on the arguments that they have decided not even to fight this campaign on issues but on personalities .
But they do care about power , and this Telegraph story suggests that Bill Kristol was a powerful motor behind the absurdity of Sarah Palin 's candidacy :
Sources in the McCain camp , the Republican Party and Washington think tanks say Mrs Palin was identified as a potential future leader of the neoconservative cause in June 2007 .
That was when the annual summer cruise organised by the right - of - centre Weekly Standard magazine docked in Juneau , the Alaskan state capital , and the pundits on board took tea with Governor Palin ...
Now many believe that the " neocons " , whose standard bearer in government , Vice President Dick Cheney , lost out in Washington power struggles to the more moderate defence secretary Robert Gates and secretary of state Condoleezza Rice , last year are seeking to mould Mrs Palin to renew their influence .
A former Republican White House official , who now works at the American Enterprise Institute , a bastion of Washington neoconservatism , admitted : " She 's bright and she 's a blank page .
She 's going places and it's worth going there with her . "
Asked if he sees her as a " project " , the former official said : " Your word , not mine , but I would n't disagree with the sentiment . "
In so many ways , Palin is the apotheosis of the neocon dream .
She siphons the religious fanaticism of the base to support war on behalf of what the neocons believe is in Israel 's and America 's interests .
The goal is war against Iran and Russia .
And a further deepening of the occupation of Iraq .

Earlier this year I was invited by the BBC to visit the last surviving British soldier who fought in the trenches during the first world war .
He 's called Harry Patch and lives in a nursing home in Wells , Somerset ; in 1917 , aged 19 , he was a Lewis gunner in the Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry and took part in the battle of Passchendaele .
I weighed the invitation in my mind for a split - second , then said yes .
I 'd grown up with the army at the borders of my life - my grandfather had fought in Flanders in 1918 , and my father in France and Germany from D - day until the end of the second world war .
Although neither of them had shown any interest in poetry , my own devotion to it had first been stimulated by reading Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon at school .
I 'd written my graduate thesis and then a book on Edward Thomas , who was killed at Arras in 1917 .
I 'd visited the battlefields of that region several times - once with my father , on the 60th anniversary of the D - day landings .
I 'd edited an anthology of first - world - war poetry .
Meeting Harry , I thought , would connect the writing to its circumstances in a uniquely powerful way .
And so it did .
After a train - ride to Bristol , then a drive along the misty switch - back to Wells , I found Harry 's nursing home among the suburbs .
The staff told me how to get the best from him : he might be amazingly robust for someone 110 years old , but 110 was 110 .
I should speak up , talk slowly , repeat myself if necessary .
The more advice I was given , the more sharply I sensed the difficulty ahead .
For the past several years Harry had been seeing radio people , TV people , historians and well - wishers at a pretty steady rate .
Although he told everyone he was " just an ordinary chap " , and " not a hero " , he 'd come to be seen as just that .
It evidently made him feel awkward , as well as pleased .
Equally obviously , he 'd developed a way of protecting himself by sticking to the same few stories - stories I 'd already come across in the autobiography he published with the help of his friend Richard van Emden , The Last Fighting Tommy .
My most difficult job would be to surprise Harry back into his old self ; the danger would be that this might distress him .
Lights , cameras , action .
Harry was brought into the room in a wheelchair - little and frail but , given his great age , astonishingly spry -looking .
Blue blazer and grey trousers .
A sparrow - body .
A twinkle in his eyes .
Medals pinned to his chest .
I shook his hand , then held it for a moment .
I had expected to be moved , but not this much .
The fingers felt fragile as twigs ; 91 years ago they had picked up a machine gun and aimed it across No Man 's Land .
For a moment I could n't speak .
Harry was grinning at me .
He 'd seen this kind of thing before .
We started talking and , sure enough , Harry 's conversation fell into the same shape as the autobiography : his childhood in Combe Down outside Bath , the initial reluctance to join up in 1914 , conscription , Passchendaele , the shell that killed three of his mates in the Lewis team , his own wounding and recovery in Blighty , his work as a plumber , then the long later part of his life , in which he was nearly killed again , serving as a fireman in the Bristol blitz .
Harry 's voice was very low , almost worn out , and I had to bend close to catch what he said .
There were lengthy pauses , too , before he answered some of my questions .
To start with , I thought these were to allow him to collect his memories .
Gradually I realised they were to let him collect himself .
Even though so much time had passed , some of his memories still appalled him .
Or maybe they had grown even more appalling over time .
Harry fought in France for just a few months before he was wounded and sent home but , partly no doubt as a result of being asked to remember the war again and again , and partly as a result of some natural process , it was clear that his war experience lay at the top of his mind like a still - lethal grenade .
One scene was especially difficult for him to describe - when he went over the top and stumbled on the body of another soldier , a boy , really .
" He was ripped open from his shoulder to his waist by shrapnel , and was lying in a pool of blood .
When we got to him , he looked at us and said , ' Shoot me . ' "
He was beyond all human help , and before we could draw a revolver he was dead .
And the final word he uttered was ' Mother . ' "
By the time our conversation ended , I had forgotten the cameras and all the other paraphernalia of filming .
Harry 's whispered descriptions , still amazingly vivid with detail and compassion , had drawn me completely into his world .
Various misconceptions had been corrected : how , for instance , he and thousands of others had been reluctant to enlist as soon as the war broke out - I 'd been raised on the idea that everyone rushed to slaughter , like they do in Philip Larkin 's poem MCMXIV , innocently thinking the war was " an August bank holiday lark " .
Or how much human comradeship survived long into the war , regardless of nationality : Harry was always careful to shoot his enemy in the legs " and no higher " unless he thought his life was in danger .
These felt like valuable corrections to received wisdom about the war .
Even more fascinating was hearing how everything in Harry 's life before 1914 now seemed coloured by the - war - in- anticipation ( memories of creeping along vegetable - trenches as a child ) , and how everything after the war had been affected by it in recollection ( having to ask nurses not to turn on the light in the airing - cupboard opposite his room , because the flash took him back to the trenches ) .
One way or another , the few months Harry served in France now entirely dominate the 1,300 months he has lived elsewhere .
Before we said goodbye , Harry breathed me a joke : he thought that because he'd been alive for such a long time , he might as well go on for ever .
What he meant , in all modest seriousness , was that he knew his own value as one of the very few who are still able to say , " The war was like this ; I was there . "
This , in turn , means that he is also one of the very few whose eyes we can look into and imagine we see what they saw , whose hands we can hold and feel they are leading us back through time .
To sit in his company is to feel the flow between " then " and " now " is unbroken .
And when Harry and the others are no longer with us ?
Then our sense of the war as " history " will become different , simply because it will lack this particular connection .
But it will be a subtle difference , because it 's already abundantly clear there 's no danger of the war being suddenly forgotten , or made to seem irrelevant to our sense of what Europe and the world has to avoid repeating .
In fact , during the last generation or so , and for reasons that have to do with much more than the survival of Harry and a few other veterans , the first world war has been identified by common consent as one of the great turning points in our history .
In the immediate aftermath , people did what they could to put it behind them - as they did again after the second world war .
( My own father , in a way that was typical of his generation , said almost nothing to me about his life in the army , no matter how much I prodded him . )
But in the long western European peace since 1945 , the first world war has loomed larger and larger in our imaginations .
It was once described as the war to end all wars .
Over time , it has become the war by which most others are measured - in spite of all the obvious differences in weaponry , motive , duration , everything .
In the process , it has also become more and more clearly the event which made us " modern " - both in the sense that it accelerated the growth of our democratic structures , and loosened old class strictures , and because it made the whole population familiar with barbarity , suffering and loss on a scale never seen before .
Ninety years on from the Armistice , we look at the events of 1914 - 18 and think we are examining our national psychic wound .
That 's why Remembrance Day parades and ceremonies are given so much press and other kinds of attention these days ( perhaps even more attention than previously , but these things are hard to measure ) .
They exist to commemorate the dead of all wars , but they invariably revolve around images associated with the trenches - the heart - jolting pictures of people like Harry Patch floundering in the mud , or scrabbling over the lip of a trench and almost immediately being shot down .
And throughout the rest of the year they are fed by other elements of national life .
By the pathos and ubiquity of the large - scale memorials in our cities , and the smaller monuments in our villages - often recording the deaths of several members of the same family .
By the way poetry of the first world war is drip - fed from the national curriculum into almost all our children as they become teenagers .
( To the extent that even the best poets of other wars , such as Keith Douglas , are not studied at all , or made to seem somehow less good , because they do n't conform to the criteria of war poetry established by Owen , Sassoon , et al. )
All these are reasons for thinking that when Harry Patch is no longer with us , the Great War will keep its eagle - grasp on our imaginations .
Unlike the Hundred Years War , or the Napoleonic wars , it 's feeling of closeness is continually refreshed by the monuments that stand at the heart of our communities , and by the fact that very many families cherish the memories of ancestors who were involved .
Unlike more recent and contemporary wars , shocking as these are , it still feels on our doorstep , recollected in landscapes we recognise , and involving our neighbours as well as ourselves .
A good many poets writing after the first world war - sometimes long after it - have tried to catch this combination of immediacy and distance .
Ted Hughes and Michael Longley are both especially good at it .
Longley , indeed , is evidently so haunted by memories of his father 's experience in the trenches , and by his own sympathetic identification with Edward Thomas , that he often writes about the war as if he had fought in it himself - and feels continually a prey to its images and remembrances .
This is his short poem Pine Marten , for instance :
That stuffed pine marten in the hotel corridor
Ended up on all fours in nineteen - thirteen
And now is making it across No Man's Land
where
A patrol of gamekeepers keeps missing him .
In his curiosity about the war , and his skill in showing how it touched and touches all aspects of life , and not just the lives of soldiers in the frontline , Longley is exemplary .
His poems tell us that we are all survivors of the war - not just because we might happen to have relatives who fought in it , but because its footprint is still visible somewhere near where we live , and because our sense of good fortune at living in a peaceful Europe is constantly animated by evidence from elsewhere that things could be otherwise .
He confirms our communal sense that the first world war looms at the threshold of how we think about ourselves as citizens in our own later world .
It is part horror - show , part cautionary tale , and partly heroic example .
That 's why Harry Patch and the few other survivors are so important to us .
Even in their frailty , they make these things intimate .
We wo n't entirely lose this when they are gone , but we will have to work harder to find it elsewhere .
In the stones , and statues , and archives , and exhibitions , and , on Remembrance Day , in the notes of bugles calling from sad shires .
• On Saturday , the Guardian begins a unique week - long series on the history of the first world war , in the form of seven free 32 - page booklets , with contemporary essays on the key themes of the war plus extracts and poems from writers including Ernest Hemingway , DH Lawrence , HG Wells , Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen .
· This article was amended on Saturday November 8 2008 .
Harry Patch , the last surviving British soldier who fought in the trenches during the first world war , is 110 , not 109 as we originally said several times in the article above .
This has been corrected .
Your personal happiness can be measured by your social network
Are your friends happy ?
What about their friends ?
These people , new research suggests , will have a profound impact on your own personal satisfaction .
Like an influenza outbreak , happiness – and misery too – spread through social networks , affecting people through three degrees of separation .
For instance , a happy friend of a friend of a friend increases the chances of personal happiness by about 6 % ( see graphic , right ) .
Compare that to research showing that a $ 5000 income bump ups the odds by just 2 % , says James Fowler , a political scientist at the University of California , San Diego , who led the new study .
“ Even people we do n’t know and have never met have bigger effect on our mood than substantial increases in income , ” he says .

He and colleague Nicholas Christakis , of Boston ’s Harvard Medical School , made the connection by mining 53,228 social connections between 5124 people who took part in a decades - long clinical study .
Emotional ripples
As part of the Framingham Heart Study , participants updated researchers on their social contacts and health status , including happiness , as measured by a standard psychological questionnaire .
Many participants listed several other study participants , allowing the researchers to connect social dots .
Fowler and Christakis took a similar approach to document how obesity and cigarette smoking permeated through the same social network .
Even more than smoking and obesity , happiness spreads best at close distances , they found .
A happy next - door neighbour ups the odds of person happiness by 34 % , a sibling who lives within 1 mile ( 1.6 kilometres ) by 14 % , and a friend within half a mile by a whopping 42 % .
The effect falls off through the network , with friends ’ happiness boosting the chances of personal happiness by an average of 15 % and friends of friends by 10 % .
As with obesity and smoking , Fowler and Christakis detected no effect beyond three degrees of separation .
While there might be six degrees of separation between any two people , “ there are three degrees of influence , ” Christakis says .
Fowler theorises that beyond three connections , a kind of social dissonance saps the transmission of behaviour , almost like a wave .
“ If you drop one pebble in a pond , it will create ripples out from the pebble , ” he says .
“ That ’s not what ’s happening here .
You have a whole handful of pebbles and you ’re throwing them in the pond at once . ”
Contagious feeling
In the case of happiness , dour sentiments contain its infective spread .
Fowler and Christakis found that each happy contact increases a person ’s odds of happiness by an average of 9 % , while an unhappy contact decreases those odds by 7 % .
The long - time collaborators even bet over which emotion would spread more potently .
“ I think that happiness is more likely to spread because here ’s an emotion that ’s about social cohesion , ” says Fowler .
Visible and contagious happiness might have helped our ancestors maintain social cohesion .
“ In this rare occasion , James was right and I was wrong , ” Christakis admits .
“ It ’s pleasurable to be near other happy individuals and not near other unhappy individuals . ”
Ruut Veenhoven , a sociologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam , Netherlands , editor of the Journal of Happiness Studies , and curator of the World Database of Happiness agrees .
“ Happy people are typically more involved , are nicer to their kids and their dog , and live longer , ” he says .
The study , which he describes as “ terribly creative ” , might even help people improve their daily lives .
“ If you want to make people happier , you know at least how it spreads . ”

A reader writes :
Opiate painkilling drugs are in critically short supply across the developing world .
So why does n't the USA just buy the Afghan poppy harvest , process it into painkilling meds , and distribute them to poor countries ?
1 . This would cut off the Taliban 's chief source of funding .
2 . It would put the average Afghan farmer on the side of the US - supported government instead of the Taliban .
3 . It would play to our strength -- money .
The Taliban has more local knowledge , more time , more patience , more willingess to shed innocent blood .
But we have more money .
They might be able to outfight us , out - corrupt us , or out - terrorize us , but they can't outbid us .
4 . It would put the US on record as alleviating suffering all over the world .
5 . By fighting the Taliban with dollars instead of ( as many ) soldiers , we 'd suffer a lot fewer killed and maimed Americans .
6 . It might even be cheaper .
Soldiers , tanks , planes , humvees , night vision goggles , bullets , Predator drones , etc. are really , really , expensive .
In two weeks The National Organics Standards Board is expected to vote in Washington on what kinds of fish can actually be labeled organic .
Tell Washington what YOU think by signing a petition from the Consumer ’s Union .
[ social_buttons ]
We ’re all pretty clear on what “ organic ” means when it comes to vegetables , poultry and red meat , but what about fish ?
This is a question that has been on our radar for quite some time .
There is a limited amount of seafood being sold as organic at stores in the US but oftentimes these products were certified in other countries .
The organic fish question still has us scratching our heads , because as of yet there has been no “ official ” organic designation when it comes to seafood in the US .
That ’s about to change .
The National Organics Standards Board is “ recommending ” that fish can be organic even if they ’ve been fed wild fish .
Thus wild fish that are carnivorous could be considered organic .
This is controversial as many wild fish live in environments high in toxins such as mercury and PCB’s .
“ If you ca n’t call a wild Alaska salmon true and organic , ” asked Senator Lisa Murkowski , a Republican from Alaska , “ what can you call organic ? ”
The board also recommends that fish raised in “ open ocean net pens ” should be labeled organic .
These types of fish farms , however , are extremely polluting and release immense amounts of waste into the environment .
What ’s encouraging , is that YOU can have a say in what standards are officially adopted for organic fish .
The vote happens in two weeks , and the Consumer ’s Union has created a petition addressed to the National Organics Standards Board .
The petition asks that the organic fish label stand for as high a level of purity as possible .
Read and sign the Consumer ’s Union petition .
And stay tuned for an update !

A Co Roscommon mother - of - six has been to sentenced seven years in prison after pleading guilty to incest , sexual assault and neglect of her children .
The woman was told by the sentencing judge she had destroyed the lives of her six children who " from the moment they were born knew nothing but cruelty and neglect " .
Minister for Children Barry Andrews expressed his " absolute shock and abhorrence " at the facts of the case and said he had been informed today by the HSE that a preliminary investigation into the circumstances is already underway .
Children 's rights bodies and Opposition parties called for a full independent inquiry into the case and the ISPCC said the planned referendum on children 's rights should now be held .
Judge Miriam Reynolds , who also placed the accused on the Sex Offenders ' Register , said it was the first known case of a woman having been convicted of incest .
She said that in imposing sentence she was bound by legislation that was 101 years old , the Punishment of Incest Act 1908 .
Under the Act , a man coming before the court on this charge would face life in prison but the maximum sentence for a woman was seven years , the judge said .
She said she believed that women should be treated equally before the law .
The way the legislation was drafted showed that it was not even contemplated by society at the time that a woman could be the perpetrator or instigator in the crime of incest , she added
Imposing sentence at Roscommon Circuit Court , Judge Reynolds said that any possibility of a normal and happy life had been stolen from the six children at the centre of this case by " the woman who calls herself their mother " .
She pointed out that even now " these poor children were clinging to the hope " that their mother might get her act together and that they could go home .
She told the 40 - year - old accused that she had " cast a long and dark shadow " over the lives of her children .
The court heard harrowing evidence of how the woman had forced one son to have sex with her when he was just 13 years old and she was 36 .
The judge also heard that the children who were shunned at school because they smelled and were covered with lice and fleas , were forced to live in squalor , in a freezing , filthy home , over - run with mice and rats , where there was often no food , no heat and where rubbish was dumped in every room .
The judge said she did not know how the children could in the future be able to cope given what they had endured .
" Six lives have been destroyed .
There is no other way of putting it . "
Judge Reynolds said the children felt guilty and felt as if they had done something wrong .
" I want to assure them they did not , " she stressed .
The judge said that even at this stage she was being told that one of the teenage children who had contemplated suicide , might harm herself if her mother was imprisoned .
The judge stressed that this child was not responsible for her mother 's actions .
She said it was difficult for this girl and for all the children because the person they expected to nurture and look after and protect them had in fact been their abuser .
Counsel for the accused , Bernard Madden SC , had pointed out that a victim impact report suggested that one of the woman 's daughters had very mixed emotions about her mother and that she longed to be with her .
This child felt she was being punished by being put in care , she had been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder and had talked about wanting to kill herself .
Counsel expressed concern that if the child¿s mother was sentenced that this could be a precipitating factor " in her doing something she should not do " .
Before imposing sentence the judge said she was taking into account the fact that the mother had pleaded guilty , thus saving her children , who had been through so much from the added trauma of having to give evidence .
That would have been " an appalling vista " given that some of the children were still of tender years .
Describing this as a " final act of mercy " by the mother , the judge said it was perhaps " the only act of kindness she ever bestowed on them since they were born " .
As their mother the accused had " a very particular position of trust " in the household but the trust had been shattered .
" There was violence .
She had dominion over them , " said Judge Reynolds .
Mr Madden had told the court that his client accepted responsibility for her actions and wanted to apologise to her children for her failures and for her role in destroying their lives .
She accepted she had done irreparable harm to the children she bore .
Her biggest regret was the loss of her children and the fact that they must hold her in contempt , given what she had done and what she had allowed to happen to them .
The accused was sentenced to six years in prison on each of the two incest charges .
Two sentences of seven years were imposed on the charges of sexual assault on her son - which carry a maximum sentence of 14 years .
Des Dockerey BL , counsel for the State , pointed out that three of the offences of willful neglect and ill - treatment of her children were committed before the Children 's
Act 2001 came into force and therefore the maximum sentence was two years .
Three further counts of neglect were dated from 2002 to 2004 and carried a maximum penalty of seven years .
Judge Reynolds imposed sentences of 18 months each for the three earlier charges and of six years each for the three later neglect charges .
All sentences are to run concurrently from today .
Verizon has been awarded $ 33.15 m in a cybersquatting lawsuit against a shady domain aggregator that registered hundreds of websites using the telco 's name and trademarks .
In a default judgment this week , a federal court in Northern California ruled this week that OnlineNIC should pay $ 50,000 for each of the 633 domains Verizon claims were created specifically to be confused with legitimate Verizon brands .
According to the lawsuit filed in June 2008 , OnlineNIC used an automated process to claim sites such as verizononline.com , myverizonwireless.com , 123verizonphones.com , accountverizonwireless.com , and iphoneverizonplans.com .
The fake Verizon sites hosted ad links and pop-under advertisements that resulted in revenue for OnlineNIC .
Verizon calls the decision " the largest cybersquatting judgment ever " – which is probably a bit far - reaching unless the company follows the ancient Mayan calendar in which the universe ends in 2012 .
And that award could be $ 22 zillion , for all it matters - the real trick will be collecting it .
No one appeared in court on OnlineNIC 's behalf , and Verizon itself can't figure out exactly who 's behind the scheme , according to court documents .
Verizon claims that OnlineNIC conceals its owners ' true identities and involvement by using numerous shell entities , fictitious businesses , and personal names for ICANN registration .
The firm also allegedly deletes infringing domains within five days and then re-registers to avoid paying registration costs and to avoid detection by trademark owners .
OnlineNIC claims to be based in San Francisco , although its website offers an Oakland , California mailing address .
Court filings show that Verizon was unable to find a correct mailing address for any OnlineNIC employees at which to serve the court summons .
Nevertheless , in a statement Verizon says that the judgment " should send a clear message and serve to deter cybersquatters who continue to run businesses for the primary purpose of misleading consumers . "
Microsoft and Yahoo also have similar lawsuits currently pending against OnlineNIC . ®

Collateral damage is defined as : " Unintentional or incidental injury or damage to persons or objects that would not be lawful military targets in the circumstances ruling at the time .
Such damage is not unlawful so long as it is not excessive in light of the overall military advantage anticipated from the attack .
" Now look at this extract from the latest UN situation report in Gaza : Now I ask you : how collateral is this really ?
Can this still be understood as " unintentional " and " incidental " ?

The Icelandic Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde , in a press conference held at noon today , announced he will be stepping down as the leader of the Independence Party due to his grave health condition .
He has been diagnosed with a malignant cancer of the oesophagus .
He also announced that he is , in cooperation with the Social Democrats who are in coalition with the Independence party , recommending national elections to take place on the 9th May this year .
As IceNews has reported , heavy and growing protests have been taking place in Reykjavik and all across the country and pressure has been mounting on the government to take action towards re-election .
The diagnosis of the Prime Minister comes as a shock to the nation , especially in light of the fact that the Foreign Minister , Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir , the leader of the Social Democrats , has been undergoing treatment of a benign brain tumor since last autumn .
Haarde expects to undergo surgery around the end of the month and will remain party leader until the Independence Party ’s rescheduled conference on 26 - 29 March .
Donna Sturm , a jewelry designer in Fort Greene , Brooklyn , was watching her 12 - year - old daughter play at the Parade Grounds fields south of Prospect Park on Friday .
She also said that defining women by the sports their children play  be it soccer or hockey  is not particularly useful .
“ It ’s kind of short for ‘ I ’m like you , I ’m not elitist , I too drive my kids from place to place , ’ ” she said .
“ So I think Michelle Obama can use it as much as Palin .
I think the population is too taken in by that .
So you do n’t have to go into deeper issues .
I ’d much rather someone talked about a health care plan or a child care plan . ”
At a nearby field , Sarah Weir , 41 , the manager of the Brooklyn Patriots Revolution team for 10 - and 11 - year - old girls , made another comparison between the sports : “ In soccer , parents do n’t get as worked up .
I ’ve heard in hockey of parents attacking coaches . ”
Cristina O’Brien , 30 , who also was watching her daughter Samantha , 10 , at the Parade Grounds , said : “ I know a hockey mom .
She was getting up at 4:30 to take her son to hockey practice .
I ’ve seen someone who ’s taken their kid to Canada for tryouts and games .
But I just want her to have fun . ”
In Toms River , N.J. , the Shelter Cove soccer field was full of soccer parents on Friday evening .
Kim Rinkerman , 32 , a health and physical education teacher in Toms River , helps manage the team her 10 - year - old son , Tylar , joined after expressing interest in hockey .
“ We call soccer the poor version of hockey , ” she said .
“ We ca n’t afford the gear . ”
Ms. Rinkerman , a single mother , said she had not decided how she would cast her vote , but she was happy to hear Governor Palin call herself a hockey mom .
“ I ’m glad she ’s open and honest , ” she said .
“ I ’m just glad someone is proud of who they are . ”
Cynthia Lane , 36 , of Beachwood , N.J. , a school bus driver , has four children .
All of them play soccer , and the youngest two , both boys , play hockey as well .

I do n’t understand why Hong Shao Rou ( 紅燒肉 ) is never on a Chinese restaurant menu in America .
Maybe it is simply just too exotic or “ home style . ”
But ask any Chinese person and they can tell you stories of grandmother ’s Hong Shao Rou .
Family recipes are often guarded secrets , and only passed down within the family members through generations .
Improved Recipe
Since publishing this post I ’ve revised the recipe using a traditional technique of par - boiling the meat .
The result is much better and I encourage you to use the improved recipe in a subsequent post .
Many different approaches exist for preparing this dish .
There are always debates as to the merit of caramelizing the sugar first , or just simply adding it to the braising liquid .
Controversies are often stirred up as to whether spices such as star anise and Osmanthus bark should be added .
Hard boiled eggs are sometime added to the dish .
And in the Southwestern region of China , where chili is king , very often dried chilies are added to spice up the dish .
All these just create even more mystique to the dish .
Hong Shao
Rou is typically made with pork belly meat , a cut commonly used for making bacon .
It is layered with fat and results in a very tender and flavorful pork dish .
One can argue that this is rather unhealthy , but I simply cannot justify using any other cut because it is just so wrong otherwise !
Hong Shao
Rou is served regularly at home as daily meal and yet can also be served at celebratory occasions .
It is quite common to serve this dish with small steamed buns .
The buns are often made from round dough folded into half circle resembling a clam shell .
One holds a piece of Hong Shao Rou in the steamed bun like hot dog in a bun .
These buns can be purchased from Chinese grocery stores , although sometime I enjoy making them at home .
More often than not I simply serve this dish with some steamed vegetables and rice at home .
So without further ado , here is my version of Hong Shau Rou .
Red Cooked Pork ( 紅燒肉 ) 0 from 0 votes Print Ingredients 1 1/2 pound pork belly cut into two inch cubes
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons sugar
3 cloves garlic peeled
3 star anise
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup Shaoxing cooking wine ( 紹興料酒 )
1 1/2 cups pork stock or water Instructions
Melt the sugar and the vegetable oil in a medium pot over medium high heat .
Continue heating until the sugar is slightly brown .
About 3 minutes .
Put the cubed pork in the pot and brown it with the caramelized sugar .
About 8 minutes .
Put the garlic , star anise , dark soy sauce , rice wine and clear stock into the pot .
Cover the pot and simmer over low heat .
Cook for about 90 minutes .
Stir the meat every 10 minutes to make sure the bottom of the pot does not get burnt .
Remove the cover and turn the heat to medium high .
Cook the meat for another 10 minutes until the sauce reduces to a smooth consistency .
This dish , like most stew dishes , is better if left overnight and reheated the next day .
But if you ca n’t wait then plate it in a shallow bowl and garnish with shredded scallion and sprigs of cilantro .
He has persuaded MPs to campaign to keep the fictitious drug " cake " off the streets , and musician Phil Collins to warn children against paedophiles while wearing a " Nonce Sense " T - shirt .
Now the satirist Chris Morris is tackling his most controversial topic yet : wannabe suicide bombers .
Morris 's film , which has the working title Four Lions , explores the " farce " of terrorism and is funded by FilmFour .
It goes into production this summer , after a year of delays caused by funding difficulties over fears that it was too contentious , and is expected to be in cinemas by the end of the year .
The production company Warp Films said the film , which Morris spent three years researching , " understands how terrorism relates to testosterone .
It understands jihadis as human beings .
And it understands human beings as innately ridiculous . "
Deirdre Steed , who worked with Morris to secure funding for the film , said the satirist , who fronted The Day Today and Brass Eye , has spoken to terrorism experts , imams , police , secret services and hundreds of Muslims to research the film .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Even those who have trained and fought jihad report the frequency of farce , " she said .
" At training camps , young jihadis argue about honey , cry for their mums , shoot each other 's feet off , chase snakes and get thrown out for smoking .
A minute into his martyrdom video , a would - be bomber looks puzzled and says ' what was the question again ? '
On Millennium eve , five jihadis set out to ram a US warship .
They slipped their boat into the water and carefully stacked it with explosives .
It sank . "
Ms Steed said terrorist cells share the same group dynamics as stag parties and five - a- side football teams .
" There is conflict , friendship , misunderstanding and rivalry , " she said .
" Terrorism is about ideology , but it 's also about berks .
" Four Lions is a funny , thrilling fictional story that illuminates modern British jihad with an insight beyond anything else in our culture .
It plunges us beyond seeing these young men as unfathomably alien .
It undermines the folly of just wishing them away or alienating the entire culture from which they emerge .
As Spinal Tap understood heavy metal and Dr Strangelove the Cold War , Four Lions understands modern British jihadis . "
The project , which Morris has described as showing the " Dad 's Army side to terrorism " , has suffered a year of delays , and was refused funding as a television project by the BBC , amid speculation that the subject was too controversial .
But Morris remained determined that it should go into production .
He asked the public to show their support by offering £ 25 towards the funding of the film , in return for the chance to be an extra in the comedy .
Then , on 30 October , Morris announced to fans : " We 've had some good funding news which means we wo n't be asking you to back your generous offer with hard cash . "
FilmFour confirmed it will be backing the film and yesterday said it will be produced this year .
A spokeswoman said Morris had always envisaged the project as a feature film rather than a piece for television and that FilmFour " had been involved from the beginning of the development process " .
Morris has previously acknowledged that " some may find poking fun at terrorists offensive " .
But , he said : " Most of us would dearly love to laugh in the face of our worst fears .
Why are n't we laughing at terrorists ?
Because we do n't know how to , until now . "
Preface : Maybe this post should be title “ PR Disaster Averted … by Brand - Management Jedi Scott Monty . ”
This story changed a lot in the few hours after it was published due to Ford rep Scott Monty .
If you read through the updates you ’ll see that he single - handedly put down an internet uprising by acting fast , talking to the lawyers to get the real story and then fully explaining Ford ’s actual position on the subject …
Ford is suing multiple Ford enthusiast web sites .
You may want to read that again .
Ford is suing multiple Ford - enthusiast web sites .
Ford Motor Company , who loses an average of $ 1,925 every time it sells a vehicle and who wants billions from the government to keep operating under a failed business model * is now suing people who run Ford vehicle fan sites .
Websites such as The Ranger Station , Michigan Mustang and Mustang Evolution ** have received legal notices from Fords lawyers .
Jalopnik reports :
In a recent letter to enthusiast web sites , Ford ’s reportedly requiring the relinquishment of all Ford trademarks including domain names , banners , signs and merchandise as well as a restitution payment of $ 5,000 by December 19th .
This company does n’t understanding anything about … well , anything .
People who run Ford - enthusiast websites should be Ford ’s closest allies at this moment .
The company is on the ropes .
They ’ve gone to the government hat - in - hand and been denied .
This may be their final hour and they ’re lashing out at the people they need the most : people who still believe in the company ’s products .
( Yes , they ’re out there . )
They should be cultivating these brand ambassadors , but no , they ’d rather send the lawyers after their best , and maybe only , source of positive word - of - mouth .
This is so short - sighted it defies belief .
That is , unless you know that in 2006 after posting a record $ 12.7 billion net loss Ford gave its new CEO Alan Mulally $ 28 million for four months on the job .
( This is according to the company ’s proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission . )
This man went to Washington in November with GM and Chrysler , collectively asking Congress to loan him $ 25 Billion of taxpayer money .
When he was asked to take a symbolic salary cut to $ 1 , not including stock options or bonuses where corporate - America CEOs make the majority of their money , he replied “ I think I ’m OK where I am . ” (!?)
Well , pretty much no one else does , Alan .
And now your company is suing the only people who do “ think you ’re OK where you are . ”
What should Ford be doing with it ’s fan sites ?
How about cultivating them ?
How about tapping into this community of folks passionate about your product …
Sponsor a barbecue and talk to these people about why they ’re passionate about past Ford vehicles and apply that to future products .
( The Ranger Station ?
Who loves Ford Rangers ?
Why ? )
Host a track day at their proving grounds to strengthen the bond between the company and their most evangelistic customer base .
Reaching out to them with special promotional products you can only get through membership so they can increase their numbers .
Or jeez , maybe they could just not sue them into oblivion .
That ’s free .
The hubris runs high at Ford and it goes all the way to the top .
President Bush said that giving this company a loan would be throwing good money after bad .
I finally agree with him .
* Ford has stated that they ’re not facing short - term liquidity issues like GM and Chrysler and they will not be seeking any sort of government funding – Link
** Mustang Evolution and Michigan Mustang have since been removed from the original Jalopnik Article as defendants ; they are just reporting on the issue .
SAME -DAY UPDATE :
Good news !
At least someone at Ford is paying attention to their base : about 30 minutes after this was posted , Scott Monty , Global Digital Communications Ford Motor Company , left a comment below .
I ’m pasting it into the body of the story , because I think it ’s important to note that there are people at Ford who are “ not pleased ” as well .
I ’m looking into this personally with our Chief Trademark Counsel .
I ’m not pleased that such action would be taken , but I ’m trying to understand the full ramifications of the story .
I ’ll update when I know more .

He also has a good post on his blog about how Ford can pay more attention to their customers ( instead of , say , suing them . )
Thanks for chiming in , Scott , I ’m looking forward to your update .
SAME -DAY UPDATE # 2 :
Scott has more info on The Ranger Station :
They were selling counterfeit merchandise branded as Ford .
Pulled from the comments :
Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention .
Without question , Ford enthusiasts are extremely important to us .
Their enthusiasm and loyalty are part of our heritage and part of what ’s going to keep us moving forward .
Recently , there was an item posted stating that Ford was requesting TheRangerStation.com to turn over its URL to Ford and pay $ 5,000 .
We ’d like the opportunity to share some additional facts that might make a difference in how you think about this situation .
In its communications , TheRangerStation.com stated that Ford was making them change the name of their site and pay $ 5,000 .
What was not mentioned was that TheRangerStation.com was selling counterfeit Ford - brand merchandise on the site .
As a company , Ford has a responsibility to protect our brand and a responsibility to our licensees .
We can not let something like that pass .
( The counterfeit goods have been removed from the website since TheRangerStation.com got the letter from Ford ’s attorney . )
Please know that Ford takes no joy in pursuing enthusiast sites .
Since there are a number of sites out there with Ford vehicles as part of their names or URLs , some people have asked if they should be concerned .
Ford has been and continues to be willing to license its trademarks for use by enthusiast groups and enthusiast websites .
Requesting a license is done easily by contacting [ email protected ] .
To request a license to produce or sell branded merchandise bearing Ford ’s trademarks , contact [ email protected ] .
In short , we are not asking for $ 5,000 and we would like TheRangerStation.com to keep the domain name .
We simply encourage TheRangerStation.com to contact Ford to request a license to continue using the domain name .
We hope you will share this information with anyone who is concerned .
We deeply appreciate our fans ’ dedication and enthusiasm and want to be able to work together with all of our supporters to tell the Ford story .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama signed a memorandum Monday requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider an application by California to set more stringent auto emissions and fuel efficiency standards than required by federal law .
California and 13 other states would be permitted to set their emission standards under President Obama 's plan .
If the EPA grants a waiver allowing California to set its own emissions standards , the nation 's most populous state will be allowed to require automakers to produce trucks and cars that get better mileage than what is required under the current national standard .
Thirteen other states could take similar action .
" It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil , " Obama said .
Watch Obama discuss energy plans »
Increasing fuel efficiency , he said , is a key step in preventing the United States " from being held hostage " to hostile regimes and the threat of global warming .
iReport.com : What should Obama do next ?
" I am fearful that today 's action will begin the process of setting the American auto industry back even further , " replied Sen .
George Voinovich , R - Ohio , in a written statement .
" The federal government should not be piling on an industry already hurting in a time like this . "
Former President George W. Bush 's administration rejected California 's application , agreeing with automakers that the creation of another set of rules regarding pollution standards for some states would be confusing and unenforceable .
Besides the EPA waivers , Obama also called for automakers to increase their fuel efficiency standards nationwide .
The president also directed the federal government to make its buildings more energy efficient and to find new ways for federal agencies to save energy .

Thoth : The Soul - Stirring Muse of Central Park
Thoth : One Man ’s Painful Search for Self - Identity
People can hardly ever forget the first time they witness , or rather experience , S. K .
Thoth performing in the tunnel at Bethesda Terrace in Central Park , directly across from the “ Angel ” Fountain .
Costumed like an ancient Greek superhero , complete with golden loincloth and a red feathered headdress , Thoth is truly a striking sight to behold .
Then he opens his mouth and begins to sing in his three range operatic voice , with a violin on his shoulder , dancing like a man possessed by something otherworldly , stomping rhythms with his heeled sandals and belled ankles making an indelible impression in your mind .
Many of the people in his audiences have no idea what they ’re watching , nor do they understand what it could possibly mean .

Tech columnist David Pogue pulls out " The Best Photography Tricks of All Time " for anyone shooting digital , including the crafty use of a lampshade :
It turns out that the threads at the top of just about any lamp — the place where the lampshade screws on — are precisely the same diameter as a tripod mount !
In a pinch , you can whip off the lampshade , screw on the camera , and presto :

We know that throughout history conservatives have constantly fought tooth and nail against equality and justice ?
But the question remains , why ?
Could it be a sickness ?
What 's up with conservatives anyway ?
Time after time they have been shown to have been on the wrong side of history , standing strong , tall and proud against justice , equality and progress .
Yet in the present they always seem to stubbornly cling to their bankrupt way of thinking , as they insist on opposing all progressive change , whatever it may be .
Of course today 's typical conservative would n't defend slavery or deny women the vote , but , in the end , it 's the same mindset and , without a doubt , today 's conservatives , had they been around back in the day , would have supported the status quo then , just as they do today .
The conservative mind remains the same , it 's just the topics under discussion that change .
Take the environment .
As all evidence points to the rapid destruction of our planet due to global warming , conservatives , such as Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. President George W. Bush , do everything they can to stall any and all progress in the fight to save the planet for future generations .
All that matters to them is the economy , the economy , the economy .
The future of the Earth be damned .
Or take the Anglican Church .
The conservatives there are threatening to break away from the main church due to their revulsion at women being made bishops .
Would n't want a filthy woman as your spiritual superior now would you ?
And then , of course , there are the conservatives in the Catholic Church , which , sadly , includes those in control at the Vatican .
These Catholic conservatives seem to oppose just about any change or modernization , whether it concern the role of women in the church , doing away with the bizarre tradition of celibate priests , allowing the use of birth control , you name it .
Likewise , when it comes to treating all citizens equally , regardless of their sexual orientation , conservatives of all stripes are adamant in their desire to deny gay people equal rights to marriage , adoption , etc .
This I just do n't get .
Why would anyone oppose the marriage of two people who love one another and want to spend their lives together ?
Well , ironically , religion , which normally insists on institutionalized marriage , would seem to be the main culprit .
Especially in America , which , unlike Europe , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , has a lunatic fringe of born - again fundamentalist Christian freaks who , particularly down south in the Bible Belt , are most certainly lunatic , but , unbelievable as it may seem , are not really all that fringe at all .
In fact , they have somehow actually become part of the mainstream down there .
However , the strong opposition to gay marriage can't simply be explained away by the fact that America is so radically religious compared to the rest of the Western World .
No , what I 'm trying to say here is that I think it has much more to do with the evil of the conservative mindset .
Religious conservatives can certainly be the most entrenched in their positions , supposing God to be on their side and all , but conservatives do n't , by any means , need to be religious to be stubbornly opposed to a more just world .
And , I should point out , I 'm not just talking about Catholic , Anglican and North American conservatives here .
No , let me be perfectly clear , I 'm most definitely also talking about African , Asian and European conservatives , Islamic conservatives , Hindu conservatives , Communist conservatives , Orthodox Jews , Mormons , the Taliban , the ruling family of Saudi Arabia , you name it .
The fact of the matter is that throughout history conservatives have supported horrible injustice and have almost always backed it up with a few quotes from the Bible ( or the Koran or one set of holy scriptures or another ) that have supposedly shown just how right they were and just how much God has always indisputably supported slavery , women as the property of their husbands , the separation of the races , what have you .
No matter how unjust , unfair , cruel or despicable the situation , conservatives have always been there to defend the status quo .
Here 's a short list of the changes conservatives have opposed ( and often fought tooth and nail against ) over the years , sticking for the moment to the West and , specifically , America :
- the end of slavery ;
- women being granted the legal status of equal human beings and no longer being considered the property of their husbands or fathers ;
- women being given the vote ;
- the end of racial segregation ;
- the introduction of universal health care and other social programs ;
- the introduction of The Pill ;
- the repeal of laws that legally allowed men to beat , and rape , their wives ;
- the decriminalization of homosexuality ; that is , the end of criminalizing 10 % of the population for simply being who they are ;
- and , not too many years ago now , the legalization of inter-racial marriage .
Yes , let 's not forget that inter-racial marriage was illegal in most states in the good ol ' U.S. of A. until quite recently .
So , with conservatives coming out on the wrong side of justice and equality time and time again , the only real question is :
What exactly is wrong with them ?
Why can't they see what is so glaringly obvious to the rest of us : that they 're ALWAYS on the side of pathetic small - mindedness , fighting passionately against the creation of a more fair , just and equal society ?
The only reason I can see is that it must be a sickness and these poor conservatives simply can't help themselves when it comes to passionately fighting against any and all measures that would make for a more just world .
This condition , let 's call it " conservativitus " , clearly involves a serious deficiency in both compassion and empathy , a coldness of the heart , if you will ... perhaps brought on , at least in America , by an overexposure to Christian Rock and / or FOX News .
Whatever the cause , these conservatives , as if inflicted with a bad case of Tourette 's Syndrome , seem to be unable to control their impulse to scream out " No fucking way ! ! " whenever any change is proposed to make the world a better place .
So , whenever you see or hear a conservative , I urge you to try to remember that they are sick and , instead of condemning them , please wish them well .
It 's the least you can do .
They may sneer back at you , but do n't take it personally , it 's all just part of the disease .

The 2007–2008 financial crisis had its genesis in the United States housing markets , but it rapidly spread to other economies , first to the United Kingdom , but then almost everywhere else , including such unlikely spots as Iceland whose banking system collapsed .
[ 1 ]
Because events in the United States triggered the crisis , this essay will concentrate on the US causes although they had their many counterparts elsewhere .
There are at least three long - standing background influences that contributed to the financial debacle that dominated the US economy in 2008 :
For almost 100 years , the US government has not felt constrained to match its expenditure with its revenue .
This policy was given intellectual justification by the writings of John Maynard Keynes who argued in the 1930s that , during periods of slow economic growth , active and purposeful government policies would allow the economy to spend its way out of recession .
[ 2 ]
It was simply a matter of time before citizens aped the financial habits of their governments by living beyond their means .
The Federal Reserve System ( the Fed — created in 1913 ) has accommodated government 's policy of spending to excess by inflating the money supply and keeping interest rates artificially low .
Today 's dollar will buy what in 1913 would cost less than a nickel .
This easy - money policy has not only led to inflation but has resulted in investments taking place that would not be justified had the money supply been constrained , and had interest rates more clearly reflected economic reality .
Since the 1960s , politicians parroting the suspect theories of Keynes have fed the public 's naïve belief that government can provide ever - increasing living standards by means of its monetary and fiscal policies .
Pulling a fiscal lever here and pushing a monetary button there meant that constraints on spending were old fashioned , and living standards would forever improve .
The limitations imposed by the laws of economics had been repealed if you voted for politicians who promised to provide you with something for nothing .
Fiscal prudence was simply a capitalist lie .
It is against this long term , more philosophic backdrop , that the following , more immediate issues , assumed greater importance .
Households collectively made little attempt to save for the future .
The United States , in particular , borrowed from China , Japan , and Middle Eastern countries to finance its spending addictions .
Financial responsibility was considered an old - fashioned , or even an irrelevant , virtue , and people were led to believe that government could , by waving its magic wand , provide improved housing without the pain of saving or foregoing immediate consumption .
The acquisition of a house was viewed by many buyers not so much as having somewhere to live but as a painless way to make money .
House prices , they naively believed , would always continue to increase in value while the relative burden of mortgages would continue to fall .
Not only that , but as house values increased , a house could be used as collateral for a further loan .
The financial equivalent of turning sea water into gold had been created .
So long as house prices increased , borrowers were in financial heaven .
When house prices fell , the earth opened up under the feet of lenders .
Government - sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac subsidized mortgages for people who , under more - prudent rules of borrowing , would never have qualified for a loan from a conservative banking institution .
Congressman Barney Frank in 2003 stated in a moment of candor , " I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing . " [ 3 ]
Well he certainly did , at the same time accepting with gratitude campaign contributions from Fannie and Freddie .
The egalitarian policies of government through such legislation as the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 " persuaded " lenders , Mafioso style , to lend to low - income borrowers , against their better judgment .
Government lawyers made it clear that the consequences of failing to meet politically imposed targets and quotas could be dire .
It was a matter of time before a substantial minority of borrowers could not or would not service their mortgages .
Partly because astute people predicted this , well - known names in the financial world began to package , or sponsor , mortgage and other debts such as credit - card balances into what were called structured - investment vehicles ( SIV ) , dubbed " financial weapons of mass destruction " by Warren Buffett .
So complicated were the terms contained in such instruments that many legal minds and the credit - rating agencies were baffled as to exactly what they meant and where the ultimate risk lay .
Banks and others could benefit by lending to people who could not afford to pay interest , far less capital , provided they were able to sell the SIVs to gullible investors .
Money managers naively bought such investments for pension funds , money market funds , and ( even more surprisingly ) for their firms ' own accounts .
This was the primrose path to unlimited housing ownership , with no painful cash deposit , and no adverse consequences to the first lenders .
So long as ( a ) the value of housing increased , ( b ) borrowers paid on time , and ( c ) confidence remained in the credibility of SIVs , everything was hunky - dory .
Unfortunately , all three cratered about the same time ; house values stagnated or fell as supply exceeded demand ; when values stuttered , so did borrowers repayments , and confidence plunged .
Borrowers , having promised to pay and having offered security for their promises , were failing to pay because their security had declined in value .
They repudiated their debts , and the burden fell on hapless financial institutions .
Populist politicians rarely blamed the borrowers , because there are so many of them and they vote ; instead they blamed greedy capitalists , speculators , short sellers , anyone except the debtors , and the imprudent economic policies of the US government .
As events began to unravel in mid-2008 , well - established firms like Lehman Brothers , went to the wall .
Others like Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at knockdown prices .
Yet others , like insurance giant AIG , were effectively nationalized . [ 4 ]
Meanwhile , the stock - market value of banks and other financial institutions took a nosedive .
For example , Citibank stock price fell by 79 % between October 2008 and October 2009 .
The broader stock - market indices like the Dow Jones also plummeted by around 40 % .
The US government had no systematic policy , and rules were made up as more and more bad news emerged , especially about jobs .
Citibank had a labor force of 375,000 in 2007 ; in November 2008 , it was announced that 53,000 jobs would go by the first quarter of 2009 .
Senior government officials were like shipwrecked sailors ( and were spending money like drunken sailors ) paddling like mad but with little idea of where they were going , or why .
The only consistent rule was that something had to be done , and the US government must be the action party .
[ 5 ]
It is difficult not to recall the words of Herbert Spencer : " The ultimate result of shielding man from the effects of folly is to people the world with fools . "
The financial crisis of 2007 –2008 was a Ponzi scheme writ large .
A Ponzi scheme , or chain letter , initially succeeds but eventually collapses , just as imprudent loans may at first succeed in their objectives but eventually the laws of economics come into play and expose the futility of the whole exercise .
A pyramid scheme is always unsustainable for the simple reason that it is based on faulty principles and built on flawed foundations .
Until too late , no one in authority ( regulators , risk managers , senior bank executives , credit - rating agencies , investment analysts ) asked the key question , namely , how on earth was it possible in the long term to make profits by lending money to people whose chances of paying it back were practically nil ? [ 6 ]
The issue was simply swept under the carpet because loans to deadbeats provided a better short - term return than did lower - risk debt instruments .
In summary , the essence of the subprime crisis is that money was lent ( often through the agency of questionable mortgage brokers ) at very low interest rates ( courtesy of the Fed ) to hundreds of thousands of people ( all they needed was a credit score and a pulse ) who could not afford to pay it back ; and it was backed by collateral ( a house ) that was not properly valued .
[ 7 ]
Such assets , accurately described as " liar loans , " were then packaged into opaque securities , known as structured - investment vehicles ( sponsored but not guaranteed by a respected and well - known name ) , which very few people understood .
They were sold on to pension funds , banks , and others whose gullible investment managers also did not understand them and failed to carry out the rigorous analysis that their clients had a right to expect . [ 8 ]
$ 14 $ 12 order 2 – 4 , save $ 1 each order 5 – 9 , save $ 2 each order 10 – 100 , save $ 3 each
Government encouraged all of this by supporting affordable housing ( which was politically correct ) and accusing banks of redlining ( failing to lend to poor and black people in the same proportion as they lent to the rich and white ) .
When the borrower , already maxed out on his credit cards , predictably failed to make payments , the scale of the problems eventually became apparent to somnolent regulators and financial institutions .
Confidence and trust evaporated , because no one knew which institutions held suspect securities , how much the losses were , and who was ultimately safe .
A financial system built on debt and excessive leverage was a financial system built on sand .
The errors and fallacies that weave and surround this awful catalog of errors could have largely been avoided by paying attention to a single sentence written by Henry Hazlitt over 60 years ago :
The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the long effects of any act or policy ; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups .
A Franciscan monk named Luca Paccioli wrote a book Summa de arithmetic , geometrica et proportionalitià in 1494 , where is posed the now famous problem of points .
A and B are playing a fair game of balla .
They agree to continue until one has won six rounds .
The game actually stops when A has won five and B three .
How should the stakes be divided .
This problem gave birth to modern probability theory .
Read The Unfinished Game by Keith Devlin for a fascinating account of how Pascal and Fermat struggled to find a solution to this problem .
In the book Devlin says
Interestingly , as far as we know , neither Pascal , Fermat , nor anyone else sought to resolve the issue empirically .
If you were actually to play out the completion of the game many times — that is , imagine the game had been halted after eight tosses , with A ahead five to three , and then toss actual coins to complete the game — you would find that A wins roughly 7/8 of the time .
( I have reworded the above quote to match with the problem statement . )
Sounds like Devlin is asking us to verify the claim by Monte Carlo simulation .
Lets do that .
import Control .
Applicative ( ( <$ > ) ) import Control .
Monad .
MC import Text .
Printf ( printf )
Lets start by defining the game .
We have two players
data Player = A | B deriving ( Eq , Show ) players = [ A , B ]
Define a record to store the current state of the game .
data Game = Game { pointsA :: Int , pointsB :: Int , pointsTotal ::
Int } deriving Show game :: Game game = Game 5 3 6
At any round , a player can win with equal probability .
So ,
play :: MC
Player play = sample 2 players
Lets create a sequence of tosses .
Notice that the game must end after ( pointsTotal - pointsA ) + pointsTotal - pointsB ) - 1 rounds .
tosses :: MC [ Player ] tosses = sequence .
replicate count $ play where count = ( total - a ) + ( total - b ) - 1 total = pointsTotal game a = pointsA game b = points B game
We need to keep track of the current score of each player .
I use a tuple to store the score , and use the following function to update the score .
updateScore :: ( Int , Int ) -> Player -> ( Int , Int ) updateScore ( a , b ) A = ( a+1 , b ) updateScore ( a , b ) B = ( a , b+1 )
Next I define a function that keeps track of the score as the game progresses .
scores :: MC [ ( Int , Int ) ] scores = scanl updateScore ( a , b ) < $> tosses where a = pointsA game b = points B game
Given a sequence of scores , I can determine who won the game .
winner :: [ ( Int , Int ) ] ->
Player winner [ ] = error " Calculating winner of an empty sequence " winner ( ( a , b ) : xs ) | a >= total = A | b >= total =
B | otherwise = winner xs where total = pointsTotal game
Now , we need to compute the probability that A wins the game .
Since , I am using a Monte Carlo simulation , I need a random variable to keep track of the number of times player A has won .
This can be done by simply assigning a reward of 1 when player A wins and a reward of 0 when player 2 wins .
That way , the expected value of the reward will be equal to the probability that A wins .
reward :: Player ->
Double reward A = 1 reward B = 0
And finally , the Monte Carlo simulation .
main :: IO ( ) main = let n = 1000000 seed = 101 stats = repeatMC n ( reward < $> winner < $> scores ) `evalMC` mt19937 seed in do printf " Probability that A wins : %f
" ( sampleMean stats ) printf " 99 % % Confidence interval : ( %f , %f )
" `uncurry` ( sampleCI 0.99 stats )
This gives
Probability that A wins : 0.8749600000000389 99 % Confidence interval : ( 0.8741080072900288 , 0.8758119927100491 )
The actual solution of the problem is 7/8=0.875 .
So , the problem would have been resolved much earlier had the Renascence mathematician had access to Monte Carlo simulations 🙂

Iceland 's parliament has passed emergency legislation to try to salvage the country 's banking system .
In a televised address to the nation , Prime Minister Geir Haarde said the legislation would help the island avoid national bankruptcy .
Iceland will also offer an unlimited guarantee for all bank customers ' savings accounts .
The moves come after trading in six of Iceland 's biggest banks and financial firms was temporarily halted .
Banks dominate Iceland 's economy , leaving the island of just 300,000 people heavily exposed to the global credit squeeze .
Under the legislation , Iceland 's financial regulator will have wide - ranging powers to dictate a bank 's operations and could even force it to merge with another company or declare bankruptcy .
The bill will also allow the government to take over housing loans held by the banks and put in a government fund .
National bankruptcy
" We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy , " Mr Haarde said .
" The legislation is necessary to avoid that fate . "
Prime minister Geir Haarde is facing a financial crisis
Before the legislation was announced , Iceland 's financial supervisory authority said it had decided to temporarily suspend trading in the three biggest three banks - Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir - and three other financial groups , Straumur - Burdaras , Exista and Spron .
The regulator said it had suspended trading to protect investors ' interests while waiting for a government announcement on its rescue plans .
Icelandic banks and companies have provided financial backing for a number of UK businesses and , as such , problems in the Icelandic banking system could have a knock - on effect in the UK .
Kaupthing has invested in pubs group Mitchells & Butlers and department store Debenhams .
And Icelandic retail group Baugur owns UK stores such as Iceland , Hamleys , Oasis and House of Fraser , although Baugur has said that it is unaffected by the current situation in Iceland .
Repatriate assets
Under the legislation , the country 's largest banks have agreed to sell off some of their foreign assets and bring them home .
This money will be brought back into Iceland , in an effort to shore up the economy and prevent the currency , the krona , from sliding any further .
Last week , it lost a fifth of its value against the dollar and on Monday it plunged 30 % against the euro .
The legislation came after frantic weekend talks with political , financial and trades union leaders .
Banking troubles
The government also wants the trade unions to return a sizeable portion of their foreign - invested pension funds to Iceland .
To help stabilise Iceland 's troubled economy , the unions are also being urged to agree to wage restraint , despite the country 's inflation rate of 14 % .
But in return , the unions want Iceland to apply for EU membership - a move it has resisted for decades .
Iceland 's economy was traditionally based on fishing , but in the 1990s the banks boomed , expanding abroad and growing to several times the size of the national GDP .
The government stepped in to nationalise Iceland 's third largest bank , Glitnir , last week .
The nationalisation led ratings agencies to downgrade Iceland 's credit rating .
Analysts have warned the troubled banking sector may be too big for Iceland to be able to save .

OP -ED :
The renewed violence between Israel and Hamas , in which 1.5 million innocent Palestinians are caught , is yet another definitive demonstration that there is no military solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Israel will not be able to secure its future , normalize its relations with the region and live in peace without an agreement with the Palestinians ; Palestinians will not achieve liberation and independence without an agreement with Israel .
The fundamental conundrum is that the Palestinians and Israel cannot completely bridge the gaps that separate them on their own .
To achieve an agreement , both parties require an outside intervention , and that can only come from the United States .
Beyond the violence , there is a critical problem that renders the status quo unmanageable : this is the expansion of the settlements , which erodes the physical possibility of a two - state solution .
Settlement expansion threatens the meaningfulness of future negotiations about the establishment of a Palestinian state and poisons the political atmosphere .
It creates political problems in Israel by empowering a passionate and belligerent constituency opposed to necessary territorial compromises .
The responsible leadership in the Palestinian Authority , and the whole Arab world , is largely defenseless against the accusation that they have failed to deliver as long as settlements grow .
Along with securing a lasting cease - fire in Gaza , freezing the settlements will be the main issue the incoming administration must deal with in its early days .
There is an urgent need to buy time to prepare the political groundwork for a successful round of negotiations , bolster moderates on both sides , establish an effective framework , and perform the other necessary tasks that would have to precede an agreement , without continuing to lose ground and credibility .
The reality is that no Israeli political leadership has been able to take the bold step of enacting a comprehensive settlement freeze , even during the Oslo period , nor is one likely to be able to do so on its own and survive .
Israeli leaders need help , even though doing this is in their country ’s own interest .
Only the American president can give the vital and necessary political cover to an Israeli prime minister and cabinet for this step to be adopted .
This cannot take the form of pressure but should instead reflect strategic understandings and interests .
Along with the United States , the Arab states have an important role to play in this equation .
While expanding the dialogue and even negotiations at the appropriate level with all parties , we need to work on a strategic partnership with responsible Arab leaders committed to ending the conflict .
Israel ’s freeze of settlement activity needs to be coupled with significant incentives provided by the Arab world .
These could take the form of public movement towards operationalizing the Arab Peace Initiative that could serve as a reasonable quid pro quo for Israel ’s settlement freeze .
Many political issues in the Middle East are interconnected and interdependent .
A comprehensive regional strategy is needed in which the Palestinian - Israeli conflict is prioritized .
Even though dealing seriously with this issue with view to resolving it will not solve all the other problems , it would be uniquely helpful across the board .
Acknowledging that no other achievable goal in the Middle East would have as many benefits to the United States , we must abandon any thoughts about managing this conflict and proceed with a serious strategy to resolve it .
Palestine is the ultimate political symbol in the Arab and Muslim world .
Whoever is perceived as the authentic champion of that cause gains enormous , possibly unassailable , credibility .
Permanently losing the issue to radical religious extremists would very likely pave the way to an unstoppable wave of revolts and even revolutions .
The forces aligned with Iran could not wish for a more powerful weapon in their campaign to destabilize Arab regimes and the Arab state system , to promote domestic radicalism and regional rejectionalism .
The United States , Israel and the Arabs have much to fear from such a scenario , and all need to move quickly to defuse this ticking bomb .
The strategic partnership must move public perceptions from a zero-sum game to a win-win scenario through a conflict - ending agreement .
Equally , and urgently , closer attention needs to be paid to damage inflicted on moderate and realistic policies , and their advocates , by a toxic public discourse being peddled in the Arabic - language media that puts pragmatism and realism itself on the defensive .
It should be clearly understood that the radical religious forces ’ main appeal is to the sense of injured dignity that the Palestinian , Arab and Muslim peoples feel intensely .
Military defeats , daily humiliation , and gruesome images and accounts of suffering under the occupation , enhance rather than weaken their appeal .
The lack of a palpable improvement on the ground in the daily lives of the people of the West Bank and East Jerusalem , with continued humiliation and hardship , continues to be a serious failing of the present policy :
It weakens the moderate leadership , strengthens radicals and breeds a toxic public political discourse .
Improvement of the quality - of - life for the Palestinians requires the further development of the Palestinian security system based on a nation - building doctrine rather than one perceived as serving to enforce the Israeli occupation ; improving access and mobility ; economic improvements and institutional development , including good governance - all of which will take time .
The Bush administration launched initiatives on some of these fronts since Annapolis that have begun to bear fruit and need to be expanded .
All the criticism notwithstanding , Annapolis has yielded several positive trends that must continue :
1 ) It reaffirmed the indispensible world commitment to a two - state solution .
2) It launched several channels of formal and serious negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis dealing with all outstanding issues .
3 ) It was followed by the indispensible , and the unquestionably successful , rebuilding of the Palestinian security system .
4 ) It placed a premium on Palestinian economic development but was short on delivering sustainable vehicles for development .
5 ) It identified good governance as a major objective .
The global instruments designated to achieve this goal have fallen far short and need to be reassessed .
The twin policy of isolating Hamas and empowering moderates as implemented , has meant very little to the Palestinian people .
While the quality of life plummeted in Gaza under Hamas , the anticipated improvement in the quality of life for the Palestinians of the West Bank and Arab Jerusalem has simply failed to materialize .
Failure to rectify that now would be political malpractice .
The two - state solution , as Winston Churchill once said about democracy , is the worst solution except for all the others .
And , to make matters worse , it has an expiry date .
The Palestinians and Israelis have their futures , and even their survival - perhaps not just as states but as peoples - at stake .
Decision makers who procrastinate may come to discover that their inaction has yielded the future to the advocates of paranoid delusions and primordial fears .
Just as the economic global crisis is offering an opportunity to rebuild the global economic system , the current crisis in the Middle East offers the opportunity to resolve the Palestine Israel conflict and to transform the political landscape , not just in the Middle East , but across the world .

There were , however , some constants among the 40 or so Kenyans lined up at the bottom of a valley in the distance - running capital of the world - a lack of helmets , pure glucose powder as the energy booster of choice , furrowed brows when gazing at the course ahead : 15.5 miles , gaining 1,500 metres in altitude .
And , of course , the bicycles : big , solid , Indian or Chinese - made roadsters with no gears and names like Phoenix and Five Star .
" My bicycle is so heavy , about 15 kilogrammes , " said Samuel Wanjala , who rode nearly 100 miles just to get to the race in Iten , western Kenya .
A proper racing bike would help if he were to " meet with Lance Armstrong ... and put him aside " .
He was joking but that is exactly what the organiser of the race , Nicholas Leong , hopes will happen in the next few years .
A 40 - year - old commercial photographer from Singapore , Leong has already invested nearly three years and tens of thousands of pounds of his own money in his quest to prove Kenyans can transfer their running success into the almost exclusively white world of professional cycling .
" In 106 years of the Tour de France there has never been a single black rider , " said Leong , at the start line in Iten last weekend .
" I am trying to help change that . "
The search for a " black Lance Armstrong " in a country with precious little cycling history might at first seem outlandish - but Leong is deadly serious about his African Cyclist project .
He took two Kenyan amateur riders from the town of Eldoret , 20 miles from Iten , to tackle the famous Tour de France climb at Alpe d'Huez in August last year .
Zakayo Nderi , a 26 - year - old shoe - shiner who had never ridden a racing bike with gears before leaving Kenya to train for the ride , made it in 42 minutes 10 seconds , then the fastest time of the year and an achievement that would have placed him in the top half of Tour riders when a time trial was last held on the mountain in 2004 .
Publicity about the feat helped to secure sponsorship from a French hedge fund manager , enabling Leong this week to open a full - time training camp for up to 10 riders near Eldoret , along the lines of numerous high - altitude running camps in the area .
Negotiations are starting on hiring a professional trainer from abroad .
Last Sunday 's race , the first in a series to be held every two months , was designed to identify new riders to join Leong 's team .
The participants are promised a monthly salary of more than £ 200 - excellent money in these parts .
The start line had been chalked across the road , and there were no water points despite the heat .
Repair kits were rare ; one man taped a screwdriver behind his seat while the rider who discovered before the race that his rear tyre was flat simply accepted his ride would be very tough .
" This is like the earliest days of cycling in Europe , " said Leong , before climbing aboard a pickup serving as the lead car .
" The bikes , the people , the spirit ! "
Though he never cycled competitively , Leong has followed the Tour on television since his childhood .
In other sports he watched black players became ever more common during the 1980s and 90s .
But the Tour has remained resolutely white , a fact that Leong says is solely down to lack of opportunity .
He wrote to a dozen professional cycling teams urging them to seek out African talent .
Only one replied , with a " sympathetic no " .
So Leong decided to test his theory himself .
He avoided seeking professional advice .
" People would have thought I was a kook , " he said .
But had he done so he might have been discouraged .
Tim Noakes , a renowned professor of sports science and exercise , at the University of Cape Town , said that while marathon runners and cyclists often shared outward physical characteristics , the processes involved in running and cycling were completely different .
But Leong persevered .
After six months of searching for a promising rider to support he stumbled across Nderi , from the Kikuyu tribe , who had run competitively at school but enjoyed riding more .
Samwel Mwangi , 24 and also Kikuyu , who packed supermarket shelves and rode a " boda - boda " bicycle taxi , soon joined Leong 's team , along with a third rider , Sammy Ekiru , a Turkana .
When news got around town that they had been put on contracts , people 's attitudes to cycling began to change .
" Before when we used to train for fun people would say ' Have you not got work to do ? ' , " Nderi said .
" Now people see they can earn money from this and want to be cyclists too . "
Leong 's three riders took the podium positions in Sunday 's race , but not before a complete unknown had threatened a grand upset .
Ishmael Chelanga , 23 , the man who wore diving boots , finished a close fourth .
His bicycle cost him about £ 30 .
He said he was a boda - boda operator in Eldoret , and had only been cycling for leisure for five months .
What 's more , he was a Kalenjin who had run competitively at school .
Though Leong could barely contain his excitement , he did not give a contract to Chelanga , whose £ 80 prize was more than he earns most months .
To be sure Chelanga was serious about cycling , he asked him to come back for the next race .
" I 'll be stronger , " said Chelanga .
Then he rode home .
Can they do it ?
Dan Hunt , coach to Rebecca Romero , Olympic gold medallist in cycling and silver medallist in rowing :
" Off the back of what Rebecca Romero has done there has been a lot of talk about talent transfer , but the athletes you are looking for need a very specific set of skills and physiological qualities .
The more complex the task , the harder it is to transfer from another sport because the skills and learning required are simply too much .
The Kenyans are physically very gifted but I 'm not sure which box they would fit into in cycling .
There are question marks over how they might adapt .
Men 's road cycling has a massive pool of talent worldwide and you need more than just a big engine and a strong pair of legs .
Trying to teach an 18 - to 25 - year - old runner the tactical ins and outs of road racing would be difficult , the bike handling would be a question mark , and the repeated ebb and flow of pace in a road race might be hard to handle .
It 's not like an endurance run . "
Order ( Price Type ) Explained – Market , Limit Orders and the Like
When I say order , I mean the instruction for the broker to buy or sell on an exchange ( such as NYSE ) .
Most people think of stocks when they reference orders but the same terminology is used in stocks , bonds and commodity markets as well .
Market Orders
A market order is simply a instruction to buy or sell at current market prices .
Once the order is placed , the broker is supposed to find the best available price to execute the order .
This type of orders are usually executed the quickest and some brokerage firms like E*Trade even have 2 second execution guarantee or your commission back .
Market orders also have the best chances to get executed so brokers love these types of orders from clients but it may not be the best interest of customers to use these market orders .
The reason is simple .
Time and time again , I see others taking advantage of people who use market orders to buy and sell .
In a market where liquidity is low ( buying and selling volume is low ) , the best available price may be very different than the current market price .
For example , a person that puts in a market order for a stock with a price of $ 15 may end up getting the order executed at $ 15.50 if the volume is really low if there are no sellers between $ 15 and $ 15.49 .
The problem was the worst when after - hours trading were first introduced because ignorant investors put in market orders in an environment where transaction volumes are much lower .
These days with so many people getting burned and with the help of the media , the problem is less severe .
In the old days when retail investors is n’t as sophisticated as they are now , market orders were very common .
Nowadays however , many people see the advantages of the alternative ordering method and have changed their preferences .
Limit Orders
An order type that gives investors much more control , a limit order is an instruction to buy ( or sell ) at no more ( or no less ) than the specified price .
These type of orders avoid the low liqudity problem mentioned with market orders all together as brokers are not allowed to execute the order without regard to prices .
For example , if I were to put in a buy limit order of $ 15 for a stock that is currently priced at $ 15 , there will be no execution until there is a seller willing to sell the stock for $ 15 or lower .
This reduces my exposure to surprises , but at the same time reduces the chance that my order will be executed .
Due to the lower chances of execution of a limit order , more conditions come into play .
Brokerages generally allow you to specify whether you would like to execute the whole lot of shares at once .
What I mean is that if I wanted to buy 500 shares , I can choose to allow my broker to execute whenever there are people selling at prices I ’ve specified , or wait till the broker can execute in one transaction .
For most of us , this sounds like a ridiculous options but for investors managing hundreds and thousands of transactions , this can be an efficient way to minimize book keeping .
Which One Should I Use
Whenever someone ask me that question , I always tell them to use limit orders because of the inherit danger of market orders that I mentioned earlier .
If I really wanted to make sure that the order is executed , I can always put a limit order price that ’s below ( or above ) the current price to make sure it gets executed .
I ’ve found that as stock prices fluctuate , using limit orders have always given me a better price for every transaction and while small , it certainly added up through the years !
For more , stay tuned to the extension of this explanation on condition orders next week !

Motorist beats 98 mph speeding charge - by buying back his car and proving it can only manage a top speed of 85mph
It is hardly the boy racer 's vehicle of choice .
About 14 years old and with 130,000 miles on the clock , the Honda Civic driven by
Dale Lyle was barely capable of reaching the speed limit .
So when he received a ticket for apparently driving at almost 100 mph on the motorway , he told magistrates the mobile speed camera must have got it wrong .
Prove it , they said .
He did . . . but it was n't easy .
Mr Lyle , 21 , who has a clean driving licence , had already sold the car to a friend for £ 600 .
He had to take out a bank overdraft to buy it back .
Dale Lyle , who was accused of driving at 98 mph , holds up the test certificate which proves his 14 - year - old Honda Civic has a top speed of 85mph
Then he had to pay an independent driving expert £ 600 to test the 1.3 litre Civic 's top speed at a circuit in Bedfordshire .
The result was as expected .
Even when driven flat - out , the Honda could still only do a top speed of 85.4 mph in fourth gear and 81.3 mph in fifth .
Next , Mr Lyle obtained the mobile speed - camera footage of his alleged offence - travelling at 98 mph on a 70 mph three - lane carriageway of the A38 , near Plymouth , on December 13 , 2007 .
The three - minute film shows three other cars in the frame at the same time , he said , which he believes means his vehicle was mistaken for another .
Mr Lyle could have faced a maximum £ 1,000 fine and a six - month ban for the speeding charge .
He said : ' The video evidence the CPS sent me was just appalling .
They are just picking on innocent motorists .
It makes you wonder how many people say , " Fine , give me the points " , when they are not guilty .
Eventually , his hard work paid off , and the Crown Prosecution Service informed him the case had been dropped .
' I 'm really glad I fought the system and won , ' he said .
' It 's shocking how hard it has been for me to prove my innocence . '
Mr Lyle , a finance worker , from Staple Hill , Bristol , recalled his feelings when first served with the prosecution .
' I was in total disbelief when I opened the letter , ' he said .
' I 've never driven my car over the speed limit , let alone at 98 mph .
It 's such a small car I would n't feel safe .
' I told the magistrates that the car was ancient and that there was no way it will do that speed . '
He intends to return to court to seek compensation for the £ 1,200 he spent proving his innocence .
The CPS said : ' We came to the conclusion that there was no longer sufficient evidence to provide a prospect of a conviction .
Recompense is a matter between the defendant and the court . '
Hmm .
This is sort of an awkward topic for me to write about , given that I ’m a low - grade celebrity stalker myself ( kidding , kidding !
unless you ’re into that sort of thing , Misters Miller , Weatherly , and most recently , Pattinson – nope , nope , I ’m still just kidding ) , but when I read what former federal prosecutor Sunny Hostin said in a FOXNews.com article about celebrity stalkers , I could n’t stay quiet .
The article , Celebrities ’ Stalker Menace : ‘ It ’s Tough To Control Crazy ’ , which takes its title from Hostin ’s quote ( and you can pretty much guess which part of it got me going ) , discusses statistics regarding celebrity stalkings , some minimal advice on how to handle it ( what works and what does n’t ) , and highlights some celebrities who ’ve had to deal with stalkers ( Alyssa Milano , Jennifer Garner , Gwyneth Paltrow , and most recently Paula Abdul , to name a few ) .
Overall , fine information .
But for someone who should clearly have a tad bit more political correctness under her belt to come out and say “ it ’s tough to control crazy ” …
That is just not cool , Ms. Hostin .
Not cool , and very stigmatizing .
Did you just not have enough time to come up with something like , oh , I do n’t know , “ It ’s tough to deal with the unpredictable and often delusional behavior of people who ’ve become obsessed with celebrities ” ?
I would n’t think so .
I mean , I just came up with it in three seconds .
“ Crazy . ”
The word bothers me .
I ’m not totally opposed to using it – I say “ crazy ” all the time .
The fact that my two - and - a - half - year - old dog is still as hyper as a three - month - old puppy is crazy .
My reaction to Warner Bros . ’s decision to postpone the release of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince for almost a year was crazy .
Calling someone who could very well be struggling with mental illness “ crazy ” ?
I ’m not down with it .
Sadly , not everyone really gets the effect stigma has on people with mental health issues .
I ’m positive I did n’t really understand it until I got involved in the world of mental health .
The Mental Health Works page on stigma and mental illness states :
The stigma attached to mental illness is so pervasive that people who suspect that they might be mentally ill are unwilling to seek help for fear of what others may think .
Yeah .
Because that ’s really the goal we ’re trying for , right ?
Making people afraid to seek treatment ?
What do you think ?
Has something someone has said to you – a family member or friend , perhaps – affected how you think about yourself and mental health ?
What about something you ’ve heard in the media ?
Sound off !
In the meantime , you can learn more about stigma and its relationship with mental health treatment at the following sources :
Let me start out by saying ….
I have a man-crush on Sidney Crosby .
I am a self - admitted bandwagon Pittsburgh Penguins fan because of Sidney Crosby .
And most of all , Sidney Crosby might have single handedly started the process to save the NHL .
However even without him in the game , the NHL might have a great opportunity to do some terrific marketing of other great players in this year ’s All - Star game .
I will first off admit , straight off the bat , ratings will be down .
Sidney Crosby has become the face of the NHL .
Even though he is behind Evegeni Malkin and only one point ahead of Alex Ovechkin , he is still the most synonymous name with the NHL today .
So why is this a great opportunity ?
While listening to Michael Kay on 1050 ESPN Radio in NYC today , his co-host Don LeGreca brought up a great point : this will allow the league to market other players .
For instance , a players like Pittsburgh ’s Malkin and Washington ’s Ovechkin .
These guys are great players but are separated by a language barrier since they are not fluent in the English language .
However , these guys help make the sport more marketable worldwide .
Audiences from Russia will tune in to watch their native countrymen play .
However , the NHL ’s Crosby - centric marketing scheme is all about who else ?
… Crosby .
The NHL could provide exposure in a Crosby - less All Star game to let audiences know these players actually have either better or equal stats .
One opportunity to expand American and International markets .
Another opportunity comes with Calgary ’s Jarome Iginla .
The NHL has been known to be a ‘ white man ’s ’ sport .
Iginla is an African - Canadian ( he was born in Canada so he can not be African - American ) .
Exposure of Iginla could easily help the NHL expand into the African - American demographic .
Provide them with an icon for children to look up to .
Not necessarily like a Tiger Woods , but along the lines of a black figure in hockey who breaks the stereotype of hockey being a white man ’s sport .
For a young African - American child looking to play hockey , the NHL can use Iginla as inspiration for them to break into the sport .
Finally , exposure of players in smaller markets .
The San Jose Sharks are having a tremendous year .
They have a 5 point lead over the rest of their conference .
A player like Joe Thornton can easily be overlooked because the NHL is too concern with marketing the likes of Crosby , the original six , and the Detroit Red Wings .
It will not be every year that the NHL will be blessed with the Red Wings and the Penguins in the Stanley Cup Finals .
Remember we had Edmonton and Carolina a few years back .
Exposing players in markets like San Jose , the Canadian cities , Colombus , etc. can help the NHL boost ratings when NBC and Versus are stuck with a Tampa Bay - Calgary Stanley Cup .
So there you have it .
The NHL has a golden opportunity to break through its Crosby - centric marketing scheme .
Sure , Crosby is their biggest strength .
Yes , Crosby not playing in the All Star game will hurt the league and is one of the bigger weaknesses facing the league this season .
However , a strong marketing push of players like Iginla , Thornton , Ovechkin , and Malkin can help the league establish icons for the sport throughout the country ….as well as the world .
You do n’t have to hope that things will change when you vote for me .
You know things will change , because I have been fighting for change in Washington my whole career .
I ’ve been fighting for you my whole life .
That ’s what I ’m going to do as President of the United States .
Fight for you and put the government back on the side of the people .

Advertisement Israeli troops have clashed with Palestinian militants on the edge of Gaza City on the third night of Israel 's ground assault on Gaza .
The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups say fighters engaged Israeli soldiers with machine - guns and rocket fire .
Three Israeli soldiers were also killed by " friendly fire " in northern Gaza .
Some 540 Palestinians are thought to have been killed and 2,500 wounded in the 10 days since Israel moved to end rocket attacks from within Gaza .
Palestinian medical officials say at least 90 people have died since the ground assault began while Israel has lost four soldiers and four civilians over the 10 days .
Aid agencies in Gaza speak of appalling conditions for treating casualties of the continuing Israeli bombardments .
Eyewitnesses reported that Israeli tanks had for the first time moved into the southern city of Khan Younis .
Rejecting international appeals for a ceasefire , Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said on Monday that the operation would continue until it met its objective .
Foreign diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis have borne little fruit so far .
Single shell
An Israeli army spokesman said three soldiers from the elite Golani Brigade had been killed accidentally by a single tank shell , with a further four severely wounded and 20 suffering lighter injuries .
Israel says the operation will continue until it reaches its objectives " In the fierce battle that was being waged between our Golani brigade soldiers against the Hamas ... unfortunately one of our tanks actually exploded on to a building where our forces were located , " Capt Guy Stiegelman told the BBC .
At nightfall on Monday , Israeli troops were reported to be battling Palestinian militants on the outskirts of the Shujaiya district of Gaza City .
Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters had engaged Israeli soldiers with machine - guns and rockets .
Residents reported hearing loud explosions and heavy gunfire .
Israel 's Haaretz newspaper , quoting Israeli army sources , reports that Hamas lobbed mortars at the soldiers .
Artillery and helicopter gunships were reportedly brought in to drive back the Palestinian fighters .
Describing fighters ' tactics , an unnamed Hamas official told AFP news agency that fighters had lured Israeli forces into a trap .
" We have left a lot of explosives in their path , " he added .
Islamic Jihad spokesman Abu Ahmed said the group had lost one man in the fighting in Shujaiya .
" Communications with our fighters are cut at the moment but it [ combat ] is still going on , " he added .
Israeli tanks were also reportedly moving towards the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza and Beit Hanoun and the Jabaliya refugee camp saw clashes on Monday .
Information about what is happening inside Gaza is limited as Israel has barred foreign reporters from entering .
' Serious hunger '
Living conditions in Gaza are reported to be deteriorating sharply , with supplies of fuel , food , water and wheat running desperately low .
Gaza humanitarian crisis deepens Map : Gaza incursion - Week Two Analysis : High stakes BBC News in Arabic Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert , one of two foreign doctors working at Gaza 's biggest hospital , al - Shifa , said operating rooms were full and people were dying because of a lack of supplies .
Israel says it is not targeting civilians but Dr Gilbert said he had only seen two fighters among hundreds of casualties .
The UN says a million people in the territory are without electricity and many are facing " serious hunger " within days .
Dominic Nutt , of the aid agency Save The Children , told the BBC that workers in the territory were reporting rapidly deteriorating conditions : " They do n't have any water most of the day , there is no electricity , they are freezing cold , the windows have to be left open to stop them smashing when the bombs fall .
" Children are at risk from hypothermia , they are malnourished , there is not enough food , the situation is getting desperate . "
Thousands of Gazans are reported to have fled their homes , despite the dangers of moving around outdoors in the territory .
Israel says it has allowed a convoy of 80 lorries carrying food and medicines through Gaza 's southern border with Egypt .
Peace bid French President Nicolas Sarkozy is to travel to Damascus on Tuesday along with an EU delegation in a bid to persuade Syria to influence Hamas leaders to accept his plan for a ceasefire .
He held talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the region on Monday .
Accusing Hamas of acting in an " irresponsible and unforgivable manner " by firing rockets into Israel , he appealed to Israel for a halt to the violence to allow in humanitarian aid .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is due to attend a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday , along with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia , Egypt , France and Britain , in an attempt to put pressure on the Security Council to act decisively .

Like many motivated , focused high - school students , Lillian Kivel had worked hard academically and in community service in hopes that her efforts would win her acceptance into a good college .
It did .
Trouble was , Ms. Kivel 's focus was much less clear when she had to decide which college to attend -- the Boston - area senior had applied to 38 schools because her interests were so varied .
At the suggestion of friends , Ms. Kivel decided to take a gap year -- a year outside of academia between high - school graduation and college matriculation .
It was n't rest and relaxation that Ms. Kivel sought , but rather an opportunity to gain life experience and focus her goals .
Gappers , as they 're called , typically feel that taking a year off will give them a head start in college -- and life .
" I [ have ] the opportunity to explore my interests , like medicine and China , outside the classroom , " she says .
John Segal
Ms. Kivel eventually decided to attend Harvard College , but deferred entrance until fall 2009 .
Ms. Kivel lived at home this fall and interned at the Boston branch of Partners of Health , a global health outreach nonprofit .
She 's also serving as a legislative aide in the Massachusetts Statehouse .
And she 's auditing at anthropology class at Harvard .
To fill her spring months , Ms. Kivel turned to gap - year consultant Holly Bull , president of Interim Programs , to help her sift through more than 100 different programs in China .
Ms. Kivel will live with a host family in Shanghai , study Chinese language , history and culture in a classroom setting , and teach English to children .
" I have gained so much by ... becoming more responsible and independent [ and ] exploring my interests , " Ms. Kivel says .
The increased focus , maturity and motivation that gappers obtain -- along with a brief escape from the intense pressure that leaves many high - schoolers burned out -- has led more high - school guidance counselors and college admissions officers to suggest gap years to high achievers and strugglers alike .
" Not every 17 - year - old is ready to enter college , and a gap year ... allows them to be in the real world , do service and approach college much more deliberately , " says Karen Giannino , senior associate dean of admission at Colgate College .
Longtime educator Karl Haigler , co-author of " The Gap - Year Advantage , " agrees .
" We think that there should be more of a focus on success in college , not just on access to college , " he says .
That 's partly what motivated Princeton University to become the first school to formalize a gap - or bridge - year program .
It will be launched in the fall of 2009 , starting with 20 students and growing to 100 .
Students will be invited to apply after they have been accepted to the school .
The program will send students for a year of social service work in a foreign country .
Students wo n't be charged tuition and will be eligible for financial aid .
Formal gap - year programs typically cost between $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 , including living expenses , says Ms. Bull .
Students can often apply for financial aid through Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( www.fafsa.ed.gov), or look for scholarships and individual study - abroad loans through specific programs .
There are also community - based programs , like Americorps , where students receive room and board in exchange for service work and a small stipend .
To get the most out of the experience , students should already be accepted into college and defer admission before the gap year begins , says Missy Sanchez , director of college counseling at Woodward Academy , a private school in Atlanta .
" They can use the necessary high - school resources for their applications and have something to come back to after their year off , " says Ms. Sanchez .
The year should be well - planned and researched to avoid a lot of downtime .
" Most students choose to do a smorgasbord of two or three programs through out the year , " says Ms. Bull .
That was Sabrina Skau 's strategy .
She spent three months teaching English in a small Costa Rican town .
She taught Spanish at her local high school in Portland , Ore. , for two months .
She spent three months working in a hospital and orphanage in Cordova , Argentina .
And she wrapped up the year with a five - week Spanish program in Barcelona .
Though Ms. Skau had deferred her admission at University of Rochester , she also reapplied to Brown University and was accepted .
She began her freshman year in August .
" The gap year prepared me to be much more focused and independent at college because I have already been away on my own , " Ms. Skau says .
Students can research many of the 8,000 educational programs , internships and public - service jobs on their own , but many find it daunting .
Several private schools across the country , such as Atlanta 's Woodward Academy , have begun to hold gap fairs , where vendors come to meet prospective participants .
Students from any school can attend .
Another option is to hire a gap - year consultant .
They typically charge about $ 2,000 to help research and guide students to reputable programs .
It 's important to investigate the program 's track record , credibility , supervision , structure and safety , says Mr. Haigler .
Get references from at least two past participants and speak to them personally -- do n't just settle for email .
Finally , check your status for family medical coverage .
Insurance policies often do n't cover adult - age dependents if they are no longer full - time students , but temporary insurance policies are often available .
Ms. Kivel was able to remain on her parent 's insurance policy .
She will fund the $ 12,000 cost of her Shanghai semester from savings from a part - time job and help from her parents .
" I 'm just thrilled to be taking the year off , " she says .
With CES behind us , one of the biggest surprises was the announcement of the Palm Pre , Palm 's latest entry in the smartphone market .
Designed in part by Jon Rubenstein , a former Apple executive , the Palm Pre is a multi - touch screen phone with a pull out QWERTY keyboard that some pundits think has the best chance of challenging Apple 's iPhone - but is there any truth to that statement ?
First of all , Palm has to be given a lot of credit for delivering , by all accounts , a sexy looking phone that had a lot of people crowning it the best new product from CES .
The Pre sports a 3.1 inch screen , comes with 8GB of storage , has a 3.0 Megapixel camera , GPS , Wi-FI , an accelerometer , an extremely polished user interface , cut and paste ( gasp ! ) , EvDo , and even the ability to run applications in the background .
Not too shabby at all .
In fact , spec wise , this might give the iPhone a run for its money .
But in today 's smartphone market , hardware is fast taking a backseat to software in the minds of consumers , and Palm might soon find itself fighting an uphill battle in that regard .
The PalmPre runs webOS , a new platform that by all accounts is extremely intuitive and well - thought out .
The new OS is based in CSS , HTML , and Javascript , so there definitely wo n't be a shortage of developers capable of coding for it .
The only question is if developers will want to .
As I alluded to earlier , consumer expectations for phones have grown over the years .
In the past , a phone that played music and video was cutting edge , whereas now that capability is expected .
That said , and as Steve Jobs has mentioned as well , the differentiating factor between phones in the future will be software , and in that regard , the iPhone is already out to an extremely commanding lead .
Developers have seen the financial success possible via the iTunes App Store , and with over 10 million iPhones already in use , it might be hard to convince developers to code for the Pre .
It also does n't help that Palm stated that its App Store will only be accessible over the air .
People can hate oniTunes all they want , but there 's no denying that searching for and downloading media via your computer is a lot easier than doing it on your phone .
Of course , having the capability to purchase media from your phone is extremely convenient , but if that 's the only possible avenue , the user experience will lagappreciably behind that of Apple's .
Other factors to consider when discussing the potential success of the Pre is that it will be tied exclusively to Sprint , which currently trails AT&T and Verizon in total number of subscribers .
Another factor is price - When Peter Kafka of AllthingsD asked Palm CEO Ed Colligan if they would undercut the price of the iPhone , he responded , " “ Why would we do that when we have a significantly better product ? ”
Gutsy .
I like that .
But a $ 250 Palm Pre , let 's say , might not be that appealing to a customer also looking at a $ 199 iPhone with access to the already more than 10,000 applications currently in theiTunes Store .
Also , while the Pre 's slide out QWERTY keyboard is nice , BlackBerry already has that segment of the market on lockdown .
The Pre is expected to launch in the first half of 2009 , and will have to compete with the iPhone , the BlackBerry Storm , and the G1 in an already competitive smartphone market ( sorry Instinct , but you do n't make the cut ) .
To its credit , though , it seems that in developing the Pre , Palm was n't angling for an iPhone killer .
So rather than mimicking what Apple has already done , they went off into some new territory , and came back with some intriguing new features like Palm Cards that will definitely make it an attractive phone for potential buyers .
All in all , the Pre looks great and extremely promising , but the iPhone is a freight train plowing through at 300 MPH , and it 's extremely unlikely that the iPhone has anything to worry about .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
While depression often follows a heart attack , a recent call for heart specialists to do routine depression screening may have been premature , a team of researchers said on Monday .
Their detailed analysis of more than 17 studies suggests the American Heart Association ’s recommendation for early and repeated screenings for depression in heart attack survivors would be burdensome and may not provide enough benefit to patients to justify the trouble .
They said there is little proof that depressed heart patients live longer or fare better over the long term if they are screened for depression and treated with drugs and talk therapy .
“ It ’s a very appealing idea that non-mental health professionals can administer a quick , easy - to - use depression screening test and that would somehow benefit patients , ” said Brett Thombs of McGill University in Montreal , whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
“ Unfortunately , the reality is that it would be an extremely difficult undertaking that would n’t produce practical benefits for patients , ” Thombs , a psychology professor , said in a statement .
Studies have shown that depression is about three times more common in patients after a heart attack and depressed patients are at higher risk for a second heart attack .
Thombs and colleagues ’ review of medical studies found that screening alone or screening and referral does not help many patients and that depression treatments such as therapy or drugs result in only modest symptom relief .
They found no evidence that depression treatment can prevent a second heart attack .
Dr. Sharonne Hayes , director of the Mayo Clinic ’s Women ’s Heart Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , said in a telephone interview the study reflects the misgivings of cardiologists who feel they are not qualified to screen patients for depression .
“ The argument this group is making is we should n’t be screening if we do n’t have good treatment , ” said Hayes , who was not involved in the study or the screening recommendations .
“ I think some of the criticisms are valid .
On the other hand , the take - home message that we should n’t even screen for depression or be looking for it in a systematic way sends the wrong message to practitioners , ” she said .
On any given day , acres of tanned flesh are on view at Bondi Beach : men wearing the briefest of briefs , women sunbathing topless .
But it was n't always so .
In the 1940s , a legendary beach inspector , Aub Laidlaw , patrolled the golden sands , ruler in hand , ensuring that men's and women 's bathing costumes conformed to bylaws governing public decency .
Costumes had to cover at least three inches of thigh , as well as the entire front of the body , and wobbly bits had to be kept in place by robust straps .
Mr Laidlaw frogmarched 50 or more people a week off the beach , including , in 1945 , the first woman to brave Bondi in a bikini , and in 1961 , a group of men wearing Speedo swimming trunks .
The fanatical Mr Laidlaw retired in 1969 , eight years after the bikini was legalised , but now his ghost is once again stalking Sydney 's beaches .
A Christian fundamentalist politician , the Rev Fred Nile , is calling for topless sunbathing to be outlawed , and he has received backing from several mainstream MPs .
While nudity is illegal in Australia except on designated beaches , local councils consider toplessness acceptable .
Mr Nile wants the legislation to be tightened .
" The law should be clear , " he said .
" It must say : ' Exposure of women 's breasts on beaches will be prohibited ' . "
His proposal elicited howls of protest from sun-loving Sydneysiders , who have just begun their long summer holiday .
Outraged callers deluged talkback radio stations , and the ACT nudist club in Canberra , the national capital , warned that Australia was in danger of appearing like a " haven for prudes " .
However , Mr Nile , a veteran family values campaigner , was unrepentant , and several conservatives in the state parliament supported him , with Paul Gibson , a Labor MP , claiming that topless women made people uncomfortable .
" If you 're on the beach , do you want somebody with big knockers next to you when you 're there with the kids ? " he asked .
A Liberal politician , David Clarke , agreed , telling Sydney 's Daily Telegraph : " I do n't think our young children should be confronted with nude bathers on these public beaches . "
Mr Laidlaw , who made international headlines in 1951 after escorting a Hollywood starlet , Jean Parker , off Bondi for wearing a skimpy swimsuit , would applaud such sentiments .
But many public figures poured scorn on Mr Nile , with Sally Betts , the mayor responsible for Bondi , declaring that toplessness did not equate to nudity .
" Nude is when you 've got no clothes on , " she said .
Ms Betts added that Sydney faced far worse social problems than bare breasts .
" We 've got alcohol - related violence , we 've got underage drinking and antisocial behaviour in the public domain : those are really important issues , " she told local radio .
And – pertinently , in a country with the world 's highest rate of skin cancer – a junior health minister , Jodi McKay , said that safety in the sun was more important than who exposed what .
Nude sunbathing is permitted on certain beaches in every state except Queensland .
As for the Speedo trunks that so upset Mr Laidlaw : the men he arrested were charged with indecency , but the case was dismissed because no pubic hair had been exposed .
A new front : Defining decency
A decision by Facebook to censor pictures of breastfeeding mothers has caused a backlash .
Barry Schnitt , a spokesman for the social networking website , said the images had been removed to protect children .
" Photos containing a fully exposed breast ( as defined by showing the nipple or areola ) do violate those terms ( on obscene , pornographic or sexually explicit material ) and may be removed , " he said .
Kelli Roman , who fell foul of the breastfeeding ban , has collected 80,000 names for an online petition called " Hey Facebook , breastfeeding is not obscene ! "

Alaskans are use to a more rustic lifestyle than the rest of the lower 48 states .
However , a possible upcoming event will likely be more than just an inconvenience .
Mt. Redoubt , located about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage , is part of the Aleutian Range of Alaska , an active volcanic mountain range .
Mount Redoubt erupted in 1902 , 1966 and 1989 .
That last eruption spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000 ft and an area of about 7,700 sq. miles .
Ever since scientists warned that an eruption was imminent , citizens in Anchorage and other areas near the volcano have been stocking up at grocery stores , hardware stores ( for face masks and goggles ) and auto parts stores ( for air filters ) .
Unlike some volcanoes , like the ones in Hawaii , which are noted for their molten red lava flows , Alaskan volcanoes feature ash plumes that shoot up 30,000 to 50,000 feet high — more than nine miles — into the jet stream .
This ash is then carried miles away .
One of the biggest issues with these type of ash eruptions is air travel , or should I say that lack thereof .
Whenever volcanic ash is present , planes cannot fly .
Volcanic ash is abrasive , and can cause damage to the engines of an airliner .
During that last eruption of Mt. Redoubt , a KLM jet carrying 231 passengers accidentally flew into the ash plume
All four engines flamed out .
Before the crew was able to restart the engines and after dropping more than 2 miles in altitude , smoke and a sulfur odor filled the cabin .
The plane did land safely , but required $ 80 million in repairs .
While not the Alaskan cruise season ( so most travelers wo n’t be impacted ) , you have to know that volcanoes have no seasons .
Last August , near the end of the Alaskan cruise season , ash from Mt. Kasatochi , a volcano in the Aleutians , impacted much of Alaska .
While it did n’t prevent ships from sailing , it did cancel flights for days , likely impacting some travelers efforts to either get to a ship or back home .
But then , travelers to Alaska should adhere to the adage that most residents live by : Go with the Flow .

Harry Caray must be smiling upstairs .
It truly was a day of firsts for Wrigley Field .
Not only was it the first hockey game ever played at this historic park , but also the first time in history when NHL ice dancers were in the house .
Bare - legged ice dancers .
Just how Harry Caray would have liked them : young , skinny and wearing Bud Light sponsored 1987 basketball shorts .
We ’re not really sure what the ladies were doing in the crowd other than making men stare and wives angry .
This Winter Classic just keeps getting better .
Invading storied American parks with a Canadian game and somehow working hot chicks into the equation makes this an emerging must - visit event for sports fans .

One of the notable features of open source software is forking .
If an open source project takes a direction that users or developers do n't like , well , they can fork off in a new direction .
In these cases , developers of open source licensed code can fork a project and create a new application that takes a different path than the original code .
That 's what happened with the Nessus vulnerability scanner in 2005 which led to the OpenVAS ( Open Vulnerability Assessment System ) project .
OpenVAS is now out with its 2.0 release , which still shows some of its Nessus roots but is n't focused on keeping up with what 's happening on the main Nessus effort .
The Nessus fork is now carving out its own niche and moving out of the shadow of its creation .
" You will still be able to see the origins of OpenVAS , " OpenVAS developer Jan-Oliver Wagner told InternetNews.com .
" However , many parts are not compatible anymore and only few patches to OpenVAS might still apply to Nessus 2.x .
The OpenVAS developers have not started to rewrite major parts of the code .
It was rather about removing redundant code paths and other cleanups as well as new features . "
Sailing around the world may not , for most people , be associated with cheap , never mind free , travel , but if you 've ever dreamed of watching the sunrise from the deck of a yacht , out of sight of land , or watching the dolphins playing in your bow wave , these dreams may not be as far - fetched as they sound , even if you have no money , sailing experience , or boat of your own .
It is possible to sail around the world for free , and once you know where to look , it 's not that hard to find a ride .
A few years ago I decided , as many people do , to backpack around the world .
I bought a one - way ticket from Europe to Australia even though I knew a round - the - world ticket would be more economical .
I did n't want to be tied down to a return air fare , and I thought I might just hitch a ride back to Europe on a yacht .
It did n't seem that believable at the time , even to me , but that 's exactly how I got ( halfway ) home .
It 's the way a lot of relatively inexperienced sailors get around the world , and mostly it costs very little or nothing at all .
If you 're interested in getting a passage on a boat ( as opposed to a professional crew position ) there are a few things to bear in mind .
1 . No real experience is necessary , but a willingness to learn is .
I had only been sailing a handful of times , but managed to get a place on a boat sailing out of Darwin to the Indonesian Spice Islands , and on to Lombok , Bali , Jakarta and Singapore .
All the skipper required of me — and the four other non-sailing travelers who had volunteered — was that we went sailing with him once a week for the month before we set off , and made a real commitment to learn the basics .
2 . Be willing to pitch in .
You 're not on a cruise , or a paid charter .
You will be expected to help out with cooking , washing up , and various cleaning and maintenance jobs around the boat , both at sea and in port .
3 . Use your hostel resources .
Backpacking hostels in seaside towns / sailing communities are a great place to find contacts .
I got that first trip from a note on a hostel notice board , and I know plenty of people who 've done the same thing .
Talk to the locals working at your hostel .
They 'll often have sailing contacts amongst their friends and family .
4 . Hang out at the sailing club .
Upmarket yacht clubs may require you to be a member to even set foot on the premises but most grass roots sailing clubs are casual , friendly , and a great place to have a few beers .
The bartender at a sailing club is a good friend to make ( is n't any bartender ? ) .
He or she will know which skippers are planning long trips and whether they might want extra crew .
5 . Be in the right place at the right time .
Rallies and races mean lots of boats setting off together and more chance of finding a spare place .
The Darwin to Ambon race starts late July , and involves up to 60 yachts setting out from Darwin to the Indonesian Spice Islands ( many continue to cruise on to other parts of Southeast Asia ) .
The Atlantic Rally Challenge involves around 250 yachts setting out from Gran Canaria in November ( many will set out from mainland Spain and Portugal the month before ) .
They aim to arrive in St Lucia in time for Christmas .
These are both events where the emphasis is on fun and comradeship , rather than all - out competitive racing , and there are many more all over the world .
Check out what 's happening on your travel route before you set off .
6 . Do n't expect luxury .
If you want to crew a state - of - the - art boat with a trained chef and a cocktail cabinet , apply for a job on a billionaire 's super yacht ( experience , qualifications and a pristine uniform required ) .
If you hitch a ride on an average sailing boat you will usually be in fairly cramped conditions .
Facilities will be basic .
You will be washing in salt water .
You may have to " hot - bunk " .
This involves sharing your bunk with another crew member but is not as much fun as it sounds .
It simply means that one of you is on watch , whilst the other sleeps .
When it 's time for your crew mate 's watch , you wake him up and get in his bunk ( at least it 's warm ) .
Many boats have more crew than bunks and operate the above system at sea .
In port you may find yourself sleeping on the floor or out on deck .
( During a warm rainy season I recommend wrapping yourself in a spare sail — surprisingly cozy and almost completely dry ! )
7. Travel light .
Most backpackers do this anyway , but you may have to lighten up even more for a long leg at sea .
You 'll have really limited storage space .
If , for example , you 're halfway through a long trip , now might be a good time to ship home any extra items you 've acquired on your travels , and pass on anything you do n't need to other travelers .
8 . Be sure before you set out that this is really for you .
Be honest .
Do you get seasick ?
Claustrophobic ?
Easily bored ?
All these can make a long sea journey a nightmare .
Spend as much time with the rest of the crew as you can .
You will be stuck with them for a long time .
On a 30 foot boat you finally understand what it 's really like to have nowhere to go .
No one expects a long sailing trip to complete without some friction , but if you really think you might get to the stage where you could happily kill and eat these people ( hey , you 've been living on canned goods and stale crackers for a few weeks now ! ) it might be as well to re-think before you 're a four day sail from the nearest ( uninhabited ) island .
9 . Do n't expect to be paid .
There are great paid positions for experienced sailors , but that 's not what we 're talking about here .
You will basically be hitching a lift .
Some skippers will support you during the trip as a thank you for your hard work .
Others will expect you to make a financial contribution towards food supplies and other expenses such as fuel and cooking gas .
Make sure you know exactly what your skipper expects before you commit to the trip .
10 . Collect and keep contact details of everyone you meet during that first trip .
Get the phone number and email address of your skipper , crew , the crew members of other boats , staff at marinas and sailing clubs , and anyone else you meet along the way .
On a wet Wednesday back in your hometown , or stuck in a cubicle selling pet insurance next winter , I can almost guarantee you 're going to want to make a few calls .

Questions & Answers
Question :
We have taken the inexperienced offshore passenger and found that the passenger was more a liability than a help .
When a passenger is seasick , going down below is an arduous task , as you will more than likely become sicker .
Also , we have had guests leave the water running in the head while in transit .
Just a few issues to address of many .
Since those experiences , we request experienced people only for the safety of our crew and family aboard .
Can I ask you how you began sailing ?
Answer :
As I described in the article , I got a place on a boat sailing out of Darwin as part of the Darwin to Ambon race , and on to Lombok , Bali , Jakarta , and Singapore .
I had grown up around powerboats all my life but had only been sailing a few times with family friends .
The skipper asked me , and the four other non-sailing travelers who had volunteered , to go sailing with him every weekend for the month before we set off , and learn the basics .
He made sure we were all thoroughly briefed on everything - including things like head use , fire safety , proper use of provisions etc - as well as learning to actually sail .
Even experienced sailors get seasick sometimes .
On that particular trip , I was the only one who did n't , including the skipper ( which did mean I got sent down below a lot ) but everyone 's seasickness was mild and occasional .
I guess a serious problem with that would have come up ( excuse the pun ) on our practice sessions .
James J Mills from Northern California on August 17 , 2015 :
Nice article Karen ..... having been both skipper and crew I would say that you got it right on nearly all points .
I would highly recommend that anyone ( especially a female ) get references for any potential crew or captains you consider sailing with on any ocean voyage ....

Hi Marc , sounds like an amazing trip .
Have n't spent time in that part of the world recently so I 'm out of touch with the sailing scene in Indonesia but you might find some leads here :

Marc on July 18 , 2013 :
Hi , I 'm currently attempting to travel from Istanbul to Japan overland & overseas .
I 'm now 9 months on the road and riding a bicycle across Sumatra in Indonesia .
I love sailing boats and always dreamed to catch one on this trip .
I would do anything cooking , cleaning , etc. to learn get the chance to learn how to sail .
If you have any advice on finding someone in Indonesia it 's most welcome ( noted your advice about guesthouses and sailing club already ) .

I never thought this could be possible but you have proved me wrong .
It sounds like a great adventure for young people , not for me though , the food description and the easily bored warning make me think I would not enjoy it .

Thanks for stopping by GetitScene .
Have checked out some of your hubs .
Love your sailing stuff .
Dale Anderson from The High Seas on September 07 , 2012 :
EXCELLENT article .
I know a lot of people that have done this and most of them do it more than once .
It 's a lot more common than most land - folk realize .
When I berthed my boat at the San Diego customs dock I 'd have complete strangers stopping by my boat every day to ask if I needed crew .
If you 're looking for passage it's also a good idea to put up notices at marine stores and on marina billboards .

Great article and insight .
I crew aboard sailboats when I can .
As you say , it the crew working together that makes it all worthwhile .
Kenneth Wayne from Alabama on May 10 , 2010 :
Not that I plan on doing any of this , but I never even thought about going out to sea in this manner .
Interesting !
Karen Banes ( author ) from Canada on April 26 , 2010 :
You 're right kelgs13 .
I do n't suffer with seasickness but a lot of people do .
And you certainly do n't want to commit to a long trip if you 're one of them .
Having said that , on my big trip everyone suffered short bouts of seasickness ( including the skipper who had 30 years of sailing experience ! ) but no - one suffered long - term .
There are some great seasickness medications on the market now , for those who do suffer - although you have to be careful .
On a long trip you 'll be on regular night watches and do n't want to take anything that might make you drowsy !
kelgs13 on April 25 , 2010 :
I am an experinced sailer .
Sailing is no vacation it is hard work , if you are not use to the sea there is a good chance you will get sick , 80 % of people I take out on my boat who are not experinced want to get back to land less then 1 hour later the another 10 % will last for over 2 hours when the sea is rolling .
The seas and oceans can be overbearing to some , there is no time for fishing or margaritas when your in 15 foot rolling seas for a week strait .
While sailing may seem like a dream to some it is just that a dream .
De Greek from UK on March 02 , 2010 :
Excellent !
Interesting even to an old geezer like me :-) )

This sounds like a dream trip .
I have heard of a bunch of websites that hook up volunteer crew with boats .
Create a dream and then figure out a way to make it happen .

Ferrari says that it is not going to be involved in Formula 1 with standardised engines .
This is reiterating what several other manufacturers have said ( either on or off the record ) .
The Ferrari Board of Directors examined the proposed changes to the F1 regulations , in the light of the current global economic crisis .
The company says that it has a " wholehearted commitment to a substantial and needed reduction in costs in Formula 1 , starting with propulsion " , but the Ferrari board expressed " strong concerns " regarding plans to standardise engines as it felt that such a move would detract from the entire raison d'etre of a sport with which Ferrari has been involved continuously since 1950 , based principally on competition and technological development .
The board of directors expressed the opinion that should these key elements be diminished , it would have to re-evaluate , with its partners the viability of continuing its presence in the sport .
There is a clear message here for the FIA .
Hopefully someone within the federation will take the hint .
Car unions demand British bail - out as Bush unveils £ 11bn rescue package for U.S. firms
Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk unless the motor industry receives financial aid from the Government ‘ within days ’ , a union leader warned .
The comments by Derek Simpson of Unite put Prime Minister Gordon Brown under renewed pressure to help the industry in the wake of a U.S. decision to provide billions of dollars in loans to its own troubled carmakers .
President George Bush said allowing the Big Three - Ford , Chrysler and General Motors - to fail would not be ‘ a responsible course of action ’ .
Troubled : Jobs at factories like Jaguar 's Castle Bromwich plant , above , are at risk unless a rescue deal is agreed ' within days ' , a union leader warned
American car firms will get £ 11.5 billion ( $ 13.4billion ) in short - term financing from a £ 472 billion Wall Street bail - out , followed by another £ 2.7 billion later .
A British Government offer of assistance is also said to be imminent , with Jaguar set to be handed an emergency loan before Christmas .
Lord Bhattacharyya , a Labour peer and industrial expert , told the Financial Times he was confident the Government would arrange ‘ fairly soon ’ a package of loans to help the sector and was discussing it already .
The package being discussed , he thought , amounted to £ 667 million to help Jaguar Land Rover in addition to an unspecified sum for other car companies .
Mr Simpson , joint leader of the Unite union , urged the Treasury not to delay any longer in providing short - term financial assistance to the UK industry .
‘ Government must establish a strategic funding mechanism for the car industry within days , not weeks , ’ he said .
George Bush leaves the Roosevelt Room in the White House after speaking about the failing U.S. car industry
‘ It is simply no good bailing out the banks if the banks wo n’t then bail out business .
‘ Only action by the Treasury in the next few days will safeguard the tens of thousands of jobs and the many communities across the country depending on car manufacturing for their livelihoods .
‘ For their sake and the sake of our manufacturing base we do not have the luxury of pondering on intervention for weeks or months .
Intervention must come this side of Christmas . ’
He said that what was being asked for was ‘ not a handout ’ but access to strategic funding for a key economic sector .
‘ By providing short - term loans , repayable with interest , the Treasury could instantly restore some liquidity to this system and save the tens of thousands of skilled jobs that are at this moment hanging by a thread . ’

Chrysler is closing its 30 North American manufacturing plants until at least January 19
Mr Simpson said the UK motor industry was world - class , having undergone a massive modernisation process in recent times .
‘ But it has been hit hard by the global credit crunch - the market has simply seized up .
Make no mistake , failure to support the car industry now will have severe , damaging ramifications for the rest of our manufacturing base , ’ he added .
But Mr Brown yesterday told his final news conference of 2008 that no promise of support had been offered to firms in the UK .
He said : ‘ Different industries will have different problems at this time .
There is a problem about consumer demand in the car industry .
‘ We , of course , talk to the larger companies in our country regularly .
But I ’ve got no announcement or decision to make about what we can do .
‘ These are issues that will be debated over the next period of time , but there is no promise that we 've made of any support . ’
Unite has been pressing for a £ 13 billion strategic support package from the Government , similar to support provided by the German , French and Swedish governments .

Mr Simpson ’s comments were backed by the head of the Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) , who said ministers needed to act with ‘ urgency ’ to save an industry that is ‘ vital to our future ’ .
With 800,000 jobs reliant on car - making in the UK , director - general Richard Lambert said taxpayers could afford to provide short - term loans for ailing firms .
Mr Lambert said : ‘ The whole industry needs access to credit and I think this is something the Government could do and should do with urgency .
‘ This is not money that ’s being given away , it ’s money that will be repaid . ’
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has warned that the Government does not have an ‘ open chequebook ’ to help struggling companies .

Khan must serve at least 20 years in prison A woman who paid members of a rap band to attack her husband before killing him by running him over in a 4x4 vehicle has been jailed for life .
Faria Khan , 29 , who was earlier found guilty of murder , paid members of the band Dem Boyz £ 200 to kidnap and kill 30 - year - old Nawajid Khan in Sheffield .
The city 's crown court heard that when Mr Khan fought back , the mother - of - two decided to run him over with the car .
She was told she must serve a minimum of 20 years in prison .
The court heard Khan , of Pitsmoor , Sheffield , had engaged a group of " posturing would - be gangsters " to kidnap and murder her estranged husband as he walked to a takeaway in the city , where her husband worked as a chef .
But when he and his friend put up a fierce defence when they were attacked by the gang , she decided to run him over .
You fought this case all the way and lied throughout
Judge Michael Murphy , addressing Khan Mr Khan died of multiple injuries outside Milan 's pizza shop in Chesterfield Road on 27 January 2008 .
Three other people , who had earlier been found guilty of Mr Khan 's murder , were also jailed .
Gang members Brian Yorachi , 20 , and Kanu Kangi , 21 , both of Fir Vale , were sentenced to life , with a minimum term of 17 years each .
Neelam Kauser , 18 , of Tinsley , who introduced Khan to the rappers , was sentenced to 14 years in prison .
Two other members of Dem Boyz , Daniel Moore , 23 , of Upperthorpe , and Abdiquadar Mohammed , 18 , of Gleadless Valley , were earlier found guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to kidnap .
Mr Khan died from multiple injuries Moore was jailed for eight years and Mohammed was sentenced to seven years in a young offenders ' institution .
Khan claimed she had been subjected to violent abuse by her husband but Judge Michael Murphy said : " You fought this case all the way and lied throughout . "
He said she killed her husband because she could not cope with the " financial and social consequences " of the couple 's impending divorce .
The judge added : " You recruited a group of posturing would - be gangsters who were prepared , for some little payment and more probably for their own self - image as hard men , to do what you wanted them to do . "
He said among the items found in the car for use in the intended kidnap plot were two axes and a knife .
The judge said Yorachi portrayed himself as a violent rap artist who could " arrange acts of violence to order " and told him he had taken part in order to boost his " tawdry credibility and glory amongst your fellow would - be hoodlums " .

I often post photos on photography fora .
Most fora want you to place a link to a photo somewhere on the net , but different fora have different rules .
Some fora want you to stick to a maximum of 800 pixels wide , some 700 pixel and some even strange values like 639 pixels .
My own site uses 600 pixels so I end up resizing images all the time .
Since I keep my originals with my gallery as well ( hidden for public viewing ) resizing on the fly would be a nice asset .
I 'm using my previous snippet to apply a slight unsharp mask for better web display of my photos .
usage
This snippet takes the url to my photo application which is a simple link using the pk of my photo table and adds ' width '.jpg to the end ( some fora check if the link is an image based on extenstion )
The view takes the width requested and creates the resized image from the original full size image or takes it from the cache for display on demand .
To prevent a dozen directories I use a setting to specify which widths are allowed , providing room for several versions of the same image .
Any improvements are appreciated since I 'm still rather inexperienced in Python and Django .
Jennifer Aniston on David Letterman ( Video )
received an early Christmas present last night on the Late Show when actressstopped by to talk about Marley & Me , which hits theaters on Christmas Day .
What was the gift ?
The tie that Jen wore on the January cover of GQ magazine .
What makes the tie so special ?
It was the only thing she was wearing .
Letterman 's band started to play a little burlesque type music while Dave quickly shed the tie he was wearing and put on Jen's .
The actress called the ' dressing of Dave ' an historic event in her career .

It becomes obvious , as the hotel door swings open into a wall of tobacco smoke , that Burton Cummings has not held onto that famous rock ' n ' roll howl all these years by cutting cigarettes out of his diet .
Or by cutting anything out of his diet , by the looks of things .
Delighted that his inquisitor will join him and a managerial type in their next round of smokes – " Always good to meet another brother in the great fraternity of smokers , " he crows – he settles his portly frame back behind a half - eaten burger - and - fries plate and divulges the secret health regimen that allowed a 60 - year - old Burton Cummings to sound reassuringly , robustly like the Burton Cummings of yore while recording his latest album , Above the Ground .
" Good Canadian beer and good Canadian cigarettes , man , " says the former Guess Who singer , who turned 61 on New Year 's Eve .
" Yeah , my health regimen : I eat junk food , I do all the wrong things for a singer .
But I do use my voice a lot .
When I 'm at home , I 'll pick up a guitar and sing songs or go to the piano and sing .
I think your voice is like any other muscle : if you do n't use it , it 'll let you down .
But if you use it all the time ...
" There are some singers who do n't lose it , and I would like to try to be one of those for another 10 or 20 years maybe . "
The voice is there , then .
But Cummings realized just how long it had been since he'd provided the world with any evidence that he could still write a song when his songwriting foil of four decades , Randy Bachman , went down for a shoulder operation in November 2007 and begged off touring duties in their Bachman - Cummings nostalgia act for a few months .
Was he going to keep schlepping around , sans Bachman , doing " American Woman " and " No Sugar Tonight " every night ?
Or was he going to stop dithering and do something with the stacks of songs he 'd accumulated since his last solo album , Plus Signs , was released in 1990 ?
" This window opened up , so rather than just touring and playing the old songs as Burton , I thought : ` Here 's my chance to make this new album I 've been thinking about for a few years , ' " he recalls .
" And next thing I know – bang - o! – the studio was booked for Jan. 11 , 2008 , and the flights were booked for my band , the Carpet Frogs , to come down from Toronto to L.A .
Once I heard officially that it was gonna happen , it was like a bit of weight was lifted off my shoulders . "
Perhaps conscious of past mistakes made in the studio , for Above the Ground Cummings stuck to the bluesy , meat - and - potatoes rockers and wistful hippie - dippy ballads upon which his and the Guess Who 's careers were built .
The Carpet Frogs , a versatile Toronto outfit that 's served as Cummings ' touring band for most of the 2000s , were crucial to maintaining the record 's likeably straightforward , classic - rock feel , says Cummings , who wanted to avoid making a studio record that sounded " synthetic and machinistic , " and go for something that sounded more organic this time around .
Thus , he shot up to Toronto for a few days of prep work with the Frogs in a Brampton rehearsal studio before recording began .
" This a real band that plays live , that works live and we just took that into the studio and recorded it .
The album would n't be what it is without the Carpet Frogs , " he says .
" We 're very good friends .
We 've been working together for seven or eight years now .
You can get the high - dollar , hotshot studio players to come in , and they play great and it's all good and they get their huge cheque and they leave .
And the next afternoon , these guys would n't remember one thing about these songs that they 've played on and you 'll never see them again in your life .
There 's a detachment to it .
" I 've worked that way before .
When I first went solo we had all these hotshot players : Jim Keltner , Jim Gordon , Jeff Porcaro and Scotty Edwards on bass and Ray Parker Jr. on guitar sometimes , Jim Horner on sax .
I had my choice of the cream of the crop of L.A. studio players and , do n't get me wrong , those were good records .
But to have my own band and take that band feeling into the studio , it sounds like a `band ' record . "
Curiously , after 40 years in the business and armloads of gold records , Cummings also managed to notch a personal " first " with Above the Ground : it 's the only record in his career written and produced entirely by Burton Cummings and Burton Cummings alone .
" This is the first time I 've ever written all the songs myself without one co-writer on anything .
When I looked at the back cover and saw ` All songs by Burton Cummings , ' I thought : ` Aaaw , is n't that nice to see ? '
After 33 releases , that 's the first one , " he says .
" I was exhausted by the end of that , but I 'm proud it and I 'm pleased with it .
There was no interference , no intervention from anybody .
There was nobody telling me , ` Do this , do n't do that ! ' or ` Do n't do this , do that !'
So I 've really made the album I wanted to make . "
Silva tells CNBC up to a thousand face failure or forced mergers
Paul Joseph Watson

Wednesday , December 24 , 2008
Financial analyst Ralph Silva of TowerGroup told CNBC this morning that he expects no less than one third of banks to fail in 2009 and that anything up to a thousand could collapse if they do n’t merge .
Silva said that only five or six global banks have enough funds to survive comfortably throughout 2009 .
“ The rest of the banks , and that means a thousand other banks , do n’t have enough money to get themselves through 2009 , ” added Silva .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ In 2009 we ’re gonna see one third of the banks in the G8 countries disappear , either being merged , forced or not forced , or completely disappearing , ” said Silva .
The analyst predicted that rather than letting banks fail , governments will force them to merge , citing the example of Bradford and Bingley in the UK , which would lead to “ very few banks owning quite a bit more . ”
Silva warned that banks would not be able to lend any money throughout 2009 because they would be more concerned with merely surviving and being able to pay their own employees .

Google ( s goog ) recently announced an extension framework for Chrome , adding the ability to run extra software in the browser .
It ’s a feature many had long considered missing from Google ’s browser — and one that has been key to Firefox ’s popularity .
But with the Chrome extensions , Google is doing much more than just playing catch - up with Firefox .
An extensible browser is the missing piece of a much bigger puzzle :
By tying its App Engine to Google Apps ( more details in the App Engine blog ) , the company has delivered a complete ecosystem for cloud ISVs .
All software ecosystems need four basic things :
A platform — A complete cloud platform is distributed , ubiquitous , and works both offline and on .
App Engine lets developers build the server - side portion and not worry about scaling .
And Chrome ’s extensions let coders build a cross-platform user interface that leverages the Gears framework to work even when disconnected .
Rich APIs —
All those apps can use authentication , chat , OpenSocial , calendaring , Checkout , search , mapping , and other Google services .
That makes it easy to build rich apps with familiar components .
Administration — Google Apps lets an administrator purchase , provision and manage permissions for an app .
Deployment is easy :
Once you ’ve found the app you want in the Google Marketplace , just click the “ add ” button , then install the Chrome extension .
A market — Google Apps has 10 million active users and is signing up some 3,000 new companies a day , according to Matthew Glotzbach , product management director of Google Enterprise .
With the Chrome extensions , Google has made it possible for ISVs to launch ready - made niche applications for the cloud .
It ’s the same thing Facebook did with its API and Salesforce ( s crm ) did with AppExchange ; in Google ’s case , ISVs now have a turnkey channel that can reach small businesses easily .
The ability to let Apps customers buy third - party software is n’t quite ready yet .
“ Now , Google Apps administrators can also deploy several new Google applications hosted on App Engine to members of their organizations with Google Apps Labs , ” said Pete Koomen , product manager for App Engine .
So for example , a dentist ’s office could use Google ’s Docs suite for word processing and spreadsheets , but also buy third - party apps from Marketplace — one for patient scheduling , and another for invoicing .
They ’d all work smoothly together , online and off , using the Apps / Docs / Chrome ecosystem .
With Google looking to find revenues beyond advertising , monetizing those 10 million accounts has got to be a big priority .
Selling third - party applications ca n’t be far off .
Of course , these apps will work with any browser .
But they ’ll likely work better with Chrome and its extensions .

It is one of the most glorious pieces of natural theatre .
Assuming you spend your life on the same part of the Earth ’s surface , you might witness it once – if you are particularly lucky or very long - lived , perhaps twice .
But a total solar eclipse is worth the wait .
At the height of totality , the fit of sun and moon is so perfect that beads of sunlight can only penetrate to us through the rugged valleys on the lunar surface , creating the stunning “ diamond ring ” effect .
It is all thanks to a striking coincidence .
The sun is about 400 times as wide as the moon , but it is also 400 times further away .
The two therefore look the same size in the sky – a unique situation among our solar system ’s eight planets and 166 known moons .
Earth is …
Editor 's note : Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound - off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday .
If you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you .
A nationally syndicated columnist , Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November .
He is the author of " Listening to the Spirit Within : 50 Perspectives on Faith " and " Speak , Brother !
A Black Man's View of America . "
Visit his Web site for more information .
Roland S. Martin says the McCain campaign has done Sarah Palin a disservice by keeping her hidden .
( CNN ) -- Is Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin running for vice president of the United States or vice president of the student council ?
Listening to some political strategists , pundits and radio and TV blowhards , you would think that all she has to do is show up , sign her name on the roll , and she 's done enough to satisfy the requirement for president .
Do people really and truly understand that she will be sitting a heartbeat away from the presidency , backing up a 72 - year - old guy who has a history of cancer ?
Nothing drives me nuts more than listening to some of these folks who act as if we should n't expect Palin -- and Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen.
Joe Biden -- to be well - versed on national issues , foreign policy and the social and cultural issues that have to define America .
Conventional wisdom says that the vice president means nothing and that the voters going to the polls between now and November 4 are really voting on Sens.
Barack Obama and John McCain .
iReport.com : What would you ask Palin , Biden ?
But looking at the role that the last few vice presidents have played , especially Vice President Dick Cheney , it is clear that the VP can make a world of difference and that we should be demanding the tough answers to tough questions from both candidates .
Now , the blowhards have been going on and on , suggesting that too much attention is being paid to her gaffes and not to those of Biden .
True .
But what we have learned this election season is that there are double standards .
Countless folks have said that we all know McCain , and it 's necessary to scrutinize every aspect of Obama .
Really ?
I think if you ask the average person , they 'll know a lot more about Obama 's childhood than McCain , solely by the level of scrutiny .
The truth is , the nation does n't know much about Palin .
And when folks do n't know a lot about you , there is an expectation to get to know more .
As for Palin , I fundamentally believe that millions of Americans want to know what she thinks about the critical issues of the day and not from reading cue cards .
The McCain camp has done her a huge disservice by treating her like a Faberge egg , totally untouchable .
She needed to do multiple media interviews and not keep an arm 's distance from the media and , yes , the general public .
Back to that low expectation thing .
The reality is that the McCain camp and Republicans want that .
Even Biden and the Obama camp are tamping down expectations , hoping that if the bar is set just above someone 's ankle , it will be easy to cross .
Hogwash .
Now is not the time for low bars and low expectations .
We need our candidates to think big and be big .
They need to speak to our concerns and our fears .
And yes , Biden has been around a long time , and many say they know what to expect from the loquacious one .
But Palin must strut her stuff .
Thursday 's debate will not be read from a teleprompter .
It wo n't be on cue cards .
With the nation watching , she is going to put up or shut up .
What is most at stake is whether she 's the subject of further ridicule or can show Americans that she has a strong command of the issues .
If she can do the latter , she validates McCain 's selection .
If not , she calls into question his judgment , and at this stage of the game , that is not a good thing .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

DC protesters demonstrate against Bush the President , one last time Mike Sheehan and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday January 19 , 2009
Print This Email This Dozens marched on Washington , D.C. 's 17th Street today in a last - minute sendoff for departing President George W. Bush .
Citizen journalist Mike Rogers , a staff member of RAW STORY , captured exclusive photos of the protesters , in the blocked - off zone around the White House .
Numerous videos of the protest , found at the bottom of this story , were also submitted to YouTube .
The group had a police escort in front and back and were allowed to march on the closed streets .
Iraq Veterans Against the War , World Can't Wait : Drive
Out the Bush Regime , Code Pink and other protest groups took part in the demonstration .
The final DC protest of Bush the President culminated with a barrage of shoes being hurled at White House gates ; a symbolic gesture of solidarity with Muntadar al - Zeidi , an Iraqi correspondent for Al - Baghdadia television , who threw his shoes at President Bush as he gave a press briefing in Baghdad .
Al - Zeidi's brash act made him a folk hero in Iraq , driving a massive spike in sales of the " Bush Shoe , " formerly known as Ducati Model 271 .
One protester , wearing a jail uniform and dummy Bush head , walked before a group of others holding a large sign saying " Arrest Bush . "
Others held a sign with an anti-war quote from Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , whose birthday today is a federal holiday , while a group from Code Pink held a similar sign .
" A hooded , black - clad man posing as the Grim Reaper stood nearby with a sign saying ' Death thanks Bush and Cheney . '
The reaper , in an interview , added : " Theyve been very good for business , ' " reported Reuters .
" On the stage nearby -- behind a neat line of boots , loafers and sneakers -- Gael Murphy , co-founder of the antiwar group Code Pink , called Zaidi courageous and thanked ' everyone who has stood up and spoken truth to power in their own way , ' " said the LA Times .
" Hold onto your shoes , " Murphy is quoted as saying .
" The struggle is not over . "
President - elect Barack Obama is to be sworn in tomorrow in the nation 's capital , while Bush will head to his ranch in Crawford , Texas to begin post - White House life .
The following videos were captured , edited and posted by protesters outside the White House on Jan. 19 , 2009 .
Mike Sheehan , David Edwards , Mike Rogers and Stephen C. Webster contributed to this report .

You are reading the headline correctly .
Bill O'Reilly really has no material to work with on his phony " War on Christmas " theme - based show , so he 's resorted to just making sh&t up .
F& F 's Gretchen Carlson is all fired up too over the big Christmas crisis so far .
The only incident that he 's been really passionate about because -- there ain't nothin ' to complain about anywhere else -- is in Washington state .
David gives you the back story :
According to Bill O'Reilly , it 's the fact that an atheist group was permitted to erect a holiday display alongside a Nativity scene at the state Capitol in Washington state ... read on
What really got Gretchen was a possible exhibit for the great " Festivus " holiday from Seinfield being proposed too .
Hey , she can take only so much .
Carlson :
When they wanted to do Festivus , give me a break .
O'Reilly : This is a mocking of Gregoire ...
Carlson :
To me that was the final straw today because Bill , what is going to be next ?
O'Reilly :
What 's going to be next is in our secular progressive society they are going to try and revoke the federal holiday .
You wait and see .
That 's going to come .
Carlson :
That 's what I said .
Jesus is taking a back seat .
They 're going to say separation of church and state , you can't have a federal holiday based on religion .
You wait and see , that 's what 's going to be next .
Hey , I like Christmas and all , but Bill is speaking in " baby talk " over this stuff .
We 're assuming that most of us have jobs next year , what a moronic man who nobody likes , not even his boss .
America does n't get enough time off as it is and even if people objected to a federally mandated law based on it , I doubt they mind getting the time off from work .
Oh , and Bill : Merry Christmas .
George Clooney and Matt Damon Overserved in London
and palset out on a city club crawl in London and from the looks of it , they rather enjoyed themselves .
Clooney was sporting a mustache for his upcoming role in the movie Men Who Stare at Goats .
As the two actors were leaving Nobu restaurant , George reached out for one of the Paparazzi 's cameras , but did n't have any luck .
His reflexes must have been a tad off due to his state of inebriation .
His driver helped him to the car and it was on to the next bar , Whiskey Mist nightclub .
We bet the boys are n't feeling so good today .

I think it ’s safe to say that the standard economist take on the Fed paying interest on reserves is that it was a tool to ( try to ) keep the federal funds rate from sinking .
The Fed had flooded the market with tons of new reserves ( see my new favorite chart below ) , and so naturally the interest rate on overnight loans of these reserves would sink .
Thus , Bernanke may have thought that he could achieve both of his objectives – ( 1 ) buy up dubious assets and ( 2 ) peg the federal funds rate–if he started paying interest on reserves .
If that was in fact Bernanke ’s plan , it obviously did n’t work .
( Robert Wenzel points out that one problem is that the GSEs are still able to lend reserves in the federal funds market , but they ’re not allowed to earn interest from the Fed .
So they would lend them out . )
Tyler Cowen links to this interesting Interfluidity post that discusses a different aspect I had n’t even considered :
Interest rates are , for the moment , excruciatingly low .
But a subsidy to the banking system , once put into place , will be quite hard to dislodge .
So , let ’s imagine that the Fed will pay interest on bank reserves in perpetuity , that it will pay such interest at or near the risk - free short - term interest rate , and that the expansion of the Fed ’s balance sheet is more or less permanent .
How large a subsidy to the banking system do the interest payments on reserves represent ?
Some problems are arithmetically challenging , but not this one .
The present value of a perpetual stream of market - rate interest payments is precisely the amount of the principal .
Therefore , the present value of the Fed ’s de facto commitment to pay interest to banks on $ 800B of freshly created reserves is $ 800B .
We fought and wailed and gnashed our teeth over potentially overpaying for TARP assets .
Meanwhile , we are quietly allowing the Fed give away , as a direct , literal subsidy , more than the entire $ 700B that Paulson was allowed to play with .
Note there is no question about this being an “ investment ” :
The interest payments that the Fed is now making to banks on its suddenly expanded balance sheet are not loans .
The banks owe taxpayers absolutely nothing in return for this windfall .
Now we can quibble about the calculation .
What the guy ( ? ) means is that the higher the interest rate the Fed pays , you ’d think the greater the subsidy .
But not if we take the interest rate to be “ the ” interest rate .
A dollar the Fed pays to the banks next year is n’t the same as a dollar today , and so if you discount future payments at the same rate of interest at which the initial principal is rolling over , then the present value of that entire future stream of interest is exactly equal to the original principal .
For what it ’s worth , it would n’t surprise me if the Fed discontinues interest payments once inflation gets out of control .
But then again , if the banks are still on a morphine drip ( which they will be–just look at housing projects ) , then maybe it will be too painful to contemplate .
Last point :
Even more than the mysterious open market operations , in which the Fed buys an asset ( such as a government bond ) from a bank and then credits its account with more reserves , here the Fed quite openly is “ creating money out of thin air . ”
Perhaps the actual mechanism is more subtle than this , but my understanding right now is that if you are a bank and have $ 1 million on deposit with the Fed , they pay you interest simply by changing the number in their records .
No need to debit this payment from some other fund , no need to get Congressional approval , no need to float bonds to raise the money for it .
You need to pay out a million dollars in reserves today ?
Go right ahead , just change the 1s and 0s in the computer .
I think it ’s starting to sink in with people , even members of Congress , how powerful the Fed really is .
I ’m still pretty sure Bernanke is mostly an academic , and he ’s trying to do what he can in an admittedly impossible situation .
The only real deceit I think coming from Bernanke is his acting like he knows what the hell he ’s doing .
But what happens when a real schemer runs the Fed ?
Do you realize that the Fed chairman effectively has a printing press at his command ?
Can you imagine the outcry if one sheik controlled the entire world ’s supply of oil ?
Well the Fed chair controls the world ’s supply of dollars .
I know — a juicy sale price on a gadget is hard to resist .
But the extras associated with these items are the real killers .
It 's time to look beyond the tag in search of values .

Game Consoles
Xbox 360 : Let 's say you scored an Xbox 360 Pro bundle this holiday for $ 240 .
Not bad — that 's a 20 % savings .
But you still might need / want an extra wireless controller , an HDMI cable , a wireless adapter and two play - and - charge battery kits .
All of a sudden , the price jumps up to $ 440 — nearly double the initial cost .

While you may be stuck with Microsoft wireless controllers , there are workarounds for the other components that can help bring costs down .
Going with trusted 3rd party manufacturers like Nyko on peripherals is one way to do this .
Their version of the play - and - charge battery kit for your controllers will save you $ 10 right off the bat .
As for the wireless adapter , you can set up a DIY version fairly easily using a cheap router , a few feet of Cat 5 cable and open source DD - WRT firmware — saving you as much as $ 70 .
You can even use your laptop as the wireless adapter and save the entire $ 100 .
By using your own HDMI , you can save as much as $ 45 .
And if you want to send digital audio separately , there 's a simple hack to your included AV cable .
All in all , the total cost of of your Xbox 360 hardware can be reduced from $ 440 to as little as $ 325 .

Nintendo Wii :
As far as essential add ons are concerned , Nintendo and Sony are not nearly as extreme as Microsoft .
However , there are still some deals to be found on accessories if you know where to look .
For example , Nyko will be offering wired versions of their Wing ( classic controller ) and Kama ( nunchuk ) for $ 15 apiece starting in January .
A $ 5 savings over the official version is n't much , but it starts to add up if you are buying several controllers for party games .

Another area that you can save with the Wii involves storage .
Buying the officially licensed 2GB SD card will set you back around $ 25 — but other than the Nintendo seal there is no difference between that and a standard $ 10 card .
Playstation 3 : Even if you managed to score a deal on the PS3 this holiday , you are still going to shell out additional cash for an HDMI cable .
By now , the world has realized that a cheap HDMI cable works just as well ( in most cases ) as an expensive version .
Therefore , it does n't make much sense to shell out $ 50 - $ 60 for an official PS3 HDMI cable when you can get a version that is perfectly fine for as little as $ 5 shipped .

Computers
Hardware : Like game consoles , picking up a new computer is n't always as straightforward as paying the sticker price .
MacBooks are a good example of this .
If you just picked up your first MacBook , chances are you are going to need two things right away : an upgrade to Wireless - N and an external hard drive that takes advantage of Leopard 's Time Machine functionality .
One option would be to drop $ 300 on a 500 GB version — or $ 500 on a 1TB version — of Apple 's Time Capsule wireless hard drive / base station .
Granted , this is an ideal solution to both problems , but MacBooks tend to put a hurtin ' on finances so there may not be much money left over to go this route .
Advertisement
On the lower end you could go with Apple 's AirPort Express and your own external hard drive .
The AirPort is actually a decent value at $ 99 — but you can still save a little extra cash by making a sacrifice or two and going outside of Apple .
For example , you can get a decent 802.11n router for as little as $ 70 .
You can also score a 500GB hard drive that can do the job via USB for $ 90 and under .
The throughput on the router may not be as high and you may have to deal with USB cables on the hard drive , but you are still getting fully functioning hardware at a sizable discount .

Software :
It 's almost never a good idea to purchase additional software from the manufacturer of your computer as an add on .
If , for some reason , you decided to get the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2008 suite from Apple they would charge you $ 135 extra when it can be easily had elsewhere for around $ 110 .
Dell goes even further by charging $ 149 for Office Home and Student 2007 when a version licensed for 3 PCs can be had for $ 75 .
Home Theaters
Cables :
Whenever you purchase home theater equipment there are a seemingly endless variety of hidden costs that can end up nickle - and - diming you to death .
Again , cabling is a big part of this equation .
As I mentioned earlier , in most cases shelling out big bucks for fancy HDMI cable is n't much different that flushing your cash down the toilet .
However , at cable distances greater than 6 feet or so this may not always be the case .
As we learned in our Truth About Monster Series , as a general rule , it is better to purchase your cables from a discount retailer like Monoprice and give them a shot before spending wads of money on products like Monster with enormous markups .

Of course , there are alternatives that can help you avoid these pitfalls .
Even if you have your heart set on a wall mount , there are stands out there like the Synchro Furniture Mate that are designed to achieve the wall - mounted look without the hassle of tearing up your walls .
As noted in our post on tips for buying an HDTV , if you decide to do it yourself to save a little extra cash , make sure you plan things out in advance .
I would also suggest pricing your mount across the internet before purchasing at retail because the markups are likely to be astronomical .
Case in point : Best Buy is offering a Sanus tilting wall mount for $ 145 when a quick visit to Pricegrabber revealed that the same mount is selling on Amazon for $ 78 .

As for setting up surround speakers , it definitely pays to do it yourself .
The old - fashioned method can be problematic , but there are solutions as simple as picking up some 4 - strand flat speaker cable and running it along your baseboard .
It costs under $ 60 from start to finish , it 's simple and it looks great .
Again , plan ahead and price your mounts online before heading off to your local electronics store .

These are but a few examples of how add ons and extras can kill a budget , but the point is clear — it pays to look at the big picture .
Before you jump at a sale price , do a little research and think about the total cost of ownership .
If you look hard enough , you can find deals that will help you save in the long term .

Ethnos printed photos showing a man apparently being made to strip naked
Greek police are investigating reports that a number of officers humiliated a suspect by carrying out a strip search in the centre of Athens .
The inquiry was ordered after a Greek newspaper published photographs of the incident involving a man who appears to be of Asian or Middle Eastern descent .
He was told to drop his trousers and underwear in the middle of the street , according to Ethnos .
The report was headlined " Guantanamo images in the centre of Athens " .
The photos have tarnished the image of the police as they try to crack down on spiralling crime and violence in the city centre .
Pictures of the event were taken from the offices of a leftwing organisation which campaigns on behalf of immigrants ' rights .
Its spokesman , Petros Constantinou , described the incident as a case of extreme racism .
The police have launched an internal inquiry and say that any officer implicated in the affair will be subject to disciplinary sanctions .
Troubled area
The episode will undermine the police as they struggle to cope with the rapidly changing nature of the area around Athens 's famous Omonia Square .
Side streets around Omonia are a magnet for illegal immigrants , who live in squalid accommodation and find it difficult , if not impossible , to support themselves .
They have been blamed by Laos , a rightwing political party , for a surge in drug crime and violence .
Athens used to pride itself as a safe and peaceful city but that reputation was shattered in August when 11 people were severely wounded during a battle between two rival African drug gangs wielding swords , axes and machetes .
The Athens Prefect , Yiannis Sgouros , has warned that action must be taken to clean up the area to prevent it becoming an arena for racial clashes and gang warfare .
He has described the situation as a ticking time bomb and he wants to expropriate abandoned buildings to re-house illegal immigrants in " safe places " .

On Google Disallowing Crawling of Their LIFE Hosting
Is n’t it great how Google makes millions of photos available to the world in their LIFE photo archive ?
Well – with one exception : they disallow other search engines to access these photos .
The same access rights that make Google Image search crawl other photo collections are not given by Google to competing image search engines for their photo hosting .
Here ’s the respective part in Google ’s robots .
txt that says so :
Disallow : / hosted / images /
Disallow : / hosted / life /
In crawler speak , this means : stay out of our images directory !
Indeed if there ’s any site in the world where the owners do n’t need to think about SEO in traditional terms , it ’s Google .
LIFE images still do appear in Google Image Search , ever since the service was released in November last year .
Google ’s internal programs can internally access whatever Google stores without looking at any robots .
txt .
Asking Google for their reasoning behind barring external image search engines from accessing their site , I received a reply , but it did n’t actually provide a reason :
While Google allows crawling of many of its own properties from Blogger to Knol , the LIFE photo archive is not available for crawling at this time .
To learn more about the licensing or merchandising of these images , visit www.timelifepictures.com.
Andy Baio tells me , “ It ’s disappointing that Google gets exclusive access to index these images and every other search engine is out of luck .
Exclusivity like this does n’t seem in line with Google ’s philosophy .
To me , it ’d be like the Flickr Commons only allowing Yahoo crawlers or Picasa blocking access to anything but Googlebot . ”

According to Lt. Danny Maguire of the Weston Police Department , " The biggest challenge we have is to convince people that , just because the law has changed , marijuana has not become ' legal , ' and that the problem of drug addiction is still just as severe as always .
There is also the danger that people will think it ’s actually OK , under the new law , to smoke a joint or two and get behind the wheel of a car . "
…
One ounce of marijuana is the equivalent of 200 to 300 joints , according to Maguire .
Police do n’t just get the facts wrong about the dangers of marijuana and the impact of commonsense reforms like decriminalization .
Frequently , they ’re wrong about marijuana itself , making wild claims about the street value of the latest bust or exaggerating plant yields to make small growers sound like major traffickers .
If you think you ’ve heard it all , here ’s a cop from Massachusetts who says an ounce equals 200-300 joints :
This is just shockingly crazy and wrong .
Researchers have estimated the average size of a joint between 0.4 and 0.9 grams , which would equal 30 - 70 joints per ounce .
If you roll more than 70 joints from an ounce , they ’ll be empty toothpick - sized joints with more paper than pot .
They wo n’t even work and no matter who you are , I ’m sure you know someone who can assure that this is true .
Claiming that you can roll up to 300 joints from an ounce is a total lie .
It ’s hilarious to anyone who ’s ever smoked or even seen a joint .
It ’s like claiming a bag of skittles will serve 300 people , when there ’s actually only 70 Skittles in the bag and most people do n’t find an individual Skittle very satisfying anyhow .
So what the hell is this guy talking about ?
He ’s angry that voters in Massachusetts decriminalized possession of up to an ounce of marijuana , and he ’s trying to pretend that ’s a huge amount of pot .
It is n’t .
His lie , on the other hand , is enormous .
In the social networking industry , the single most important factor for building user trust is strict control over their privacy .
It looks like Reunion.com continues to break their users ’ trust .
Back in May I wrote about Reunion.com spam tactics .
An article in LA Times highlights yet another privacy violation by Reunion.com .
This time around the company paid a third - party for a massive user database which ended up including the data of minors , one of which was only 4 - years old .
According to the article , “ Reunion.com ’s privacy policy says the site ‘ prohibits registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 . ’
But that does n’t address the site ’s own data - gathering . ”
The data may not have come from their recent user database acquisition though .
Instead a Reunion.com supervisor suggested that the information probable came from “ state vaccination records or from the Centers for Disease Control . ”
Wherever the data came from it can be shocking to see the information of your family members who are n’t members of the site showing up within your profile thanks to the help of third - party data .
Oregon State officials stated that this information is technically not public and that Reunion. com ’s assertion was completely inaccurate .
I think I smell a lawsuit coming .
The company appears to be in the business of aggregating profiles of individuals created by third - party data providers whether or not those individuals are actually users .
If there is one company that is good at building a bad reputation , I would say Reunion.com is .
Have you had any bad experiences with the company ?
WASHINGTON , Oct. 6 ( UPI ) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. Monday put a 35 - year - old ex-Goldman , Sachs & Co. executive in charge of ramrodding the $ 700 billion bailout program .
The former executive , Neel Kashkari , joined the Treasury Department in July 2006 as a senior adviser to Paulson and most recently has been assistant secretary for international economics and development .

People often forget that their biggest financial asset is not money , stocks , bonds , real estates or business .
Your and my biggest asset is financial knowledge and information .
It is heartbreaking to learn that people work hard for years only to trust their money blindly to the so - called fund managers of mutual funds .
Not that mutual funds and the likes are bad – but it is about time that people start to put their money to what matters most – financial education .
The premise is , if you have the right education , you can control your financial in whatever your personal financial endeavours .
Why you need to invest your money and time to obtain financial education and information
Your mind is your biggest asset – your mindset , what you know , and what you believe can command your decision making .
What many people experience in today credit crunch and financial slumps is mainly due to their lack of financial knowledge and information .
Lack of these commands your decision making quality , as people act according to the reality they have in their mind .
Well - informed mind will result in well - thought decision making , and this includes decision making that involves money .
How the lack of financial education affects you
Many personal bankruptcy stories are evolving around people that lost their money due to the stock market crash .
The most irritating thing is , they lost their money not because of their bad investment decision , but because of their blind trust to fund managers to manage their fund .
The truth is , it ’s not the fault of the fund managers – they do whatever they can , but the money owners themselves , for their lack of financial knowledge and information .
The moral of the stories is that people should regain control of their money – they have to decide where to invest in what , and when .
That is achievable through proper financial education , that can comes in many form – courses , seminars , mentorships , and many more .
Unfortunately , those could cost you hundreds to thousands of dollar .
Fortunately , there are large amount of free resources available , thanks to the Internet
The best thing of the Internet is information .
You can access finance articles , such as loans articles , personal finance articles , and other finance - related articles .
However , the Internet is so flooded with information , that you can get yourself biased due to the pros and cons , as well as different perspective of a financial issue .
The best way to choose which ones are the right ones for you , you can consult finance forums for recommendations , as well as , of course , visiting financial authority sites , such as Financial Times ’ FT.com .
Visiting finance section of large networks is also a good start – sites , such as Yahoo !
Finance , CNN Finance , and other similar sites can offer you credible information that will help you in your personal finance endeavours .
Conclusion
Every single person should take care of their own financial welfare – The Government ca n’t do that for you .
Your boss ca n’t do that for you .
Your parents ca n’t do that for you .
You have to stand up , take responsibility of your personal finance management .
Learn as many as you can , as knowledge will set you free – literally .

White House : Increase in terror attacks since 9/11 a success Eric Brewer
Published : Saturday January 10 , 2009
Print This Email This
One of the many sad ironies of the Bush era that is rapidly and mercifully drawing to a close is that after the president created a central front in the war on terror by invading Iraq , the amount of terrorism in the world skyrocketed .
I call it the Bush Bubble :
At first , the administration seemed a little embarrassed by this result , and it engaged in various attempts , which Ive documented over the years and summarized here , at disguising the increase .
Interestingly , the public face for many of those shenanigans was John Brennan , formerly head of the National Counterterrorism Center and currently Obamas transition intelligence adviser and pick for the newly created position of deputy national security adviser for counterterrorism .
In July 2005 , announcing a new web - accessible database of terrorism incidents compiled by the RAND corporation and available at tkb.org , Brennan said , " We 're trying to be as open and transparent to the public as possible . "
That lasted a little over two years .
Funding was withdrawn from the project on March 31 , 2008 , probably because people like me were using the analytical tools on the site to produce embarrassing graphs like the one above .
Note that the data used in that graph was accessed a couple of months before the sites demise , and the decrease shown for 2007 may reflect incomplete data .
The governments own figures , put out by the National Counterterrorism Center but going back only to 2004 , show an increase in 2007 :
Those increases were largely driven , of course , by the carnage let loose in Iraq subsequent to our invasion .
The last time Bushs attention was called to the havoc he wreaked there , his response was a blithe ,  So what ? 
I didnt want that to be the last word , so on Friday I went back to the White House to throw one more metaphorical shoe at the president .
Luckily , Deputy Press Secretary Scott Stanzel was sitting in for Dana Perino and Tony Fratto , both of whom have ignored me these last couple of months .
Heres the transcript of my exchange with Scott :
ME : The administration has been boasting about the success of the President 's war on terror , yet data compiled by the RAND Corporation show that the global rate of terrorism , as measured by the number of people killed per year , increased by almost fivefold during the Bush presidency .
And according to the government 's own terrorism statistics , 2007 was the worst year ever , with over 22,000 people killed worldwide .
Does the President consider that record a success ?
MR. STANZEL : The President considers it very much a success that we have kept this nation safe since the devastating attacks of 9/11 .
The magnitude of the attacks on 9/11 were unprecedented , unseen , when 19 individuals armed with box cutters flew airplanes into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon , and were fought and died in a field in Pennsylvania .
We have taken the fight to the terrorists .
It has been this President 's sole mission throughout his presidency to confront those threats where they are .
He has a much talked - about Bush Doctrine .
The President has made it very clear that if you aid , abet , house , feed , fund a terrorist , you are just as guilty as the terrorist , and that we will also confront the challenges where they emerge so we do n't have to face them here at home .
And we will work to spread an ideology of hope and freedom , which will be the ultimate tool in combating terrorism around the world .
So I 'll move on .
Yes , go ahead --
ME : But should n't the anti-terrorism efforts reduce terrorism rather than increase it ?
MR. STANZEL : Well , I guess you should ask the question , have terrorists -- do terrorists continue to try to kill innocent civilians around the world ?
Yes , they do .
Should we then just take a step back and decide , no , we should n't confront those challenges ?
ME : But you can try a --
MR. STANZEL : I 'm done , I 'm going to move on .
ME : -- you can try a different tactic .
MR. STANZEL : Which is -- we have a full tactic , full panoply of tactics that we use , on the diplomatic side , on the defense side , on the homeland security side , and terrorist financing side .
So the President is very proud of his record in defending this country and taking the fight to terrorists for the past two terms .
This is probably the last time I 'll set foot in the Bush White House .
So that s my farewell kiss in honor of the widows , the orphans , and all those killed in Iraq .

Gary Daigneault discussed the ramifications of this joint effort today on his 107.7 F.M. Talk Back show .
Mr. Daigneault and his callers seemed to be very concerned .
On its face , one may think this is a good idea .
But it ’s not .
I agree with Mr. Daigneault and his callers .
Most of which seemed to think this is a very bad idea .
Mr. Daigneault contacted a Constitutional Law expert , and the attorney informed him this is absolutely unconstitutional .
It ’s NOT permitted under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , 8 U.S.C. § 1385 .
It ’s my understanding that the Constitutional Law expert said CHP officers could be arrested out there working with the Military Police because it ’s a “ felony . ”
Democracy depends upon abiding by the U.S. Constitution .
Therefore , I challenge anyone to go out there and put a citizens arrest of the CHP officers , then call 9 - 1 - 1 and have a sheriff come out and take charge of your prisoner .
Just kidding , of course , but a very brazen citizen legally could attempt to such a thing .
But do n’t even think about it .
Many of his callers vocalized that this joint effort or mutual cooperation between the military and the CHP is going to be very intimidating .
They ( as I ) are very concerned the CHP is going through with this action .
It ’s not really clear what the specific role of the Military Police will be …
To assist ; to observe ; to train ; to make a strong military presence ; to take charge of military offenders detained by the CHP ?
Nonetheless , whatever , it ’s unconstitutional ; it ’s a felony .
I contacted the Morongo CHP office .*
The dispatcher said the program will be in effect tonight .
When I asked here were it was going to be , she said call back tonight after 7:00 P.M .
But I politely protested , these DUI check stops are public .
She said I have to speak with CHP Public Affairs officer after seven . *
A call to the CHP Public Affairs Officer ’s number * after seven got a recorded message to call from 9 - 5 during business hours .
Query : why was n’t I told that ?
By the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , 20 Stat .
152 , 18 U.S.C. § 1385 , it was provided that “ it shall NOT ( emphasis added ) be lawful to employ any part of the Army of the United States , as a posse comitatus , or otherwise , for the purpose of executing the laws , except in such cases and under such circumstances as such employment of said force may be expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress … . ”
The effect of this prohibition , however , was largely nullified by a ruling of the Attorney General “ that by Revised Statutes 5298 and 5300 [ 10 U.S.C. §§ 332 , 334 ] the military forces , under the direction of the President , could be used to assist a marshal .
16 Ops. Atty . Gen. 162 . ” B. RICH , THE PRESIDENTS AND CIVIL DISORDER 196 n.21 ( 1941 ) .
Okay , as far as I know the President has not given direction to the local CHP to deploy the USMC on public roads in order to setup a military presence during routine DUI check stops in the Basin .
It ’s not allowed .
Whoever came up with plan in the CHP in my opinion is abusing their powers .
Where is the public necessity or authority to do this ?
There is none — unless the Commander in Chief made the call .
It ’s also my opinion , the CHP has made a very bad choice in their joint venture with the Marine Corps .
Though I have intrinsic belief that the CHP has the very best of intentions , however , good intentions does not override the U.S. Constitution .
I know the Marine Corps has the best of intentions too .
But the best of intentions is not cause to trump the Constitution .
Late this afternoon , I spoke with the Provost Marshal office , Corporal Knuesn .
He indicated this may happen .
I then spoke with the MCAGCC Public Affairs Chief , Gunny Sgt. Chris Cox .**
He was very cooperative and informative about the mutual efforts of the Military Police and the CHP : “ They will be working closely over the month to cut down of traffic accidents , ” he said , “ the Military Police will observe DUI check points and watch for their own guys .
The intent is to have Military Presence out there . ”
Gunny Cox explains that Hwy. 62 is one of the most dangerous highways out here .
No doubt it is .
The Public Affairs Chief also explained , “ they will not participate [ assist the CHP ] because they are not concerned [ lack of jurisdiction ] with California law . ”
I must say , Gunny Sgt .
Cox is one extremely nice guy .
And his good intentions — to save his guys from injuries or worse — was certainly manifested .
May good fortune be with this Marine .
It ’s little encroachments like this that undermine the Constitution .
Then one day you wake up , and it gone .
[ See Franklin quote , infra- ] .
I can see numerous scenarios during those DUI check stops .
To name a few : The Military Police go to the aid of the CHP to take down a civilian bad guy .
A drunken teen .
Unruly tweakers .
Will the Military Police be armed ?
Do they have any sort orders of engagements ?
* **
The bottom line : I urge anyone and everyone who believes in the Constitution , United States Codes , and Posse Comitatus — to do something !
What can you do ?
To begin with , I suggest you contact the local Joshua Tree CHP Public Affairs Officer , Officer McLoud , at : 760 . 366.3707 and voice your concern .
Further , you can contact the MCAGCC Public Affairs Chief on the base at : 760.830.5476 or 760. 830.6213 .
Moreover , contact the Provost Marshal office at : 760.830.4215 .
Voice your concerns .
That ’s just a start .
Contact state officials and legislatures .
Write letters to the editor .
Thank you , Branson Hunter

Bacon Cheeseburger
Chicken is definitely one of Kevin ’s top 3 favorite meals .
I love it too , because it ’s an easy way to amp up boring chicken breasts into an exciting , mouth - watering dish !
Intrigued ?
Let ’s get started . :)
First , let ’s start by making our own bacon bits .
Yes , you can use store bought bacon bits , but I just love making my own because real bacon adds such an amazing flavor that you just cannot buy in a bottle .
Now , let me be honest with you .
Frying bacon used to be the bane of my existence .
I ruined at least the first 5 batches of bacon I tried to cook .
I tried cooking it every way possible .
On the stove top .
In the oven .
In the microwave .
They all ended the same way .
Everyone running out of out a smoke filled house gasping for air . :p
Then ,
The Pioneer Woman taught me how to fry bacon and I will never , ever go back to using bacon bits ever .
I absolutely LOVE frying bacon now !
Let me pass along her words of wisdom .
The first trick is to cut your bacon in half .
She does it while it ’s still unopened in the package , just cut it in half so the bacon strips are n’t so long .
How to Make Bacon Cheeseburger Chicken
Arrange the bacon in a single layer in a large skillet over LOW to medium - low heat .
On my electric stove , which ranges from 1 – 9 , I put the heat on 4 .
Leave the bacon on one side ( without flipping ) until the fat starts turning translucent and the red part starts getting browned on the bottom ( use tongs to lift up the bacon and check ) .
You really just have to watch it and keep checking , but it ’ll probably take around 10 mins .
But that ’s not exact so just keep checking on it . ;)
When that happens , flip all the bacon slices over to the other side .
In another 5 - 10 mins , the other side will be nice and brown and done .
If both sides are nice and browned , drain bacon slices on paper towels ( make layers of bacon and paper towels ) .
If you need to flip the bacon over again , that ’s fine too , I usually have to do that because I did n’t get the first side done enough the first time . :p
Okay !
So now you have some awesome bacon !!
Go ahead and try a piece , I never can resist . :D
In the skillet you used to fry the bacon , you have some bacon grease .
Go ahead and pour most of it out into a coffee cup ( or something , do n’t pour it down your drain , that ’s bad ) but leave 1 - 2 tbsp of grease in the skillet ( enough to make a thin layer of grease in the bottom of the pan ) .
This is what we ’re gonna use to sear our chicken !
If you did n’t fry your own bacon , just use about 2 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of butter , like I said earlier , just enough to give the bottom a nice layer of oil .
Using butter with olive oil will help it not smoke up the house so much . :)
Heat the grease ( or oil ) over medium - high heat .
Preheat your oven to 350 , and spray a 9×13 or 8×8 baking dish with Pam ( depending on how much chicken you have , if you use more than 2 breasts , go with the 9×13 ) .
Take a few boneless , skinless chicken breasts and cut them in half , right down the middle , and put them in the skillet .
Sear 4 - 5 mins each side until lightly browned .
Like this :
With both sides of the chicken are browned , remove from skillet and place in baking dish that has been sprayed with Pam .
Now it ’s time to make our bacon bits !
Take the bacon slices from earlier , which should be cooled and drained by now , and stack them up :
Using a big , sharp knife , slice up your bacon into bits ! :D
Yummy , flavorful bacon bits :D
Back to the chicken .
Pour about 1 /4 cup of teriyaki sauce onto the chicken breasts .
I ’ve made this so many times , I know about how much teriyaki sauce I like , so I just pour it straight from the bottle .
But you may want to measure it the first couple of times because I do n’t like the way it tastes if I use too much teriyaki sauce .
I do just enough to cover the pieces , about like this :
Next , cover the chicken with ranch dressing . :D
I love ranch dressing :D
You can use plain old ranch dressing , but I like using Ranch with Bacon .
Gives it a little something extra . :D
Now top with cheese …
And your bacon bits !
If you have any left over bacon bits , just put them in a ziploc bag and stick them in the freezer .
Bacon keeps * great * in the freezer , and now you have your own , homemade bacon bits to use whenever you need them !
They ’ll add so much more flavor to meals than store bought bacon bits . :)
Now bake your chicken in the oven at 350 degress for 25 to 35 minutes , until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear .

Chicken goes great with mashed potatoes !! :D

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
For many cash - strapped workers , Barack Obama 's plan to stimulate the economy could mean more take - home money in their paychecks .
While details remain unclear , the president - elect 's recovery proposal is likely to include a tax cut to boost spending .
Exactly how much of a break that could mean for workers depends on how the tax cut is structured .
But back - of - the - envelope calculations suggest in some scenarios it could be anywhere from an extra $ 83 to $ 166 per paycheck during the first quarter of the year .
David Axelrod , a top adviser to Obama speaking Sunday on NBC's " Meet the Press , " said Obama had promised a middle class tax cut and that his economic recovery package will include " a portion of a tax cut that will become part of the permanent tax cut he 'll have in his upcoming budget . "
On the campaign trail , Obama proposed a number of tax cuts for middle - and low - income households , including an increase in the earned income tax credit for low - income families and an increase in the Hope credit to pay for education expenses .
He also proposed exempting seniors with income under $ 50,000 from having to pay income tax .
But the proposal most likely to get money into the hands of the greatest number of taxpayers quickly is some form of Obama 's proposed Make Work Pay Credit .
The credit would essentially work as a payroll tax credit equal to $ 500 a year for individuals and $ 1,000 for couples .
And the money could be delivered fairly quickly simply by having employers reduce the tax withholding in a person 's paycheck .
The full credit would be limited to those making $ 75,000 or less ( $ 150,000 or less for couples ) .
Individuals making between $ 75,000 and $ 85,000 ( and couples making between $ 150,000 and $ 170,000 ) would get a partial credit .
The credit also would be refundable , meaning that even tax filers without any tax liability -- typically very low - income workers -- would receive one .
Assuming a worker gets a paycheck every two weeks , a $ 500 tax break amounts to $ 19.23 extra a paycheck .
A $ 1,000 break for couples is the equivalent of $ 38.46 per pay period .
But those amounts could rise if the full tax break is given during the first part of the year .
Generally speaking , " the potential stimulus effect is bigger the earlier in the year that you give it , " said economist Gary Burtless , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
One approach could be to give workers an advance on the money so that they 'd receive the full $ 500 or $ 1,000 over the course of the first quarter .
That could mean an extra $ 83 a paycheck for individuals or $ 166 for couples , assuming they get six paychecks between January and March .
Or that amount could be increased further if the economic recovery package calls for the tax credit to be in place for two years .
In that case , if workers got an advance on two years ' worth of credits , that would double the extra money in their paychecks .
How effective can it be ?
Whether a temporary tax cut is spread out over the year , given in advance over the first quarter or dispensed as a one - time lump sum , there is a question about just how effective it will be in stimulating the economy .
Generally speaking , economists say , permanent tax breaks boost the economy more .
Why ?
Because consumers feel freer to spend it rather than save it since they know it 's a sum they 'll get every year .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden said last week the stimulus tax cut would be a " down payment on the tax relief that we promised for the strapped middle class . "
So the promise of permanence may have its own stimulus effect .
But considering that Congress has n't weighed in on the issue , there 's no guarantee .
Early evidence on the $ 100 billion in stimulus checks sent out earlier this year suggest that consumers saved more of their rebates than they spent .
During the second and third quarters , when most of the stimulus money landed in consumers ' bank accounts , the personal savings rate jumped over the first quarter .
But the numbers are still preliminary and given the financial chaos that erupted in late summer , it 's hard to sort out what role the rebates played .
" Everyone was told we 're in the worst financial crisis in decades so it could be that the savings rate would have gone up anyway because consumers were n't making big - ticket purchases [ and put off spending ] on anything that can be plausibly postponed , " Burtless said .
Of course , consumer sentiment , if anything , is worse now .
Should the Obama team opt to propose a temporary payroll tax credit , there 's nothing saying they could n't make it worth more than $ 500 per worker .
Nothing , that is , except the cost to federal coffers .
As it is , the Tax Policy Center estimates the cost of the Make Work Pay Credit would be $ 115 billion over two years ( $ 49 billion in 2009 and $ 66 billion in 2010 ) .
The total cost of the stimulus package , meanwhile , is expected to approach $ 800 billion .
But that includes the many other elements that Obama 's economic team has said would be included , namely spending on infrastructure , energy , education , health care and state aid .
Given that the country 's deficit could hit $ 1 trillion before any money is spent on stimulus and the government to date has committed nearly $ 8 trillion in one form or another to stabilizing the financial system , ratcheting up the cost of any one stimulus item may not be a slam dunk .
What would a female college beach volleyball player look like ?
With Leather found ESPN ’s Page 2 asking that question and the NCAA freaking out over whether the ladies would wear bikinis .
“ If you were to knock on some administrators ’ doors and tell them that their prospective female sand volleyball team would be playing in bikinis , it would be like , ‘ OK ’ then ‘ buh - bye . ’
End of discussion .
It ’s not happening . ”
Ease up NCAA .
Your women are already wearing school logos to compete in the National Collegiate Beach Volleyball Tournament and have been looking pretty damn good in the process .
It ’s true the ladies do n’t get the opportunity to wear bikinis , but being the understanding men we are , the sports bra and short shorts will have to do .
The Collegiate Nationals is held in April on some beautiful California beach .
In 2008 it was the University of Texas who won the title over USC in a classic tilt .
Now , this volleyball tournament is n’t regulated by the NCAA so they will likely ignore the fact that these women do n’t seem to be uncomfortable with the following outfits .
It ’s nothing different than they would wear at the student rec.
center where a guy can see way more than this .
We know .
Alumni get that discount and BC takes full advantage .

The legendary Nebraska volleyball program sent some ladies to the Collegiate .
But it seems that many Israelis accept Mr. Seaman ’s assessment and shed no tears over the restrictions , despite repeated protests by the Foreign Press Association of Israel , including on Tuesday .
A headline in Tuesday ’s issue of Yediot Aharonot , the country ’s largest selling daily newspaper , expressed well the popular view of the issue .
Over a news article describing the generally negative coverage so far , especially in the European media , an intentional misspelling of a Hebrew word turned the headline “ World Media ” into “ World Liars . ”
This attitude has been helped by supportive Israeli news media whose articles have been filled with “ feelings of self - righteousness and a sense of catharsis following what was felt to be undue restraint in the face of attacks by the enemy , ” according to a study of the first days of media coverage of the war by a liberal but nonpartisan group called Keshev , the Center for the Protection of Democracy in Israel .
The Foreign Press Association has been fighting for weeks to get its members into Gaza , first appealing to senior government officials and ultimately taking its case to the country ’s highest court .
Last week the justices worked out an arrangement with the organization whereby small groups would be permitted into Gaza when it was deemed safe enough for the crossings to be opened for other reasons .
So far , every time the border has been opened , journalists have not been permitted to go in .
On Tuesday , the press association released a statement saying , “ The unprecedented denial of access to Gaza for the world ’s media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of Israel in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs . ”
At the same time that reporters have been given less access to Gaza , the government has created a new structure for shaping its public message , ensuring that spokesmen of the major government branches meet daily to make sure all are singing from the same sheet .
“ We are trying to coordinate everything that has to do with the image and content of what we are doing and to make sure that whoever goes on the air , whether a minister or professor or ex-ambassador , knows what he is saying , ” said Aviv Shir - On , deputy director general for media in the Foreign Ministry .
“ We have talking points and we try to disseminate our ideas and message . ”
Just about everyone has a Yellow Pages in their country .
These tomes are usually huge and given the availability these days of online versions , are pretty much just paper spam to many they are forced upon .
The North American Yellow Pages print distribution is around 540 million directories annually .
That ’s substantially more copies than the entire population !
Why ?
Up until recently , everyone with a landline received a copy ; but with a switch to mobile communications , the YP marketing boffins figured that some folks were missing out , so they engaged in a saturation distribution campaign according to PaperPetition.org .
While countries such as Australia recycle up to 70 % of each Yellow Pages run , which is great , the remaining 30 % still represents millions of copies and what is recycled does nothing towards the costs , energy , emissions and other pollutants involved in creating that paper in the first place .
Imagine how many trees , how much ink must go into creating these large books !
Imagine the transport costs of shifting all these books around the country !
According to Yellow Pages Goes Green , in the USA alone the 540 million directories represents :
– 19 million trees to provide the paper
– 1.6 billion pounds of paper wastage
– 7.2 million barrels of oil ( not including delivery )
– 268,000 cubic yards of landfill
– 3.2 billion kilowatt hours of electricity consumption
I ’m a little confused on the tree issue as the Yellow Pages Group states it uses a blend of post - consumer fibre content and thermo-mechanical pulp made from wood chips .
Regardless , there ’s still a lot of energy and resources involved in producing these often massive directories .
I worked for a printer churning out the Yellow Pages years ago and the amount of waste involved was startling – multiple dumpsters were filled each 24 hours during the print run – and that edition just covered a reasonably small area .
However , it was encouraging to see on the Yellow Pages Group site that they are taking steps towards reducing this sort of waste .
An ad in the Yellow Pages is incredibly expensive , running into the tens of thousands of dollars .
I feel the Yellow Pages paper versions are trading on their old reputation when they were indeed the go - to source for business information .
They are n’t keen to let go as the industry is valued at more than US $ 31 billion worldwide , with the vast majority of that figure coming from paper - based directory ad sales .
The Yellow Pages may be a very useful tool , but the Internet has changed the way most of us access it .
They are delivered to hundreds of millions of homes globally , but how many people actually use them these days ?
While I ’m sure some people would wish to continue receiving the paper version , there really needs to be an * easy * way for consumers to stop delivery .
Canceling Yellow Pages delivery
I ca n’t remember the last time we used a Yellow Pages , so I set about trying to find out how to opt out of receiving it .
I noticed no mention whatsoever of opt out processes on the Yellow Pages Group environmental commitment page ; yet this is a major step they could take in reducing their impact .
There ’s no direct opt - out for the USA , UK , Australia and Canada that I could find , so it seems the best bet is via Paperless Petition , which covers all these countries .
The petition challenges the Yellow Pages Association ( YPA ) to move to a strictly on - demand system of directory distribution and in the interim , acts as an opt - out registry that the YPA supposedly must respect .
Folks in the USA may want to hedge their bets by also signing up at Yellow Pages Go Green
Recycling Yellow Pages
Thankfully , recycling a Yellow Pages directory is as easy as hoiking it into your recycling bin in most countries these days ; however you should check with your local recycling authority first .
Uses for Yellow Pages
If you ca n’t throw your Yellow Pages into a recycling bin , here ’s a few ideas for reusing it .
– Packing material
– Shredded , wet , then compressed into bricks for wood fires
– Paper mache crafts
– Composting
– Mulching
– Useful as food for a worm farm
– Bird cage liners and general pet cleanup chores
– Wet and mold into biodegradable seedling pots
Just in regards to using your Yellow Pages for composting and worm feed , you should probably check with your local YP publisher to ensure the ink used is vegetable / soy / water based .
Given the size and weight of these books , I ’d hazard a guess that with a little ( earth friendly ) fire retardant and sealer added , they could also be used as bricks for building a house :) .
If you have any more suggestions for reusing yellow page , please add them below !
I feel it ’s way past time that the Yellow Pages Association phased out the saturation distribution of the paper based directory .
Sure , it ’s a lot of money to miss out on , but by refocusing resources on marketing and improving their online services , I ’m sure the agencies involved could make up the difference .
This would show a * real * environmental commitment .

The war on smokers proves the axiom “ The first casualty of war is the truth . ”
After the real dangers of primary smoking were publicized a lot of smokers quit , but not enough to satisfy the nicotine nannies , who concocted a new danger : second hand smoke .
Smartenized ® people know that SHS is the biggest scam since homeopathy , but it still has been used to harass and vilify smokers and install smoking bans that put thousands of bars , restaurants and bingo halls out of business .
Their goal is to force smokers to quit by making it impossible for them to smoke anywhere and to turn them into social pariahs who are hated and feared by the unwashed masses .
The scam has been fairly successful .
At one point about half the US population smoked .
Now less than a quarter of them do .
But this is not enough for the Nicotine Nazis – their religious zeal wo n’t let them rest until they eradicate smoking from the entire planet .
Consumed with their self - righteous zeal they ’ve now concocted a new scam : Third Hand Smoke .
Years ago people in the smoker ’s rights movement joked about third hand smoke .
Now , as further proof that our society has become so absurd that satire is nearly impossible , the press is now all abuzz about this new fictitious danger , described as deadly toxic particles that hang out long after the second hand smoke is gone .
It started with an article in the once respectable New York Times .
Dr. Jonathan P. Winickoff , evidently desperate for his fifteen minutes of fame , has published a study that , on first glance , appears to bolster this ridiculous claim .
“ Your nose is n’t lying , ” he says .
“ The stuff is so toxic that your brain is telling you : ’ Get away . ’ ”
The article closes with the statement that Third Hand smoke contains polonium - 210 , “ the highly radioactive carcinogen that was used to murder former Russian spy Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006 . ”
This is yellow journalism at its worst .
Michael McFadden , author of the book Dissecting Antismokers ’
Brains sent me some rough calculations about polonium - 210 .
He writes :
“ A 30 cig per day smoker gets 1 picocurie per day .
“ A typical nonsmoker living or working with smokers would get at most about 1/100th of that per day , more likely only 1/1,000th with good ventilation and / or a more reasonable amount of indoor smoking , so about one femtocurie .
“ A child would have to live with a smoker for roughly three trillion days to absorb the dose that killed the Russian . ”
And that is for second hand smoke .
Since Third Hand Smoke is a fictional construct , we can only base our calculations on assumptions .
( These calculations also come from McFadden . )
Assuming that 1 % of this deadly stuff has been spread on the 10,000 square feet of surface area in a typical 2,000 sq foot house , and also assuming that your method of cleaning is to having your infant lick the kitchen floor clean once a day , the kid would have to lick the floor for one hundred trillion days to accumulate a fatal dose .
That comes out to about 274 billion years .
The universe is about 13.8 billion years old .
The half life of Polonium - 210 is a mere 138 days .
So in order to ingest a fatal dose , the not only would the floor licker have to keep at it 20 times longer than our universe has existed , we ’d also have to completely rewrite the laws of physics to keep the stuff dangerous long enough to do any damage .
That would n’t even slow down a nicotine nanny , of course – they have quite a bit of experience rewriting the laws of physics .
If the NYT had any ethics they never would have allowed this statement to get past the editor , and would have chastised the writer for including it .
Fortunately , ethics and accuracy have n’t been an issue for them for quite some time .
So how did the doctor come up with his proof ?
Did he visit the homes of smokers and carefully measure particulates on every surface ?
Did he check out the interior of smoker ’s vehicles and measure chemicals on their clothes ?
Hell no .
He did a phone survey to see how many people believe this nonsense .
That is the entirety of his research .
He had someone call a bunch of people and ask them questions ( and we can only guess how loaded these questions were ) and presented the results as proof that third hand smoke was deadly .
And the New York Times , in their wisdom , published this under a scary headline .
Yessir , that there is some real fine and dandy science .
Noting wrong what that scientific method , nuh uh .
Of course The Today Show , which is always delighted to jump on any junk science bandwagon , did a story on this .
And what a story it was , with computer graphics of a lit cigarette leaving blood - colored stains splattered all over a living room and car interior .
Ignoring the fact that this study was nothing more than a phone survey of uninformed opinions , Dr. Nancy Snyderman expounded on this new scary danger to children .
( It ’s always for the chilllllllllldreeeeen , is n’t it ? )
She opened with the fiction , “ We know that second hand smoke kills 50,000 people a year . ” ( Care to Name Three , Nancy ? )
She went on to say , “ Everybody has been on an elevator , and a smoker gets on and you can tell immediately who the smoker is , because you smell those toxins . ”
You ’re not just smelling smoke , you ’re smelling toxins .
Oooo , scary .
“ The same stuff that comes out of the tailpipe of a city bus . ”
She goes on to say , “ If you really ca n’t kick the habit you have to smoke outside .
And then I would say guess what ?
You have to change your clothes .
They have to go right into the washing machine , because you are a walking toxic dump . ”
She did n’t go so far as insisting the smoker then needs to take a shower to wash that deadly stuff off , then call in an decontamination unit to clean up the bathroom , but I would n’t be surprised to hear some other nicotine nanny make that claim .
MSNBC , who is to journalism what Britney Spears is to music , claims that “ Even if you do n’t smoke around your children , the study finds that toxins from tobacco smoke can linger in the air , on hair and clothing , long after the cigarette is put out .
Those toxins can be easily transferred to a baby or small child .
Researchers found that even at low levels tobacco particles can be associated with cognitive problems in kids . ”
( For the chilllllllldreeeeeen ! )
The study , of course , showed none of these things , but MSNBC has always found that reporting is so much easier when you just make shit up .
There is no end to the fictions nicotine nannies will create to justify their venomous hatred of smokers .
This is their latest one , but , but we can be sure there are more to come .
Smokers who politely smoke outside , often in inclement weather , to avoid annoying people with second hand smoke , are now horrible evil bags of toxins that will kill your children .
And while the idiocy of this will be obvious to anyone with a functioning brain cell , we can be sure that plenty of stupid people will swallow this lie and use it as an excuse to harass smokers even more .
情報は自由を欲しているけれど
iTunes Music
Store の音楽が DRM free になったと , 同僚のアップルファンが喜んでいた .
Windows 入りのノート PC が壊れて以 来 iPod に音楽をとりこめないままの私は iTunes に腹が立っていたので , ( VirtualBox + Windows XP 上の iTunes は音楽 CD のとりこみに失敗する . ) つい " でも AAC が patented なので free とはいえませんね " などと毒づいてしまった .
大人気なかったと反省している .
前よりはよくなったのだから文句を言う筋合いじゃない.
Linux ユーザに iPod は身に余る .
Macbook がほしい ...
奇しくも同じ日 , Stewart Brand の " The Media Lab " が届いた .
1980 年代に出版された本で , 古本屋に注文したまま忘れていた .
Steward Brand は " Information wants to be free " という 有名な台詞の言いだしっぺとして知られている .
" The Media Lab " は出典の一つだ .
( Brand はあちこちでこの台詞を使っていた . )
" Information wants to be free " / " 情報は自由を欲している " は ヒッピー文化からオープンシステムまで 様々な活動家のプロパガンダに広く使われてきた .
けれど実は " Information also wants to be expensive . " という続きがある , なんてのもそれなりに知られた話 .
この続きを読むと , 情報は " 自由を欲している " というより " タダになりたがっている " といった方が妥当そうだ .
実際プロパガンダ目的以外で引用されるときには , そのような日本語をあてがわれることが多い.
結局 Brand は何を言いたかったのか .
権威主義者の私は原典を当たろうと件の本を注文したのだった.
以下は該当箇所の引用 :
Information wants to be free .
Information also wants to be expensive .
Information wants to be free becasuse it has become so cheap to distribute , copy , and recombine - too cheap to meter .
It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient .
That tension will not go away .
It leads to endless wrenching debate about price , copyright , " intellectual property " , and the moral rightness of casual distribution , because each round of new devices amake the tension worse , not better .
情報はタダになりたがっている . 情報は高価にもなりたがっている.
情報がタダになりたいのは , 配布や複製 , 再結合が安価になったからだ .
安過ぎて価格がわからないくらいだ.
情報が高価になりたいのは , それが受け手にとって大きな価値を持ちうるからだ.
この葛藤がなくなることはないだろう. 価格 , 著作権 , " 知的財産 " , カジュアルな配布の倫理的正しさを巡る身を裂くような議論が , 終わることなく続くだろう .
新しい機器の登場によって状況が悪くなることはあっても , 良くなることはないからだ .
Brand は特段 free を支持していたわけでもなく , expensive の肩を持つでもなく , 情報の電子化によって両者の緊張が強まるのと主張していたのだった.
because 以下の説得力はいまいちな気もするけれどそれは時代というもの .
テクノロジーが庶民に広まりはじめて間もない
1987 の本ですからね ... ( 初代 CD プレイヤー発売が 1982 年. )
議論の中で , Brand はソフトウェアのコピーに関する面白いエピソードを紹介している .
Borland が " Sidekick " という PIM ソフトを販売する際 , 55 ドルのコピープロテクト版と 85 ドルのコピーフリー版を用意した .
するとコピーフリー版の方が 5 倍も売れたというのだ. 人々は 30 ドル多 く( expensive ) 払うことでコピーの自 由( free ) を買いとった .
iTunes Plus の手口は 20 年来のものだったわけ .
そのほか , コピーのコストが低い結果として東京のレンタルビデオ屋にある
70 % のビデオが 海賊版だったという , 今となっては冗談みたいな調査結果が紹介されたり , 情報そのものより発信者の権威に金を払う傾向を指摘し , 広告時代の到来を予測したり , " Information wants to be ( politically ) free " と censorship について議論したり .
古いなりに面白い本だった .
レトリックの 力
主張の是非はさておき Brand の技巧には目をひかれる .
" information " は人間ではないのだから , 何かを want することはない .
けれど Brand はそれをさらりと擬人化( ? ) し , free であるこ と( あるいは expensive であること ) を 情報自身の意思であるかのように語った .
そして < free > のメタファが生き残った. < expensive > は , 今やせいぜい < free > に付き添って現れるばかりだ. なぜ " information wants to be free " が人々の心を捉え生き残ったのか , 理由は色々だと思う .
けれどレトリックの技巧に着目するなら , " wants to be free " は人としての共感のしやすさに秀でていたのではないか.
私たちは自由でありたい .
だから自由でありたいという訴えには共感をおぼえる.
私たちは同時に( 年収などが ) 高価でもありたいけれど , それは自由ほど声高な訴えではない .
メタファがモノやアイデアに意思を与えるとき , それは人としての共感をあてにしているのかもしれない.
情報の自由/無償化は , テクノロジーの進歩だけでなく , 私たち自身がもつ自由への欲望に背中を押され広まった.
それを精神的に支えたのが
Brand の言葉だった...というのは過大評価だろうけれど , 話としてはちょっと面白い .
さて本当のところ , information のヤツは何を望むのだろう .
ドーキンスファンとしては " information wants to be selfish " を推したい .
( ミームですね. ) もちおファンは " information wants to survive " あたりを支持すればいいとおもう .
いつかインフォたん同人が登場する日を願ってやまない.

I read a Reuters Health article the other day that highlights a survey reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry :
The survey , of more than 5,000 U.S. adults ages 19 to 25 , found that mental health disorders were common among both college students and those not in college .
But neither group was likely to have had the problem addressed ; overall , one - quarter had sought treatment for their mental health disorder in the previous year .
Obviously the findings are n’t 100 % spot on , because the surveys asked the participants “ standard questions used to diagnose substance abuse and other mental health disorders , including depression , anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder , ” so , regular trips to the psychiatrist it was not .
However , if we assume the participants all answered honestly , then we can probably safely assume some of them may actually be suffering from an anxiety problem , or depression , or substance abuse .
Why are so few seeking treatment ?
Is it because of the stigma attached to mental illness ?
Lack of resources ?
Inadequate knowledge about mental health ?
I expect it ’s all of those things , which leads me to my next question :
If more celebrities spoke out about mental health issues , would more young people be prompted to act ?
Celebrities are n’t gods ( no matter how I act each Monday night when Prison Break comes on ) ; however , many of them do have the eyes and ears of 19 - to 25 - year - old young adults , like those included in the survey .
They have the eyes and ears of many folks of all ages .
Actors , musicians , and just generally well - known public figures often influence clothing fashion , hairstyles , and behavior .
Celebrities even influence religious views , for Pete ’s sake .
Could n’t they also influence education and proper care when it comes to mental health ?
Back in 1998 , when she lost her husband to colon cancer , Katie Couric became a fervent advocate for the awareness and prevention of colon cancer :
After I lost my husband , Jay , to colorectal cancer in 1998 , I became determined to share my newfound knowledge about this deadly disease with the public .
My decision to become an advocate for colon cancer awareness and prevention seemed perfectly logical — over 6.3 million people watch the “ Today ” show every day — to not use it as a bully pulpit to impart potentially life - saving information seemed to me then and now tantamount to criminal negligence .
Couric used her own celebrity to spread an simple , important message : Colon cancer kills .
Let ’s learn to prevent and treat it .
She co-founded the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance ( NCCRA ) and even underwent a live colonoscopy to show viewers she practiced what she preached .
Naturally , I ’m not suggesting celebrities sign up for live broadcasts of their trips to the psychiatrist ’s couch ( wonder what kind of reality show that would make ) ; I ’m merely pointing to an example of successful celebrity advocacy work .
I know a lot of people who went out and scheduled colonoscopies during that time .
We ’re not talking the latest Louis Vuitton creation here people .
We ’re talking responsible health care .
So , what do you think ?
If you ’re older , would you have been more active with your own mental health care if a celebrity you respected preached its importance ?
If you ’re younger , would you be more apt to seek help – or at least start to acknowledge mental health problems more – if your favorite celebrity came forward about the issue ?

MPs in new dodge to keep details of expenses secret
Battle : Speaker Michael Martin who fought in the courts to stop MPs expences being published
MPs were accused of a ' new level of arrogance ' last night as they launched a bid to keep secret full details of how they spend millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money .
And they will further mock voters with a new rulebook allowing them to carry on squandering cash on furniture and home improvements .
With households and businesses cutting costs , the moves will be seen as more evidence that elected representatives are hopelessly out of touch .
The announcement that Ministers want to defy the High Court and block publication of receipts for MPs ' expenses was buried on the day news was dominated by Government statements on Heathrow and Equitable Life .
The extraordinary move is in direct response to a High Court judgment upholding an Information Tribunal ruling that receipt - by - receipt breakdowns for how public money is spent by MPs must be published .
Speaker Michael Martin spent around £ 150,000 of public money unsuccessfully fighting the case .
A Parliamentary order has now been drafted to exclude MPs and peers from parts of the Freedom of Information Act .
If both Houses of Parliament back it next week it could become law within 24 hours , and no receipts need be published .
Yesterday Commons Leader Harriet Harman claimed the Government - would increase transparency by raising the number of published categories under which MPs say how they used their expenses , such as travel and accommodation .
But campaigners dismissed this because without the receipts there will be no opportunity to discover exactly how the headline spending figures , which will be released on an annual basis , are made up .
MPs ' expenses and allowances last year cost taxpayers £ 87 million .
Their claims are on top of their £ 63,291 salary .
But Westminster has been alive with rumours throughout the expenses controversy that some MPs have milked the system to such a degree that full disclosure of claims would force them to quit Parliament .
Last night there was incredulity that MPs are to use valuable time in the shortest Parliamentary year on record to protect their pampered lifestyles .
Tory Shadow Cabinet member Theresa May said : ' In the middle of a recession the last thing people expect the Government to be worrying about is how much information is available on MPs ' expenses . '
Information campaigner Heather Brooke , who battled for years to have the receipts released , said the developments showed a ' new level of arrogance ' .
' Just when you thought MPs had understood the need to regain public trust they do something like this , ' she said .
' This shows they have not learned a thing .
' It is what you would expect from a banana republic . '
Matthew Elliott of the TaxPayers '
Alliance said : ' These desperate measures will only harm Parliament 's standing by making people wonder what it is that politicians have to hide . '
In a separate development , it emerged that despite promises of an end to the Westminster gravy train , MPs will still be free to use taxpayers ' cash for extravagant items to furnish and upgrade second homes .
Under revised expenses rules
MPs will still be entitled to pick items from the so - called ' John Lewis list ' , the informal guidelines on how much can be spent on home furnishings .
As now , they will be able to charge for white goods , sofas , chairs , tables , beds , cutlery and crockery , security fittings , cleaners and decoration to kit out their second homes .
Mortgage interest payments or rent for the additional residences will also be met by the taxpayer as will utility bills and council tax payments .
Receipts will not need to be submitted for any items under £ 25 .
There will also be flat - rate ' subsistence ' payments of £ 25 per day when a ' member spends a night away from his or her main home on Parliamentary business ' .
LG Releasing Sunlight - Illuminated LCD Display
December 23rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Next month ’s Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas is shaping up to be an interesting event .
A few days ago , we reported that Energizer plans on debuting its solar - powered battery charger at the show .
Now LG has announced the CES debut of its sunlight - illuminated 14.1 inch LCD notebook panel .
LG ’s panel features an adaptive backlight that switches from transmissive to transreflective mode with the click of a button .
The panel ’s transreflective display — made for outdoor use — reflects sunlight to illuminate itself from the inside .
The company says that its transreflective mode provides a clear view of the screen display ( the contrast ratio is 9:1 ) — and reduces power consumption by up to 75 % .
Transreflective panels are n’t new , but LG ’s product is the first to provide the option to easily switch back and forth between display modes .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In his soon to be published book Just Sex ? , Guy Brandon of the Jubilee Centre in Cambridge claims that it is the failure to respect persons , as made in God 's image , which is at the heart of our social and personal malaise .
We treat other people simply as a means to our own gratification , without due regard for the consequences our behaviour will have for them , for ourselves and for society as a whole .
Many of the problems that beset us today , whether depression , distrust , sexually related disease , or the collapse of marriage and the family , can be traced to selfishness .
This also has implications for the commercial world , where ideas of trust , honour and reliability have simply collapsed under the weight of collective greed .
We are only just beginning to see the consequences .
Excessive self - regard has led also to a reluctance to " belong " and to contribute to the community as volunteers , as well as by giving and participation .
Once again , social capital is critically eroded .

EPHAM09 is co-located with 2009 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization ( CGO ) in Seattle , Washington .
Last year , a silverback alpha male gorilla , the leader of his group , and three females were shot and killed in Virunga national park , in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Two of the females had babies and the other was pregnant .
The two babies were not found , and experts say they will probably have died of stress and dehydration .
This was the seventh killing in the Virunga area , which is home to 200 of the world 's remaining 700 mountain gorillas .
It is thought that these killings are not the work of poachers , because the bodies were left intact .
Likewise , at a previous scene of slaughter , a baby gorilla - worth thousands of dollars on the live animal black market - was found clinging to its dead mother .
The motivation for the killings is not known , but it is suspected to be political .
The local - and illegal - charcoal industry clashes with conservation efforts in the area , and rangers have been threatened , tortured and killed as a result of the clashes .
More than 100 rangers have lost their lives trying to protect the gorillas of Virunga .
The Congolese rangers in this group are working with WildlifeDirect , a conservation organisation , and they receive a salary based on donations ( wildlifedirect.org ) .
But the mountain gorillas now face an even more uncertain future .
In October this year , rebels loyal to Laurent Nkunda seized the headquarters of Virunga national park .
The park 's 50 rangers , in fear for their own lives , were forced to flee , leaving the gorillas unprotected .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) -
There is evidence that Israel committed war crimes during its 22 - day campaign in the Gaza Strip and there should be an independent inquiry , U.N. investigator Richard Falk said on Thursday .
The mental anguish of the civilians who suffered the assault is so great that the entire population of Gaza could be seen as casualties , said Falk , U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Falk , speaking by phone from his home in California , said compelling evidence that Israel ’s actions in Gaza violated international humanitarian law required an independent investigation into whether they amounted to war crimes .
“ I believe that there is the prima facie case for reaching that conclusion , ” he told a Geneva news conference .
Falk said Israel had made no effort to allow civilians to escape the fighting .
“ To lock people into a war zone is something that evokes the worst kind of international memories of the Warsaw Ghetto , and sieges that occur unintentionally during a period of wartime , ” Falk , who is Jewish , said , referring to the starvation and murder of Warsaw ’s Jews by Nazi Germany in World War Two .
“ There could have been temporary provision at least made for children , disabled , sick civilians to leave , even if where they left to was southern Israel , ” the U.S. professor said .
Falk said the entire Gaza population , which had been trapped in a war zone with no possibility to leave as refugees , may have been mentally scarred for life .
If so , the definition of casualty could be extended to the entire civilian population .
Falk , who was denied entry to Israel two weeks before the assault started on December 27 , dismissed Israel ’s argument that the assault was for self - defence in the light of rocket attacks aimed at Israel from the Hamas - ruled Gaza strip .
“ In my view the U.N. charter , and international law , does not give Israel the legal foundation for claiming self - defence , ” he said .
Israel had not restricted fighting to areas where the rockets came from and had refused to negotiate with Hamas , preventing a diplomatic solution , Falk said .
About 1,300 Palestinians , many of them civilians , were killed and 5,000 wounded in the assault .
Ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians , hit by cross - border rocket fire , were killed .

Google is closing three engineering offices and cutting 100 recruiters from its work force as the recession dampens hiring at the internet search company .
" Given the state of the economy , we recognised that we needed fewer people focused on hiring , " Laszlo Bock , a Google vice president , wrote in a blog posting announcing the layoffs .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In a separate post , Google said it would close its engineering offices in Austin , Texas ; Trondheim , Norway and Lulea , Sweden , a step the company said would affect 70 workers .
" Our strong desire is to keep as many of these 70 engineering employees at Google as possible , " wrote Google 's vice president for engineering and research , Alan Eustace .
" Our long - term goal is not to trim the number of people we have working on engineering projects or reduce our global presence , but create a smaller number of more effective engineering sites , " he added .
The cuts follow news last week of a government filing from Google showing a significant cutback in temporary employees aimed at trimming costs .
The company acknowledged in November that it would be looking to reduce contract workers while retaining full - time staff .
Google has n't said how many positions it plans to eliminate .
The layoffs represent only a small portion of Google 's global work force - less than 1 per cent of the 20,100 total .
But the move is a rare blemish on the company 's worker - friendly reputation .
As consumers shop less online and advertising budgets shrink , Google 's ad revenue has been growing at a slower pace , leading the company to cut back on some of its famous employee perks .
While giving no sign that it will limit research and development or acquisitions , Google has closed some of its free cafeterias .
And instead of its customary US $ 1,000 holiday gift , the company handed out $ 400 Android cell phones to workers last month .
Google also appears to be trimming the number of projects it devotes engineers and money to .
The company made four separate announcements saying it will shutter some of its less popular applications .
Google Notebook , a feature that allows users to save and bookmark text notes , will stop accepting new users and Google Catalog search , a searchable trove of product catalogues , will be shut down .
Google is also ceasing work on Jaiku , an application that let cell phone users broadcast their whereabouts to friends , and closing Dodgeball.com and Mashup Editor .
Google Video will no long accept user - uploaded content .
Google shares fell $ 9.34 , or about 3 per cent , to $ 291.63 in afternoon trading Thursday .

Stanford researchers have reclaimed bragging rights for creating the world 's smallest writing , a distinction the university first gained in 1985 and lost in 1990 .
How small is the writing ?
The letters in the words are assembled from subatomic sized bits as small as 0.3 nanometers , or roughly one third of a billionth of a meter .
The researchers encoded the letters " S " and " U " ( as in Stanford University ) within the interference patterns formed by quantum electron waves on the surface of a sliver of copper .
The wave patterns even project a tiny hologram of the data , which can be viewed with a powerful microscope .
This is an electron wave quantum hologram displaying the initials " SU " of Stanford University .
The yellow area is a copper surface .
The holes in the copper are molecules of carbon monoxide .
Constantly moving electrons on the surface of the copper bounce off the carbon monoxide molecules in predictable ways .
With their dual wave / particle properties , the electron waves in the purple area create inference patterns that can store readable information , in this case , SU .
To store information , the researchers arrange the molecule in specific patterns with a scanning tunneling microscope .

" We miniaturized their size so drastically that we ended up with the smallest writing in history , " said Hari Manoharan , the assistant professor of physics who directed the work of physics graduate student Chris Moon and other researchers .
The quest for small writing has played a role in the development of nanotechnology for 50 years , beginning decades before " nano " became a household word .
During a now - legendary talk in 1959 , the remarkable physicist Richard Feynman argued that there were no physical barriers preventing machines and circuitry from being shrunk drastically .
He called his talk " There 's Plenty of Room at the Bottom . "
Feynman offered a $ 1,000 prize for anyone who could find a way to rewrite a page from an ordinary book in text 25,000 times smaller than the usual size ( a scale at which the entire contents of the Encyclopedia Britannica would fit on the head of a pin ) .
He held onto his money until 1985 , when he mailed a check to Stanford grad student Tom Newman , who , working with electrical engineering Professor Fabian Pease , used electron beam lithography to engrave the opening page of Dickens '
A Tale of Two Cities in such small print that it could be read only with an electron microscope .
That record held until 1990 , when researchers at a certain computer company famously spelled out the letters IBM by arranging 35 individual xenon atoms .
Now , in a paper published online in the journal Nature Nanotechnology , the Stanford researchers describe how they have created letters 40 times smaller than the original prize - winning effort and more than four times smaller than the IBM initials .
( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3QQJEHuefQ)
Working in a vibration - proof basement lab in the Varian Physics Building , Manoharan and Moon began their writing project with a scanning tunneling microscope , a device that not only sees objects at a very small scale but also can be used to move around individual atoms .
The Stanford team used it to drag single carbon monoxide molecules into a desired pattern on a copper chip the size of a fingernail .
On the two - dimensional surface of the copper , electrons zip around , behaving as both particles and waves , bouncing off the carbon monoxide molecules the way ripples in a shallow pond might interact with stones placed in the water .
The ever - moving waves interact with the molecules and with each other to form standing " interference patterns " that vary with the placement of the molecules .
By altering the arrangement of the molecules , the researchers can create different waveforms , effectively encoding information for later retrieval .
To encode and read out the data at unprecedented density , the scientists have devised a new technology , Electronic Quantum Holography .
In a traditional hologram , laser light is shined on a two - dimensional image and a ghostly 3 - D object appears .
In the new holography , the two - dimensional " molecular holograms " are illuminated not by laser light but by the electrons that are already in the copper in great abundance .
The resulting " electronic object " can be read with the scanning tunneling microscope .
Several images can be stored in the same hologram , each created at a different electron wavelength .
The researchers read them separately , like stacked pages of a book .
The experience , Moon said , is roughly analogous to an optical hologram that shows one object when illuminated with red light and a different object in green light .
For Manoharan , the true significance of the work lies in storing more information in less space .
" How densely can you encode information on a computer chip ?
The assumption has been that basically the ultimate limit is when one atom represents one bit , and then there 's no more room — in other words , that it 's impossible to scale down below the level of atoms .
" But in this experiment we 've stored some 35 bits per electron to encode each letter .
And we write the letters so small that the bits that comprise them are subatomic in size .
So one bit per atom is no longer the limit for information density .
There 's a grand new horizon below that , in the subatomic regime .
Indeed , there 's even more room at the bottom than we ever imagined . "
In addition to Moon and Manoharan , authors of the Nature Nanotechnology paper , " Quantum Holographic Encoding in a Two - Dimensional Electron Gas , " are graduate students Laila Mattos , physics ; Brian Foster , electrical engineering ; and Gabriel Zeltzer , applied physics .
The research was supported by the Department of Energy through SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Science ( SIMES ) , the Office of Naval Research , the National Science Foundation and the Stanford - IBM Center for Probing the Nanoscale .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. emissions of gases blamed for warming the planet rose 1.4 percent last year as acute weather pushed consumers to crank up heaters and air conditioners and cut output from hydropower generation , the federal Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday .

The rise in the pollution level made President elect Barack Obama ’s goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 more ambitious .
U.S. emissions last year were about 16.7 percent above 1990 levels , or a rise of 1.7 percentage points from 2006 , the EIA said .
Obama also wants to cut emissions in the United States , the world ’s top greenhouse gas polluter after China , 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050 .
U.S. greenhouse gases last year rose to 7.282 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent , mostly on a rise in emissions from the burning of fossil fuels , the EIA said .
Annual emissions from the globe ’s biggest polluters are being closely watched as world delegates meet in Poznan , Poland this month as part of a push to agree to a pact to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 , by the end of next year .
The United States was alone among industrialized countries in not ratifying the Kyoto pact , which requires 37 rich countries to cut emissions as a first step in reducing the chances of stronger storms and more heat waves , floods and droughts .
The EIA report showed the impact that weather can have on annual emissions as milder temperatures in 2006 led them to fall slightly , said EIA spokesman Paul McArdle .
He added that achieving Obama ’s emissions goals would be a “ substantial task . ”
The EIA has projected in previous reports that U.S. energy - related emissions of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide , would rise an average annual rate of 0.5 percent from 2005 to 2030 in a business as usual scenario .
U.S. hydropower output dropped 14.2 percent last year which led to greater reliance on fossil fuels like natural gas and coal for power generation , the report said .
Droughts in the U.S. Southeast and in California pushed down output from the source that is nearly emissions free .
The emissions intensity of the U.S. economy , or the volume of emissions for every dollar of economic output , fell by 0.6 percent in 2007 , the smallest annual improvement since 2002 , it said .
President George W. Bush has not agreed to mandatory emissions cuts .
Instead , he set a goal of reducing emissions intensity by 18 percent over 10 years .
Since 2002 , the base year of that plan , U.S. greenhouse intensity has fallen by an average of 2.1 percent per year .
Gmail is by far the most popular free email service by Google .
Now power users can check out these 5 little known GMail tips and learn some more ways to get a better Gmail experience .
1. Custom From
Redirecting mails from another email is a pretty common service that most email service providers provide .
Gmail takes it a step further .
Not only can you redirect your mails from Gmail to another address but also send mails from your Gmail account as if they were appearing from another account !
No , we are not spoofing .
It ’s a legal way that Gmail provides .
As an example , take two email ids like google@gmail.com and yahoo@yahoo.com .
Our task is to configure Gmail account such that mails could be sent with From : as either of the two ids .
Go to google@gmail.com >
Settings >
Accounts tab .
Under Send mail as : option , click on Add another email address .
Follow the instructions on the screen .
An email will be sent to yahoo@yahoo.com with a pass code .
Enter that pass code in the specified location .
Done .
As shown in the image alongside , you can use either google@gmail.com or yahoo@yahoo.com as the From address to send mails , and can configure either as the default .
I really like this and has made my life much easier
2. Gmail signature in reply - to exactly where you want it
This is something new from the Gmail ’s super creative team .
With this option enabled , you need not cut - paste your signature from the bottom to just after your message .
As soon as you click on reply , your signature will automatically appear on the very top .
This is especially useful in long mail exchanges .
3 . Shoo away spammers
Gmail considers r.o.w@gmail.com the same as row@gmail.com .
This can be an excellent way to find out your spam mail source .
Bloggers submit their email ids to many places .
With each submission there is a potential for email abuse .
The way to get around this is : Instead of submitting your mail id like row@gmail.com , submit it as r.ow@gmail.com to one , as ro.w@gmail.com to another , and so on .
Set up filters in Gmail corresponding to each of the mail ids submitted by you .
Now when you receive spam , you can identify its source based on the unique filter that has been set up for it .
4 . I forgot to attach that doc
No more fret about it .
With this option enabled , Gmail will detect that you wanted to attach a doc but forgot to and it will prompt you to do so .
Go to your Gmail account > labs and enable this feature as shown .
It seems that this feature scans for words like attachment , find attached etc. to detect missing attachment .
Simple but a lovely idea .
5. Secure your Gmail account
Worried that someone else might be reading your emails from the cyber cafe you went to and forgot to log out from ?
No more .
Gmail now provides
Sign out all other sessions facility .
Scroll down to the bottom of Gmail page after login .
Click on Details .
You will get this pop up .
You know what to do with this button now .
Rest in peace .

Investing in 2008 has been anything but easy for most Americans .
The economy officially entered into recession in December of 2007 and ever since , we have experienced the strongest volatility ever recorded .
Extreme market volatility as I had discussed in a previous article is a telltale sign that the market is in severe distress and is not an indicator of market health .
On Friday , the unemployment report came out and shocked to the downside .
Most analyst were expecting the unemployment number to come in at - 350,000 when the actual number was - 533,000 jobs lost .
This sent the Dow 30 down over 200 points yet at the end of the day , the market ended up strongly by 259 points .
The S & P 500 which is a better measure of the overall economy , went up 3.65 % .
When we see action like this , it is hard for many not to begin to look for a bottom .
I would argue that a bottom is far from here .
Even looking at economic fundamentals with employment and sector growth , the country is set for a powerful contraction .
$ 50 trillion has already disappeared from the global economy since the peak in October of 2007 .
Today we are going to look very closely at the S & P 500 and try to determine whether it is a smart time to invest in the broader markets .
First , let us take a look at a graph of the S & P 500 since 1936 through 2008 :
Looking at data since 1936 the average P/E for the S & P 500 is 15.79 .
The current P/E for the market looking at second quarter data is 24.92 .
Since that time , the P/E has started to look more attractive but you have to be cautious as to why this is occurring .
First , the current P/E ratios are betting that earnings will not take hits in 2009 which they clearly are .
The formula itself looks at a stock price and measures it to earnings .
Well as you know , many companies are reporting weaker and sometimes no earnings .
This obviously is going to hurt the overall ratios and makes what looks like an attractive investment , a bottom trap .
If you think it ca n’t go lower take a look at some of the historical quarter lows :
1942 : 8.47
1949 : 6.52
1974 : 7.71
1980 : 7.65
1989 : 12.61
The current P/E for the S & P 500 as of 12/5/2008 is 18.01 .
This may start looking attractive because earnings for the most part are being projected the same by numerous companies .
This of course is inaccurate .
So what you have , is over the past year the price going drastically lower while earnings have yet to catch up .
This is where the economic fundamentals come in .
Clearly earnings come from a vibrant economy and losing the most jobs in 34 years is going to force many of these companies to cut back .
Let us look at how the S & P 500 is broken down :
The S & P 500 is made up of 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy .
Companies have to have a minimum market capitalization of $ 4 billion to make the index .
Most regard this as a better overall gauge of the U.S. equities markets than say the Dow 30 components which only reflects 30 companies .
You can see in the above chart that 5 of the heaviest weighted sectors will be facing difficulties in the upcoming year .
If energy prices stay as they are because the menace of deflation goes longer than expected , this will cut deeply into earnings .
Consumer staples ?
Early reports are showing us that consumers are tapped out and spending on more necessities as opposed to want goods .
Could it be because the United States is looking at over $ 50 trillion in debt and is maxed out ?
This sector will be contracting as well .
Health Care ?
This may be one of the few areas that does hold up but people in tough times cut back no matter what .
Financials ?
Well this area has been the hardest hit and it is easy to understand why with the bursting housing bubble and the destruction of equity and credit markets over the past year .
IT ?
Take a look at the NASDAQ and you ’ll see how they are doing .
AT & T just announced it will be cutting thousands from its workforce .
This area will contract as well .
So what does this all mean ?
Expect lower earnings .
So even though the index price has been declining ( after all the S & P 500 is down over 40 % for the year ) it is no bargain .
Even if we assumed a healthy economy , the price is no bargain .
Throw in the fact that we are in recession and you can understand why the S & P 500 is still overvalued .
We have n’t even come close to the historical P/E of 15.79 which includes good times as well .
Here is an easy way to wrap your brain around this .
Wal - Mart has been holding up well since they sell needed daily goods which consumers will always need .
They are up for the year 22 % .
Their current stock price is $ 58.21 .
Their last earning per share number was $ 3.42 .
So they have a P/E slightly above 17 .
So even Wal - Mart who if we look at both economic and stock fundamentals , is priced to withstand the recession better than many other companies in the S & P 500 is still lower priced than the overall index at 18.01 !
What does that mean ?
The S & P 500 is still over priced .
Let us take a quick look at the damage :
S & P 500 Market Cap :
October 12 , 2007 : $ 13.75 trillion
December 6 , 2008 : $ 7.66 trillion
A drop of $ 6.09 trillion in market cap in a little over one year and the index is still overpriced .
Shows you that we had more bubbles than simply the housing bubble going on here .

While people often joke that in divorce , women try take their husbands for everything they 've got , according to a new study divorce makes men significantly richer , while women may never recover financially .
Advertisement
The survey , conducted by Professor Stephen Jenkins , a director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research , was the first to track the financial outcomes of divorce among British couples .
Jenkins combined data from British Household Panel Surveys from 1991 to 2004 with European surveys and calculated the divorced couples ' incomes before and after divorce .
The Independent reports that after a divorce , the incomes of ex-husbands rose by 25 percent , while ex-wives incomes fell sharply .
27 percent of the women in the survey wound up living in poverty , three times the rate of the ex-husbands .
" This is not so much a gender thing as a parent thing , " said Jenkins .
" The key differences are not between men and women but between fathers and mothers . "
Fathers ' fare even better than childless men , with their incomes increasing by more than a third post - divorce , even though they should have the added burden of child support payments .
But the survey found that mothers usually end up taking on all of the financial burden of children .
Kids usually stay with the mother and only 31 percents of fathers actually make maintenance payments for their children .

Women are also far more likely to have interrupted their careers to care for children during a marriage .
In 80 percent of families it 's the mother who stays home to care for the children , often interrupting her career , according to divorce lawyer Karen Moores .
' Even in professional couples this is still the norm and once they split up it is difficult to change the roles they have taken on , " Moores told the Daily Mail .
" He still has the income while she 's still at home or working part - time to care for the children . "
The study found that if women had worked throughout their relationship the divorce would have significantly less impact on their income .
Remarrying could have a slight positive increase in a woman 's finances , while the only time men's incomes decreased was when they remarried and had children while making payments to their first wives .
Professor John Ermisch , author of An Economic Analysis of the Family and Lone Parenthood told The Guardian that he agrees that women have a harder time financially after divorce , but said the gender disparity is getting better .
" The proportion of women with dependent children who stop working after a marital split has almost halved between the late 1990s and early 2000s , from 16 % to 9 % , " said Ermish .
In Britain , the number of women working when they divorced has also increased from around 66 percent in the 1990s to 74 % in 2002 .
Though more women are staying financially stable by working continuously throughout their relationship , this just means they are more likely to become single working mothers , and still face a much bigger struggle following divorce than their ex-husbands .

An NHS doctor who was freed following claims that she was being held captive in Bangladesh by her parents is due to fly into the UK later .
Lawyers for trainee GP Humayra Abedin , 33 , from east London , said her family planned to force her into marriage .
She had travelled to Dhaka in August after hearing her mother was very ill .
London 's High Court had ordered her return to the UK under the new Forced Marriage Act and the High Court in Dhaka has now ruled she must be freed .
Lawyer Sara Hossain , representing Dr Abedin in Bangladesh , said her client was " very relieved " by the decision and had " clearly stated " that she wanted to return to the UK immediately .
Dr Abedin 's parents had been ordered to appear at Dhaka 's High Court with their daughter on Sunday .
She was later released into the custody of the court and handed over to the British High Commission .
She is expected to return to Heathrow from Dhaka on Monday .
Judge Syed Mahmud Hossain said her parents ' actions were " not acceptable " .
Dr Abedin 's father collapsed from shock after the court 's ruling .
' Hope ' for women
The BBC's Mark Dummett in Dhaka said Dr Abedin had been held captive first at her family 's home and then at a psychiatric hospital following claims she was not able to make decisions for herself .

But she had managed to get messages to her friends in the UK about her plight who then notified the British authorities , he said .
She has chosen not to press charges against her parents .
Dr Abedin's UK lawyer , Anne- Marie Hutchinson , said there were currently up to 350 similar cases involving British women and she hoped the latest case would give them hope .
" What the ruling makes clear is that there is a right of redress , " she said .
" I would hope that many other young victims , or potential victims , would feel confident enough now to come forward and feel confident in the fact that courts will act and authorities overseas will act on their human rights and implement them . "
She added that , although forced marriage was already illegal in Bangladesh , it was significant that the judge had gone public with his ruling in demonstrating that such things were unacceptable .
An unnamed British victim of a forced marriage , who is now separated from her husband , told the BBC's Today programme the ruling was the " best news " for those facing similar situations .
" I think it will give a lot of hope to young girls out there , " she said .
Court action Dr Abedin arrived in Britain in September 2002 , when she studied for a Masters degree in public health at Leeds University .
She had been due to start work in August at a GP surgery in east London , but travelled to Dhaka after being told that her mother was ill .
The British High Court had served her family with an injunction under the Forced Marriage Act ordering them to free their daughter and allow her to return to the UK .
However , this was not enforceable overseas because Dr Abedin is not a British national .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the order was issued in the hope that it might " carry some weight " within the Bangladeshi court system .

If she 's unreasonably jealous or controlling , if she 's a " control freak , " if she slaps you around or throws things , if she starts to destroy things that are personally important to you , do n't ignore the signs !
It 's not going to get any better !
Watch out for your own safety !
Here 's what the Easton Alliance , the only organization in Canada serving battered males , has to say :
The one defining characteristic of most abused men is that they are extremely embarrassed by their predicament .
Most men who have reached out for help have been laughed at or scorned .
They are often portrayed as weak and cowardly .
This is simply not true .
All types of men are subject to the same types of abuse as women , including physical abuse .
These abuses range from a slap in the face to a kitchen knife being plunged into a husband 's stomach while sleeping to being run down by his wife who was driving the family vehicle .
Men also report emotional and sexual abuse , including threats and insults , withholding money , controlling personal activities , attempts to change him , unwanted sexual touching , forced sexual activity and sexual degradation .

Or as Charlie Campbell put it as he pulled a beer , “ It is what it is . ”
The diminutive establishment , all 800 square feet of it , has a bare - bones brick wall , walnut paneling and red vinyl booths that could never , at the Emerald , be thought of as banquettes .
“ Columbus Avenue , ” said Ms. Otstott , “ has been turning into a strip mall , with chain stores and restaurants .
Maybe the recession will help the mom-and - pops stay in business . ”
But there has been no death - row reprieve for some other classics facing rent increases , like the P&G Bar , at 279 Amsterdam Avenue at 73d Street .
The P&G , with the iconic neon sign that has been designated a landmark  is moving after February , to 380 Columbus Avenue at 78th Street , the former Evelyn Lounge .
Mike Campbell ’s father ( also Mike ) opened the Emerald with his brother William .
“ Exactly when , we ’re not sure , but it was 1943 or 1944 , ” Charlie Campbell said .
The Emerald has been an enduring link to the West Side ’s raffish past , when Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues were populated by gin mills and where brawls among patrons , enthusiastically mediated by bruiser bartenders , were not unusual .
“ We were called Spanish Harlem until the ’60s , when they put in Lincoln Center , ” said Charlie Campbell .
In recent decades , the clientele has gone upscale , to professionals who can afford Upper West Side housing , along with a sprinkling of loyal locals , some of them survivors of the era when “ West Side Story ” was a contemporary narrative .

For years the Emerald bore a yellow and green neon sign , but about a decade ago the old sign yielded to an awning ( green , necessarily ) .
These days the front of the bar is graced only by a green neon window shamrock affixed to a blue Corona sign .
As a conservative , I grew up in the threat of socialism : the nationalization of the tools of production .
What no one warned me was that this could be accomplished by way of a unique form of nationalization : the nationalization of insolvency .
We have lived through this process in 2008 .
The process will continue for several more years .
Insolvency is being transferred from the banking sector to the government sector .
How much insolvency ?
So far in 2008 , the government and the Federal Reserve System are on the hook for as much as an additional $ 7.7 trillion .
Solvency is being retained by the bailed - out banks : the private sector .
Insolvency is being transferred to those who depend on Social Security and Medicare , and also to future investors in U.S. government debt .
This is being done with full compliance of Congress , both Administrations , Wall Street , and most voters , who do not understand the nature of the transfer process .
One man does understand it .
He shares a common bond with Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin : he served as CEO of Goldman Sachs .
His name is John Whitehead .
He has watched the financial markets for six decades .
On November 12 , he offered his assessment .
The United States faces a slump deeper than the Great Depression .
Unlike the Great Depression , however , this will be accompanied by the downgrading of Treasury debt .
We ’re talking about reducing the credit of the United States of America , which is the backbone of the economic system .
I see nothing but large increases in the deficit , all of which are serving to decrease the credit standing of America .
. . .
The public is not prepared to increase taxes .
Both parties were for reducing taxes , reducing income to government , and both parties favored a number of new programs — all very costly and all done by the government .
All this has taken place behind the scenes this year .
It has taken place on five Sundays .
Then , on five Mondays , the announcement of the transfer of insolvency to the U.S. government has been made by Treasury Secretary Paulson .
The public cheers .
CITIGROUP
It happened again last weekend : another Sunday surprise .
The government on Sunday guaranteed the survival of Citigroup , which was about to go bankrupt .
Citigroup includes Citibank .
Citigroup in 2006 had a capitalized value of $ 274 billion .
By Thursday afternoon , this was down to $ 26 billion .
This was not much of a surprise .
The stock market had already anticipated it .
The Dow rose by almost 500 points late on Friday in expectation of the bailout .
It was up another 400 points on Monday .
American investors believe in bailouts .
For them , salvation happens on Sunday .
As taxpayers , they shrug it off .
“ We ’ll grow our way out of this . ”
They really mean , “ Our children will grow their way out of this , and will pay us our Social Security and pensions as our government has promised on their behalf . ”
Think of this as the equivalent of the United Auto Workers ’ faith in the pension guarantees made by the Big Three American automakers .
As investors , they cheer .
“ No more losses ! ” Think of this as the United Auto Workers ’ view of competition in 1965 .
To understand the enormous gullibility of investors , let me cite directly from a Citi document that I downloaded this week .
Save it before senior management takes it down .

Inspirational !
Investors believe in government bailouts with the same confidence that readers are expected to believe this promotional piece by Citi .
Before I comment on the Citi bailout , let me review the history of recent Sunday deliverances .
I call these Sunday surprises .
THE FIRST SURPRISE
The first Sunday surprise took place on March 16 .
The New York Times described it late that afternoon .
Bear Stearns , pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by what amounted to a run on the bank , agreed late Sunday to sell itself to JPMorgan Chase for a mere $ 2 a share , narrowly averting a collapse that threatened to cascade through the financial system .
The price represents a startling 93 percent discount to Bear Stearns ’ closing stock price on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .
Bankers and policy makers raced to complete the deal before financial markets in Asia opened on Monday , as fears grew that the financial panic could spread if Bear Stearns failed to find a buyer .
The deal , done at the behest of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department , punctuates the stunning downfall of one of Wall Street ’s biggest and most storied firms .
Less than a week earlier , the CEO of Bear Stearns , Alan Schwartz , had assured the public that the company was solvent , that there was no problem .
A Reuters story was typical of the press ’s handling of the story .
Schwartz , in a televised interview on CNBC , also said he is comfortable with the range of analysts ’ earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 29 .
Results for the quarter are due next week .
“ We do n’t see any pressure on our liquidity , let alone a liquidity crisis , ” he said .
Bear finished fiscal 2007 with $ 17 billion of cash sitting at the parent company level as a “ liquidity cushion , ” he said .
“ That cushion has been virtually unchanged .
We have $ 17 billion or so excess cash on the balance sheet , ” he said .
Schwartz denied speculation that other brokers were turning down Bear ’s credit on trades for fear of counter - party risk .
According to an article published weeks later , this “ speculation ” was introduced by the CNBC interviewer , who cited an anonymous source that Goldman Sachs had turned down a Bear Stearns trade .
Schwartz denied it .
“ There ’s been a lot of volatility in the market , a lot of disruption .
That ’s causing some administrative pressure , getting trades settled .
We ’re in constant dialogue with all the major dealers , and I have not been made aware of anybody not taking our credit , ” he said .
The Reuters article went on to describe the state of the markets .
As one of the largest players in mortgage - backed bond markets , investors have assumed Bear ’s exposure would lead to crippling losses .
“ None of that speculation is true , ” Schwartz said .
When speculation starts in a market , one that has a lot of emotion in it and people concerned with volatility , “ they will sell first and ask questions later , ” he said .
“ That creates its own momentum . ”
The critic of this chain of events argues that there never was verifiable evidence that Goldman Sachs or any other firm had turned down Bear Stearns ’ business .
The market did not care .
This supposed solvency turned out to be irrelevant within hours .
Bear Stearns ’ stock price continued to fall on Thursday and Friday .
By Monday morning , Bear Stearns was no more .
A rumor cannot create this outcome except when fears are rampant and leverage is high .
Bear Stearns was the victim of high leverage and bad forecasts .
It took a fire sale on Sunday , initiated by the New York Federal Reserve Bank , to keep Bear from going bankrupt on Monday , March 17 : St. Patrick ’s Day .
To sweeten the deal , the Federal Reserve absorbed the risk for $ 29 billion of Bear Stearns ’ debt .
The public outcry and the threat of a shareholders ’ lawsuit against the $ 2 per share price later led to Morgan upping the price to $ 10 .
As for the $ 17 billion in liquidity , Morgan must have gotten it as part of the firm ’s assets .
We never heard any more about it .
Paraphrasing Bunker
Hunt ’s statement in 1980 , as he was going bankrupt , when the FED had to lend him a billion dollars , “ Seventeen billion just does n’t go as far as it used to . ”
THE SECOND SURPRISE
On Sunday , September 7 , Treasury Secretary Paulson announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been taken over by the U.S. government .
He issued this press release .
Before I turn to Jim to discuss the action he is taking today , let me make clear that these two institutions are unique .
They operate solely in the mortgage market and are therefore more exposed than other financial institutions to the housing correction .
Their statutory capital requirements are thin and poorly defined as compared to other institutions .
Nothing about our actions today in any way reflects a changed view of the housing correction or of the strength of other U.S. financial institutions .
Note these words : “ Nothing about our actions today in any way reflects a changed view of the housing correction or of the strength of other U.S. financial institutions . ”
A week later , Paulson & Co. were at it again .
They tried — and failed — to keep Lehman Brothers Holdings from going bankrupt .
Paulson ’s press release then made a statement that will haunt the financial markets for the news two years — maybe three .
I have long said that the housing correction poses the biggest risk to our economy .
It is a drag on our economic growth , and at the heart of the turmoil and stress for our financial markets and financial institutions .
Our economy and our markets will not recover until the bulk of this housing correction is behind us .
I can think of no more accurate statement from Mr. Paulson during his term of office .
The housing correction is in its early phase .
As it accelerates , so will the “ the turmoil and stress for our financial markets and financial institutions . ”
Count on it .
This was the nationalization of America ’s mortgage industry .
By September 2008 , Fannie and Freddie were supplying 90 % of all residential mortgages in the United States .
But Paulson did not use the N - word .
He picked another .
I support the Director ’s decision as necessary and appropriate and had advised him that conservatorship was the only form in which I would commit taxpayer money to the GSEs .
“ Conservatorship . ”
How reassuring .
Nationalization would have seemed so crass , so anti-free market .
Then he admitted what is still true : the mortgage market is at the heart of the U.S. economy .
The economy was heading for a cliff .
And let me make clear what today ’s actions mean for Americans and their families .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in our financial markets here at home and around the globe .
This turmoil would directly and negatively impact household wealth : from family budgets , to home values , to savings for college and retirement .
A failure would affect the ability of Americans to get home loans , auto loans and other consumer credit and business finance .
And a failure would be harmful to economic growth and job creation .
That is why we have taken these actions today .
This is the issue of systemic risk , or , as the old spiritual put it , “ the knee bone connected to the thigh bone .
The thigh bone connected to the . . . . ”
And so on .
Paulson called for government intervention to keep the market from imposing its negative sanctions on bad decisions made by the leaders at Fannie and Freddie .
And policymakers must address the issue of systemic risk .
I recognize that there are strong differences of opinion over the role of government in supporting housing , but under any course policymakers choose , there are ways to structure these entities in order to address market stability in the transition and limit systemic risk and conflict of purposes for the long - term .
We will make a grave error if we do n’t use this time out to permanently address the structural issues presented by the GSEs .
There was no mention of the taxpayers ’ price tag on this “ conservatorship . ”
Combined , the two outfits have guaranteed over $ 5 trillion in mortgages .
To this was added the Mortgage - Backed Securities ( MBS ) that had been sold — and borrowed against — to buy these mortgages .
What of these investments ?
Because the U.S. Government created these ambiguities , we have a responsibility to both avert and ultimately address the systemic risk now posed by the scale and breadth of the holdings of GSE debt and MBS .
The move was immediately praised by Ben Bernanke .
Bond fund manager Bill Gross also praised it .
THE THIRD SURPRISE
A week after the nationalization of the mortgage market , there was another emergency meeting .
This time , the survival of the huge investment - banking firm of Lehman Brothers Holdings was at stake .
So little known was this 160 - year - old institution that knowledgeable commentators still do not know how to pronounce Lehman : “ Leeman ” or “ Layman . ” ( “ Leeman . ” )
Another institution facing bankruptcy was Merrill Lynch , the largest and most famous retail brokerage form in the United States .
The result of Sunday ’s meeting : Lehman declared bankruptcy on Monday morning and Merrill was bought by Bank of America for $ 50 billion of BofA stock .
All of this was done behind closed doors over a weekend .
That was how desperate the government and the Federal Reserve were to get the deals done by Monday morning .
They failed with Lehman .
No deal .
Lehman had over $ 100 billion in bonds outstanding .
It reported its debts at $ 613 billion and its assets at $ 639 billion .
According to its former CEO , Richard Fuld , he took out $ 300 million in the eight years prior to the collapse of his company .
By the end of the week , September 21 , two other investment banks , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , filed with the FED for bank holding company status .
That was on a Saturday .
This switch was immediately granted .
This entitled them to the bailout money being offered by the Federal Reserve System and anything Congress might pass .
Congress passed a $ 700 bailout plan , plus $ 150 billion in pork , by the end of September .
That was the last of the Big Five investment banks .
The survivors are minor players that only specialists have heard of , such as Jeffries .
Goldman Sachs ’ press release on September 21 is worth considering .
It mentioned that it had been founded in 1869 .
It was a private banking firm open only to “ high net worth individuals . ”
No longer .
“ When Goldman Sachs was a private partnership , we made the decision to become a public company , recognizing the need for permanent capital to meet the demands of scale .
While accelerated by market sentiment , our decision to be regulated by the Federal Reserve is based on the recognition that such regulation provides its members with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and funding , ” said Lloyd C. Blankfein , Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs .
“ We believe that Goldman Sachs , under Federal Reserve supervision , will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources . ”
That said it all .
The rich no longer could survive on their own .
From now on , they will need to be “ under Federal Reserve supervision . ”
We are at the end of an era that stretches back to early nineteenth - century America .
The whole nation now looks to fiat money and government bailouts .
The era of American entrepreneurship has ended in the financial markets .
THE FOURTH SURPRISE
On the weekend of September 27 , FDIC officials met with officials of America ’s fourth largest bank , Wachovia , and officials of America ’s no-longer largest bank , Citigroup .
They hammered out a merger .
This was done with no public announcement .
The announcement came in a press release on Monday morning , before the stock market opened .
Citigroup Inc. will acquire the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation ; Charlotte , North Carolina , in a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and concurred with by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the President .
All depositors are fully protected and there is expected to be no cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund .
Wachovia did not fail ; rather , it is to be acquired by Citigroup Inc. on an open bank basis with assistance from the FDIC .
It was a sweet deal for Citigroup .
Citigroup Inc. will acquire the bulk of Wachovia ’s assets and liabilities , including five depository institutions and assume senior and subordinated debt of Wachovia Corp .
Wachovia Corporation will continue to own Wachovia Securities , AG Edwards and Evergreen .
The FDIC has entered into a loss sharing arrangement on a pre-identified pool of loans .
Under the agreement , Citigroup Inc. will absorb up to $ 42 billion of losses on a $ 312 billion pool of loans .
The FDIC will absorb losses beyond that .
Citigroup has granted the FDIC $ 12 billion in preferred stock and warrants to compensate the FDIC for bearing this risk .
It was too sweet a deal .
Wells Fargo sued Citigroup .
Citigroup was offering $ 2.2 billion for Wachovia .
Wells Fargo was offering $ 15 billion .
Wells Fargo eventually triumphed .
That move gave Wells Fargo more branches than any other bank , plus deposits equaling Bank of America .
THE FIFTH SURPRISE
Citigroup was the institutional heir of the Rockefeller family , through William , the brother of John D. William ’s son James Stillman Rockefeller , who became chairman in 1959 .
The bank ’s history goes back to the War of 1812 .
So large was this bank that it was the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914 .
On November 4 , 2007 , its CEO , Chuck Prince , resigned .
The next day , I told my Website ’s subscribers to get out of stocks and short the S&P 500 .
According to a report on Bloomberg , in late 2006 , the capitalized value of Citigroup was $ 274 billion .
It was the largest bank in the United States in terms of market value , with Bank of America second .
By September 21 , 2008 , its capitalized value was in the range of $ 26 billion .
The extent of the bank ’s condition was published only after the Sunday bailout .
At that point , the government and the Federal Reserve had to come clean .
The disaster could no longer be concealed .
What had been the largest bank in terms of market value had slipped to # 6 , and was about to go bust .
This is why the government intervened .
The government ( you and I ) will shield the bank ’s shareholders and creditors against most of the losses in its portfolio of toxic loans .
Terms of the asset guarantees mean Citigroup will cover the first $ 29 billion of pretax losses from the $ 306 billion pool , in addition to any reserves it already has set aside .
After that , the government covers 90 percent of the losses , with Citigroup covering the rest from assets that include leveraged loans and so - called structured investment vehicles .
The government will pay $ 20 billion for $ 27 billion of preferred stock , which will pay 8 % .
( It will pay 8 % only because the government will pay off the bad loans . )
The government has already provided $ 25 billion in the Troubled Asset Relief Program , which is part of the $ 700 billion bailout bill , passed in late September .
“ This is a partial government takeover , ” Christopher Whalen of Institutional Risk Analytics , a Torrance , California - based research firm , said in a Bloomberg Radio interview .
“ We have been telling people for a while that some of the top banks were going to end up controlled by the government next year .
It looks like that ’s happening sooner than even we expected . ”
In a lengthy , detailed article published in the New York Times on November 22 — two years too late — the reporters trace the history of bad decisions made by senior managers at Citi .
The article shows that there were red flags , but no one paid any attention .
The article also indicates that there may be more bad news to come .
Call it “ Citi bailout , phase I . ”
CONCLUSION
America ’s biggest banks are going bust or have gone bust .
Little banks are toppling each week .
There is no end in sight .
The government , which is running a trillion - dollar deficit this fiscal year , is adding ever more debt to save the favored banks .
It is buying the banks ’ insolvency in the name of future taxpayers .
The buyers of Treasury debt and the Federal Reserve System are funding all of this .
They think future taxpayers will pay them back .
I do n’t .
I think there will be a tax revolt : mass inflation .
Meanwhile , every dollar that flows into the Treasury does not flow into the private sector .
The nationalization of insolvency continues .
The authority to make decisions regarding who will get the shrinking supply of private savings that the banks have not already absorbed to keep their doors open has been transferred to a new generation of capitalists , people who live in fear of government regulators , not depositors .
The year 2008 has seen the end of free market financial capitalism .
Forget about efficiency .
Forget about stable economic growth .
Forget about everything except solvency as defined in fiat money .
Moral hazard is alive and well in the West .
Free capital markets are not .
It was nice while it lasted .
But it could not last .
State capitalism always demands bailouts .
It always gets what it asks for .
Senior managers got the gold mine .
Taxpayers got the shaft .

Correction to this article
JUST how worrying are the figures , published on Wednesday December 10th , showing that China 's exports and imports plunged in November ?
Exports fell by 2.2 % last month from a year ago ; imports plummeted by an astonishing 17.9 % .
One analyst sums up the news as “ a shock figure ” .
The gloom is spread all over the place .
Exports dropped across all big traded goods and all parts of the world .
Exports to America fell by 6.1 % ; those to the ASEAN countries , which had grown by 21.5 % in October , fell by 2.4 % .
The faster decline in imports meant that China 's monthly trade surplus reached a record $ 40.1 billion .
Exports last fell in 2001 .
Such numbers would be nasty enough for any big economy , but they are particularly shocking because China 's racing trade has been an engine of world trade , and thus global growth .
During the 1990s China 's exports grew at an annual average of 12.9 % ; from 2000 to 2006 that growth nearly doubled to 21.1 % each year , according to the World Bank .
China 's rapidly rising imports have also driven growth elsewhere .
The chief economist of a Chinese bank calls the latest figures “ horrifying ” .
The rapidity of the decline is as striking as its extent .
Trade growth in October was similar to preceeding months ; exports grew by more than 19 % from a year earlier .
A sudden drop in just a month has surprised even the most pessimistic economists .
Some analysts point out that a global shortage of trade finance in November may have exaggerated the decline , but the Chinese juggernaut is definitely stumbling .
The consequences for the Chinese economy , which has seen dizzying rates of growth since economic reforms began in 1978 ( growth in the 1990s averaged 10.5 % ) , could now be dire .
Its growth is unusually driven by its exports , which have made it the world 's factory .
According to the World Bank , 27 % of world GDP in 2006 came from exports ( up from 21 % in 1990 ) .
The corresponding figures for China that year show it to be particularly dependent on exports : 40 % of its GDP came from exports in 2006 , compared with 11 % for highly open America and 29 % for Britain .
Thus the potential for a drop in exports to drag down China 's growth is correspondingly greater .
The World Bank 's latest growth predictions were released on Tuesday .
These predict that the Chinese economy will expand by 7.5 % in 2009 , well under its own calculation of 9.5 % growth that it reckons China needs to keep unemployment stable .
But even these calculations may prove to be overly optimistic .
The Bank 's prediction rests in part on the expectation that China 's exports will rise by 4.2 % next year .
In fact many analysts expect the slump in trade to continue and possibly worsen ; UBS , a Swiss bank , predicts that Chinese exports will not grow at all in 2009 .
Chinese workers , who are already restive , may find the new year increasingly difficult .
Labour disputes almost doubled in the first ten months of 2008 and sacked workers from closed toy factories rioted .
If export growth ceases entirely , and jobs are threatened , social responses could be more severe .
An estimated 130 m people have moved from the countryside to the cities , many for jobs in factories that make goods for export .
Zhang Ping , the country 's top planner , has given warning of the risk of social instability arising from massive unemployment .
The latest trade figures also worsen the already gloomy outlook for the rest of the world .
Some were counting on China to prop up the global economy , as much of the rich world falls into recession .
Merrill Lynch had expected China to contribute 60 % of global growth in 2009 .
But the dramatic fall in imports suggest that the Chinese can not be relied on to be the consumer of last resort .
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect several more months of shrinking exports .
Speculation that China will devalue its currency is rife , but this would have little effect if world demand is simply collapsing .
The experience of South Korea is instructive : its currency has fallen by a third against the dollar this year , but this did not prevent its exports from dropping by 18.3 % in November , compared with a year ago .
Unfortunately , this may not be enough to deter the Chinese government from trying to push down the yuan , which has appreciated significantly on a trade - weighted basis .
Fiscal stimulus is much more important ; efforts to boost domestic demand would help both China and the world .
Most analysts expect announcements about new measures on top of the $ 586 billion package already announced .
Interest rates and taxes are likely to be cut further .

We incorrectly stated that exports accounted for 30 % of American GDP and 11 % of British GDP in 2006 .
The correct figures are 11 % for America and 29 % for Britain .
Sorry .
Here ’s a good midday chuckle .
Need a good reason ( another one , I mean ) not to vote for Sen. John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ?
How about to save Tina Fey ’s life ?
“ If she wins , I ’m done , ” Fey tells TV Guide .
“ I ca n’t do that for four years .
And by ‘ I ’m done , ’ I mean I ’m leaving Earth . ”
But that will not keep her from continuing to spoof the former beauty queen right up to election day .
And with good reason .
The New York Post notes that political impersonations can actually do in a politician .
“ Presidential impersonators do influence elections , and in this one , Tina Fey is well on her way to ruining Sarah Palin ’s political career , ” said Jerald Podair , a professor of American Studies at Lawrence University .
“ Election time is always good for [ ‘ SNL ’ ] , and this is a bonkers election , ” Fey tells TV Guide in the upcoming issue with “ 30 Rock ’s ” Alec Baldwin on the cover .
And that lady is a media star .
She is a fascinating person , she ’s very likable .
She ’s fun to play , and the two bits with Amy Poehler , that was super fun . ”
So a few more weeks is doable .
But having to be Palin for the next four years would be a frightening full - time job .
High school seniors would be taught how to write a check , manage credit card debt and obtain a mortgage under a bill advanced in the New Jersey Senate today .
The Senate Education Committee approved a pilot program in personal financial education despite concerns about overloading the high school curriculum .
Sen. Jim Whelan , ( D - Atlantic ) , expressed concerns about adding requirements to the high school curriculum without extending the length of the school day .
The New Jersey Education Association said financial lessons can be incorporated into existing coursework in business , economics , math or home economics .
The three - year pilot program will be restricted to six school districts .
The measure passed in the Assembly in September .
Whether the calls for reducing America 's oil dependence on the Middle East that played such a big part in Barack Obama 's campaign will find a home in today 's inaugural address is an open question .

Llora , no cantes ( AP ) The Mexican oil industry is in steep decline .
The huge production falls seen through the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter , Bloomberg says , as Mexico 's state oil company is set to report its steepest annual production declines ...

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- A Citigroup infrastructure fund is bidding 7.9 billion euros ( $ 10.2 billion ) to buy a Spanish highway operating firm , the firms said on Monday .
Citi Infrastructure Partners is buying most of Itinere Infraestructuras from Sacyr Vallehermoso ( 018287021 ) , a Spanish construction group eagerly trying to shed debt as the Spanish housing market weakens .
The same company is in talks with Russia 's Lukoil to sell a minority stake in oil group Repsol REP , +0.59 % .
The deal sees the Citi fund assume 5 billion euros of debt and pay 2.87 billion euros of cash in a transaction that will slash Sacyr 's debt load by as much as 37 % .
The fund , in which Citi directly has about a 15 % stake , is paying 3.96 euros per Itinere ( 013384801 ) share in a complex deal in which Sacyr also will buy back some highway concessions that are in a ramp - up phase .
The Citi fund is then going to sell some highways it 's buying to Abertis Infraestructuras ( 011184501 ) and Atlantia ( ATL ) in a deal worth about 1 billion euros .
Abertis is buying 621 million euros of highways in Spain and Chile , and Atlantia is buying 420 million euros of highways in Chile and Brazil .
Julie Ainouz , an analyst at Societe Generale , said Citi was playing a relative low price because Sacyr needed to make a quick sale .
" Despite tougher lending conditions , these various transactions show that investors are still interested in motorway concessions , but they also reveal pressure on transaction multiples in the sector , " Ainouz said in a research note .
Itinere shares rose 14.5 % to 3.86 euros .
Sacyr shares rose 4.4 % , while Abertis shares weakened 2.8 % and Atlantia slipped 2.2 % .
In opening New York trade , Citi shares slumped over 10 % .
Itinere operates 44 infrastructure concessions in seven countries , notably Spain , Portugal , Chile and Brazil .
The group had a nine - month operating profit of 218 million euros on revenue of 478.6 million euros .
The move by the Citi C , - 2.12 % fund comes after a failed attempt with Abertis to run the Pennsylvania Turnpike .
The fund also is actively involved in the airports sector .
Citi said they 'll use the Itinere platform to invest in mature toll roads in developed economies .
One picture encapsulated his fame .
“ Christina ’s World ” became an American icon like Grant Wood ’s “ American Gothic , ” or Whistler ’s portrait of his mother or Emmanuel Leutze ’s “ Washington Crossing the Delaware . ”
Wyeth said he thought the work was “ a complete flat tire ” when he originally sent it off to the Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan in 1948 .
The Museum of Modern Art bought it for $ 1,800 .
Wyeth had seen Christina Olson , crippled from the waist down , dragging herself across a Maine field , “ like a crab on a New England shore , ” he recalled .
To him she was a model of dignity who refused to use a wheelchair and preferred to live in squalor rather than be beholden to anyone .
It was dignity of a particularly dour , hardened , misanthropic sort , to which Wyeth throughout his career seemed to gravitate .
Olson is shown in the picture from the back .
She was 55 at the time .
( She died 20 years later , having become a frequent subject in his art ; her death made the national news thanks to Wyeth ’s popularity . )
It is impossible to tell her age in the painting or what she looks like , the ambiguity adding to the overall mystery .
So does the house , which Wyeth called a dry - bone skeleton of a building , a symbol during the Depression of the American pastoral dream in a minor key , the house ’s whitewash of paint long gone , its shingles warped , the place isolated against a blank sky .
As popular paintings go , “ Christina ’s World ” is remarkable for being so dark and humorless , yet the public seemed to focus less on its gothic and morose quality and more on the way Wyeth painted each blade of grass , a mechanical and unremarkable kind of realism that was distinctive if only for going against the rising tide of abstraction in America in the late 1940’s .
“ Oftentimes people will like a picture I paint because it ’s maybe the sun hitting on the side of a window and they can enjoy it purely for itself , ” Wyeth once said .
“ It reminds them of some afternoon .
But for me , behind that picture could be a night of moonlight when I ’ve been in some house in Maine , a night of some terrible tension , or I had this strange mood .
Maybe it was Halloween .
It ’s all there , hiding behind the realistic side . ”
He also said : “ I think the great weakness in most of my work is subject matter .
There ’s too much of it . ”
Nonetheless , the perception of Wyeth ’s art as an alternative to abstraction accounted for a good portion of its enduring popularity during the mid-years of the last century .
Added to this was his personality : self - theatricalizing ( his biographer , Richard Meryman , described him as a “ self - promoter ” and a “ closet showman ” ) , Wyeth was not a bohemian , or at least he behaved contrary to the cliché of the bohemian artist .
He was also a vocal patriot , which endeared him to some quarters during the Cold War and dovetailed with a general sense that his art evoked a mythic rural past embedded in the American psyche .
“ America ’s absolutely it , ” he once said .

Regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Apple 's disclosures about chief executive Steve Jobs ' health problems , Bloomberg is reporting .
Citing a person familiar with the matter , theÂ financial publicationÂ said the SEC wants to make sure investors were n't misled .
Â
The probe is n't an indication that investigators have seen any evidence of misconduct .
" The good news flipped by the bad news makes one wonder what Apple knew , " said James Cox , a law professor at Duke University quoted in the report .
Â
" It 's not surprising for the SEC to come in and look afterward , given the pressure and publicity regarding their handling of a lot of cases , " he said , referring to Bernard Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
Spokespeople for both Apple and the SEC declined to comment .
An SEC lawyer who teaches at Wayne State Law School said securities regulators would be hard pressed to build a case against the Cupertino - based company .
" It would be difficult , and certainly a new area of the law , " said Peter Henning .
Â
" You would have to pin down exactly what they knew , and with a health issue — unlike a merger or a decline in revenue — it 's not subject to definitive answers . "
OnÂ January 5Â
Jobs disclosed that a hormone imbalance was causing him to lose weight but that he was undergoing treatment and planned to remaining as chief executive .
Â
Shares rose 4.2 percent .Â
But just nine days later , Â the Apple co-founder spooked industry watchers with his decision to take medical leave through June , saying his health problems turned out to be " more complex " than he thought .
Â
Apple shares have since fallen 8.4 percent .
A corporate governance expert at Chadbourne & Parke told Bloomberg that Apple 's board may have met its obligation to shareholders by announcing Jobs would be on leave .
" It 's really an issue of the ability of the CEO during the period of his ill health to continue to advise and consult and manage the affairs of the company , " said Edward Smith , who said the board is n't obligated to give specific details about Jobs ' illness .
Â
" Someone might be able to [ consult ] from a hospital bed for several weeks just as well as they may do it from the office . "
It 's been speculated that Apple will inevitably face lawsuits from shareholders unhappy with the company 's recent secrecy over Jobs uncertain health .
Such suits would be the first of their kind and represent uncharted territory for the US legal system .
Oct 19 , 2007 ( CIDRAP News ) – Scientists investigating why seasons drive annual influenza epidemics have charted how low humidity and cold temperatures contribute to the spread of the disease in laboratory animals .
The research group , from Mt Sinai School of Medicine in New York City , published their findings yesterday in the October issue of Public Library of Science Pathogens ( PLoS Pathogens ) .
In the two - pronged study , the researchers first tested aerosol influenza A virus transmission at different relative humidities and temperatures among guinea pigs .
Then they assessed whether cold temperatures influenced the immune response of infected animals by extracting RNA from their nasal tissues for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) testing .
The researchers used guinea pigs because they learned from a medical journal that guinea pigs kept for research purposes in 1919 at a New Mexico army base died during the 1918 flu pandemic , Peter Palese , a Mt. Sinai virologist and senior author of the study , said in a report today from New Scientist , a British science and technology magazine .
" We did n't know guinea pigs got the flu .
They are no longer popular lab animals , and no one had tried them , " he told New Scientist .
To tease out the effects of temperature and humidity on virus spread , the group performed 20 trials at different humidities and temperatures , each involving eight animals .
For each trial , four guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with influenza A virus .
Then pairs of infected and uninfected animals were housed individually in adjoining cages .
Nasal wash samples were collected from the animals about every other day , and serum samples were collected before infection and on day 17 after infection .
Five different humidity levels were tested at 20°C : 20 % , 35 % , 50 % , 65 % , and 80 % .
The researchers found that transmission was most efficient at the two lowest humidity levels , at which three or four of the exposed guinea pigs became infected .
At 50 % relative humidity , only one of the four animals contracted influenza .
More were infected in 65 % humidity , but no disease transmission was noted at 80 % humidity .
In the temperature experiments , animals were exposed to 5 °C , 20°C , and 30 °C at different humidity levels .
The investigators found that transmission was more efficient when guinea pigs were kept at 5 °C than at 20°C , and at 30 °C they detected no disease spread .
In addition , the duration of peak viral shedding at 5 °C was 40 hours longer than at 20°C .
" Our data implicate low relative humidities produced by indoor heating and cold temperatures as features of winter that favor influenza virus spread , " they concluded .
In assessing the effect of low temperatures on innate immune response , the authors found that housing animals at 5 °C did n't greatly impair their immune response when compared with that of animals housed at 20°C .
This finding runs counter to the conventional wisdom , the authors asserted .
Palese , quoted in a report yesterday from the LiveScience news Web site , said , " We 've always thought the immune system was n't as active during the winter , but that does n't really seem to be the case . "
The researchers said their findings on humidity effects raise several possibilities about influenza transmission mechanisms :
Breathing dry air could desiccate the nasal mucosa and reduce ciliary clearance of the virus — though the guinea pigs were n't exposed to dry air for very long before they became infected .
The virus could be more stable at low humidity .
At low humidity , water evaporates quickly from bioaerosols , leaving droplet nuclei that remain airborne and increase the opportunity for pathogen transmission .
Low temperatures could affect hosts in ways that contribute to the infection mechanism , the report says .
For example , cooling the nasal mucosa is thought to increase the viscosity of the mucous lining , which could reduce ciliary clearance of the virus .
Also , cooling in the nasal passages may provide a more stable environment for flu viruses .
The authors said their findings suggest that controlling indoor temperature and humidity — warmer than 68 °F and 50 % to 80 % relative humidity — might slow influenza virus transmission .
Michael T. Osterholm , PhD , MPH , director of the University of Minnesota Center for infectious Disease Research and Policy , publisher of CIDRAP News , said the seasonality of influenza outbreaks is clearly important .
However , he said other factors besides just temperature and humidity must be involved .
" Previous pandemic outbreaks were widespread in other seasons of the year , " he told CIDRAP News .
For example , he said , the spread of flu in August and September during the 1918 pandemic was especially dramatic .

Influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature .

The x86 server market has embraced virtualization in the past few years but at least one company thinks it can spin old - style server deployments in a way that keeps them price / performance competitive with modern solutions .
Rackable Systems announced its MicroSlice architecture on January 21 , claiming that its new product line " eliminates the need for costly virtualization software and sets a new standard for price performance - per-watt ...
MicroSlice eliminates the need for virtualization software through ' physicalization , ' a revolutionary , hardware - based approach to virtualization which further improves the total cost of ownership . "
That 's an awful lot of sizzle to slap on an unproven product , and the first MicroSlice systems sure do n't scream " revolutionary . "
What Rackable has " invented " is a method of putting lots of motherboards in a box : up to six mini-ITX boards ( Athlon 64 ) or three mATX boards ( Phenom ) .
You read the processor names correctly — Rackable uses Athlon 64s and Phenoms , not K8/K10 - derived Opteron parts .
Just a heads - up guys — you really ought to scratch out " Phenom " and replace it with " Phenom II " as soon as possible .
Rackable argues that these servers are a good fit for companies with a limited need for virtualization .
There 's a certain logic to that argument , especially for small businesses .
A small company with a highly parallelized or distributed workload might also benefit from Rackable 's approach ; the company does pack its 1U unit with up to twelve cores , which compares favorably to the unofficial eight core / 1U standard that both Dell and HP seem to favor .
The company claims it can build a 44U cabinet of 264 processor cores at just 72W per-server .
The company does n't come out and say it , but I will — that 's virtually guaranteed to be a K8 - based cabinet built around AMD 's low - power 45 W Athlon 64 parts .
The company does n't list any official prices , but states that " MicroSlice establishes dramatic new server price points , with many configurations starting at sub -$ 500 . "
Company president Mark Barrenechea presents the new product series as " timely in this economic climate , allowing data center budgets to go twice as far . "
The problem with Barrenechea 's statements is that it 's very hard to see where physicalization makes the jump from " useful in specific scenarios , " to " general purpose solution . "
Underneath the rhetoric , Rackable is taking desktop hardware , jamming it into a 1U case , and calling it a revolutionary advance .
The MicroSlice website claims to offer a " Quantum leap advancement in Price / Performance over standard dual socket server configurations , " without noting that sticking two Athlon 64 or Phenom CPUs on two completely different motherboards fundamentally changes the game when it comes to cross-processor communication .
I also can't help but notice that the company claims to offer " [ a ] dvanced server - class features like ECC memory and remote server management capabilities . "
If these are " advanced features , " I shudder to think what the basic features are : RAM slots vs. soldered memory ?
Replaceable CPUs ?
I 'm also skeptical of what the company refers to as " desktop - derived components . "
Ironically , the desktop - level CPUs are n't what bothers me ; in my experience , the CPU is the component least likely to fail .
I 've seen CPUs taken out by power supply failures or lightning strikes , but I 've only ever seen three chips fail while operating under normal conditions .
What does concern me , however , is just which other system components might be " desktop - derived . "
Rackable 's 1U unit can hold a maximum of 12 cores ; the company needs to publicly detail how it cools this many chips in this tight a space .
A full breakdown of parts would also be appreciated .
I trust AMD and Intel to build a desktop CPU that can withstand server - level operating environments ; I do n't necessarily feel the same way about the motherboard .
There are real reasons why people prefer Asus or Gigabyte to , say , PC Chips .
Any company that plans to build servers on desktop platforms needs to satisfy end - user concerns regarding the quality of the desktop parts they 're using .
As far as physicalization is concerned , I think Rackable is on to something insomuch as not everyone needs to go virtual .
Based on what the company has revealed so far about its product , however , I 'm unconvinced that it 's properly positioned to take advantage of that fact .
With Elvis ’ birthday coming up and all , I was inspired by the Baking Bites post on Peanut Butter Swirl Banana Bread to do some experimentation of my own .
I made the peanut butter swirl as written , although I added some chopped peanuts along with the smooth peanut butter .
The texture was … weird .
Sort of grainy , sort of sticky …
I had hopes it would even out in the cooking , but those hopes , as you ’ll see later , were disappointed .
For the banana bread , I used my favorite Banana Bread recipe , which I got from an old cookbook of recipes written by science fiction authors ( called “ Serve it Forth : Cooking with Anne McCaffrey “ ) .
It ’s Kathy Tyers ’ Four - Generation Banana Bread from the Philippines , and I ’ve found it to make a wonderfully flavorful banana bread that is moist and spiced , not bland nor dry .
The last tweak I made was to do muffins instead of a loaf .
Muffins are easier to offload onto coworkers , for one , and for another , I needed more muffin pictures . 🙂
The batter filled 12 muffin tins almost perfectly full , and I added a dollop ( about a TB , I would imagine ) of the PB mixture to the top center of each , figuring it ’d sink in a little .
I could have tried to hide it inside by pouring half full , putting the dollop , then the other half , but who has the time ?
Not me .
Here ’s how it looked :
The verdict ?
The banana bread part was , as always , fabulous .
Lovely crunchy edges on the spillover ( despite them being filled almost 100 % full , there was n’t much spillage – just enough ) , and moist , and it looks pretty enough , but the peanut - butter filling just was n’t interesting .
Sort of grainy , still , and wet .
I ’ve put them in the fridge overnight to see if they ’ll firm up and be more interesting in the morning .
Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Filling
( from Baking Bites )
4 - oz cream cheese , room temperature
1/2 cup peanut butter ( pref. crunchy )
1 large egg yolk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
Kathy Tyers ’ Four - Generation Banana Bread from the Philippines
( Adapted from Serve it Forth )
Ingredients :
1 cup walnuts , coarsely chopped
3 ripe bananas
1/2 cup milk
2 cups flour ( I used white lily )
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup oil ( I usually replace with unsweetened applesauce , but was out )
1 egg
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground cloves
Preheat oven to 350F .
Grease a 12 - cup muffin tin .
Preparation :
Mash together bananas and milk until it ’s ‘ like a milkshake ’ .
Leave some chunks if you like that in your final bread .
Mix together sugar , oil / appesauce , egg , baking powder , baking soda , salt , cinnamon , nutmeg , and cloves until well mixed .
Add liquids and flour in alternating batches , ending with flour .
This recipe tolerates thorough mixing quite well , but try not to overdo it .
Fold in the walnuts .
Fill muffin tins almost completely full .
Add to each a dollop ( about 1 TB ) of peanut - butter mixture .
Bake at 350 F for about 30 minutes , until tester in outer edges ( remember , the middle is peanut - butter ) comes out dry .
( If making an entire loaf , bake for approx .
one hour )
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - The “ nasty ” U.S. recession will tighten its grip next year as unemployment rises and weak home and stock prices imperil consumers , finance firms and debt - laden businesses , a UCLA Anderson Forecast report released on Thursday said .

Additionally , a sustained retreat in prices for goods and services is a very real possibility that would further drag on the economy , according to the forecasting unit ’s report .
“ Where only last quarter we were worried about inflation , we are now worried about its very rare opposite : deflation , ” the report said .
Falling prices would cut demand and discourage employers from hiring .
“ The record collapse in oil prices has brought with it welcome relief to motorists throughout the country and an effective tax cut of $ 440 billion in the form of a lower oil import bill , ” the closely - watched report said .
“ Nevertheless the swift fall in oil prices is now lowering the absolute level of consumer prices and bringing with it likely declines in nominal GDP over the next three quarters . ”
Where the forecasting unit in summer had projected a “ subprime ” outlook for the U.S. economy through the end of next year with growth at just above 1 percent , it now sees the economy facing a winter of discontent .
“ The news from the economy is bad , ” the report said .
“ The recession that we had previously hoped to avoid is now with us in full gale force . ”
The UCLA Anderson Forecast unit expects real GDP to shrink by 4.1 percent this quarter and by another 3.4 percent and 0.8 percent in the first and second quarters of next year , respectively , as consumer and business spending weaken and as the foreign trade that had propped up growth much of this year sags .
“ Because Europe and Japan are already in recession and China and India are suffering from a significant slowdown in growth , the export boom of the past few years will wane , ” the report said .
“ Make no mistake the global economy is in its first synchronized recession since the early 1990s . ”
By late 2009 the U.S. unemployment rate will hit 8.5 percent , compared with 6.7 percent in November , as employers shed an additional two million jobs over the next year .
The historical long - term trend of 3 percent growth will not resume until 2010 , the report said .
The administration of President - elect Barack Obama and Congress should act quickly next year to pass an economic stimulus package , said David Shulman , the report ’s author .
“ They ’re talking a lot of infrastructure , which makes a lot of sense .
They ’re talking a middle - class tax cut .
I think when Congress gets through with this they ’ll be raining money on the economy , ” Shulman said .
Police forces are using stop - and - search tactics to seize knives from youths
The Tories have demanded an apology after Downing Street admitted releasing data on knife crime in the face of objections from statisticians .
Sir Michael Scholar , head of the UK Statistics Authority , said officials pleaded with No 10 not to release " unchecked " and " selective " numbers .
The government admitted " insufficient attention " was given to the authority 's views on releasing the data .
MPs are to carry out an inquiry into the release of the data .
The government 's decision has also been criticised by senior Labour backbenchers .
The authority 's protests were over - ruled by ministers eager to show a crackdown on knife crime in England was working .
Responding to Sir Michael 's letter of complaint , Permanent Secretary at 10 Downing Street , Jeremy Heywood said " the prime minister and all his ministers , officials and advisers take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics " .
But he added : " In this case ... insufficient attention appears to have been given to the views of the NHS Information Centre statisticians on whether one specific data set included in the Tackling Knives Action Programme fact sheet was ready for publication . "
' Political manipulation '
In a press release issued on Thursday , Number 10 and the Home Office said there had been a sharp fall in the number of teenagers caught carrying knives in England and hospital admissions due to knife wounds in areas targeted by police .
They pointed to a 17 % fall in serious injuries and deaths across nine police force areas over the past six months as well as a 27 % fall in hospital admissions .
Sir Michael told the BBC that government statisticians had asked Number 10 not to publish the data until March when the knife crime campaign would have ended and it could be properly checked and published in its proper context .
Asked why Downing Street had acted against the advice of officials , he said : " The government was making a series of announcements about this issue and felt its case would be put better if it could publish these numbers . "
I hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics
Sir Michael Scholar , UK Statistics Authority Mark Easton 's blog
In full : Watchdog 's letter
The government had " breached " the code governing official statistics by publishing just " one part " of the numbers .
Tony Wright , the Labour chairman of the Commons Public Administration Committee , said his committee will carry out the inquiry .
He told the BBC's Today programme : " We are going to find out exactly what happened in this case and make sure that an edict goes out across Whitehall that it never happens again .
" We need to find out who in Number 10 and who in the Home Office thought they could do this . "
He added : " There is a new regime for the release of official statistics and this breaks the rules and it should n't have done . "
Conservative leader David Cameron said an apology was needed from Gordon Brown .
He told Sky News : " We are not going to get anywhere with a government giving us dodgy statistics and deliberately disobeying what its own Statistics Authority is saying .
" It really is an appalling way to behave .
The prime minister has got to own up to it , he 's got to apologise for it and he 's got to make sure it never happens again . "
' Accurate statistics ' Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said the government had to accept the criticism but denied the figures had been manipulated .
" The idea that there is a conspiracy behind this , I goodness wish that Whitehall was so sophisticated , I can assure you it 's not .
" But the fact of the matter is that crime by knives has fallen , an that surely is what is important . "
However Keith Vaz , Labour MP and chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee , said the early release of figures " greatly undermined " public trust in the government .
He said : " It is important that we have accurate statistics that we can rely upon in order to craft policy to resolve problems as well to gauge when legislation is working .
Public trust is greatly undermined by actions such as this . "
The BBC's Mark Easton said the episode was damaging for trust in crime figures and official statistics in general .
The figures covered the period since the Home Office launched a £ 2 m campaign in June to crack down on knife carrying in 10 " hotspots " including London , Greater Manchester and the West Midlands .

ATLANTA --
There were snickers across the state when Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue announced a major plank of his economic development strategy : a $ 19 million project to make the state the most popular fishing destination in the country .
Rolling eyes turned to open criticism when the state issued bonds between 2007 and 2008 to fund the plan .
The economy was souring , a drought was dropping lake levels to historic lows , and the governor was preparing to slash billions from other programs to cover a gaping budget shortfall .
A November editorial in the Rome News - Tribune , a northwest Georgia daily , compared Mr. Perdue 's decision to proceed with his " Go Fish " agenda amid the economic downturn to Marie Antoinette and the suggestion attributed to her that hungry French peasants eat cake .
The plan , the newspaper said , " betrays a level of stupidity , and general insensitivity . "
Unswayed , the administration recently began construction on a $ 14 million " Go Fish Georgia Center , " featuring a fish hatchery , visitor 's center , and public fishing ponds about 12 miles from Mr. Perdue 's hometown of Bonaire .
The 15,000 - square - foot building will feature interactive exhibits , including fishing simulators where visitors in a fake boat can struggle against computer - controlled fish .
Outside , a wooden path will lead visitors through simulated Georgia topography -- from mountains to piedmont to swampland -- as trout , bass and bream swim in aquariums and pools along the way .
Georgia officials claim fishing already generates $ 1 billion dollar a year and nearly 17,000 jobs in Georgia .
They note that the world record for the biggest largemouth bass ever caught -- 22 pounds , 4 ounces -- was set in 1932 on a Georgia lake .
Still , the state has never become a major center of fishing .
The two biggest pro fishing tournaments , the FLW Outdoors Forrest Wood Cup and ESPN 's Bassmaster Classic , had long snubbed Georgia .
Lucid Imagination Launches , With Support for Lucene and Solr Search

Lucid Imagination , a Massachussetts - based startup focused on support and services for open source search technologies Apache Lucene and Solr , has announced that it has officially launched .
The company was one of only a tiny handful of open source companies to obtain significant venture capital funding in the fourth quarter of last year .
The company collected $ 6 million from a $ 7.5 million Series A funding round led by Granite Ventures and Walden International .
It will focus on both developers and and organizations using Lucene and Solr .
The Lucene search library ranks amongst the top 5 Apache projects , installed at over 4,000 global companies .
Although OStatic is primarily Drupal - based , our site 's search is based on Lucene .
According to Lucid Imagination officials , the Solr search server , which transforms the Lucene search library into a ready - to - use search platform for building applications , is the fastest growing Lucene sub-project .
Based on my own personal experience with search services built into several web sites and blogs I 've written for , Lucene is a very powerful and accurate search tool .
Frequently , blogs in particular have very poor search functionality , but Lucene is a dependable free and open source alternative to expensive proprietary alternatives .
The search and discovery market is growing at 28 percent per year , with 2007 revenue of $ 1.8 billion according to market research from IDC .
Lucid 's business model is roughly comparable to Red Hat 's very successful model , in that it centers on support and services for free , open source software .
I 'm also reminded of Acquia which offers a commercially supported version of the Drupal content management system and sells service and support for it .
( Disclosure : Acquia is an OStatic sponsor . )
The company 's team includes CEO Eric Gries , previously with XACCT Software and Compuware , and CTO Marc Krellenstein , formerly with Elsevier and Northern Light Technology .
There are also technical leads who are key committers to Lucene and Solr .
" Lucene has achieved its current popularity and level of adoption because it is open source and because of the strengths of the technology , " said Doug Cutting , creator of Lucene as well as the Hadoop clustering search technology underlying Yahoo and many other sites .
" These strengths include its flexibility , out - of - the - box relevancy ranking , query performance and scalability .
Both Lucene and Solr are quite robust and ready for the enterprise , but can benefit from what a commercial company can bring to bear , including commercial - grade support and services to make the software easier to deploy and maintain . "
Lucid Imagination is offering certified distributions of Lucene and Solr , and a 30 - day " Get Started Free " offer for support and services .
It will also offer value - added tools , consulting , training , and more .
Based on our very positive experience with Lucene here at OStatic , I 'm inclined to think Lucid Imagination has a good shot at success .
As is true for Acquia , Red Hat and other companies focusing on support for open source software , evangelism and making a difference for enterprises will have to top the priority list .
It is good to see more top - flight open source projects getting commercial support , and hopefully venture funding for these types of efforts will resume an upswing .
Nanotech particles can be small enough to get inside body tissues Attitudes to nanotechnology may be determined by religious and cultural beliefs , suggest researchers writing in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
They say religious people tend to view nanotechnology in a negative light .
The researchers compared attitudes in Europe and the US and looked at religious and cultural backgrounds .
They say the findings have implications for scientists and politicians making policy decisions to regulate the use of nanotechnology .
' Religiosity '
The researchers compared attitudes to nanotechnology in 12 European countries and the US .
They then rated each country on a scale of what they called " religiosity " - a measure of how religious each country was .
They found that countries where religious belief was strong , such as Ireland and Italy , tended to be the least accepting of nanotechnology , whereas those where religion was less significant such as Belgium or the Netherlands were more accepting of the technology .
Professor Dietram Scheufele from the Department of Life Sciences Communication at the University of Wisconsin , US , who led the research , said religious belief exerted a strong influence on how people viewed nanotechnology .
" Religion provides a perceptual filter ; highly religious people look at information differently , it follows from the way religion provides guidance in people 's everyday lives , " he said .
The US was found to be the most religious country in the survey , and also the least accepting of nanotechnology .
Cultural beliefs
The researchers say it is understandable that there would be a conflict between religious belief and nanotechnology , especially when looking at what they call " nano - bio - info - cogno " ( NBIC ) technologies , the potential to create life at a nano - scale without divine intervention .
" It 's not that they 're concerned about not understanding the science , more that talking openly about constructing life raises a whole host of moral issues , " said Professor Scheufele .
Nanotechnology could be used to treat disease at a sub- cellular level " It is not a study about what religions or believers think about nanotechnology , but about the influence of religiosity on views of nanotechnology .
Indeed , what it measures as the national ' religiosity ' of different countries seems odd compared with my experience of working with several of the countries on issues of religious belief and technology , " said Dr Donald Bruce , a technology consultant .
" A second major concern is what is meant by the term ' nanotechnology ' .
It has been apparent for several years in public engagement with nanotechnologies that to ask the someone if ' nanotechnology is morally acceptable ' is largely meaningless , because ' nano ' can be as varied as the technology to which its innovations are applied . "
A similar study in the US looked at attitudes to nanotechnology and wider cultural and political beliefs .
People were asked about their views on a range of subjects , including risk from the internet , genetically modified food , nuclear power and mad cow disease .
Broadly , if they thought these were risky , they thought nanotechnology was too .
The researchers say their findings support the idea that underlying cultural beliefs have a stronger influence on opinions formed about nanotechnology than science based information about its potential and pitfalls .
Professor Scheufele says the findings have implications for policymakers trying to regulate nanotechnology .
" How do we regulate something where we have different moral ideas from the public ?
" We need to get to grips with the idea that the exact same piece of information can have a different meaning to different people ; it 's the age - old dilemma for science about what could be done versus what should be done . "

It ’s a number that lenders may consider when deciding whether or not to lend you money , but it is n’t the well - known credit score .
Meet the bankruptcy score , the credit score ’s more mysterious cousin .
How bankrupt consumers compare with bad credit consumers BANKRUPT
CONSUMER BAD CREDIT CONSUMER
Lines of credit 14.34 Lines of credit 10.42 Credit inquiries 1.78 Credit inquiries 1.41 Collection items 0.76 Collection items 1.02
Age of credit 42.14 months
Age of credit 40.61 months Credit utilization 65.99 % Credit utilization 52.71 %
New lines of credit* 3.77 New lines of credit * 2.78 * Newer than 24 months Source : “ The Science of Predicting Consumer Bankruptcy ” by David R. Kelly and Gregg A. Weldon
While the popular FICO credit score gives lenders an indication of how likely a borrower is to repay a loan , a bankruptcy score — as the name implies — suggests how likely a consumer is to file for bankruptcy .
“ Lenders are in business to extend credit to borrowers , not to refuse them credit .
Lenders use tools like bankruptcy scores to protect their ability to stay in business and continue offering credit at competitive rates , ” says Craig Watts , spokesman for FICO , which also produces bankruptcy scores .
FICO ’s website notes that its bankruptcy scores can be used in combination with FICO scores to “ sharpen ” a lender ’s risk assessment .
Bankruptcy scores remain secret
What gives the bankruptcy score its air of mystery ?
For one , bankruptcy scores , unlike credit scores , remain unavailable to the general public .
The credit industry is n’t hiding the score ’s existence .
For example , FICO ’s website says , “ Like FICO scores , Fair Isaac Bankruptcy Scores include reason codes that can be used in notifying the consumer about the factors that led to a credit decision . ”
But unlike its credit scores , which can be purchased many places , the company wo n’t tell consumers their bankruptcy scores .
Other companies that have their own versions of these scores take a similar approach .
“ Financial institutions do not normally provide bankruptcy prediction and other internal management scores to their customers , ” says Steven Wagner , president of Experian Consumer Information Services .
Still ,
Wagner says financial institutions are required to let consumers know the reason their application for credit was denied , such as due to a deficient bankruptcy score .
Meanwhile , lenders are also hesitant to discuss their use of these scores .
Banks contacted for this article were unwilling to provide much comment on the subject .
“ We use various analytics and look at a number of factors to determine credit risk .
We do not comment , however , on our proprietary modeling , ” says HSBC spokeswoman Cindy Savio .
Nevertheless , it seems clear that bankruptcy scores are used when considering credit card applications : Fair Isaac ’s website promotes its bankruptcy score as “ an effective tool for retail cards , bank cards and other revolving accounts , as well as for installment loans , telecommunications / utilities accounts and other credit portfolios . ”
Further complicating the picture is that , unlike with credit scoring , there is n’t a single , commonly used bankruptcy score .
“ There are a lot of bankruptcy scores out there , ” says Gregg Weldon , chief analytical officer with AnalyticsIQ Inc. in Atlanta .
For example , credit bureau Equifax ’s Bankruptcy Navigator Index ( BNI ) uses scores that range from 1 to 300 , with a higher score indicating a lower predicted risk .
Meanwhile , Experian and Visa offer Bankruptcy Predict , a bankruptcy score that “ uses patented technology and processes to create a more comprehensive view of consumers most likely to drive bankruptcy losses over the next 24 months , ” according to its website .
Bankruptcy Predict scores range from 50 to 950 , with a lower number indicating a higher risk of bankruptcy , Experian ’s Wagner says .
Improving your bankruptcy score Because borrowing behavior plays into the calculation of both traditional credit scores and bankruptcy scores , credit cardholders may want to take the following steps to lessen the odds a lender will view them as a bankruptcy risk :
Make on - time payments .
A rash of recent delinquencies can signal that a consumer is headed for bankruptcy .
By staying current with their credit card bills , cardholders should be able to improve their bankruptcy score .

Maintain a low credit card balance .
Consumers who go bankrupt tend to borrow up to their credit limit in order to pay for expenses .
Therefore , a cardholder ’s bankruptcy score may benefit from keeping a low utilization ratio , or the amount of credit used compared to the amount of total credit available .

Therefore , a cardholder ’s bankruptcy score may benefit from keeping a low utilization ratio , or the amount of credit used compared to the amount of total credit available .
Do n’t apply for too much credit in too short a time .
A rush to secure additional lines of credit can signal danger to potential lenders .
Consumers should therefore spread credit applications out over a longer time frame if at all possible .
All of this is proof that the bankruptcy score remains far less mature than the credit score .
“ Bankruptcy scores are where traditional risk scores were 20 years ago , ” says Weldon , who built generic and custom models for Equifax in the mid- to late - ’90s .
He says that while developments in the economy and bankruptcy law have brought about changes in the number of bankruptcy filings — nearly 2 million bankruptcy petitions , a record number , were filed in 2005 ahead of the enactment of a bankruptcy law reform — bankruptcy scores remain more “ piecemeal , ” with various private companies and credit bureaus using their own bankruptcy scoring models , Weldon explains .
Credit score versus bankruptcy score
Although they attempt to predict different outcomes , credit scores and bankruptcy scores have much in common .
“ Fair Isaac ’s bankruptcy scoring models use consumer credit reports as input , just as the FICO score does , ” says Fair Isaac ’s Watts .
Other bankruptcy scores also incorporate information from the credit bureaus .
Bankruptcy Predict , which became commercially available as a subscription service in early 2008 , uses a “ combination of credit reporting agency attributes and trending data , as well as transactional behaviors such as credit card transaction amounts , merchant category codes and cash advances , ” according to Experian ’s website .
“ By using both credit data from Experian and transaction data from Visa , a financial institution can make more informed account management decisions , including when to intervene with education or other actions that may relieve financial distress and prevent a consumer from filing bankruptcy , ” says Susan Henson , Experian ’s director of public relations .
” With greater risk information , financial institutions can better target incentives such as reduced fees and financial education for those having financial difficulties , ” Henson says .
According to Wagner , that Visa transactional data includes date and time of transactions , whether a transaction was approved or denied , merchant category codes and the transaction ’s dollar amount .
The overlaps mean certain behaviors — such as keeping balances low , making payments on time and avoiding too many applications for new credit — should benefit both types of scores .
“ When it comes to improving bankruptcy scores or any other type of credit score , consumers should follow the same golden rules … since almost all credit scores , in some fashion , measure how consumers pay their bills , the length of time they have managed credit well and the types of credit they are managing , ” Experian ’s Henson says .
Despite the common ingredients , the “ two types of models evaluate credit information differently since they are designed to predict different things , ” Fair Isaac ’s Watts says .
According to Weldon , the “ strength of those variables is different for bankruptcy models . ”
For example , the number of recently delinquent accounts ( such as during the past six months ) may be more closely watched by bankruptcy models , Weldon says .
He also says bankruptcy scores may put added weight on carrying a heavy debt burden from month to month .
In the case of people who go bankrupt , “ they are actually utilizing their credit much more than the traditional ‘ bad ' ” credit borrower , Weldon says , noting that these borrowers tend to live on their credit cards until they can no longer make payments and then file for bankruptcy .
This fact is reinforced by research conducted by Weldon and David R. Kelly showing that the typical bankrupt consumer utilizes 65.99 percent of their revolving credit , compared with the typical bad credit borrower who uses 52.71 percent .
Weldon says bankruptcy models also stress the application for new lines of credit , since borrowers who end up bankrupt typically scramble for added funds as earlier sources of money dry up .
His research shows that the typical bankrupt consumer initiates 3.77 new lines of credit in the 24 months leading up to his bankruptcy filing .
That ’s compared with 2.78 new lines of credit in a 24 - month period for the typical bad credit borrower .
When it comes to bankrupt consumers ’ credit lines , “ they ’ve maxed out all the previous ones , and they ’ve maxed out the new ones as well , ” he says .
Bob Lawless , a bankruptcy expert and University of Illinois law professor , agrees with those conclusions .
Since consumers will attempt to borrow until they can no longer do so , “ the inability to borrow further often determines the timing of their filing ” for bankruptcy , he says .
Lawless says there is no disincentive for consumers to stop borrowing as they approach a bankruptcy filing .
“ You ca n’t become more bankrupt by borrowing more , ” he says .
“ Lenders are in business to extend credit to borrowers , not to refuse them credit .
Lenders use tools like bankruptcy scores to protect their ability to stay in business and continue offering credit at competitive rates . ”
The unique traits of potentially bankrupt consumers mean the added scoring models are needed by lenders .
“ The FICO score is really good for telling you who will pay on time and who wo n’t .
But it wo n’t tell you who is going to pay on time and who is also going to go bankrupt , ” Weldon says .
Lenders pay the costs for consumer bankruptcy
Bankruptcy scores attempt to predict an outcome that costs lenders much more than a mere charge - off .
When an account gets charged off , the lender can still attempt to collect the money associated with that account , or the outstanding debt can be sold to a debt collection agency .
“ There is a lot of flexibility with what you can do with someone like that , ” says Weldon .
Not so when the borrower goes bankrupt .
In cases of bankruptcy , the consumer ’s debt becomes a legal issue .
“ Once the court gets involved , your hands are tied , ” Weldon says .
Although Weldon says bankruptcy models usually do n’t distinguish between the two main types of consumer bankruptcy , whether the borrower files for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy does matter , Lawless says , with the lender able to recover some funds under a Chapter 13 filing .
“ It seems what the lender really wants to know is how much money they are going to recover , ” he says .
Furthermore , the lender stands to lose a significant amount .
Bankruptcies tend to involve much larger amounts of money than charged - off accounts , since the borrower often runs up the maximum amount of his or her credit line before declaring bankruptcy , Weldon says .
Role of the bankruptcy score
Scoring models attempt to help lenders head off these threats .
FICO ’s scores “ are designed to predict bankruptcy far enough in advance for action to be taken , while there are still losses to be prevented , ” according to the company ’s website .
Meanwhile , Experian and Visa ’s Bankruptcy Predict enables lenders to take “ pre-emptive actions to minimize bankruptcies that erode your profits , ” according to Experian ’s website .
The product lets customers “ choose daily monitoring to take immediate action on high - risk accounts and mitigate exposure .
Utilize month - to - month management across your entire portfolio to assess where changes are occurring and apply the most appropriate strategies . ”
That means more risky borrowers get watched more closely .
The scores do not only aim to reduce losses , but to help the lender maximize profits as well .
“ Fair Isaac Bankruptcy Scores enable you to separate accounts with a high risk for large bankruptcy losses from accounts that look risky but will be highly profitable accounts , ” the website says .
Lawless sees bankruptcies rising to 1.4 million for 2009 , up from around 1.1 million last year .
If his and other expert predictions are correct , lenders will undoubtedly rely on bankruptcy scores to help chart the most profitable passage through rough economic seas .
The creators of bankruptcy scores agree .
“ In these challenging economic times , it is critical for banks to be able to discern real risks and to be able to continue to lend to those that pose less risk , ” says Experian ’s Wagner .
“ Lending needs to continue — for the good of the economy , our financial system and consumers . ”

A quick update from a knowledgeable source who works in that big building with the dome …
I do n’t think it ’ll be hard to explain why Senate Republicans had the final say : that ’s what the Constitution and Senate rules require .
How else would we have passed anything ?
I do think it ’ll be hard for Senate Republicans to explain themselves .
They were invited , repeatedly , to participate in more than a week of negotiations with a Republican White House .
They declined .
They were asked to provide an alternative bill .
They refused .
Finally , one of their members – Senator Corker of Tennessee – participated in a day - long negotiation with Senate Democrats , the UAW , and bondholders .
Everyone made major concessions .
Democrats gave up efficiency and emissions standards .
UAW accepted major benefit cuts and agreed to reduce workers ’ wages .
Bondholders signed off on a serious haircut .
But when Senator Corker took the deal back to the Republican Conference , they argued for two hours and ultimately rejected it .
Why ?
Because they wanted the federal government to forcibly reduce the wages of American workers within the next 12 months .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- UMass Dartmouth Physics Professor Gaurav Khanna and UMass Dartmouth Principal Investigator Chris Poulin have created a step - by - step guide to building a home - brewed supercomputer that can reduce the cost of university and general computing research .
Found at www.ps3cluster.org , the resource fully illustrates how to create a fully functioning and high performance supercomputer with the Sony Playstation 3 .
Last year , Khanna ’s construction of a small supercomputer using eight Sony - donated Playstation 3 gaming consoles made headlines nationwide in the scientific community .
On the consoles , he is solving complex equations designed to predict the properties of gravitational waves generated by the black holes located at the center of the galaxies .
“ Science budgets have been significantly dropping over the last decade , ” Khanna said .
“ Here ’s a way that people can do science projects less expensively .
This new web site will show people how to move forward . ”
Typically , scientists rent supercomputer time by the hour .
A single simulation can cost more than 5,000 hours at $ 1 per hour on the National Science Foundation ’s TeraGrid computing infrastructure .
“ For the same cost , you can build your own supercomputer and it works just as well if not better , ” Khanna said .
“ Plus , you can use it over and over again , indefinitely . ”
The cost for his initial Playstation grid was $ 4,000 .
The guide is freely available to the public under an open source license .
The Cluster Workshop project is partially funded by the National Science Foundation and was first announced and demonstrated at the 2nd Annual Georgia Tech , Sony / Toshiba / IBM Workshop on Software and Applications for the Cell / B.E. Processor .
“ This opens up a huge door to partnerships with industry and other universities , ” said Khanna , noting that the UMass Dartmouth College of Engineering has an interest and focus in simulation sciences .
Tyco Electronics ( through the UMass Dartmouth Advanced Technology and Manufacturing Center in Fall River ) , Sony , Terra Soft Solutions and IBM are among the companies already involved with this effort .
The scientists are seeking input from industry members and researchers to determine future project direction .
“ We hope to continue to bring supercomputing to a broader audience by providing tools that simplify the use of these systems , ” said Poulin , who specializes in distributed pattern recognition and artificial intelligence .

Since no computer Operating System in existence provides us with the direct information and computational utility needed to bring us the wisdom of how to become more virtuous human beings , Socrates would not have an automatic favorite OS .
However , there is a set of computer operating systems that are created in the kind of cooperative , non-profit , community spirit that Socrates would have appreciated and recognized .
Socrates engaged in the same type of cooperative effort during his own philosophical search for truth .
FOSS , or Free Open Source Software , is created in an open community of developers who desire to positively impact the public good by donating their time and knowledge to create free and very useful software .
This built - in sense of good citizenship would have impressed Socrates .
The civic - minded Free Open Source Software Community serves and enhances the public good by using the power of non-corporate , public cooperative efforts to produce quality software that can be distributed , used and modified at no cost .
Just as Socrates believed that all ideas and forms of reasoning should be laid out in the open for the free examination of all , the Free Open Source Software community makes all of its ' source code available to the public .
The Free Open Source Software community values the public discussion and scrutiny of technical issues pertaining to source code , opposes the intrusion of commercial interests resulting in proprietary source code and advocates that all persons have complete freedom to use , examine and modify existing FOSS code for their own purposes .
Socrates , who focused more generally on ideas than on source code , also believed in the free and public discussion of ideas .
He also objected to the impositions of commercial interests in which sophists would sell their proprietary knowledge at exorbitant prices .
Socrates was also an advocate of people freely using and modifying ideas to serve their own lives .
This kind of free experimentation with public ideas characterized Socrates ' own life .
Socrates could have made a lot of money for his teaching services if he ran it exclusively as a for - profit business .
He was popular with many of the educated elite of his time and had a wealthy and ready clientele that would have paid him very well .
However , he chose instead to give away most of his services for free to whomever was willing to answer questions .
He considered this type of free participation in the public creation , examination and modification of ideas to be his duty as a citizen of a democracy .
I have no doubt that the historical Socrates , after being struck completely spellbound for two days at the very idea of thinking machines , would have wholeheartedly endorsed FOSS .
Free Open Source Software is created in the same kind of open community spirit that Socrates knew to be at the heart of all good citizenship .
Both FOSS and the Socratic Method run on the same spirit of community and service to the public good .
The Socratic Method as practiced by Socrates , except for the total lack of computer hardware and source code , was actually a good example of an Open Source community .
If ideas can be seen for a moment as the software of the human mind , all ideas were discussed and developed in the open .
Nobody in the community was forbidden to make a contribution .
Nor was anyone allowed to claim a priority stake in a new idea for the sake of profiting materially .
This practice of free and open philosophical inquiry was conducted by Socrates in the context of a full Athenian democracy ( as opposed to the political structure of a partially democratic republic such as in the U.S. ) .
In a full democracy , every citizen is required to make a contribution to the development , maintenance and running of their government .
For the citizen of a democracy , to fail to take part in the governance of your country is to fail to be a good citizen .
Modern FOSS communities , with their open and participatory structure , may be the closest thing to full democracy in the west .
Socrates would have recognized FOSS as being created within the same cooperative structures and community spirit with which he conducted his own lifestyle of philosophical inquiry .
During our current economic downturn , it is good to know that computer users do not have to pay for new software or pay to upgrade existing software .
With Free Open Source Software , not only can you save yourself a lot of money , but you can participate in community projects that have more of the spirit of good citizenship built into them than all of the for - profit software in the world combined .
Recommended FOSS Operating System * :
For the average user , the best choice to try a FOSS operating system is likely to be a version of Linux called Ubuntu .
Ubuntu is FOSS and comes with other Free Open Source Software for office work , photo manipulation , email , internet and more .
Ubuntu is one of the easiest versions of Linux to install and use .
You can try Ubuntu without touching anything on your current operating system by downloading the live CD file , burning the file to a CD and running Ubuntu off the CD .
Download Live CD
When you put the CD in you will get a boot menu .
To use the live CD option choose , " Try Ubuntu without change to your computer . "
The live CD also has installation options if you decide to switch from windows .
Perhaps the safest and most user friendly option to actually install Ubuntu on your hard drive is through WUBI .
WUBI installs Ubuntu into a Windows folder as if it were merely an application and allows Windows to remain on your system .
The result is that you can boot into either operating system .
This is a good way to try Ubuntu beyond the live CD experience .
For the love of Wisdom , always backup all of your data before attempting to install an OS !!!
Good Reasons to try Ubuntu Linux :
1. Its Free and all upgrades are free !
It also comes with lots of other free software !
2 . It runs excellently on older computers .
You can resurrect an old computer with a new OS and it can actually run better than when it was new !
This also means you can get more mileage off your current machine without worrying about it getting clobbered by the next resource devouring and financially costly release of Windows .
You can also buy much cheaper new machines and run them with an OS that actually works very well on lower spec machines !
( as opposed to Vista just claiming it works on low specs )
In some cases , an older machine running Ubuntu will outperform a new machine running Windows Vista !
3 . Faster , more secure and more stable than Windows .
Runs better and is MUCH less prone to viruses .
4 . It is easy to install , learn and use !
5 . Socrates loves Free Open Source Software !
Bad Reasons to Just Stay with Windows : 1 . Ubuntu is a funny name .
2 . I do not wish to learn anything new .
( Socrates disapproves of this ! )
3 . Open source is hacker stuff .
I do not want to do anything illegal .
( Such ideas are just false .
Open Source Software is not only perfectly legal , but demonstrates the very best public citizenship of any software development model in existence . )
4 . I do not use my computer for much , just checking email , surfing the web and a few letters .
( You are exactly the kind of person for whom Linux based operating systems work very well , once it is installed properly . )
5 . I do not want to do any work to test a good idea .
( Socrates frowns on this ! )
Other Free Open Source Software
If you are keeping your current operating system , then there are other Free Open Source Software packages that run on your OS !
Below is a list of software programs with their Free Open Source Software equivalent .
Proprietary Software Free Open Source Software
Microsoft Office Open Office ( Win , Mac , Linux ) Photoshop Gimp ( Win , Mac , Linux ) Maya and other 3D animation software Blender - I first looked at Blender back in 2004 , when I was running a small animation studio I set up .
It took me 10 minutes to realize it was no good for my purposes .
I was using Maya and Blender simply did not compare in any way .
That has all changed dramatically .
Blender is one of the most extraordinary open source software packages out there .
I recently opted to not renew my Maya license and switch to Blender .
Adobe Acrobat PDFCreator ( Win ) Programming tools : Notepad ++ - ( Win ) is a source code editor that can syntactically highlight the code from various programming and scripting languages .

The boss of a winter blunderland faces prosecution after a record 5,000 complaints and told The Argus : " I do n't care . "
Victor Mears and his son
Henry could be taken to court by trading standards after customers branded the Lapland New Forest park a shambles .
People paid up to £ 30 a ticket but instead of the snow - covered winter wonderland they discovered a muddy field , a broken ice rink , squabbling elves and a Santa who would frequently light up a ciggie .
Trading standards last night revealed it wants to take legal action against Brighton - based Lapland New Forest Ltd after describing it as an unmitigated disaster .
Yesterday , The Argus again approached Victor Mears , the company director , at his home in Selsfield Drive , Brighton .
When The Argus asked for a comment on the investigation , the 65 - year - old shouted through his front door : " Go away you scum bag .
I do n't care . "
Sales of about 50,000 tickets are believed to have netted Mr Mears company up to £ 2 million .
Last night , Dorset County Council 's trading standards manager Ivan Hancock said : " It attracted a record number of calls for any consumer issue .
" We are investigating both the company and also individuals involved .
" The investigation is progressing well and we have made it a priority .
" We want to take legal action and are taking advice from a specialist consumer barrister and the Office of Fair Trading . "
Reid : ' Serious concerns ' over Lieberman 's future Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Republican leader reaches out to former Dem Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) was still a member of the Democratic caucus and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee as of Thursday afternoon ; it remains unclear how long that will continue to be the case .
The Senate 's top Republican is working to convince Lieberman , who backed John McCain 's presidential bid , to join the GOP converence , Politico reports Friday .
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly approached Lieberman , but he is unable to offer to Connecticut senator any high profile committee spots .
A Lieberman aide tells Politico the Senator wants to remain in the Democratic caucus as long as he is not stripped of his Homeland Security Committee chairmanship .
Lieberman and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid met to discuss the senator 's future after a bruising presidential campaign during which Lieberman was a top surrogate for McCain , delivering plenty of sharp attacks aimed at Barack Obama .
" Today Senator Lieberman and I had the first of what I expect to be several conversations .
No decisions have been made , " Reid said in a statement e-mailed to reporters after their meeting .
" While I understand that Senator Lieberman has voted with Democrats a majority of the time , his comments and actions have raised serious concerns among many in our caucus .
I expect there to be additional discussions in the days to come , and Senator Lieberman and I will speak to our caucus in two weeks to discuss further steps . "
For his part , Lieberman described the meeting as a " very good conversation ... between friends " and said he would take several days to consider his options .
He said he viewed his Senate decisions " not through a partisan lens " but based on what he thought would be best .
" We have just finished an historic election .
As you know , I decided in that election that partisanship should take a backseat to doing what in this case I believed was best for our country , " he told reporters following the meeting .
" But the election is over , and I completely agree with President - elect Obama that we must now unite to get our economy going again and to keep the American people safe .
That is exactly what I intend to do with my colleagues here in the Senate in support of our new president , and those are the standards I will use in considering the options that I have before me . "
Long story short , little new information about Lieberman 's future emerged Thursday .
After losing in Connecticut 's Democratic primary in 2006 , Lieberman was re-elected as an independent .
He split with his former party over the war in Iraq and remains a strong supporter of President Bush 's neoconservative foreign policy and draconian national security measures .
However , Lieberman continues to vote with Democrats on issues like abortion , education and tax policies , so the party allowed him to continue as a member of the caucus and retain his Homeland Security Committee chairmanship .
After the 2006 election , Lieberman 's continued participation in the Democratic caucus was necessary for the party to hold its Senate majority .
After picking up at least six more seats Tuesday , the Democrats no longer need Lieberman to hold on to control .
Over the summer , Lieberman stopped attending weekly Democratic caucus lunches as he stepped up his attacks on Obama .
Lieberman spoke at the Republican National Convention this year .
If Lieberman loses his Homeland Security chairmanship , the position would likely go to Hawaii's Daniel Akaka , the committee 's third ranking Democrat .
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) has more seniority on the committee than Akaka , but he already chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee .

BBC News , Gaza City
Only party stalwarts turned out for a victory rally Standing on a newly formed hillside of rubble in the destroyed Jabaliya refugee camp , five young men all claim to be resistance fighters .
" All of Gaza are mujahideen , " they said .
But when asked which of them had actually fired a gun in the three week - long battle with Israel , none gave a convincing answer .
And as armed Hamas policemen return to Gaza 's street - corners and traffic - lights , many in Gaza are wondering where they were when it came to fighting the Israeli Army .
Hamas still has enough power and influence here that few will criticise the Islamist movement openly .
But when Hamas called for a rally to celebrate what it has been calling a historic victory over the Israelis , the citizens of Gaza voted with their feet - they stayed at home .
In the past Hamas could easily call tens of thousands into the streets , but this time only party stalwarts could look around the devastation and believe this could be victory .
" I think the resistance is strong , " said Beithar Ajar , 26 , who described himself as a Hamas legal adviser .
" I think the Israeli army is very weak .
Very weak . "
Sober appraisal A truck with loudspeakers made a turn around Palestine Square in central Gaza city , playing Hamas battle songs .
A barker standing on the back shouted insults to Israel 's government on a microphone .
But relatively few green flags unfurled in the crowd .
CONFLICT IN FIGURES
More than 1,300 Palestinians killed Thirteen Israelis killed More than 4,000 buildings destroyed in Gaza , more than 20,000 severely damaged 50,000 Gazans homeless and 400,000 without running water
Hamas leader hails ' Gaza victory '
In depth : Gaza conflict Q&A : Gaza conflict Who are Hamas ?
The march ended in front of the concrete skeleton of the Palestinian Legislative Council building - pulverised by Israeli bombs during the first days of the air assault .
" It 's not a problem for us , " said Ajar , as a loudspeaker played recordings of machine guns and explosions dubbed over a fiery speech .
" We will overcome the Israeli Army this time and every time in the future , " he said .
Hamas supporters claim that many more Israelis died in the three weeks of the war than Israel 's official count of only 13 dead .
Likewise they believe the official Hamas announcement that Israel killed only 48 fighters among over 1,300 dead in Gaza .
But that raises another question : if so few Hamas fighters died , were they really out there fighting ?
A man settling in to sleep next to the remnants of his home gave a more sober appraisal .
Yusef , a farmer from Jabaliya , was burning old kitchen cupboards to keep himself warm , as nightfall brought the winter 's cold .
Israeli bombs destroyed his house , he said , but they were not the only ones to blame .
" I blame Israel and Hamas both , " he said .
" I just want to live . "

In order to end the tribal war that has been lasting for over 20 years , the angered women of a Highland region in Papua New Guinea decided to kill their male newborns .
During a period of peace , which lasted for three days in the capital of Eastern Highlands , Goroka , two women told the Papua New Guinea National newspaper about killing their male babies .
Both Rona Luke and Kipiyona Belas , representing the warring tribes , believe that male infanticide lowers the pay back violence that repeatedly takes place during tribal struggle in Highlands .
Women in the region say that if they stop giving birth to males , the tribe 's stock would fall , forcing men to stop the war .
" All the women folk agreed to have all babies born killed because they have had enough of men engaging in tribal conflicts and bringing misery to them , " said one of the women .
None of the women could give a clear answer on the number of killed male babies .
According to Belas , it is very difficult to get food due to the fact that men are always engaged in the fight , while women and their children are left unprotected and have to somehow defend themselves , reports Stuff.co.nz .
Different tribes receive help from the Salvation Army , whose goal is to bring peace in the region .
The Salvation Army outlined that women in the warring tribes are so frustrated with the fights that they started taking extreme steps to stop them .
" This situation shows the extreme frustration the women have with the men in these areas , " a spokesman said .
Give a listen to this fascinating interview on WTOP with a writer and blogger for which I have tremendous respect – Deborah Kotz , a Senior Editor at US News & World Report .
Kotz is interviewed on the recent passage of the " HHS rules " that allow for providers or any staff members at a health care institution receiving any kinds of federal funds to refuse to provide or participate in the provision of services which they find " objectionable . "
Kotz says " at first blush it seems like a well - intentioned rule " but then does justice to the underlying issue here – that with this rule , women may very well be left in the dark as to just which legal , safe , medical options their providers do or do not have objections to , leaving female patients at a disadvantage .
As Kotz says in the interview ,
" This is definitely a rule that has a lot of people outraged really .
Medical organizations like the AMA … say this will hurt patients … especially women patients … What these groups have pointed out is that the rules already exist that protect doctors from providing services they object to .
Bush ’s OMB [ editor ’s note : Office of Management and Budget ] already says this rule would put an undue burden on hospitals and that the rules are duplicative …
There is concern out there that …especially in terms of what a doctor has to disclose – there ’s really nothing in the law that says that a doctor must tell a patient , ‘ Hey , you know what , I really do n’t believe in birth control , I ’m not going to give you a prescription however there are other doctors who will … ’ "
Kotz goes on to state that she asked HHS whether the onus should n’t be on doctors to put forth their objections to their patients so that female patients know which services they will or wo n’t provide and " at least allow the patient to go elsewhere . "

Abortion .
Parenthood .

It ’s unclear whether the interviewer really understands what an injustice this truly is for women .
In response he says , " For better or worse , I think this is something a lot of women have had to get used to – they ’ve had to ask what kinds of services will you provide to me ? "
For better or worse ?
I ’m going to go with " worse " here .
How will this regulation play it in real - life circumstances ?
Kotz presents a hypothetical situation .
A woman who is raped and is attended to by a physician or nurse who " does not believe in " using emergency contraception ( EC ) is under absolutely no obligation to tell the woman a ) that EC is an effective way to prevent pregnancy after unintended or unwanted sexual intercourse or b ) that he or she will not provide EC but will refer the patient to another provider or pharmacy that will provide the EC for her .
This is not just an " onus " , it seems like out and out malpractice to me .
If a male patient is assaulted and in need of a particular kind of health service and a physician does not provide , mention or refer for that service even if it could help improve his health outcome , would n’t it be incumbent upon the provider to do so ?
Clearly it ’s more commonly thought of as an " inconvenience " for women – we just need to somehow know or make sure we find out which of our providers will impose their own moral judgements on our health and lives and which wo n’t .
Kotz ends on a powerful note by stating that a doctor truly should have
an obligation to inform female patients of his or her moral objections
and ensure that women are referred elsewhere if need be .
We ’ve covered this rule extensively and will continue to do so over the coming days and weeks .
This rule will certainly be challenged either Congressionally or via the rule - making process once President Elect Obama is sworn into office .
Canada ’s “ putsch ” : Oppose Conservative power - grab !
No support to Liberal - NDP coalition !
By Keith Jones
4 December 2008
The World Socialist Web Site urges readers and supporters to download this article as a PDF - format leaflet and distribute it broadly .
Canada 's right - wing , minority Conservative government is preparing to cling to power illegally .
Led by the neo-conservative ideologue Stephen Harper , the Conservatives are threatening to unleash a constitutional crisis and incite anti-Quebec chauvinism rather than allow the parliamentary opposition parties to form an alternate government .
" We will use all legal means to resist this undemocratic seizure of power , " declared Harper on Monday , after the opposition parties — the Liberals , New Democratic Party ( NDP ) , and Bloc Québécois ( BQ ) — announced an accord to form a Liberal - NDP coalition government supported by the BQ .
The Conservatives , who won the votes of barely one in five Canadians in the federal election held October 14 , are accusing the opposition parties of attempting a " putsch " and thwarting the will of the electorate .
This is reactionary rot .
It is the Conservatives who are acting undemocratically , and in manifold ways .
• Under Canada 's parliamentary system , the opposition parties have every right to form an alternate government , since they won a majority of the seats in the House of Commons in a general election held just seven weeks ago .
If one includes the votes of the Green Party , which announced Tuesday that it too backs the Liberal - NDP coalition , 61.2 percent of voters cast their ballots October 14 for parties supportive of the coalition .
• So as to avoid defeat in a parliamentary non-confidence vote scheduled for next Monday , the Conservatives are reportedly preparing to prorogue or shut down parliament , which reconvened only on November 17 , until late January ,
• The Conservatives have announced that should they lose a non-confidence vote , Harper will " advise " the Governor - General to dissolve parliament .
In effect , the Conservatives are demanding that Canada 's unelected head of state deprive the opposition of its constitutional right to form a government .
And should Governor - General MichaëlleJean not capitulate to their anti-democratic demand , the Conservatives are threatening to unleash a wider political and constitutional crisis by attacking the democratic legitimacy of the Liberal - NDP coalition .
• With the support of much of the corporate media , the Conservatives have launched an aggressive drive to mobilize reactionary forces , denouncing the Liberals for aligning with " socialists " and " separatists , " references respectively to the NDP and BQ , against " Canada 's government . "
To oppose the coming to power of a " socialist - separatist driven coalition , " the Conservatives have called " Rallies for Canada " in the country 's major cities this coming Saturday .
Their not so veiled purpose is to intimidate the Governor - General .
In the last parliament the Conservatives repeatedly depended on the votes of the BQ to remain in office .
Yet , in a transparent attempt to whip up anti-Quebec chauvinism , especially in western Canada , the Conservatives are implying that the proposed coalition government is all but treasonous , because it would put Canada 's government " at the mercy of people committed to destroying our confederation . "
• Whatever Governor - General Jean ultimately decides , the very fact that the Conservatives are intent on making her demonstrably choose Canada 's government has the effect of giving greater legitimacy to , and expanding the power , of this reactionary office .
Under Canada 's constitutional monarchy , the monarch 's representative , the Governor - General , is almost always legally required to follow the " advice " of the Prime Minister — the head of the party or multi-party alliance with majority support in parliament — but wields , although this is not generally known , virtually unlimited " reserve " powers .
Through this archaic mechanism , the Canadian ruling class has given itself a means of short - circuiting parliamentary democracy in a period of acute crisis .
Any use by the Governor - General of these powers establishes a reactionary precedent that can and will be invoked against working people in future political crises .
• The current crisis was precipitated by the fiscal and economic update the government tabled in parliament last Thursday .
The update was chock full of right - wing and flagrantly anti-democratic measures .
These included the abolition of a $ 1.95 per vote , annual subsidy to federal political parties — an action universally condemned in the corporate media as a brazen Conservative attempt to cripple the opposition by bankrupting them .
The Conservatives also suspended the collective bargaining rights of federal workers , removing their right to strike until 2011 .
Last but not least , under conditions of a financial crisis and world recession that threaten working peoples ' jobs and pensions , the Conservatives spurned calls for increased support to the unemployed and expanded public works initiatives , choosing instead to slash public spending .
If a putsch is afoot in Ottawa , it is manifestly a right - wing putsch being carried out by Harper and his Conservatives .
In opposing the Conservatives ' unconstitutional and anti-democratic attempt to retain power , working people must give no political support to the proposed Liberal - NDP coalition government .
The Liberals are the Canadian bourgeoisie 's traditional party of government .
They have repeatedly used their opponents on the right as electoral foils , then in office imposed the policy prescriptions of the right , be it Trudeau 's three - year wage controls in the 1970s or the massive public spending and tax cuts imposed by the Chrétien - Martin Liberal government of 1993 - 2006 .
Canada 's social - democratic party , the NDP , is a no less dependable prop of capitalist rule .
When it has formed provincial governments , most notably in Ontario during the recession of the early 1990s , the NDP has come into headlong conflict with the working class , including slashing social spending , promoting " workfare , " and breaking strikes and otherwise attacking workers ' rights .
The BQ's sister party is the Parti Québécois .
When the PQ last held office as Quebec 's provincial government ( 1994 - 2003 ) , it carried out a program of social spending and tax cuts strikingly similar to that of its federalist Liberal rivals in Ottawa — a program designed to redistribute wealth from working people to the most privileged sections of society .
None of the three opposition parties have questioned , let alone opposed , the Harper government 's commitment , without any public discussion , of tens of billions of dollars to prop up Canada 's big banks .
Few details of the coalition agreement have been made public .
But it is known that the Liberal - NDP government will not " revisit " the Afghanistan issue , i.e. , that the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to play a leading role in the Afghan counterinsurgency war through 2011 .
Also , the Liberal - NDP government will implement the Conservatives ' five - year , $ 50 billion - plus program of corporate tax cuts .
As for the promised massive economic stimulus package , it will be welcomed , no doubt , by the big manufacturers and politically promoted as a program to " save jobs . "
But Ontario's Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty has let it be known that any federal - provincial assistance to the automakers will be used as a means to extort sweeping new contract concessions from autoworkers .
The Canadian Auto Workers union , a strong ally of McGuinty and an early advocate of a federal NDP - Liberal coalition , has already announced its willingness to make further changes in workrules , that is , to impose speed - up and job cuts .
To repeat , the working class must oppose the Conservatives ' power - grab .
The attempt of one of the major parties of the Canadian ruling elite , with considerable and quite likely preponderant big business support , to overturn long - established parliamentary and constitutional forms is a frontal attack on democratic rights .
But in opposing the Conservative 's illegal attempt to block the opposition from forming a government , working people should extend no political support to the opposition parties or their alternate government .
Rather the struggle to defend democratic rights and workers ' jobs and living standards and against imperialist war is entirely dependent on the development of an independent political movement of the working class in opposition to the entire bourgeois order .
In this respect , there are important parallels with the political and constitutional crisis that erupted in the United States over the outcome of the 2000 president elections .
It was incumbent upon socialists to vigorously oppose the attempt of the Republican right , supported by the most powerful and rapacious sections of the US plutocracy , to steal the election on behalf of George W. Bush ; but this opposition in no way implied any political support to the Democrat Al Gore .
Ultimately Gore and the Democrats capitulated to the right , allowing Bush to assume the presidency unopposed after the right - wing majority on the US Supreme Court , in flagrant violation of the law and the democratic will of the American people , declared him president .
The Socialist Equality Party will be intervening broadly in the working class in the coming days — including in the Canadian Labour Congress - sponsored " Make Parliament Work ! Coalition Yes ! " rallies — to mobilize opposition to the Conservatives ' anti-democratic power grab and politically prepare the struggle against the alternate big business government being organized by the Liberals , NDP , and BQ with the support of the trade union bureaucracy .
Chiang says his office must continue education and debt payments but will defer money for tax refunds , student aid , social services and mental health programs .
A severe drop in revenue has left the state 's main bank account depleted .
The state had been relying on borrowing from special funds and Wall Street investors ; those options are no longer available .
In past years , Wall Street accounted for as much as 12 percent of city tax revenue , the comptroller said .
This year , most financial firms reported losses that the mayor has said they may carry forward , allowing them to avoid paying city tax for several years .
By the comptroller ’s estimate , city taxes from Wall Street - related activities could drop by $ 2 billion , or more than 40 percent , over two fiscal years .
I have been reading about how California is going bust and New York is having revenue probems and one thing leaps out .
How much the so - called " greedy Wall Street bastards " and their investors were subsidizing these places .
For example , in this tidbit linked on Drudge about Ca. needing to defer tax refunds , we find :
So , next time your liberal friends start dissing those " greedy Wall Street guys " -- just remind them that they are now in short supply and guess what ?
They were the ones paying for many of those social , mental health and other programs that you loved so much .
Now it 's somebody else 's turn to pay .
Maybe even yours .
Now Palin ’s headlining ( literally or figuratively , I ’m not sure ) the Republicans Governors Association conference .
Late Intervention Update : TPM Reader DH begs to differ : “ I beg to differ about getting Palin off the center - stage of Republican leadership .
The more she solidifies her status in the GOP , the harder it will be for them to move the party towards a pragmatic , centrist image that attracts independent voters in congressional and presidential elections .
The GOP is already defaulting to her .
That ’s good for Democratic candidates .
‘ Palin 2012 ! ' ”
I quite agree from a partisan perspective .
The more Palin the better .
But I think we also need to think about this from the broader perspective of national dignity .
And simple human decency .
You ’re at a party and someone ’s drinking too much and starting to do embarrassing things .
Even if you do n’t like them , and even if the unlovely part of you thinks it ’s kind of funny , still someone should step in .
On the other hand , if Rush and Sean , are up for it , maybe we just tap another keg ?
The government has changed its policy on publishing MPs ' expenses Receipts for MPs ' expenses dating back to 2004 will be published in accordance with Freedom of Information laws .
Commons leader Harriet Harman said the data would be released once it had been processed by the Commons authorities .
Ms Harman would not guarantee a similar policy in the future amid concerns ministers may revisit plans to exempt expenses details from FOI requests .
The Tories said the issue was still unresolved while the Lib Dems said failure to be more open was " tragic " .
On Wednesday the government abandoned plans for a vote on exempting details of MPs ' expenses from FOI requests after opposition parties refused to back the move .
Compliance Ms Harman said all expenses information requested in the past four years would be published in full , at a cost of about £ 2 m , but did not make clear when this would happen .
The tragedy is that those who did n't want to disclose anything have had to end up disclosing everything because they could n't see the way the wind was blowing
David Heath , Lib Dems Commons spokesman
Q&A : MP expenses row These outstanding FOI requests cover about 1.3 million receipts for MPs ' spending on second homes , travel and office costs .
The High Court ruled last year that details of claims made under the £ 24,000 - a- year second homes allowance , including receipts , should be published in the interests of transparency .
But Ms Harman said proposed changes to how expenses would be audited in future , including independent scrutiny , may change the " legal position " regarding disclosure .
" There is both the legal decision , but there is ( also ) the public policy decision of whether or not , having published receipts once , it is sensible to go back on publishing them and not publish them in the same way in the future , " she added .
The Conservatives said the issue of full disclosure under FOI was " still hanging " .
" My view is that we should still be subject to Freedom of Information , " said shadow commons leader Alan Duncan .
Wind blowing MPs should observe the " highest standards " of transparency , he said , but there should be some safeguards in place .
" We do n't just want , by making everything available , to allow ourselves to be subject to open season of malicious and vexatious attacks , " he added .
The Lib Dems said Parliament should have responded to public pressure for more openness many years before .
" The tragedy is that those who did n't want to disclose anything have had to end up disclosing everything because they could n't see the way the wind was blowing , " said Lib Dem commons spokesman David Heath .
MPs approved without a vote moves to increase the scrutiny of their expenses and the rules under which they are declared .
The proposals will give the National Audit Office new powers to scrutinise expenses while claims would be broken down into 26 categories rather than the current 14 .
Information about telephone and energy bills , as well as mortgage and rental payments on second homes , will be published for the first time .
Cost concerns Freedom of information campaigners have insisted that all receipts for individual claims must be published to maintain public confidence in Parliament and to uphold standards .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Some MPs are clearly desperate to prevent the release of past expenses claims which are likely to have exceeded what could reasonably be justified to the public , " said Maurice Frankel , from the Campaign for Freedom of Information .
The Scottish Parliament already publishes details of its members ' claims , including receipts , on the internet .
But UK ministers have expressed concerns about the cost of doing this .
MP 's expenses have been the subject of controversy since it emerged last year that Conservative MP Derek Conway had paid his son , a student , more than £ 40,000 to act as a researcher when an inquiry found he had done no work .

The Best
Five Dollar Footlongs
What ’s not to like ?
$ 5 footlongs save cash , leave buyers with two healthy meals , and have an immensely catchy jingle .
The most ingenious part of this campaign is that the developers sat down and thought something like , you know , we ’ve got a lot of numerical and corporal dimensions to this idea .
First , people have five fingers , so we should use that .
Second , 12 inches is a foot , so there ’s another limb connection .
The result was the iconic movement that began with the display of five fingers and ended with two hands estimating the length of a foot .
It was an oddly elegant gesture , like a tai chi move or something , the perfect kinetic compliment for the jingle .
Then someone threw Godzilla and meteorologists into the mix , and it was poetry .
Sprint Product Placement
“ You know what your problem is .
You want everything .
You want a husband , you want unlimited text , unlimited data , and unlimited calls , ” a curly - haired girl explains to her friend at an outdoor lunch .
Cue the cheesy Michelle Branch - ish song , the emotional low - register voice - over , and Sprint made one of the cleverest ads of the year .
Sprint is probably just as guilty of sticking phones in a celluloid hero ’s hands as anyone else , but in these ads the product placement is inverted .
The writing is clever , the editing is faultless , and best of all , the ad parodies the fussy and greedy way that women are portrayed in films ( see Bride Wars ) .
The phone ’s not bad either .
Free Credit Report ( .com )
A lot of people get annoyed at the shaggy - haired , stoner - ish twentysomething guy who sings , “ Too bad I did n’t know my credit was whack / now I ’m driving off the lot in a used sub - compact , ” but no one could forget him .
He looks sort of like Rob Thomas , but better , and his collection of stories that flow to the same tune are more interesting than a Matchbox 20 album anyway .
But there ’s also an element of ( probably accidental ) logistics that makes this ad campaign even more striking : a free credit website theoretically should not have enough money to afford such persistent advertising .
Some crappy credit website is n’t Best Buy or Comcast or an airspace - dominating enterprise .
That inexplicable element makes it seem like the ads are actually an autonomous venture fueled by the star himself , and that makes his regret about not knowing his credit seem even more sincere .
But do n’t be fooled , once the site gets your credit card number , it starts charging a monthly fee .
Whopper Virgins
After years of being trumped by the red and yellow flag wielding , globalizing McDonald ’s , Burger King is back .
Shaking off the creepy plastic - king campaign , their new venture is into the geographic realms that McDonald ’s has not yet conquered .
In the ad , they set out to have an unbiased taste test by flying boxes of burger ingredients into remote test sites to see which enterprise makes the best burger for popping that Whopper - shaped cherry .
Sending burger missionaries out into the world is n’t going to help anyone , but the ads ( and the online documentary ) do manage to capture an interesting space between the Western - acquainted parts of the world and the rest , and it ’s clear that the exact line is getting foggier , one burger at a time .
Many of the burger virgins did n’t even choose the Whopper , but at least this ad accomplished the goal of getting people talking .
Volkswagen Routan Boom
This ad confused the hell out of everyone .
Why is Brooke Shields making a pretend public service announcement about women being overeager to have babies in order to sell some kind of flashy caravan ?
But that confusion , like the Whopper Virgin campaign , got people talking .
No one will ever know the exact goals of the ad , but here are a couple guesses :
1. Dissociate German car engineering with the Holocaust by associating it with an excess of fertility .
2. Mock public service announcements
3. Remind people of the incest scene in The Blue Lagoon .
Better than using cheesy psychedelic graphics to rope in nostalgic baby boomers .
The Worst
AT&T
AT&T ’s latest ad campaign features users of non-AT&T services expressing their regret by visiting themselves at a former moment of phone - related crisis .
A guy watches his chump self playing pool and laments how he is at that moment missing a call about concert tickets .
Another man views himself getting arrested because he had missed a call about a security system .
The problem with these ads is that they break one of the most elementary rules of propaganda : customers are to be flattered .
These ads are targeting non-AT&T customers by insulting their intelligence for not already having AT&T .
The regretful individuals even say “ [ he ’s / she ’s ] an idiot and does n’t have AT&T . ”
Ouch .
Glade
Or “ Glahh - day ” as the incompetent housewife of the Glade commercials likes to call it .
In all the ads , she ’s trying to impress her elite suburbanite buddies and failing .
Her gingerbread cookies are old , and her candles are cheap ones that she probably got in the Windex isle of the grocery store .
Maybe Glade is trying to create some form of identification between women sitting around watching TV all day and this dopey character by elaborating on moments where they feel unimpressive .
But trying to promote a product by portraying its ability to act as a symbol of a person ’s general underwhelming - ness is just stupid .
Plus , the whole neurotic housewife stereotype has long gone out of style .
Hom Furniture
Those who are fortunate enough not to live in the Midwest may not have been exposed to these ads , and because of that , they are even luckier .
In the 2008 ads , it appears as if Hom has been studying the cinematic techniques of “ food porn . ”
Unnatural camera angles , zooming in on parts of a whole and then zooming back out , most Food Network shows know how to make pesto in a food processor look pretty damn sexy .
But that feeling just does n't translate when Hom ’s advertisers try to do it with couches .
Most of the spots feature a piece of furniture sitting against a boring background , while a camera pokes toward it and back over and over .
Watching this process feels uncomfortable , and it ’s even worse due to the terrible jingle they settled on , which goes , “ Gotta … get a …. mega - big deal ! ”
There ’s no douchier phrase than “ mega - big , ” and nothing less sexy than a plushy couch .
Windows Mojave
This campaign is despicable for two reasons :
1 . It ruined a festive , jingly carnival song by the Ruby Suns .
2 . It makes the test - subjects looks stupid .
The creators traveled all over , making random people try the “ new Windows Mojave ” and then tell them what they liked about it .
Being polite , most people came up with a feature or two .
But the joke ’s on them ; turns out that it 's the old Windows , it ’s just so innovative in itself that it seems new — or so they claim .
After being told they ’d been duped , the test - subjects try their best not to look peeved .
Sarah Mclachlan - featuring animal cruelty spot
Remember when everyone loved that “ Arms of an Angel ” song and whispered about how it was written about heroin ?
Well , a decade or so after everyone got tired of it , the tune and its singer are back , sans needle drugs and with lots of injured domesticated animals .
Bizarre ?
That ’s just the beginning .
One dog stares at the camera with its sole remaining eye , the other one covered up with a piece of hair that has been combed in front of it .
At the end , a decrepit cat sticks its paw out of its cage and raises it — seemingly in prayer — toward the heavens .
Whoever made this ad was definitely on something .

" Citizen journalism " apparently just failed its first significant test .
A CNN iReport poster reported this morning that Steve Jobs had been rushed to the ER after a severe heart attack ( story and screenshot below ) .
Fortunately , it appears the story was false .
We contacted an Apple spokeswoman , who categorically denied it .
CNN 's iReport kept the report up until at least 10:15 AM , about 20 minutes after we published Apple 's denial .
The story has since been removed .
UPDATE : Here 's CNN 's official statement .
CNN says it removed the story because the community brought the story to its attention .
Importantly , CNN also refers to the content as " fraudulent , " which is much stronger than " inaccurate . "
The SEC has already launched an investigation .
UPDATE 2 : Post hate mail about our decision to link to the iReport here .
CNN 's iReport , Original Story
Steve Jobs was rushed to the ER just a few hours ago after suffering a major heart attack .
I have an insider who tells me that paramedics were called after Steve claimed to be suffering from severe chest pains and shortness of breath .
My source has opted to remain anonymous , but he is quite reliable .
I have n't seen anything about this anywhere else yet , and as of right now , I have no further information , so I thought this would be a good place to start .
If anyone else has more information , please share it .
Immediately after reading the iReport story , we contacted Apple .
Katie Cotton , Vice President of Worldwide Communications , replied quickly , saying " It is not true . "

Battered by a sinking global economy Hedge funds hit by fresh wave of withdrawals .
Hedge funds have been hit by a fresh wave of withdrawals as investors search for cash , prompting more funds to impose emergency measures to block repayments .
London Diversified Fund Management , one of Britain ’s best - known fixed - income managers , on Friday suspended both its hedge funds as trading conditions in the derivatives markets created valuation difficulties ahead of redemptions .
LDFM , founded by former JPMorgan bankers David Gorton and Rob Standing , manages close to $ 3bn ( £ 1.9bn ) , down from a peak of $ 8bn after its main fund fell 23 per cent this year and investors pulled out .
LDFM is joining a roster of hundreds of hedge funds in restricting withdrawals , with investors and prime brokers estimating as many as a fifth have suspended or limited what investors can get back as they have their worst year on record .
This week CQS , a London convertible bond specialist run by former Credit Suisse banker Michael Hintze , began canvassing investors on whether it should change the terms of its main fund to allow it to restrict withdrawals if markets worsen next year .
Huw van Steenis , analyst at Morgan Stanley , said industry assets could shrink 35 - 45 per cent from June ’s $ 1,930bn by the first quarter of next year , as heavy redemptions added to the pain of poor performance .
Two Bank of New York Mellon funds of hedge funds told investors this week they planned to restructure because almost a third of the funds in which they invest had limited redemptions .
The Sanctuary I and II funds will split into continuing and wind - down classes , with pay - outs of about a third of the wind - down class expected early next year .
On Friday , London ’s $ 4.3 bn Atlas Capital , owned by New York - based Sciens Capital Management , suspended withdrawals from a dozen funds of hedge funds , while Crédit Agricole and Grenfell PAI each suspended a fund of funds as underlying hedge funds restricted withdrawals .
“ We have seen really accelerating redemptions around the 30 per cent level , ” said Derek Stewart , a director of Mellon Global Alternative Investments , which manages the Sanctuary I and II funds .
“ The reason for doing this [ restructuring ] is purely to protect the interest of investors . ”
Tudor Investment Corp. Suspends Redemptions
Tudor Investment Corp. , the firm run by Paul Tudor Jones , temporarily suspended redemptions from the $ 10 billion BVI Global Fund Ltd. as it plans to split the hedge fund into two , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Tudor is proposing to put hard - to - sell investments , mostly corporate bonds and loans from emerging markets , into a new fund called Legacy , said the person , who asked not to be identified because the information is private .
BVI Global , which started in 1986 , would focus on easier - to - trade stocks , bonds , commodities and currencies .
More than 80 firms have liquidated funds , restricted redemptions or segregated assets following stock - market declines and a credit freeze that started with rising defaults on U.S. subprime mortgages .
Tudor , which oversees $ 17 billion , is asking BVI Global investors to approve the plan to split the fund in the next two months .
Clients would have their money allocated between BVI Global and Legacy based on the division of assets , said the person .
Tudor would n’t be able to charge investors a performance fee until the Legacy assets exceeded their high watermark , or peak value .
The firm would sell off the assets in Legacy next year and return money to clients .
Hedge funds have posted losses averaging 22 percent this year through Nov. 24 , according to Chicago - based Hedge Fund Research ’s HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index .
Investors such as pension funds and university endowments are pulling their holdings from hedge funds after they “ over - committed ” to private equity investments , van Steenis said .
Mistake To Block Withdrawals
Bearish Structural Connotations
A bearish structural factor bearing down on the US economy and equity market will be tens of millions of Boomers ( retiring and being " retired " involuntarily ) being involuntarily fired from employment at peak earnings , many of whom will never again earn anywhere near their peak earnings ( and medical and life insurance benefits ) .
Boomers by the millions will be forced to draw down on assets ( declining in value ) at a much faster rate than they or most economists imagined in an attempt to maintain the Boomer consumer lifestyle .
Hedge fund withdrawals are occurring as many financial services types ( hedgies , mutual fund mismanagers , bankers , etc. ) are seeing their livelihoods and a large share of their net wealth evaporate at an alarming amount and rate .
Private schools , private clubs , religious institutions , charities and not - for - profit entities , etc. , are now being negatively affected by the meltdown in financial assets , including leveraged real estate .
The deleveraging / liquidation process is still underway for hedge funds and barely just beginning in the overall US and global financial systems .
The rally from SPX 741 to 896 was the obligatory bear market rally of ~ 20 % ( ~ $ 1.7T addition to market cap ) , so a correction of at least half that rally is quite common ; but so is a test of the low or lower lows .
I have to sympathise with someone who does n't want to drive an atheist bus , like the Christian bus driver who made the news today .
I have enough trouble driving a car without hitting stationary objects , so the thought of driving any kind of bus makes my palms sweat .
If I had to do it , I would definitely want God on my side , preferably willing to take the wheel in an emergency .
Posters on the bus likely to put him in a bad mood would be a terrible idea .
Ron Heather 's objection , however , is a principled one , concerned more with religious offence than road safety .
He turns up for work , sees that he 's expected to drive around in a big red denial of the existence of God , and refuses .
We all have things that we find offensive , and would n't want to be confronted with them in the course of our daily work .
I 'd hate to come downstairs of a morning to find Jeremy Clarkson 's face stuck all over my laptop .
But the atheist bus poster still seems an odd thing to make such a fuss about .
For a start it does n't say anything nasty about God , just that he probably does n't exist .
Many people have said much ruder things about him , and he always seems to take it pretty well .
It also happens to be a statement of the basic religious beliefs of a lot of British people .
Considering the number of religious groups who advertise on public transport , if all drivers took Heather 's stance , the result would be pretty chaotic .
No Christians , Muslims or other believers could drive an atheist bus .
And if a bus had a poster with a verse form the Bible about Jesus dying for our sins , no atheist or Muslim could drive it .
If it advertised the Qu'ran – you get the picture .
And what would happen with a bus that had an ad for the Qu'ran on the inside and for Jesus on the back ?
It could only be driven by someone who believes all religions lead to God .
In fact , " There 's probably no God " is more a statement of agnosticism than atheism , so a really principled hardline atheist ought to refuse to drive the so - called atheist bus too .
Most of us , I think it 's fair to say , do n't want a religiously segregated public transport system .
Perhaps there 's enough room on the buses for all religions to have their say without anyone walking out .
In fact , speaking as one myself , I think it shows quite a cheek for Christians to make a fuss about this .
We 've spent decades covering public places with verses from the Bible , and posters promising that if you let Jesus into your life everything will be all right for ever .
Then as soon as the opposition get the money together to do the same thing we 're outraged , and think that God is as cross as we are .
Personally , I think that if God is anything like as big and clever as we claim he is , he can probably take it .
George S. Morrison , who commanded the fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that led to an escalation of the Vietnam War and whose son Jim was the lead singer of the Doors , died Nov. 17 in Coronado , Calif .
He was 89 and lived in Coronado .
He died after a fall in the hospital , his daughter , Anne Chewning , told The Associated Press .
Aboard the flagship carrier Bon Homme Richard , Mr. Morrison commanded American naval forces in the gulf when the destroyer Maddox engaged three North Vietnamese torpedo boats on Aug. 2 , 1964 .
A skirmish and confused reports of a second engagement two days later led President Lyndon B. Johnson to order airstrikes against North Vietnam and to request from Congress what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , allowing him to carry out further military operations without declaring war .
Mr. Morrison ’s relationship with his famous son was difficult .
Rebellion met blank incomprehension .
In “ The Doors by the Doors ” ( Hyperion , 2006 ) , he is quoted as saying : “ I had the feeling that he felt we ’d just as soon not be associated with his career .
He knew I did n’t think rock music was the best goal for him .
Maybe he was trying to protect us . ”

BBC : Journalism is about compassion too
Palestinian Mothers and we , the undersigned , in an expression of our dismay and disgust with the decision of the BBC , would like to put our names to the : LETTER SIGNED BY TONY BENN , CELEBRITIES , MANY OTHERS To Sir Michael Lyons , Chairman of the BBC Trust , Mark Thompson , Director General of the BBC , Caroline Thomson , Chief Operating Officer for the BBC The International Committee of the Red Cross say that conditions for the people of Gaza are " worse than Darfur " but the BBC refuses to allow the Disasters Emergency Committee to broadcast an appeal for aid .
We agree with Government Health Minister Ben Bradshaw , who says the reasons the BBC has given for blocking an appeal for humanitarian aid are " completely feeble " and it was " an inexplicable decision " .
We urge the BBC to reconsider its decision and to contact the Disasters Emergency Committee as a matter of urgency so that its appeal can be broadcast nationally .
Not to do so is to deny relief needed immediately for people suffering catastrophic and life - threatening conditions .
Tony Benn , President of Stop the War , says , " To deny the help that the aid agencies and the UN need at this moment in time is incomprehensible .
I appeal to the chairman of the BBC Trust to intervene to reverse this decision to save the lives of those who are now in acute danger of dying through a lack of food , fuel , water and medical supplies . "
The Mormon Cult : The Truth about Mormons and Christianity I had been a " true - blue " Mormon for over thirty years before I found the absolute proof that the Mormon Church is a cult .
I had been in denial for all those years , but now I could n't escape the facts .
Not lies and rhetoric from angry ministers threatened by Mormon success , but cold , hard , objective , scholarly proof from a source accepted by most Mormons .
On this site , I 'll show you the evidence and show you how to use it to open the minds of Mormons or anybody interested in understanding the truth about cults , Mormonism , and Christianity in general .
Mormons are n't the only ones surprised by the evidence .
Many non-Mormons have friends and relatives who are Mormon , and based on their experience , they just can't believe their ministers when they tell them that Mormons are a cult .
Here 's a typical story : " The Mormon Cult " and " The Cult of Mormons vs. Christianity " - these are themes I heard from my pastor years ago who ranted against Mormon beliefs and the menace of " Mormonism , " but I could never believe him .
I knew Mormons , and they seemed so nice , so " Christian . "
The Mormon cult members ( OK - members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ) told me they believed in Christ , they told me they worshipped Christ , and they really seemed to talk and act like Christians .
For me , they seemed like the kind of people we should welcome in our society .
A little different , yes , but to me , their main faults seemed to be fear of alcohol and refusal to party on Sunday .
Not great dancers , either , but a cult ?
Yet " Mormons are a cult " was what I heard at church and read in my Christian bookstore - but those books seemed so biased and ( sorry ) a little extreme .
They seemed to describe a different people than the Mormons I knew .
There is no way that I could believe they were a cult - until you showed me the evidence !
LOL !
Now I know better !
Now I understand the Mormons are a cult - and thanks to you , even my Mormon friends agree ! "
After being able to prove to myself and others that Mormons are a cult , I was faced with some difficult decisions .
Suffice it to say that I 'm still Mormon .
I have not had my name removed from the records of the Church .
I still attend each week .
And I still believe in what the Church taught me : I believe in Jesus Christ and that salvation comes through His Atonement and mercy , and that we should have faith and trust in Him and follow Him .
But should n't I leave now that I know Mormonism is a cult ?
Well , that 's the problem .
Is there a better cult out there ?
You 'll understand my dilemma when you read the evidence I discovered , and understand what it means for all of us .
My Discovery : The Scholarly Book that Proves the Mormon Church is a Cult As a Mormon , I had been taught that the founder of our church was a prophet of God , Joseph Smith , who was called by Christ to restore the Church of Christ on the earth .
And I sincerely believed in Christ , worshipped Christ , and was taught to have faith in Christ .
I certainly wo n't deny that .
But when the Mormon Church -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints -- was founded in 1830 , was it a actually Christian church or some kind of cult ?
Or , if possible , both ?
To answer that question , I wanted to know if the Mormons really were a cult , not just today based on modern definitions , but in 1830 and throughout the history of the Church .
So many ministers of other faiths have insisted that it was a cult from day one - but what was in that church nearly two centuries ago that qualified it as a cult ?
Obviously , my first question had to be " What is a cult ? "
But it is not enough to ask modern pastors for their definition because they are obviously threatened by the growth of Mormonism and want to make sure they use -- or create - - a definition that nails the Mormons .
Many seem to have a working definition of cult as " anything I disagree with . "
That 's not especially helpful .
So what did " cult " mean in the past ?
Is there an objective , scholarly way of answering that question , so that we can settle once and for all the real question that the world needs to know :
Is the Mormon church really a cult , based on objective criteria that existed before ministers started using the " cult " label when railing against the Mormons as competitors ?
Folks , you 're about to see the best , most objective evidence on this question right here for the first time .
And once you examine it , I think you will agree that YES , MORMONS ARE A CULT .
MORMONISM IS A CULT .
LATTER -DAY SAINTS ARE A CULT .
AND EVEN THEIR MOST VERBOSE AND ELOQUENT DEFENDERS ARE FORCED TO AGREE !
Yes , you got that right .
Mormons who have looked at the evidence I 'm about to present agree !
They accept my primary source as authoritative , scholarly , and largely objective .
They accept the criteria it established -- years before " Mormons " were troubling nervous ministers -- as fair and objective .
And they accept -- or have been forced to accept -- the conclusion that CANNOT BE AVOIDED : MORMONS ARE A CULT .
Cleland ad causes trouble for Chambliss
With Sen. John McCain returning to the campaign trail on Thursday on stump for Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss in his runoff race in Georgia , Democrats are reminding voters and donors of a controversial ad aired by Chambliss in the heated final weeks of the 2002 campaign that shows pictures of Democratic Sen .
Max Cleland , a triple - amputee from wounds suffered during his service in Vietnam , just after shots of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
The ad — which has a voice - over warning that , " As Americans face terrorists and extremist dictators , Max Cleland runs television ads saying he has the courage to lead , " then lists votes where the Democrat opposed President Bush before concluding that " the record proves Max Cleland is just misleading " — helped propel Chambliss to an unexpected victory .
Advertisement
" I 'd never seen anything like that ad , " McCain said at the time of the spot , which was widely condemned by Democrats .
Putting pictures of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden next to the picture of a man who left three limbs on the battlefield is " worse than disgraceful , " said McCain .
" It 's reprehensible . ”
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released a Web ad ahead of the Arizona senator ’s visit titled “ Disgraceful , ” reminding voters of McCain ’s 2002 response , and also issued a fundraising letter from Cleland where he writes , “ In 2002 , Saxby Chambliss won his Senate seat in the final days by putting my picture next to Osama bin Laden and lying about me , ” Cleland wrote .
“ It was despicable , but it worked .
This year , we ca n’t let Chambliss use the same vile tactics to defeat Democratic challenger Jim Martin .
“ Sen . Chambliss has his good pal , John McCain , to stand by his side and speak truth about his character , ” the text of the ad reads before highlighting McCain ’s comment .
“ It looks like even Sen. Chambliss ’ buddy , John McCain , agrees .
Georgians deserve better , ” the ad concludes .
A call to McCain 's Senate office asking for comment on the 2002 ad was not returned by the time this article was posted .
Chambliss told MSNBC on Monday that " we 're just very pleased to have [ McCain ] coming in on Thursday of this week . ”
" If Cleland had won , you ’d never have heard a thing about it , " Chambliss told Politico in response to a question about the 2002 spot .
" That ad is so mild compared to the ads I ’ve seen in campaign after campaign since 2002 .
Plus , the ad was truthful . ”
“ They lost , " he added .
" They 're always going to be bitter about it . "
DSCC spokesman Matthew Miller said that while the 2002 ad " is not what [ this year 's ] race is about , there is still certainly some resentment ” among Democrats over it .
“ There is still a lot of animosity from Democrats directed at Saxby for that , and deservedly so , ” Georgia Democratic Party spokesman Martin Mathen said .
“ It was a low blow . ”
Both ActBlue and Daily Kos have spotlighted the ad in fundraising drives for Jim Martin , Chambliss ’ Democratic opponent this year .
“ I encourage you to give to Jim Martin ’s campaign , ” reads one fundraising e-mail to ActBlue donors .
“ Jim is running for the Georgia Senate seat against Saxby Chambliss .
Perhaps you remember Saxby for his cynical , dishonest campaign against Max Cleland six years ago . ”
National Republican Senatorial Committee spokeswoman Rebecca Fisher chastised Democrats for dwelling on 2002 .
" The Chambliss campaign is focused on the future of Georgia and this nation .
If Jim Martin and national Democrats want to focus on the past , that 's his choice .
Georgians have real problems that Sen. Chambliss working to solve , " she said .
The NRSC hit Martin in the final week of this year 's general election with an ad accusing the Democrat of voting against tougher penalties for those caught soliciting child prostitutes .
Despite lingering resentment among Georgia Democrats , Martin ’s campaign has not frequently mentioned the 2002 ad .
It 's not talked about at all in the local media , ” said Charles Bullock , a political science professor at the University of Georgia .
He added that , despite the national scorn for the ad , “ it worked in Georgia . ”
“ This is a new election .
We ’re focused on the concerns of Georgia voters and not some ad Saxby ran in 2002 , ” Martin told Politico , adding , “ Still , the fact remains that this was an extremely negative campaign that he ran against a war hero . ”
While Martin has criticized Chambliss for using “ inappropriate ” tactics in the 2002 race , he 's mostly tried to stick to his economy - focused message .
Polls throughout the summer showed the Democrat trailing by over 20 percent .
It was n’t until the markets crashed in September and Chambliss made a very unpopular vote in favor of the $ 700 billion bailout that the Democrat began to close .
On the trail , Martin frequently links Chambliss to Bush on the economy and blasts the Republican ’s record on veterans ’ issues .
The Democrat has not retooled his message for the Dec. 2 runoff and is not planning to make a push over the infamous ad .
Still , Martin has not forgotten the fate of his fellow Democrat Cleland .
“ Personal attacks are how Saxby has always operated , ” he said .
“ McCain was right when he gave him a hard time about that ad .
I think he was right in 2002 and I think the facts are the same now . ”

Experiments need to be slotted into some larger context of research , and their results need to be communicated to other practitioners .

• Take the Edgar Allen Poe Quiz
Locally , the musical duo Nox Arcana took inspiration from Poe to craft 21 songs with titles like " Masque of the Red Death " and " Murders in the Rue Morgue " that are a roll call of the writer 's best - loved work .
When Edgar Allan Poe was 21 and a cadet at West Point , he and a buddy burst into the barracks brandishing a bloody knife and declaring that one of their professors would be bothering them no more .
The two students then flung a freshly killed , trussed - up goose into the room , which , in the low candlelight , looked like it might be the professor 's head .
Theatrical , macabre and defiant of authority , even the pranks of Edgar Allan Poe burnish the legend .
In the 200 years since his birth on Jan. 19 , 1809 , his influence has flourished -- in the stories we tell ourselves now and in our curiosity about the writer himself .
On Friday , the U.S. Postal Service marked the bicentennial with a commemorative Poe stamp .
Herman Melville gets a nod in the coffee brand Starbucks , but Poe has his own football team in Baltimore .
As a boy of 16 , Alfred Hitchcock began reading Poe 's stories , which he credited for igniting his lifelong interest in suspense .
And when the Mystery Writers of America singles out the best work in that genre , the group calls the annual awards the Edgars .
Poe , in the canon for " The Tell - Tale Heart " and " The Cask of Amontillado , " strove to bring a musical ear to his writing , so he might not be surprised to see the compliment returned .
In 2003 , Lou Reed produced a two - CD tribute , " The Raven , " with an all - star cast of collaborators , including David Bowie .
And the Northeast Ohio instrumental duo Nox Arcana has made a Poe- inspired CD called " Shadow of the Raven . "
Even Sylvester Stallone has admitted that he writes poetry and has a long - standing ambition to make a film about Poe .
" There are a handful of writers whose lives are almost as fascinating as their work -- Poe , Hemingway and a few others , " said Steven Fink , an English professor who teaches a course on Poe at Ohio State University .
" This class was packed the last time I taught it .
The students love him . "
Writer still chills modern reader
Partly , Fink believes , that is because most undergraduates enjoyed a chill sampling of Poe in high school .
Two centuries since his birth , Poe 's fascination with the morbid and his explorations of obsessive love remain far more accessible to the reader wearing an iPod than do the dense works of other 19th century literary giants : Nathaniel Hawthorne , Melville , Ralph Waldo Emerson .
" Poe was a writer of tremendous versatility and perplexing contradictions :
He was a genius and a hoaxer ; an elitist who was nevertheless among our most popular writers , " Fink writes in his course description .
" A poet , short - story writer , essayist , critic , and magazine editor , Poe was essential to the development of both the detective story and the gothic horror story .
. . .
He was both celebrated and misunderstood ; desperate for public approval , yet an acerbic , jealous , and self - destructive critic of his contemporaries . "
Poe thought of himself foremost as a poet , and " The Raven " is the incantatory , formal piece for which he is best known .
Four years before his death , " The Raven " brought Poe the fame he craved .
And although he sold it for $ 9 , the impoverished writer managed to charge for his recitations of it -- and sometimes for reprints .
" ' The Raven ' made him sexy , and for the first time he was invited , paid to do readings , " said Shelley Costa Bloomfield , who teaches at the Cleveland Institute of Art and is the author of the lively and well - received " The Everything Guide to Edgar Allan Poe " ( Adams Media , 286 pp. , $ 14.95 ) .
Emerson dismissed the poem that brandished " Nevermore " and contemporary academics are not overly fond --
Poe is not subtle -- but if it leads a reader to become curious about his other work , Bloomfield is encouraged .
" Even as a doctoral student in 19th - century American writers , I never really appreciated how central he is to American literature , " Bloomfield said of beginning her book on Poe .
When she finished , she said , " I got in the shower and cried -- I drew so close to someone who lived 150 years ago . "
The word " detective " did not exist in 1841 , but Poe managed to conjure the genre out of the atmospheric Gothic tales popular in his day , the 19th - century love of the lurid , serialized " Penny Dreadfuls " and his taste for the sensational .
His character C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for Sherlock Holmes and all their subsequent children .
Each of Poe 's detective stories , wrote Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , " is a root from which a whole literature has developed .
. . .
Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it ? "
To Bloomfield ,
Poe brought a moral consideration to this genre 's emphasis on crime and punishment .
" CSI , " anyone ?
And its enthronement of rationality also served Poe as a rebuke to the gooey mysticism of Transcendentalism , whose adherents
Poe satirized as " Frogpondians , " after the Boston Commons pond .
At the center of Poe 's legend and legacy is horror .
It was fanned and elevated , ironically , by a Poe rival named Rufus Griswold , who got busy as soon as he learned of Poe 's mysterious death .
Griswold placed an obituary in the Oct. 9 , 1849 , New York Tribune that began , " Edgar Allan Poe is dead .
He died in Baltimore the day before yesterday .
This announcement may startle many , but few will be grieved by it . "
The Griswold character assassination backfired into a cult of personality .
" So much of Poe 's fiction is about transgressing boundaries , " Fink said .
" He takes the normal and pushes that past the point of abnormal , such as with our impulse for revenge .
One of the things that marks
Poe as so important is how clearly he understood horror was psychological , not physical . "
Both he and Bloomfield warned against making the rookie mistake of guessing that Poe 's narrators are Poe and that his themes of deception and self - deception are simply autobiographical .
" He was more than we assume , " Bloomfield said .
" He was not a madman .
He was not a drug addict and he was not a pervert . "
She paused .
" He was complicated . "
( CNN ) --
The United States warned the Indian government about a potential maritime attack against Mumbai at least a month before last week 's massacre in the country 's financial capital left nearly 180 dead , a U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN .
Onlookers in Mumbai read messages posted outside the Oberoi Hotel , scene of one of the attacks .

U.S. intelligence indicated that a group might enter the country by water and launch an attack on Mumbai , said the source , who refused to be identified due to the ongoing investigation into the attacks and the sensitivity of the information .
Indian security forces have confirmed to CNN that not only did U.S. officials warn them of a water - borne attack in Mumbai -- they were told twice .
The area entered a higher state of alert for a week , including tightened security measures at hotels , but those efforts were eventually reduced , Indian officials said .
Local fisherman in Mumbai said they witnessed a group of gunmen dock their boat Wednesday night , before heading toward the busy causeway .
Also , sources have told CNN - IBN that officials found phones and a global navigational device on an abandoned boat floating off the coast of Mumbai .
The boat had been hijacked , intelligence officials told CNN - IBN .

Four crew members who had been on board were missing .
The captain was found dead , lying face down with his hands bound behind his back .
India has made clear that it believes last week 's coordinated attacks in Mumbai originated in Pakistan , but the Indian government is under pressure to explain the lapse of security that allowed the siege to occur .
Indian police say 179 people were killed in the attacks on 10 targets in Mumbai .
Most of the deaths occurred at the city 's top two hotels , the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal .
Watch report about nanny saving infant
Pakistani authorities say Islamabad has not received any evidence that militants from within its borders carried out the attacks , but have vowed to fully cooperate in the investigation .
Suspicion has fallen on Lashkar - e - Tayyiba , a Pakistan - based terror group allied with al Qaeda , even though it has denied responsibility .
Watch how attacks could damage relations »
Pakistan banned the group in 2002 after an attack on India 's parliament that brought the two countries to the brink of war .
Indian security forces say they arrested a member of the group in February , noting that the man was casing Mumbai for an attack .
U.S. counterterrorism officials continue to say signs are pointing to Lashkar - e - Tayyiba and they have n't seen anything to rule it out .
However , they will not definitively say the group is responsible .
A team of FBI agents is in Mumbai to assist in the investigation , and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is heading to New Delhi on Wednesday to try to ease strained relations between the nuclear neighbors .

At the center of India 's investigation is the lone suspect in police custody , who Indian authorities say is Pakistani and trained by Lashkar - e - Tayyiba .
Indian officials have identified the suspect as a clean - shaven young man who was photographed during the attack on Mumbai's Victoria Terminus train station .

British Airways has been accused of treating all men passengers as potential sex offenders after it was revealed it has banned children from sitting next to male strangers - even if their parents are on the same flight .
The bizarre regulation came to light when a nine - year - old girl was moved from her seat next to a 76 - year - old passenger and his wife on a flight from Malaga to London .
Instead her mother was told by a stewardess to take the seat next to retired journalist Michael Kemp and his wife Frances , and the girl was moved to the back of the plane .
Mrs Kemp had booked an aisle seat because a bad leg meant she needed extra space .
But as the Airbus A320 filled up , she was asked to swap seats with her husband so that she , not he , would be sitting next to the girl .
Mrs Kemp politely declined , explaining to the stewardess that she had asked for an aisle seat
to avoid discomfort during the three - hour flight .
But when Mr Kemp offered to move to the window seat so that the girl could sit between him and his wife , the stewardess said it would still breach the airline 's child - welfare regulations .
Mr Kemp , from Kensington , West London , said last night : " The little girl 's mother put her in the window seat next to me and then went to her own seat further back .
" When everyone was seated , the stewardess asked my wife if she would sit next to the girl .
Frances explained why she could n't move and I thought I could resolve the problem by moving up and letting the girl sit between us .
" To my amazement , the stewardess said BA had a rule that no unaccompanied child under 16 may be seated next to an adult male stranger - even if there 's a woman on the other side .
" The discussion went on for several minutes but she refused to back down and said we could not take off until the problem was sorted out .
I heard her muttering to a colleague that everyone would have to disembark .
" She did n't seem embarrassed - just rather irritated that it was taking up so much time .
" The whole thing caused a good deal of inconvenience which could have been avoided if BA had spotted the problem when we booked our tickets . "
Leading child protection campaigner Michele Elliot , director of the children 's charity Kidscape , said she was astonished by the BA rule .
" It is utterly absurd .
It brands all men as potential sex offenders , " she said .
" What message does it send out to children - that men are not to be trusted ?
Women also abuse children .
This is just totally lacking in common sense . "
The aircraft was operated by GB Airways , a BA franchise partner .
A spokesman said : " As a responsible airline with a duty of care to our customers , it is our policy to ensure that , where possible , we do not seat unaccompanied minors next to adult males .
" We apologise if Mr Kemp was offended by our request , but we have to balance the needs of the child with those of the adult .
" The policy is there as a precaution in the best interests of the welfare of young children flying alone . "

In der Nacht nach der Großveranstaltung Clash of Champions 2020 hat WWE bei Monday Night RAW einige Überraschungen aufgeboten :
Es gab mehrere Comebacks und Andeutungen neuer Story - Entwicklungen - und eine erneute Attacke auf die Legenden , die sich gerade an ihrem Peiniger Randy Orton gerächt hatten .
Auffällig aber war auch , was alles nicht bei RAW passierte : Die Gruppierung Retribution , vergangene Woche erst als offizieller Teil des Kaders vorgestellt , deutete ihr Erscheinen diesmal nur an , als The Hurt Business , die Gegner der Vorwoche gegen Apollo Crews , Mustafa Ali und Ricochet antraten .
Nichts zu sehen war auch von RAW Underground , der an Fight Club erinnernden Show in der Show , die vergangene Woche von Braun Strowman aufgemischt wurde .
Beides hat offenbar mit dem jüngsten Corona - Ausbruch im Performance Center von WWE zu tun : Laut Wrestling Observer musste Retribution - wie Nia Jax und Shayna Baszler - vorläufig aus den
Shows genommen werden , weil es Kontakt - oder Verdachtsfälle in ihren Reihen gab .
Fightful wiederum berichtet , dass das Filmen von RAW Underground - bei dem viele Performance - Center - Schüler beteiligt sind - aus WWE - Sicht in dieser Woche keinen Sinn ergeben hätte .
Was stattdessen bei RAW geboten wurde ?
SPORT1 fasst die Highlights zusammen .
Drew McIntyre und Randy Orton vor Hell in a Cell Match ?
Champion Drew McIntyre eröffnete zusammen mit den Altstars " Nature Boy " Ric Flair , " Heartbreak Kid " Shawn Michaels , Christian und The Big Show die Sendung - nachdem die ihn im Ambulance Match gegen Randy Orton zu Hilfe gekommen waren , als Rache für Ortons Attacken gegen sie in den vergangenen Monaten .
Die Legenden erklärten , dass sie den Plan ohne McIntyre ausgeheckt hätten und hofften , dass er nichts dagegen hätte .
McIntyre fand 's in Ordnung und freute sich .
Orton wiederum meldete sich vom Videoscreen und warnte McIntyre : Wenn er denke , dass das Match am Sonntag die Hölle gewesen wäre , hätte er keine Ahnung , was noch auf ihn zukomme - ein deutliches Indiz für ein Hell in a Cell Match bei der gleichnamigen Veranstaltung am 25 .
Oktober .
Jeder , der sich ihm in den
Weg stellte , müsste dafür bezahlen , ergänzte Orton , wovon sich auch die Legenden angesprochen fühlen mussten .
Nach dem Ende von Ortons Ausführungen sprach McIntyre eine offene Herausforderung aus .
Jeder , der heute ein Titelmatch gegen ihn wolle , könne es bekommen .
DAZN gratis testen und WWE RAW und SmackDown live & auf Abruf erleben | ANZEIGE Seth Rollins intrigiert weiter gegen Familie MysterioSeth Rollins setzte seine Bemühungen fort , einen Keil zwischen die Familie Mysterio zu treiben : Diesmal enthüllte er angebliche Handy - Nachrichten , die Tochter Aliyah seinem entfremdeten Jünger Murphy geschickt hatte und die auf einen sich anbahnenden Kontakt hindeuteten .
Aliyah hatte Vater Rey und Bruder Dominik zuvor in einem Interview - Segment versichert , dass sie sich von Murphy fernhalten würde , wegen dessen Verbindung zu Erzfeind Rollins .
Später eskalierten die Spannungen , als Dominik ein Match gegen Murphy bestritt und Aliyah zum Ring kam , als Dominik Murphy mit einem Kendostab bearbeiten wollte - die Waffe , die Rollins und Murphy selbst schon brutal gegen ihn eingesetzt hatten .
Aliyah wollte Dominik Einhalt gebieten und kostete ihn damit den Sieg .
Als Dominik dann verärgert erklärte , dass Aliyah nicht an einen WWE - Ring gehöre , ohrfeigte Aliyah ihren Bruder .
Mandy Rose bringt Dana Brooke mitDas seit Wochen angekündigte Debüt der von SmackDown transferierten Mandy Rose ging über die Bühne - mit einer Zusatzüberraschung : Rose brachte Kraftpaket Dana Brooke als Partnerin mit .
Gemeinsam besiegten sie Lana und Natalya und dürften bald nach den Tag - Team - Titeln von Nia Jax und Shayna Baszler greifen .
Robert Roode feiert Comeback - Orton schlägt zurückDie offene Herausforderung von McIntyre wurde am Ende der Show angenommen von seinem alten NXT - Rivalen Robert Roode .
Der Kanadier feierte seinen ersten WWE - Auftritt seit Beginn der Coronakrise , wegen der er in seiner Heimat festsaß .
Roode und Dolph Ziggler knüpften auch an ihre Zusammenarbeit an , Ziggler half dem " Glorious One " unfair , aber letztlich vergeblich : McIntyre siegte mit dem Claymore .
Das letzte Wort der Sendung hatte dann allerdings
Orton :
Er schlich sich als Hausmeister verkleidet in den VIP - Bereich , wo Michaels , Flair , Big Show und Christian ihren Coup der Vornacht feierten .
Er schaltete das Licht aus , setzte eine Nachtsichtbrille auf und attackierte die Legenden im Dunkeln mit einem Stuhl - wobei die Einschläge für die Zuschauer nicht zu sehen waren .
Die weiteren Highlights : \- Asuka gewährte der am Tag zuvor unterlegenen Zelina Vega ein Rückmatch um den RAW - Damentitel und siegte wieder klar mit dem Asuka Lock .
Ex-Schützling
Andrade bohrte danach in den Wunden der unterlegenen Vega und tönte , dass sie nichts ohne ihn sei .
Die Worte blieben ihm danach im Hals stecken als Keith Lee in schnell abfertigte ( Lesen Sie hier die reale und traurige Vorgeschichte von WWE - Star Zelina Vega ) .\-
Vor einem Push im Damenbereich scheint Bianca Belair zu stehen , deren athletische Qualitäten gerade in einer Serie von Videoclips präsentiert werden - die an die ähnlich angelegten Clips von Legende Mr. Perfect erinnern .
Diesmal wurde gezeigt , wie Belair als Sprinterin allen davonläuft .\-
Die länger schwelende Fehde zwischen Kevin Owens und Aleister Black führte zu einem Match der beiden ohne ein ganz zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis : Black wurde disqualifiziert , als er versehentlich den Ringrichter mit seinem Ellbogen traf , Owens verpasste ihm danach noch den Stunner .

Former secretary of state Colin Powell is expected to use a high - profile television appearance tomorrow to end months of speculation by throwing his support behind Barack Obama .
His decision to go on television just two weeks before the election suggests he has finally made up his mind .
Powell , a four - star general who worked closely with three Republican presidents , said he would decide between Obama and John McCain , a long - time friend , after watching the presidential debates , the last of which was held on Wednesday .
His endorsement would be the biggest Obama has secured so far .
As a prominent member of President George Bush 's administration , he may shift some Republican - leaning voters into Obama 's camp .
McCain 's campaign team admitted privately it would be a blow , not least because it would be another day in which Obama dominated the news .
But Democratic strategists are divide about the benefits .
One said yesterday he was concerned it could backfire .
He suggested that Powell 's decision might be seen as being based on racial solidarity and that could alienate some white voters already reluctant to back Obama on grounds of race .
The sceptical strategist added that Powell , though once so popular he was considered as a potential candidate for the White House , was badly tarnished by his involvement , as secretary of state , in making the case for Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction .
Powell , 71 , who is to appear on NBC's Meet the Press , told a conference in Washington last month that he was undecided .
" I 've said to my beloved friend and colleague , John McCain , a friend of 25 years - John , I love you - but I 'm not just going to vote for you on the basis of our affection and friendship , " Powell said .
" I 've said to Barack Obama , I admire you , I 'll give you all the advice I can , but I wo n't vote for you just because you 're black .
We have to move beyond this . "
Obama won the endorsement yesterday of the Washington Post .
" There are few public figures we have respected more over the years than Senator John McCain .
Yet it is without ambivalence that we endorse Senator Barack Obama for president , " the Post said .
The newspaper said McCain had lost its support because of the way he conducted his campaign - singling out his choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate .
The Post was the 40th newspaper to endorse Obama for president .
So far McCain has the support of 15 newspapers .
The presidential race continued to be transfixed by Joe the Plumber , the Ohio man invoked by McCain in this week 's final debate as the symbol of what he claimed was Obama 's " class warfare " against ordinary working people .
Joe Wurzelbacher 's 15 minutes of fame is now stretching into its third full day and shows no sign of abating .
McCain organisers have been trying to get Wurzelbacher to appear alongside McCain at a campaign rally in Toledo , Ohio , tomorrow .
But invitations to appear on the weekend 's TV talkshows may prove more alluring .
Though he has refused to say who will get his vote , Wurzelbacher 's story has prompted a fiercely partisan reaction from the US media .
Liberal bloggers focused on idiosyncracies in his personal details - the fact that he owes almost $ 1,200 in back taxes , that he has had no formal plumbing training and holds no licence , and that his full name is not Joe at all but Samuel J Wurzelbacher .
Rightwing bloggers retaliated against what they called such smear - mongering .
" The left 's political plumbers are attacking the messenger ...
It 's standard operating procedure for the Obama thug machine , " wrote Michelle Malkin .
In Pennsylvania on Thursday McCain told a rally that Wurzelbacher had been the real winner of the debate " because people are not going to let Senator Obama raise taxes in a tough economy " , prompting chants of " Joe ! Joe ! Joe ! " from the crowd .
In New Hampshire , Obama asked supporters : " How many plumbers do you know making a quarter of a million dollars a year ? "
Meanwhile McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , is taking her critics at first hand by appearing in Saturday Night Live .
The entertainment show has been running a popularly parody of the Alaska governor by comedian Tina Fey .
The week
Confession of the week
" If I were watching Fox News , I would n't vote for me , right ?
Because the way I 'm portrayed 24/7 is as a freak !
I am the latte - sipping , New York Times - reading , Volvo - driving , no - gun- owning , effete , politically correct , arrogant liberal .
Who wants somebody like that ? " - Barack Obama , quoted in the New York Times
Unsolicited phone call of the week
Ring .
Ring .
Ring .
" Hello .
I 'm calling for John McCain and the RNC .
You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers , whose organisation bombed the US Capitol , the Pentagon , a judge 's home , and killed Americans . "
Click .
Brrrrr .
Geography lesson of the week
" It seems like , and in our last rally too , and in other parts around this great Northwest , here in New Hampshire , ya just get it . "
- Sarah Palin , on the trail in the north - eastern Granite State .
Aspiration of the week
" I 'm not Matt Damon or one of those guys who has droves of men and women wanting to be them . " - Joe the Plumber , assessing the potential impact of his new - found celebrity , which has spawned Joe the Plumber lookalikes at rallies
Gag of the week :
" I do love the Waldorf Astoria .
I hear that from the doorstep you can see all the way to the Russian Tearoom . "
- Barack Obama
To the Honorable Madams and Sirs of either House of Congress ,
I am writing this open letter to implore you to reverse this hazardous course , one last time .
You have ignored the voice of the people , who have called and emailed your offices .
In September , most of us asked you not to vote for these bailouts ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
The House of Representatives had the temporary will to block the original bill , but failed to keep its resolve when the larger version from the Senate reanimated a week later .
For those of you who changed your vote , I hope you got your price .
I expect that President Bush will ask for the second half of the $ 700 Billion package , in order to complete the rescue of the financial industry .
We were led to believe that is the money would go to homeowners in the form of mortgage relief or new loans .
Instead the Treasury Secretary changed his mind , and used it to keep failing banks afloat ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
The American Taxpayer has no faith that the money will be spent in an open manner .
The Bloomberg News ( [ link edited for length ] ) organization is in the process of suing the Federal Reserve to get the names of the banks that have already accepted an estimated $ 2 trillion in loans .
AIG 's original $ 85 billion government loan in now being refinanced into a new $ 150 billion package ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
The Big Three automakers are asking for up to $ 50 billion to keep going ( [ link edited for length ] ) .
Nash , Hudson , Packard , Studebaker , Stutz , Willys , Kaiser , Reo and others have disappeared through merger and bankruptcy .
Oh , well .
The new plants being built in this country have the names Honda , Toyota and Volkswagen .
U.S. car companies did n't retool in good times because the margins were great with big vehicles .
I 'm afraid to buy a half - priced Hummer because my job wo n't last longer than the payments .
What guarantee that the taxpayer will get his money back this time , like with Chrysler in the 1980s ?
Kia and Hyundai already have the equivalent of “ K - cars ” in their showrooms .
We are getting sick of the refrain that these companies are “ too big to fail . ”
Please use the tools of bankruptcy to reorganize them into smaller companies , so that some may survive .
And lastly , taxpayers are done with Iraq .
If after five years and $ 10 billion per month , you have n't won the war , when are you going to get it done ?
There is no money to stop the genocide in the Sudan or to invade Pakistan , even if you could get the support of the American people .
So before you attempt to deliver on your recent campaign promises of universal health care , universal pre-school , saving social security , rebuilding New Orleans , the middle - class tax cuts , and more stimulus spending , be honest with us .
Tell us all , where is the money coming from ?
The $ 10 Trillion Debt ( [ link edited for length ] ) says you have no clue .
Sincerely , your Grumpy Citizen .
A former NFL player 's wife who was shut out of a meeting this week involving commissioner Roger Goodell says limiting the entitlement discussion to former players only clouds the picture of what life is like for many who stand to benefit .
Eleanor Perfetto , the wife of Ralph Wenzel , a backup guard with the Pittsburgh Steelers and San Diego Chargers from 1966 to 1973 , told The New York Times she arrived to a Bethesda , Md. , hotel Thursday to plead her case with the commissioner despite being told in an e-mail from the NFL that the meeting was for former players only .
" We wives are the voice of players with dementia , because they can't speak for themselves , " Perfetto told The Times .
" They are only allowing players healthy enough to attend .
That means they 're getting a very slanted view of what it 's like out there . "

Bill Richardson is out : Caught with his hand , if not exactly in the cookie jar , at least you could say his sticky finger were near it .
I 'm not surprised .
For years I 've been investigating the second - most corrupt state in the USA ( after Alaska ) .
I like to check in on the enchanted state with my bud Santiago Juarez .
I knew it was not a polite question , but it was really bugging me , so I asked HIM , “ Exactly how does a Mexican get the name William Richardson ? ”
Governor Richardson ’s dad , Santiago explained , was a Citibank executive assigned to Mexico City .
There
he met Governor Bill ’s mom , and – milagro ! – a Mexican - American was born .
Richardson gets big mileage out of his mother ’s heritage , and that makes him , legitimately , a Mexican - American , a politically useful designation .
But it ’s just as legitimate to say that Richardson is a Citibank - American .
But Governor Richardson is more than that .
Between leaving Bill Clinton ’s cabinet where he was Secretary of Energy and grabbing a Hispanic - district seat in Congress , Richardson became a partner in ( Henry ) Kissinger and Associates .
That would make Richardson a Kissinger - American as well .
IN 2004 , John Kerry won New Mexico – if you counted the votes .
But they did n't – and George Bush won the state and the presidency by just 5,000 ballots .
Everyone was talking about the theft of Ohio by
Republicans , but few noted that New Mexico was stolen as well .
But one fact drove me straight nuts :
In the end , this state and its damaged elections were in the hands of Richardson , A Democrat and a Mexican - American one at that .
In New Mexico the issue of uncounted votes is more than skin deep .
Lots of Mexican - American votes do n’t tally , but Citibank - American votes never get lost .
Kissinger American votes always count .
The story of America ’s failed elections is not about undervotes .
It ’s about underclass .
Disenfranchisement is class warfare by other means .
It just happens that in New Mexico , the colors of the underclass are , for the most part , brown and red .
Class War by Other Means
As community organizer Santiago told me :
You take away people ’s health insurance and you take their right to union pay scales and you take away their pensions – taking away their vote ’s just one more on the list .
Some New Mexico Democrats have no trouble at the voting booth .
In Santa Fe , you and trust - fund refugees from Los Angeles wearing Navajo turquoise jewelry and “ casual ” clothes that cost more than my car .
Each one has a personal healer , an unfinished film script and a tan so deep you ’d think they ’re bred for their leather .
They ’re Democrats and their votes count .
Voting – or at least voting that gets tabulated – is a class privilege .
The effect is racial and partisan , but the engine is economic .
The second – and third - highest undervotes in New Mexico were recorded in McKinley and Cibola counties ” ” 85 % and 72 % Hispanic and Native .
But the undervote champ is nearly the whitest county in New Mexico : DeBaca , which mangled and lost 8.4 % of ballots cast .
White DeBaca , whose average income hovers at the national poverty level , is poorer than Hispanic Cibola .
No question , disenfranchisement gives off an ugly racial smell , but income is the real predictor of vote loss .
And what about those Bernalillo ghost voters for Bush ?
Those spirits are , it turns out , quite well - to - do , haunting the mesas west of Albuquerque where the real estate provides unobstructed views of Georgia O’Keeffe sunsets .
This was my third investigation in New Mexico in twenty years .
The first time , the state ’s Attorney General brought me in to go over the account books of Public Service of New Mexico ( PNM ) , a racketeering enterprise masquerading as an electric company .
Too young to understand what I was n’t supposed to know , I proudly mapped out the sewerage lines of deceit connecting the gas drillers , water lords and political elite of New Mexico .
The AG ’s office handed me a nice check – which I took not as a reward , but as a payment to leave the state .
After a decade away , I returned as a reporter , to look into prisons - for - profit outfit Wackenhut Inc .
In September 1999 , a company insider told me , Wackenhut was cutting costs at its New Mexico jails by sending guards alone into the cell blocks .
Ralph Garcia of Santa Rosa , who ’d lost his ranch to drought , took the $ 7.95 - an - hour job guarding homicidal neo -Nazis and Mexican mafia thugs in the local Wackenhut lock - up .
Inexperienced , untrained and alone , he was stabbed to death by inmates just two weeks after the insider ’s warning .
So that ’s how Garcia became one more impoverished Chicano who lost his vote .
No question , that ’s not your typical case of voter disenfranchisement , but that ’s the reality of the “ Land of Enchantment . ”
New Mexico is the New America , where growing income inequality is creating a feudal divide between the prison - owning class and the prisoner - and - guard class .
Vote spoilage is the owning class ’s weapon of choice .
Whose flag does Bill Richardson carry in the nouvelle class war ?
When I was checking out the New Mexico vote in 2005 , my old friends Public Service of New Mexico hit the front page , sued by the State of California for conspiring with Enron to rig the California power market .
It is still in court .
It was a scam called “ Ricochet . ” Enron and PNM say it was not illegal .
It played out about the time Garcia was walking the cell block .
Where was Richardson ?
He was in Washington , Clinton ’s Secretary of Energy , playing chubby cheerleader for PNM ’s plan for “ deregulation ” of the energy market .
Deregulation made PNM ’s games possible ” ” and Richardson ’s employment by Kissinger inevitable .
Richardson , Ready for Takeoff
What about all those suspect spoiled votes in Hispanic and Indian precincts stuck inside the machines ?
Why did n’t this Mexican - American Democrat ask for a recount ?
It did n’t just slip Richardson ’s little mind :
He actively did everything in his power to stopa recount .
I was told that it was Richardson himself who encouraged Secretary of State Vigil - Giron to reject the $ 114,000 payment from pissed - off Democrats and the Green Party .
The Governor was too busy to speak with me about this .
Halting the 2004 recount was n’t enough for Governor Bill , however .
He demanded the legislature pass a “ reform ” law that would require anyone wanting a recount of a suspicious vote to put up a bond of over one million dollars .
As a result , “ free and fair elections ” are now effectively outlawed in New Mexico .
You can have a choice of a “ free ” election or a “ fair ” election , but not both .
Want fair ?
Then you have to pay a million to recheck the ballots .
In other words , it ’s against the law to buy votes , but in New Mexico not against the law to buy the vote count .
On his phony reform law , Richardson was called out by a fellow Democrat , State Senator Linda Lopez – an act of indiscreet defiance that would not be forgotten by the Governor ’s circle .
The centerpiece of the law signed by the Governor : Ms. Fox - Young ’s proposal to require photo ID for new voters .
Maybe the former Cabinet Secretary and United Nations Ambassador Richardson could n’t imagine that photo IDs would be a problem for some voters .
After all , Mexican - Americans in Little Texas may have trouble producing acceptable IDs , but it ’s no problem at all for a Kissinger - American like Governor Richardson .
The Governor and Jimmy Carter both have passports , they have credit cards and they have chauffeurs who will vouch for them .
Richardson would n’t speak with me about the 2004 vote fiasco .
Instead , he busied himself with his space program .
He announced the state would chip in $ 200 million to build a “ spaceport ” to land private rocket ships that will be launched beginning in 2009 by Richard Branson , the British billionaire .
Passengers have already bought tickets for $ 200,000 each ( round trip , they hope ) .

As of today , extreme pornography becomes illegal to own in the UK .

The change in the law followed the brutal murder of Jane Longhurst , whose killer , Graham Coutts , admitted being addicted to violent internet pornography .
At the time , her partner said : " Jane would still be here if it was n't for the internet . "
The government became convinced of the need for a change in the law after a concerted campaign by Ms Longhurst 's mother , Liz , to have extreme pornography banned , including a petition of 50,000 people .
But privacy campaigners and libertarian groups have condemned the law as an infringement of personal freedom .
In a comment piece for politics .
co.uk , Julian Petley , professor of Film and Television at Brunel University , said : " Appeasing the moral authoritarians has always been at the root of this measure " .
The law bans pornographic images which depict an act which threatens a person 's life or would cause serious harm to the anus , breast or genitals , regardless of whether the scenes are real or acted .
There are also bans on depictions of sex with animals or corpses , regardless of whether the animal or corpse is real .
There is considerable uncertainty over how many people will be prosecuted under the law , ahich is very broadly framed .
Over the weekend , the Ministry of Justice ( MoJ ) said it only expected to see a small number of prosecutions per year over the law , which carries a maximum sentence of three years .
A statement from the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) said : " The police will not be actively targeting members of the public but will be conducting investigations into the unlawful possession of this material where found . "
Katherine Rake , director of women 's rights group the Fawcett Society , said : " It would make a nonsense of the legislation if there was n't proactive policing around it . "
The new law comes into force on the same day cannabis is upgraded to class B .

Are you familiar with Lovecraft ’s Commonplace Book ?
It ’s a compilation of notes that can be seen as story seeds , a few of them developed in some of his tales , many of them vague indications about moods or background sketches , some dreams , some characteristic and ominous tale twists and outcomes .
Everything you need to weave a tale that you may finish speaking in cursives .
I found out about it almost a year ago in La Petite Claudine , and I was suggested that I should submit something to An Exhibition of Unspeakable Things .
( Please follow the link if you want to know more and behold the non-euclidean beauty of their poster ) .
I wrote a story then and made some sketches , as the time passed , the story grew longer , the deadlines came and went , and the tale was left in my own commonplace book I guess .
Only recently I rewrote it and tried to divide it into small narrative chunks that could be serialized in The Secret Knots .
So here it is , the first part of my non submitted entry , I hope you like it .

Aid is undergoing a revamp !
Check in with us soon !
This is the true and remarkable story of private coinage and banking in Britain in the early years of the Industrial Revolution ( 1775 - 1850 ) .
Making money was a business in demand .
The needs of business for small denominations were changing .
Merchants needed small denomination coins in copper and silver .
The Royal Mint could n't be bothered .
It made coins to serve the elites , not the new and burgeoning working class .
Free enterprise stepped in with a new industry that truly saved the day — before the Crown cruelly stamped it out and ended one of the most beautiful experiences with private money in world history .
It is very likely you have never heard of this episode .
You can read dozens of histories of the early years of capitalism and know nothing of this spectacular industry – to say nothing of its lessons for today .
What is going on here ?
George Selgin , professor at the University of Georgia , has discovered the monetary equivalent of the lost city of Atlantis .
He has written a full - scale historical narrative — one that is deeply interesting and engaging — that has been largely unknown , even to scholars of the Industrial Revolution .
It is not only the first full - scale history of this episode ever written .
It is likely to maintain a place as the definitive work for many decades .
It is 400 pages , but always and everywhere very interesting .
It includes 20 pages of color photos .
The prose is elegant , and the method of analysis is thoroughly Rothbardian : this is flesh - and - blood history of real human beings .
Here is an interview with the author .
He tells of the stories of the merchants , the button makers who turned into coin makers , the way the system worked , its wonderful innovations and its evolution , and reveals the cruelty and destructiveness behind the government 's suppression of the industry .
The industry developed to the point at which 20 independent mints were involved in making coins .
The private coins served the merchants and the workers , while the government 's currency served the landed rich .
The new industry was like capitalism itself : it was designed for everyone to the benefit of everyone .
The private coins tended to be better quality than the government 's coins .
Why ?
Because private merchants could refuse them , and consumers could too .
There was competitive control over them and an inexorable tendency for currency to improve in every way .
That 's why the book is called " good money . "
And what of Gresham 's Law , the tendency of " bad money " to drive out good money ?
Selgin 's account demonstrates something striking : it only holds under government system of money which overvalue bad money .
In a private system , good money — like good products and services in a free markets — outcompetes the low - quality money .
In a market - based money system , there is an inexorable tendency for good money to win out .
The story is riveting in its own right , not only as monetary history but as business history .
He has highlighted a fantastic industry that has long gone unnoticed .
But beyond that , there is a massively important economic point .
What Selgin has done here is help us to understand something critically important : were it not for the state , a wholly private money system would emerge from market exchange .
That means private coinage , private weights and measures , market - driven exchange rates between different kinds of monies , and a fully private banking system to go along it with it .
In fact , this is precisely how money originates : from the within the market .
Why does the state intervene ?
The British case is typical .
The state wants to control the economy , tax the economy , and control the people .
If a fully private system comes about , the state finds its job all - but impossible .
That is why the state takes over at the expense of private enterprise .
In other words , the state is not responding here to a market failure but a market success .
It is not a " public goods " rationale that leads to state intervention but old - fashioned jealousy over power and wealth .
Selgin 's book shows this not through polemics but through a completely new telling of real - life events about which we 've previously known next to nothing .
The story alone is engaging and entertaining .
But readers will have to brace themselves for the conclusion : " The episode compels one to ask , first of all , whether modern governments should be in the coin - making business at all . "
He is right that " economists tend to take governments ' monetary prerogative for granted . "
This spectacular book by Selgin could change that forever .
The impact of this book , one of the most important historical narratives ever written by an Austrian economist , will be felt for many years .
He has shown us the real history behind what has been largely theory in previous works .
Think of this as a historical application of Mises 's Theory of Money and Credit or Rothbard 's What Has Government Done to Our Money .
Selgin was the first Mises Institute scholarship student , and the publication of this book by the University of Michigan Press was made possible in part by the Mises Institute .

The New York Times recently reported on a study that found , once again , that the United States is failing to develop the math skills of its students , particularly girls , especially compared to other countries where math education is more highly valued .
Indian Math Online is a start - up that aims to take on that disparity by teaching math to American kids using techniques from Indian schools .
Bob Compton , an Indianapolis - based venture capitalist and entrepreneur who co-founded Indian Math Online , hatched the idea when he was producing “ Two Million Minutes ” , a documentary comparing high school education in India , China and the United States .
He realized that Indian teenagers who were the same age as his daughters were three years ahead of them in math .
“ If you do n’t get mathematics to the highest level you possibly can in high school , your career options shrink dramatically in the 21st century , ” Mr. Compton said .
“ Our society basically tells girls they ’re not good at math .
I was determined that was not going to happen to my daughters . ”
Mr. Compton and Indian Math Online ’s co-founder , Suresh Murthy , hired a team of math teachers and software developers in India to build the site and its curriculum .
At first , the site was meant for their daughters , but soon friends started asking if they could use it and word gradually spread .
It has lessons for students in grades one through 12 and offers several packages for $ 12.50 to $ 20 a month .
Two - thirds of the students using it are children of Indian and Chinese immigrants .
Mr. Murthy ’s children are an example .
“ He grew up in India , and he worried about his daughters falling behind in the global competition to be educated for the 21st century , ” Mr. Compton said .
The site ’s curriculum is based on some crucial differences between math education in India and the United States , Mr. Compton said .
Math homework in India consists of math problems that students work through , as opposed to the United States , where homework is heavy on reading about math topics in a textbook .
Math teachers in India have college or graduate degrees in the topic , he said .
Meanwhile , most American students in grades five through eight learn math and science from teachers without degrees or certification in these topics , according to a National Academies report .
Indian Math Online gives students a diagnostic test for their grade level and then breaks down the results by topic area , such as factors or prime numbers .
It sends parents a report showing the topics in which their children are strong and weak and sends students learning modules full of practice problems .
It will soon add online chat and live tutoring from math teachers in India for an extra fee .
By testing specific subject areas , Indian Math Online picks up weaknesses that a typical school test would miss , Mr. Compton said .
When his youngest daughter was in seventh grade , for example , she took the diagnostic test and discovered she missed every question on prime numbers .
Yet she had always received good scores on school math tests .
“ It identified and diagnosed a missing fundamental math concept that her teachers had n’t noticed , ” he said .
“ And yet , it would have caught up with her later on , and we would n’t have known why she was struggling . ”
Mr. Compton said that children of Indian and Chinese parents use the site consistently , but American children often lose interest after a couple months .
He compares math to athletics — youths must practice a bit every day to master it .
“ For some reason , American kids seem to be willing to put in the work with athletics , but not put it in with the one subject that ’s going to matter more to their lives than any other activity . ”
EPA Allows Cruise Ships to Dump Toxic Waste One Mile Off Shore ...

With an apparent hat - tip to Saddam Hussein 's post - Gulf War strategy , George W. Bush continues his scorched earth policy on the way out the door .
Earlier this month his EPA announced a new last - minute rule allowing mining companies to dump their waste into mountain streams .
Last Friday , he continued to take his dump on America , by issuing a permit to allow cruise ships to dump " untreated graywater " --- including oil , grease , metals , pesticides , viruses , fecal coliform bacteria from human sewage , medical and dental waste , detergents , and cleaners --- just one mile off shore of coastal U.S.A .
" A large cruise ship on a one - week voyage can generate one million gallons - which would fill 33 large swimming pools - of graywater , " say Friends of the Earth in a press release issued last week ( posted in full below ) following the EPA announcement .
Hope you folks in Florida will remember to thank the Republicans in 2010 ...
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Friends of The Earth ( FOE ) , Nick Berning , 202-222-0748 Cruise Ships Allowed to Dump
Pollution a Mile from U.S. Shores WASHINGTON - December 19 - The Environmental Protection Agency today published a permit that will allow cruise ships to dump unlimited quantities of untreated graywater - a harmful pollutant - into the ocean just a mile from U.S. shores .
" The Bush EPA is ignoring its own scientific findings by issuing this permit , which will allow harmful pollution near U.S. shores , " said Marcie Keever , Clean Vessels Campaign Director at Friends of the Earth .
" The Environmental Protection Agency knows that pollution from cruise ships and other vessels is out of control and getting worse .
This permit will not protect the health of our oceans or the people who use them . "
The permit issued today was a final Clean Water Act General Permit for vessel pollution discharges .
The permit allows ships to dump untreated graywater one nautical mile from U.S. shores if they are travelling at speeds above six knots .
The permit also requires ships to monitor their graywater discharges only once every three months , leaving them free to ignore malfunctioning systems the other 361 days of the year .
Cruise ship graywater contains contaminants such as oil and grease , metals , pesticides , viruses , fecal coliform bacteria from human sewage , medical and dental waste , detergents , and cleaners .
A large cruise ship on a one - week voyage can generate one million gallons - which would fill 33 large swimming pools - of graywater .
The EPA finds in an assessment report to be finalized this month that untreated graywater from cruise ships is above safe levels .
Despite this finding , the permit issued today continues to allow cruise ships to discharge such graywater .
Significantly , the EPA has also found that it would cost cruise ships only $ 7.09 per passenger to treat graywater using the best water treatment technology , and yet the permit fails to require treatment of polluted discharges beyond one nautical mile .
The EPA developed the permit in response to litigation from environmental groups .
Their lawsuit overturned an erroneous EPA regulation that for the past 35 years exempted all vessels from the permitting requirements of the Clean Water Act .
The EPA permit is available online at http://cfpub.epa.gov/npd.../home.cfm?program_id=350.

Were it not for the 28 days this idiot still has left in office , we 'd say this might be his final dump on our nation .
But we 've finally learned not to misunderestimate him .
Lord only knows what else he 'll still have time to fuck up in his final 28 days ...
Scientists now have manipulated people ’s perceptions to make them think they have swapped bodies with another human or even a " humanoid body , " experiencing the sensations that the other would feel and giving the illusion of being inside the other 's body .
The bizarre achievement hearkens to body swaps portrayed on numerous TV shows and movies such as " Freaky Friday " and " All of Me . "
In real life , the cognitive neuroscientists at the Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet succeeded in making subjects perceive the bodies of mannequins and other people as their own .
The illusion also worked even when the two people differed in appearance or were of different sexes .
It also worked whether the subject was immobile or was making voluntary movements .
However , it was not possible to fool the subjects into identifying with a non -humanoid object , such as a chair or a large block .
A year ago , scientists achieved the illusion of an out - of - body experience in subjects , using virtual reality .
The new research manipulates the brain even further — out of itself and into another body .
In one of the new body - swap experiments , the head of a shop dummy was fitted with two cameras connected to two small screens placed in front of the subjects ’ eyes , so that they saw what the dummy " saw . "
When the dummy 's camera eyes and a subject 's head were directed downwards , the subject saw the dummy 's body where he or she would normally have seen his or her own .
The illusion of body - swapping was created when the scientist touched the stomach of both with two sticks .
The subject could then see that the mannequin 's stomach was being touched while feeling ( but not seeing ) a similar sensation on his / her own stomach .
As a result , the subject developed a powerful sensation that the mannequin ’s body was his / her own .
" This shows how easy it is to change the brain 's perception of the physical self , " said Henrik Ehrsson , who led the project .
" By manipulating sensory impressions , it ’s possible to fool the self not only out of its body but into other bodies too . "
In another experiment , the camera was mounted onto another person 's head .
When this person and the subject turned towards each other to shake hands , the subject perceived the camera - wearer 's body as his / her own .
" The subjects see themselves shaking hands from the outside , but experience it as another person , " said Valeria Petkova , who worked with Ehrsson on the study .
" The sensory impression from the hand - shake is perceived as though coming from the new body , rather than the subject 's own . "
The strength of the illusion was confirmed by the subjects ' exhibiting stress reactions when a knife was held to the camera wearer 's arm but not when it was held to their own .
The object of the projects was to learn more about how the brain constructs an internal image of the body and how we come to feel like we are located inside our bodies , a concept called embodiment .
The new experiments , the first to move beyond experiments on just a single limb , show that matching of our multisensory and motor signals from the first - person perspective is sufficient for producing the experience of owning one ’s entire body , Petkova and Ehrsson write in the Dec. 3 issue of the online , open - access journal PLoS ONE .
Previously , researchers thought that embodiment was sort of an inductive process of combining signals from muscles , joints and skin .
The knowledge that the sense of corporal identification / self - perception can be manipulated to make people believe that they have a new body is of potential practical use in virtual reality applications and robot technology .
It could also be useful in research on body image disorders .
The research was supported by grants from the Swedish Medical Research Council , the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research , the Human Frontier Science Programme and the European Research Council .

Look , we know you 've been holding out for the iPhone to hit Walmart before you pick it up , sandwiched between the fishing gear and row upon row of exercise videos -- and we do n't blame you .
You 'll ride your shopping cart down the wide aisles like a chariot , and when you get home with the phone you 'll dial up all your friends and let them know how much cheaper your iPhone was than theirs .
What was that ?
Yeah , the new word on the street is that Walmart is getting a 4GB iPhone 3G for a mere $ 99 , according to Boy Genius Report , and while BGR was previously reporting a November 15th launch date at Walmart , and can't vouch for the accuracy of this new report , Walmart training materials ( pictured above ) have been seen in the wild , so there 's a grain of truth to this madness somewhere .
Plus , a $ 99 iPhone just sounds so Walmart - ey , does n't it ? [ Via Mac Rumors

I am so not going to spend the last minute of my life doing 8.01
Thoughts of an ( imaginary ) MIT student on US Airways flight 1549 :
Ugh , the ascent always takes forever .
Why ca n’t they hurry up and let me use my electronic devices ?
I really want to watch that DVD screener of “ Slumdog Millionaire ” on my laptop .
Stupid FAA , it ’s not like my laptop is actually going to interfere with the guidance systems .
Black boxes do n’t run on 802.11 b .
Gah , these guys are idiots .
I hate these Airbuses .
Why do n’t they have power ports ?
I ’m gonna have to under - clock my processor so I have enough juice to last to Charlotte .
Man , IAP is n’t even over yet and I could really use some caffeine .
Where ’s that beverage cart already ?
BANG .
Crap !
What was that ?
Eerie silence .
Seriously , did anyone else notice that ?
Smells like my 6.002 lab .
Holy shit .
Are the engines gone ?
Oh shit shit shit , we ’re losing altitude , this is not good .
Why me , why me , why me ?
The odds of this happening are like a million - to - one .
No , less .
Hold on , I bet I can figure this out .
Wish I could just Google it — no time to get the iPhone out .
Okay .
Think .
Think .
The odds have gotta be less than dying in a shark attack or bee sting , so that must mean it ’s like 52.6 million - to - 1 .
I wonder if that ’s normalized ?
Do you think there are geographic dependencies ?
Like the fact that I ’m falling onto Manhattan ?
What about factoring in that I ’m on a shitty Airbus ?
God this sucks .
I can’t believe I ’m actually going to die on an Airbus .
This is why you never let Europeans make planes .
I wonder how fast we ’re going ?
Okay , I can totally back - of - the - envelope this .
Just assume the plane is a sphere of uniform density , no sweat .
Wait , wait —
I am so not going to spend the last minute of my life doing 8.01 .
Should n’t my life be flashing before my eyes ?
There ’s so much I have left to do .
I just got my Death Knight to level 80 and I ’m about to get a full set of Tier 7 .
Crap .
If I ’m not here , who ’s going to lead the raid tonight ?
I wonder what will happen to my gear if I die ?
I wish WOW would let you bequeath BOP items .
Stupid Blizzard .
Oh man , and I ’m never going to get a chance to see “ Watchmen ” .
That trailer rocked .
I hope it ’s better than “ The Spirit ” .
Although Scarlett Johansson is so hot .
I should spend my last seconds of life thinking about her .
Her and Summer Glau .
River Tam is so awesome .
I bet she could survive this plane crash .
Brace for impact ?
What is this captain thinking ?
It ’s not like moving my head is going to make a difference when a 20 - ton aircraft comes crashing into something .
Oh man , is that the river ?
Okay , maybe we have a chance , despite the fact that hitting the water at 60 miles per hour is like running into concrete .
But still , people survive airplane crashes all the time .
I could be one of the survivors — if only I ’d passed my swim test .
AHAHHAGHSGHASHGAHSHG
this sucks .
Okay , think positive .
This plane must have a fairly decent glide ratio .
Figure with all the flaps extended , our final velocity will be only about 160 miles per hour .
Factor in a shallow angle of descent .
We got a chance , man .
We got a chance .
Dude , I crash - landed my plane a thousand times on “ Chuck Yeager ’s Air Combat ” back in the day .
If I can land a P - 51 without any engines and bullet holes in my chest , this guy can bring us down .
If I die , I wonder if my Mac LC will be waiting for me in heaven .
Playing “ Sim City ” during computer lab was so much fun .
I wonder what my chances of living are ?
They always say the back of the airplane is the safest place , and here I am in seat 15A .
I wonder if that function is linear .
I wonder if they have data on whether window or aisle makes a difference .
These windows do n’t look too sturdy .
Everyone ’s all quiet and praying and stuff .
Why ca n’t people be rational thinkers ?
Praying ’s not going to help .
We ’ve only got a few seconds left , better bone up on the safety instructions .
It might help .
Better than cramming for algorithms .
Okay , let ’s see : “ put your head between your knees ” , “ your seat may be used as a flotation device ” , “ assume a brace position ” ... hehe , assume the position .
BAM !
Owwwwwww I was not expecting that .
Lame .
Oh man , now we ’re spinning ... ugh , I feel all that Anna ’s from lunch coming up .
Not cool , not cool .
Okay , deep breaths , deep breaths .
Hey , good news , man , you ’re going to live !
That ’s awesome !
I can still raid tonight !
Tier 6 here we come !
Oh shit , water is entering the plane .
Ca n’t swim , ca n’t swim , ca n’t swim .
That ’s it — next IAP I am so taking a swimming P.E. I swear I will­­ — just as long as it does n’t interfere with Mystery Hunt .
Alright !
Time to leave the plane .
Gotta get out quickly .
Wait — no one ’s taking things with them .
I need my laptop .
Do I take my laptop ?
Uhhhhhhh .
Such a hard decision .
What if I die because I was trying to take my laptop with me ?
That would be such fail .
Shit , this is so difficult .
Okay .
I ’m gonna power the laptop on and maybe I can shell in through my iPhone if the plane does n’t sink .
This is what I get for not backing up my stuff .
Okay , next IAP , I ’m totally backing up all my files .
I swear .
Sweet , I am out of the plane .
Damn this water is really , really cold .
I wonder how long until I get the hypothermia .
Screw the FAA , I can check that shit right now !
Okay , iPhone out .
Going to Google .
Wait — better update my Twitter , my guild is going to be so geeked out when they hear about this .
“ Crash landed plane in Hudson , gtg , being rescued .
CU at Naxx tonight 7 p.m. EST k l8r . ” Gotta do my Facebook status next .
Oh wait .
Dude , I could totally be like the first person to post this on Reddit .
That ’s going to be so much karma .
Man , today ’s like the best day ever .
So I ’m checking my Twitter updates , and someone ( coostreehouse ) says that she found me using TwitterGrader , which gives everyone on Twitter a ranking .
OK , what the heck , I check my TwitterGrade .
Holy frak !
I rank 199 out of 774,000 Twitterers .
I ca n’t help but think that ’s bad .
Like , maybe I need to do better things with my time .
But then I think that I do keep up with my friends that way , and pimp the blog that way , and read about people I like that way .
And it ’s not like it eats up more than 15 minutes a day .
OK , maybe 30 .
Still , no biggie .
Then I check who follows me .
Holy frak again !
Brea Grant !
Like , the chick from " Heroes " Brea Grant !
Cool .
I knew about most of the others : skeptics , scifi people , astronomy nerds like me .
Wil .
Then I think , " Say , how many followers do I have right now ? "
Answer : 2974 !
Holy frak cubed , that means I ’m close to having 3000 !
Who will be my trimillennial follower ?
I ’m not sure I know how to find out who that person will be / is .
And if you are that special person , what do you win ?
Why , nothing !
You lose !
Good day sir !
Oops .
Sorry .
Willy Wonka moment there .
But seriously , that ’s pretty incredible .
What I ’d love to see is a demographic breakdown of followers : geographic location , gender , race ( yes , the term is ill - defined , but still has useful properties for demographics ) , interests .
Who out there will write that app ?
Or does it already exist ?
When Twitter came out , I thought it was pretty useless .
I changed my mind when , just a few days after I first signed up in April 2007 , a gunman at Johnson Space Center held people hostage and I live - tweeted it ; I got several emails from people in the aerospace biz thanking me because they could n’t get updates at work through the web .
Then I tweeted a Shuttle launch , and again got lots of support .
Now I see its ability to reach people simply and easily ( as well as tell them what I had for dinner , hooray for teh webz ! ) and I like it .
So join me !
All you have to lose is colossal amounts of time .
How much force does it take to stab somebody to death ?
Strangely enough , forensic scientists do not know .
A number of groups have attempted to measure the forces necessary to penetrate skin but the results are difficult to apply to murder cases because of the sheer range of factors at work .
The type and sharpness of the knife ; the angle and speed at which it strikes ; the strength of skin which varies with the age of the victim and the area of body involved ; these are just a few of parameters that need to be taken into account .
So when giving evidence , forensic scientists have to resort to relative assessments of force .
“ A mild level of force would typically be associated with penetration of skin and soft tissue whereas moderate force would be required to penetrate cartilage or rib bone .
Severe force , on the other hand , would be typical of a knife impacting dense bone such as spine and sustaining visible damage to the blade , ” says Michael Gilchrist at University College Dublin and pals who are hoping to change this state of affairs .
They ’ve developed a machine that measures the force required to penetrate skin–either the animal kind or an artificial human skin made of polyurethane , foam and soap .
The surprise they ’ve found is that the same knives from the same manufacturer can differ wildly in sharpness .
And the force required for these knives to penetrate the skin can differ by more than 100 per cent .
That could have a significant bearing in some murder cases .
And that ’s important because in many European countries such as the UK , stabbing is the most common form of homicide .
Gilchrist and co say their work could even help tease apart what has happened in that most common of defences : “ he ran onto the knife , your honour ” .
The key thing here is the speed and angle of penetration .
The angle can be measured easily enough but the speed is another matter altogether .
Gilchrist and co say future work may throw some light on this .

UPDATED 1/16/08 11:10 a.m. : Correcting details of T - Mobile ’s unlimited calling plan .
If you pay $ 100 a month or more to AT&T or Verizon Wireless on your wireless bill , do n’t expect your bill to drop in half quickly .
But the new $ 50 - a - month unlimited wireless calling plan from Sprint ’s Boost Mobile brand may well set off some significant price - cutting by wireless carriers .
Sprint is starting a price war as a way to wring value from the underutilized network of Nextel , the wireless company it disastrously bought in 2005 .
Nextel ’s claim to fame was its push - to - talk feature that let people communicate with other Nextel phones without paying per-minute rates .
Now that most wireless operators offer plans that let people call anyone else on their network at no additional charge , demand for this feature is dropping .
The limited selection of phones that use Nextel ’s iDen technology also has discouraged customers .
Boost Mobile is a Sprint brand that mainly sells prepaid wireless service meant to appeal to young people , who talk a lot but are very price - sensitive .
Boost had 3.9 million customers at the end of last September .
( Prepaid service is less expensive to operate than more traditional postpaid service , where customers get a monthly bill for use after the fact , because there are no credit losses .
In addition , carriers do n’t subsidize the purchase of handsets and often spend less on customer service . )
Last year , the four largest wireless carriers introduced $ 100 - a - month postpaid wireless calling plans .
Sprint includes text messaging and Web surfing at that price , while AT&T and Verizon charge extra for those features .
( T - Mobile includes unlimited texting , instant messaging and picture messaging . )
So far , these plans , which cut the bills for some very heavy talkers , have n’t led to price cuts for more typical users .
The average revenue to wireless carriers for each user has been increasing slightly as more customers buy data and text - message services .
The revenue from voice calling has been falling , largely because more customers are buying family plans with more users sharing a bundle of wireless minutes .
Prices have been falling , however , in the market for prepaid wireless service , which has mainly appealed to young people in urban areas .
Two growing regional carriers , Leap Wireless and MetroPCS Communications , have been offering prepaid unlimited wireless service at prices around $ 50 a month , but Sprint ’s network is much broader .
Shares of Leap and MetroPCS fell sharply today as investors worried about the competition .
Boost , which has 3.9 million customers , is promising a heavy marketing campaign that will try to broaden its appeal to customers who have been using postpaid plans .
Its $ 50 offer includes voice , text messaging , wireless Web surfing and most taxes , making it a better value than most of the entry - level postpaid plans , which often start at about $ 40 a month before including taxes , text messages and data .
“ We believe the offer we have in these challenging economic times will make people take a harder look at Boost … and we believe that will open us up to a much broader piece of the population , ” Matt Carter , Boost ’s president , told The Associated Press .
The discount may attract customers from Sprint ’s main brand and from T - Mobile , which have been a bit more price - competitive than the market leaders , AT&T and Verizon .
But the bigger carriers will be under some pressure to fight back with cheaper plans .
Craig Moffett , the telecom analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein , says that AT&T and Verizon are in a bind because they want to keep individual subscribers , yet they do n’t want to undercut the pricing to business accounts .
“ The worst of all possible outcomes would be for the big guys to cut their prices to match Boost , ” he said , thinking about the situation from the perspective of investors .
“ But it ’s not a picnic if they leave prices alone and lose subscribers to Boost either . ”
Mr. Moffett says the shift in the market to flat - rate , all - inclusive price plans will ultimately increase competition because such plans make it easier for consumers to shop around .
“ For years , the wireless industry had a halo of price protection because users had no idea what price they really were paying , ” he said , noting that it was hard for people to figure out which calls were included in various buckets of free airtime , etc .
“ Once you cross the Rubicon of flat - rate pricing , there is no going back . ”

Merry Commercemas !
Well , it 's that time of year again ... or still , if you just read what I wrote yesterday .
Everyone woke up early to see what presents Santa left under the tree for them , and opened up the boxes to reveal new DVDs , or XBoxes , or maybe even a nice new thick winter coat .
All in the name of Jesus .
See , that 's the part that confuses me here .
The name of the holiday is Christmas .
Christ - mas .
Christ .
My name 's Chris , but until they return my calls the holiday is n't about me ; it 's about Jesus Christ .
And obviously , when Jesus was born the one thing he wanted to be known for was people giving each other things they do n't want , do n't need , and probably wo n't ever use .
The Story Of Jesus ( Abridged ) About 2000 years ago a kid was born to a woman who claimed to be a virgin .
Three men were present , none of whom claimed to be the father .
One brought frankincense , one brought myrrh , and one obviously did n't know what a medicinal bush looked like .
Jesus lived hand to mouth as a carpenter and did some things people found cool , like turning water in to wine and something about bread and fish .
Eventually the Romans crucified him because they did n't like what he had to say , but he rose from the dead a few days later to say hello and goodbye before ascending to Heaven , still penniless .
The end .
Seriously , when did Christ get taken out of Christmas ?
Instead we made up a fat drunkard who commits breaking and entering at a mathematically impossible rate in order to steal food in exchange for goods .
He 's an obese hermit who keeps Elves in a sweatshop all year long , must have the worst case of diabetes known to man , and once a year the demand for sugar drives him out of hiding to somehow slide down chimneys to distribute " cheer . "
Let 's face it , Jesus has n't had anything to do with Christmas for a long , long time .
Jesus was a poor carpenter with ideas about love and peace , and somehow that message has been utterly perverted in to trying to see who can spend more money to demonstrate their love .
You buy people things in the name of someone who had nothing ?
Do n't you see the hypocrisy ?
Jesus preached unconditional love , not " love for those who buy you stuff . "
Christmas is n't about Christ , it 's about commerce .
It 's a time for people to go out and buy as much as possible , and give it to other people .
There are even stores that only exist during the Christmas season .
Be honest , when 's the last time you said the word Jesus on December 25th ?
Happy Unspecified Seasonal Holiday !
" But Chris , Christmas is the time of year we 're all supposed to be good to each other . "
Bullshit .
Who ever told you that you were only allowed to be good to people one day each year ?
For someone who claims to celebrate Jesus , you sure do n't have a very good grasp of what he had to say .
The point Jesus was trying to make was that you should always be good to each other , not just once a year .
Treating people like shit for 364 days in a row and then choosing the birthday of someone who preached unconditional love for all at all times as the day to be nice to people is an abomination and an insult .
Accept Christmas for what it has become : a day of increased commerce .
Nothing more , nothing less .
You choose to have a family dinner that day ?
Good for you .
Odds are it's the only time of year you do it ; more commerce .
Then there 's Boxing Day , when everyone wakes up as early as possible in order to buy more things they do n't really need ( or else they 'd have it already ) because it happens to be less expensive .
You know what that is ?
More commerce .
Either Christmas is about Jesus , or it's about buying stuff .
The two are mutually exclusive .
Jesus was poor and had nothing , and he did n't care one way or the other whether people bought things for each other .
He only cared that people were good to each other , and that does n't take any money at all .
I have no delusions about how I spend Christmas : I give and receive presents , and have good food in good company .
I do n't pervert Christ 's name to make me feel better about doing it , I accept it for what it is .
So Merry Commercemas everyone .
Try not to trip over your good will .

Bush pardons mortgage fraudster who escaped restitution John Byrne
Published : Tuesday December 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Victims ' thank ' Bush for ' worst Christmas present ' ever , White House rescinds pardon
Father gave $ 28,500 to RNC this year President George W. Bush has characterized the recent US housing crisis as a product of greed and Wall Street excess .
But that does n't seem to have been Bush 's opinion when he pardoned Isaac Toussie , 30 , of Brooklyn , the son of a New York real estate developer , who defrauded the Housing and Urban Development Department government for millions of dollars and pled guilty to inflating the incomes of at least 100 families to make them eligible for federal loans in the lead - up to the worst housing crisis the United States has ever had .
Toussie was among 19 pardoned by President George W. Bush in his semi-annual pre-Christmas clemencies .
What 's more , Toussie 's father gave $ 28,500 to the Republican National Committee this year , according to a RAW STORY analysis of federal campaign finance records available at the nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog Open Secrets .
Robert and his son were sued in 2001 in what was billed as the largest real - estate discrimination lawsuit ever filed in New York State on behalf of some 400 families .
They said they were duped into buying overpriced and shoddily built properties .
The two were accused of being in cahoots with more than a dozen lenders to defraud minority home buyers , most of whom had imperfect credit records .
Toussie admitted to mortgage fraud and to defrauding Suffolk County by issuing letters that inflated the value of a property the county and a town bought by $ 2.7 million .
As Politico's Ben Smith notes , Toussie and " his father were poster children in a 2002 BusinessWeek piece on the dark side of the housing boom . "
Issac Toussie was sentenced to five months in prison and five months ' home detention in 2003 and was fined $ 10,000 .
He escaped restitution after prosecutors said that records had been destroyed in the collapse of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 .
Excerpts from 2002 BusinessWeek article , " The Housing Boom 's Dark Side : Scams and over - extended buyers threaten the market 's strength " :

In some cases , the trail of corruption leads all the way to homebuilders who lure buyers with instant financing .
In hindsight , says Maxine Wilson , a law firm administrator , the seamless loan process should have tipped her off that the house she bought in a New York City suburb in 1997 had problems : " It was way too easy .
When the loan manager walks into a builder 's office , takes your application , and guarantees that you 're going to be approved , something is wrong . "
Now , Wilson says her home is sinking .
The foundation is cracked , and she has mildew in her attic -- where the bathroom vents .
Wilson bought the house for $ 140,000 from father - and - son builders Isaac and Robert Toussie .
Two years later , it was appraised for $ 15,000 less in one of the hottest U.S. housing markets .
Wilson and 200 others filed a suit in federal court against the Toussies , but it was thrown out on Sept. 20 after failing to qualify as a class action .
In May , 2001 , Issac Toussie pleaded guilty to fraud in federal court on Long Island for illegally obtaining federal housing loans .
On Sept. 25 , Robert Toussie 's lawyer , Richard C. Hamburger of Hamburger , Maxson & Yaffe LLP in Melville , N.Y. , said his client is so confident of the quality of his houses that he will offer to buy back those of Wilson and the two other lead plaintiffs and pay their moving expenses and $ 5,000 .
Hamburger said a letter will go out to the plaintiffs on Sept. 26 .
Aggressive mortgage practices could haunt banks as the economy weakens .
In their eagerness to lend , banks have pushed too many people to take on too much debt .
These borrowers are extremely vulnerable to higher interest rates and rising unemployment .
That raises the prospect of a flood of defaults .
And a wave of distressed properties would have major implications for the housing market -- one of the few areas of the economy that is thriving .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , government - sponsored mortgage guarantors , which purchase about half of all mortgages , are likely to exercise their right to force banks to buy back bad loans .

' Victims feel like the roof has fallen in '
Homeowners who feel they were victimized by the convicted fraudster blasted President Bush for giving them the " worst Christmas gift " ever .
" President Bush 's pardon of Isaac Toussie is a nightmare for homebuyers who watched their houses - and their lives - fall apart around them , " John Marzulli and Celeste Katz report for New York City 's Daily News .
Maxine Wilson , whose $ 146,000 ranch house became the ultimate money pit after its " boiler went , toilets backed up , basement flooded , closet doors fell off and foundation cracked , " tells the paper , " The politically connected get what they want , and little people like us are just left to sink or swim .
Thanks to the President for the worst Christmas gift you could have ever given us . "
In an accompanying Daily News story , Peter Seidman , " a lawyer who represents 460 people who say they were fleeced , " complains to the paper , " We 're in the middle of a mortgage crisis [ and ] this is somebody who was alleged to have participated in predatory lending practices . "
Seidman adds , " To pardon Isaac Toussie is a kick in the teeth to homeowners struggling with mortgages they can't afford . "
The paper also reports that U.S. Pardon Attorney Ronald Rodgers received the pardon petition on August 7 , a few months after the elder Toussie 's RNC donation .
" It clearly suggests a link between the pardon and campaign contributions , " Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington tells the paper .
The newspaper 's editorial page called the pardon " a breathtaking abuse of discretion that smells of cheaply bought political favoritism . "
Excerpts from article :
####
Alfred Boozer , 50 , a security guard at the Museum of Modern Art , said he lost his money - and his marriage - after he bought a Toussie house in Staten Island .
" I think Bush stinks anyway , " said Boozer , who now rents a studio in Queens .
Beverly Sanchez , 42 , a mom of three who bought her Middle Island , L.I. , house for $ 157,000 from Toussie in 1997 , was horrified to learn of the pardon .
" We wanted the American Dream .
We wanted the house , we wanted the white picket fence - and instead , we got nothing but heartache , " not to mention floods and mold .

A four - year - old software glitch wiped out almost 200 votes from a small California county 's November elections tally , causing officials to certify results that are now known to be incorrect .
The bug , which resides in specific versions of tabulation software sold by Premier Election Solutions , caused 197 paper ballots to mysteriously vanish from Humboldt County 's final vote count .
The error only came to light after a volunteer outfit using open - source software and an off - the - shelf paper scanner audited the results .
Premier , which until recently was known as Diebold Election Systems , first warned of the bug in 2004 , but neither the Humboldt Country Registrar of Voters nor Debra Bowen , California 's Secretary of State , said they were aware of the problem .
" Secretary Bowen is certainly concerned about Premier 's carelessness with yet another elections product and thinks it 's distressing that the company took virtually no action for years on this apparent defect , " a press secretary for Bowen told The Times Standard of Eureka .
The flaw in GEMS , short for the Global Election Management System , can cause the first deck of ballots scanned to be erased when subsequent decks are deleted .
Such deletions are common during the vote - counting process when errors are discovered .
Diebold first warned customers of the problem in 2004 when it sent out an email providing workers with a method for working around the problem .
A former Humboldt County elections manager told the Times Standard he received the email , but never passed it on after he left to take a job as registrar of voters for a different county .
Elections officials for two other California counties that also use version 1.18.19 of GEMS said they received the email and incorporated the work - around into their tabulation routine .
But for whatever reason , that information never trickled up to Bowen , who last year conducted a top - to - bottom review of all voting machines used in California to assess their security .
The botched results probably never would have come to light were it not for something called the Humboldt County Transparency Project , which passes every ballot cast through an optical scanner after it has been officially counted .
The images are then made available online for anyone to view .
Open source software allows users to sort ballots by precinct and recount tallies .
The bug in GEMS is separate from one uncovered in August when Premier warned government officials of a critical error in its touchscreen and optical scanning machines .
Premier fessed up to the problem after first blaming them on human error and bugs in anti-virus software .
Wired.com offers a deep - dive into the glitch here , and additional coverage from The Times Standard is here . ®
However , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert decided to open a " humanitarian corridor " into Gaza early Wednesday to allow residents to receive aid .
UN chief Ban Ki-moon said he was " deeply dismayed " by the strikes on the UN schools and called them " totally unacceptable . "
The United Nations demanded an investigation after tank and air assaults hit the schools , run by its Palestinian relief agency , UNRWA .
At least 43 people sheltering at the Jabaliya refugee camp school in northern Gaza were killed , emergency services said .
The UN confirmed at least 30 dead and 55 wounded in the shelling .
The Israeli military said a preliminary inquiry indicated that mortar rounds may have been fired from the Jabaliya school .
Earlier two people were killed when an artillery shell hit a school in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis .
Three people also died in an air strike on another school in Gaza City 's Shati refugee camp , medics said .
UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Palestinian territories Maxwell Gaylard said Israel had the GPS coordinates of all UN buildings in Gaza - including schools .
" Neither homes nor UN shelters are safe " for civilians , he said and called for an investigation .
" If international humanitarian law has been contravened , those responsible must be held accountable . "
Heavy fighting raged in Gaza City and around nearby Deir al - Balah and Bureij .
One air raid on Gaza City killed 12 people , including seven children from the same family .
Tanks with helicopter gunship support rolled into Khan Yunis before dawn , to be met with return fire from Hamas and its allies , witnesses said .
Four Israeli soldiers were killed in two friendly fire incidents overnight and another died when his patrol was attacked on Tuesday , bringing to six the total since Saturday .
About 35 Hamas rockets were fired over the border , one striking 45 kilometres ( 28 miles ) inside Israel -- the deepest yet -- and slightly wounding a baby , the army said .
Three civilians and one soldier have been killed by rockets hitting Israel since the offensive began .
Protests against Israel have spiralled worldwide and the French president led new calls for a truce as he met Israeli leaders in Jerusalem on Monday .
Al - Qaeda number two Ayman al - Zawahiri called on Muslims to attack Israeli and Western targets in revenge for the offensive .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reaffirmed that there can be no ceasefire until " terrorist " rocket attacks and weapons smuggling into Gaza are ended .
Sarkozy went to Damascus and Beirut and later returned to Egypt to see President Hosni Mubarak , saying there was a " glimmer of hope " for ending the bloodshed .
A Hamas delegation also arrived in Cairo .
Egypt brokered a six - month truce that ended on December 19 .
Hamas refused to renew the deal accusing Israel of reneging on the deal by not relaxing the crippling blockade of Gaza it first imposed when the Islamists seized control of the territory in June 2007 .
Israel launched Operation Cast Lead on December 27 with a massive air bombardment of Gaza , and sent in thousands of ground troops a week later .
Since then , 660 Palestinians have been killed , including about 200 children , with more than 2950 wounded , Gaza medics say .
Israel has denied there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza , but Olmert 's office announced that the Jewish state would open a " humanitarian corridor " into the territory .
" This involves opening up geographical areas for limited periods of time during which the population will be able to receive the aid and stock up , " his office said .
International Committee of the Red Cross operations director Pierre Kraehenbuehl said earlier that " there is no doubt in my mind that we are dealing with a full - blown and major crisis in humanitarian terms .
The situation for the people in Gaza is extreme and traumatic . "
The UN Security Council was meeting in New York late Tuesday to weigh an Arab call for a ceasefire and to protect Palestinian civilians , diplomats said .
Washington has strongly backed Israel , with President George W. Bush saying any truce must ensure an end to militant rocket fire .
After talks with Sarkozy , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak invited Israel for an urgent meeting to discuss security on the Egypt - Gaza border .
The envoy of the main players in the Middle East peace process , former British prime minister Tony Blair , earlier said that an immediate ceasefire was possible provided Israeli concerns about the smuggling of money and weapons across the border were addressed .

NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
As fireworks exploded over the Big Easy on New Year 's Eve , 22 - year - old Adolph Grimes III pulled up to his grandmother 's home near the French Quarter after a five - hour drive from Houston , Texas .
Adolph Grimes Jr. , with grandson Chris , wife Patricia and his son's fiancee , Shae Whitfield , want answers .
Grimes , who relocated to Texas with his fiancée , Shae Whitfield , after Hurricane Katrina , could n't wait to get home with their 17 - month - old son , Chris , and ring in the new year with friends and family .
" He made it at 12 o'clock exact , with a second to spare , " said his father , Adolph Grimes Jr .
Three hours later , Grimes lay dying on the sidewalk half a block from his grandmother 's front door , with fireworks giving way to the hue of flashing police lights .
The Orleans Parish coroner said Grimes was shot 14 times , including 12 times in the back .
Watch police investigate scene of shooting »
Grimes had just walked out of the house and was in a car waiting for his cousin , according to family members , when nine plainclothes officers -- part of an undercover narcotics task force driving around New Orleans on New Year 's Eve -- surrounded Grimes ' vehicle .
Shots rang out ; New Orleans Police Superintendent Warren Riley said Grimes shot at police first .
The Grimes family disagrees , saying police executed a loved one as he ran for his life .
" It was like someone was a murderer , and they finally caught him , " said Grimes ' mother , Patricia .
" I ain't ever seen anything like this .
And the worst part about it was I had to wait for the 5 o'clock news to find out my son was murdered . "
Shortly after finding out about the death , the family contacted the FBI to investigate alleged wrongdoing by police officers in the shooting .
" We are hoping for a thorough investigation by the NOPD [ New Orleans Police Department ] and the district attorney 's office , " said the family 's attorney , Robert Jenkins . "
We know the FBI is going to do a fully complete investigation .
We are hoping that criminal charges will be brought against all of these officers for the execution in this case . "
Riley agreed that all the facts need to be released .
" We think that families should do everything they can do make sure this investigation is as thorough and complete as possible so they know the truth , " he said .
Nine police officers were reassigned afterward , but New Orleans police are n't commenting on the case .
The police also declined to release the names of the officers and the shooting report , saying the investigation is ongoing , both internally and with the FBI .
Family members said they want to know why officers descended on a young man with no criminal record , who graduated from one of the most prestigious high schools in the city .
" This violence has to stop .
My child 's death will not be meaningless .
He did not die in vain , " Patricia Grimes said .
" This is meaningless ; this never should have happened . "
Grimes did have a gun .
His family and the lawyer , Jenkins , said he had a legal permit to carry the weapon .
Authorities also said they found a shotgun and extra ammunition in the car 's trunk .
Grimes ' relatives said they do n't believe he opened fire first .
And the family 's attorney said he believes the investigation will show rogue cops and sloppy police work .
" I just think it was some bad officers who were out there and imposing their will on the community , " Jenkins said .
Jenkins also said that 48 bullet casings were found at the shooting scene .
Police wo n't confirm or deny that number , but Riley defended his officers ' actions .
'' We train our officers to fire when fired upon .
We train them to fire more than one shot , '' he said .
But the shooting does n't make sense , relatives said , describing Grimes as a young man who was a loving father with a good job and no history of being in trouble .
His grieving mother and father said they wo n't be silenced and are not worried about a code of silence among officers , the so - called " blue wall . "
" The walls are going to come down .
Just like the walls of Jericho came down , " Grimes ' father said , trying to fight back tears .
All About New Orleans Police Department • Federal Bureau of Investigation
Television static is now broadband gold .
The Federal Communications Commission 's decision to open up the ' white spaces ' spectrum to unlicensed devices could usher in a new telecom revolution , say analysts .
Like WiFi , the availability of free , unregulated spectrum could create new technologies and new markets , bringing superfast wireless connectivity to the masses .
Unlike WiFi , it could also put pressure on wireless carriers .
" All the PR spin and FUD ( fear , uncertainty and doubt ) failed in the face of physics and the ground reality of engineering , " says Sascha Meinrath , research director of the wireless future program at the New America Foundation , a non-partisan public policy think - tank .
" Opening up white spaces will lower the cost of communications by facilitating new technology , software and devices is an enormous win for public interest , " he says .
AT A GLANCE :
__White Spaces Winners__Intel :
The company 's chips could power many of the new devices on the white spaces spectrum .
Google : New services from Google could be offered on the new spectrum .
Google could even end up becoming a broadband service provider , perhaps as part of a consortium .
Motorola / Philips / Dell :
They are likely to create the hardware and the devices to access the broadband services on white spaces .
Consumers :
More innovative products , more wireless choices , and higher wireless data speeds .
Also , the use of white spaces could finally usher in the era of seamless roaming across technologies .
White Spaces Losers
Verizon / AT&T / Comcast :
These companies have paid billions over the years to gain exclusive rights to the spectrum .
Now they will have to fight new entrants who have no legacy costs to worry about .
Professional Audio Equipment Manufacturers :
These companies , which have so far operated in the white spaces , will have to spend more to create equipment that will work in different areas of the spectrum .
They will also have to spend more on testing their devices to avoid interference .
' White spaces ' refers to the unused bits of spectrum between UHF television channels , which will no longer be needed when the United States abandons analog television broadcasting and goes all - digital in February , 2009 .
But just how to use that spectrum was a hotly - contested battle that pitted technology companies against broadcasters and wireless audio equipment manufacturers .
Wireless microphones and other equipment used by broadcasters and event producers already use some of this spectrum , so those groups resisted the idea of letting unlicensed devices onto their airwaves , willy - nilly .
The FCC 's latest decision means technology companies such as Google , Intel Motorola , Phillips and Dell – which lobbied to " free the spectrum " so they could build data services on it – will emerge as big winners .
Update 11/06 : Dell has said it plans to launch white spaces capable laptops
Telecom carriers such as Verizon , AT&T , Sprint and Comcast will feel the pain and be forced to adapt to a new reality , say analysts .
Verizon and AT&T have paid billions over the last few years for exclusive chunks of spectrum .
Also , Sprint and Clearwire are creating a WiMax network that could also be threatened by white spaces - based broadband .
White - space frequencies are unlicensed , which means any company can use the spectrum .
By contrast , wireless carriers have exclusive , licensed access to the frequencies that their phones use .
" White spaces could be a friend or foe of existing carriers , " says Paul Gallant , an analyst with research wealth management firm The Stanford Group .
" It might end up enabling carriers to enhance their retail offerings , or it could be used in completely new ways to undercut the existing business models . "
Sprint declined to comment .
White spaces have been coveted by technology companies for their potential .
The spectrum will allow wireless signals to travel two to three times farther than WiFi signals can today , including through obstacles .
Allowing for unlicensed use of white spaces means consumers will see a new generation of wireless broadband devices , said Craig Mundie , chief strategy officer for Microsoft , in a letter to members of the House of Representatives a few days ago .
It will enable low wireless broadband service in rural areas , self - forming mesh networks capable of routing traffic at speeds of 20 megabits per second and above within the mesh ; and wireless distribution of content throughout the home and among devices , said Mundie .
That 's exactly what consumers need today , agrees Meinrath .
" All those problems of diversity on the airwaves and access to internet broadband connectivity are predicated on the artificial scarcity of airwaves , " he says .
" They will be alleviated . "
The future of communications is in seamless roaming across not just networks but also technologies such as wireline broadband , WiFi and cellular networks .
" The devices of the future will allow you to completely un - tether yourself , " says Meinrath .
Already Google has applied for a patent that would allow the company to create such a device .
Chip companies such as Intel are also likely to profit from opening up of white spaces .
Intel could potentially develop chips that can ride over white spaces , much like the WiFi and WiMax - enabled chips it produces today .
The move could also mean that companies such as Motorola , Phillips and
Dell could create new mobile devices that could become alternatives to smartphones or companions to notebooks .
For telecom service providers , it will be the beginning of a new world .
Broadband connectivity over white spaces could change the telecom landscape much like WiFi did a few years ago .
Existing service providers will have to evolve fast or find themselves sinking as newer players , probably a consortium led by Google , enter the market .
" The key question is , who is going to pick up the ball and run with it ? " says Gallant .
Meanwhile Cablevision is building out a mobile broadband service in New
York using unlicensed spectrum that 's not white space , says Gallant .
If
Cablevision 's experiment succeeds Comcast , Verizon and other service providers could end up embracing white spaces .
As for Verizon 's $ 4.7 billion winning bid earlier this year for the 700 - MHz spectrum , it wo n't be an investment they are likely to regret .
" Verizon knew exactly what they were getting with that spectrum , " says
Gallant .
" White spaces is just the opposite .
It is very risky and may be hard to create a business model that will be truly successful on it . "

Paper 's count suggests Franken victory over Coleman RAW STORY
Published : Thursday December 18 , 2008
Print This Email This UPDATE : Franken takes lead in ongoing tally Democratic challenger Al Franken for the first time took a lead over Sen.
Norm Coleman in an ongoing recount in Minnesota , the Star Tribune reported .
According to the paper 's running tally of ballot challenge results , Franken held a 270 - vote lead as of Friday afternoon , and the margin was climbing .
The paper explained that such a lead was somewhat expected , as a state canvassing board had spent the morning considering Coleman challenges , most of which fail .
Earlier days had been spent considering Franken challenges , which ended up with Coleman gaining votes .
As of Thursday night , Republican Sen. Norm Coleman 's official lead over Democratic challenger Al Franken had shrunk to single digits , with 5,861 challenged ballots remaining to be counted .
But a newspaper 's count of remaining challenges suggests Franken will end up the winner .
The Minneapolis Star Tribune , having just wrapped its own count of the ballots in question , predicts a final margin of just 89 votes , in Franken 's favor .
A Franken win would give Democrats 59 Senate seats .
The Huffington Post 's Sam Stein first noted the likelihood of a Franken win .
The Star Tribune 's count considered only the 6,000 - plus ballots both campaigns challenged over the course of the recount , and it did not factor in some 1,500 absentee ballots that a the state Supreme Court just ordered back into the count .
Those ballots had been improperly rejected on Election Day .
The decision to include those rejected absentee ballots virtually guarantees the recount will drag on into the new year .

Advertisement Several thousand people have marched through the Greek capital Athens to protest at the government 's economic policies , as part of a general strike .
While turnout appeared lower than expected , the strike hit transport and the public sector and the city saw new unrest over the shooting of a teenager .
Rioters hurled petrol bombs at police outside a court where two policemen were remanded in custody for his death .
A defence lawyer says the youth was killed by a ricochet .
Police officer Epaminondas Korkoneas , 37 , has been charged with murder Greece 's conservative prime minister has vowed to restore order and compensate businesses affected by the riots , which spread from Athens across Greek cities after the shooting on Saturday .
The leader of the socialist opposition , George Papandreou , made a call for public calm .
A lawyer for the officer who fired the shot which killed 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos , who was buried on Tuesday , said ballistics tests on the fatal bullet had shown the death was an accident .
Police officer Epaminondas Korkoneas , 37 , was charged with murder and police officer Vassilios Saraliotis , 31 , was charged as an accomplice .
The Athens court ordered both men to be held in jail pending their trial .
No date for the trial was set .
The ballistics tests have not yet been published and the Grigoropoulos family has hired an independent pathologist to study the case to ensure there is no cover - up .
Union demands
The two main umbrella unions - the Greek General Confederation of Workers ( GSEE ) and the Civil Servants Supreme Administrative Council ( ADEDY ) - are demanding increased social spending in light of the global financial crisis , as well as higher wages and pensions .
GENERAL STRIKE
Athens international airport closed Athens bus , metro and suburban train systems disrupted Teachers , journalists , bank clerks and public sector workers also expected to strike
Rebellion deeply embedded
In pictures : Athens march Greece riots : Your stories Thessaloniki riot : ' War zone here '
They represent about 2.5 million workers - roughly half of the total Greek workforce .
For union leaders , though , the number of people who took part in the demonstration in Constitution Square was almost embarrassingly small , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant in the capital .
While flights in and out of Athens airport were cancelled , and some banks and businesses were closed , most private sector workers found ways to reach their work - places .
The Athens Traders Association estimates the rioting over the police shooting caused 1bn euros ( $ 1.3bn , £ 874 m ) worth of damage .
Responding to the unrest , Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis promised on Wednesday to restore order and announced measures to compensate businesses that have suffered .
In a televised address , he pledged immediate aid packages , including cash payments and tax freezes , for businesses whose buildings had been torched or property looted .
" The government is determined to consolidate the feeling of public safety and to help businesses get back on their feet , " said Mr Karamanlis .
Mr Papandreou , who has called for early elections on the grounds that public confidence in the government has been shaken , urged calm on Wednesday .
" I appeal to all to show responsibility , restraint and to end the violence that our country is experiencing these days , " he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
Our correspondent says that the government has been badly wounded but will survive , as long as the prime minister can maintain party discipline .
New violence Rioters hurled several petrol bombs near the courthouse where the two policemen were appearing before a magistrate for questioning .
HAVE YOUR SAY Cronyism and corruption need to stop for Greece to become a truly democratic society .
Victor , Athens , Greece
The bombs were reportedly thrown as a defence lawyer was preparing to talk to reporters outside the building .
An Associated Press reporter witnessed running battles in the city centre as masked youths pelted police with rocks , bottles and blocks of marble smashed from a metro station entrance .
Windows newly replaced after four nights of rioting were smashed again .
" The government wanted us to postpone this protest , but they are the ones who have to do something to stop this violence and to improve the quality of our lives , " said one demonstrator , drama student Kalypso Synenoglou .
High - school students chanting " Cops ! Pigs ! Murderers ! " clapped and cheered each time a riot policeman was hit by a stone , AP adds .
Also on Wednesday , a group of about 100 Roma attacked a police station in the impoverished Athens suburb of Zefyri , where they attempted unsuccessfully to push a burning lorry into the station , Greek TV reports .
And in the port city of Patras , 215 km ( 134 miles ) west of Athens , a crowd of shop - owners is said to have turned on rioters and forced them to stop a wave of destruction , our correspondent says .
Entrepreneurs have been sleeping in their shops to defend them against rioters and looters .

W hat makes oil a poisoned chalice ? ”
Why do so many people lead such poor lives while sitting on King Midas ’ throne , especially during an oil boom ?
That is a question millions of Nigerians , Algerians , Indonesians , Iranians , Mexicans and Venezuelans have been asking themselves for decades without getting a convincing explanation .
More often than not , oil booms plague certain oil - rich countries with all sorts of calamities and the calamity of extreme poverty can be the most demoralizing for an oil - rich Third World country ’s population .
At the peak of the Arab oil embargo in the mid 1970s , Terry Lynn Karl , an American student of political science , went to Venezuela to do some field research for the dissertation she was writing on the history of OPEC .
“ Do n’t study OPEC , ” the late Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo , a brilliant Venezuelan lawyer considered to be the “ father ” of OPEC , told her .
“ It is boring .
Study what oil is doing to us , ” he added .
As they parted , Pérez Alfonzo presented her with these prophetic words : “ Ten years from now .
Twenty years from now , you will see .
Oil will bring us ruin . ”
Karl followed Perez Alfonzo ’s advice and eventually wrote what is probably the best book on what oil - booms can do to countries like Venezuela .
Truly , The Paradox of Plenty : Oil Booms and Petro-states ( University of California Press , 1997 ) reads like a treatise on the morbid “ brain chemistry ” of the decision - making elites which rule oil - rich countries such as Venezuela , Nigeria or Indonesia .
What exactly is a petro-state ?
It could be described as a mining country with weak institutions and a malfunctioning public sector .
Its most important feature are laws that grant subsoil rights to the government , from which spring the extraordinary size and duration of the “ petro- rent ” which is much , much greater than the profits which can be made in the private sector .
An externality occurs when the actions of one person affect those of another .
For more on externalities , see “ Public Goods and Externalities ” by Tyler Cowen in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics .
Petro-states are structurally different from other countries in the advanced and developing worlds , especially the agricultural or manufacturing exporters , whose products are not thought to be depletable .
Large oil revenues imply exchange rates that inevitably encourage imports and hinder exports .
To complicate matters , state - owned companies must face the fact that oil is a “ capital - intensive ” business : the more crude you pump out , the more money you must “ reinject ” into the same oil well to keep it pumping at the same rate of productiveness .
Finally , unlike other economies , petro-states are prone to all kinds of “ externalities ” ; the most unsettling of these is that the petroleum industry is prone to booms and busts .
Global exploitation of petroleum during the 20th century coincided with state building in many Third World countries .
This process was closely related to how quickly the major oil companies learned to operate profitably in politically volatile countries , most notably their ability to help shape the “ institutions ” which were beginning to emerge and the passing of laws that could guarantee property rights .
Some petro-states considered by Karl are senior members of OPEC and some are not .
Many of them became fully independent nations only after the swift process of decolonization that followed World War II , such as Indonesia , Nigeria or Algeria .
Others are Latin American nations , like Venezuela , Mexico and Ecuador , which are a product of the early 19th century wars of independence from Spanish colonial rule .
Karl also studied the economic performance of Iran , a non-Arab Islamic petro-state .
Karl found out that most oil - exporting countries “ tend to bear a striking resemblance to each other in state capacities and macroeconomic performance , despite differences in types of political regimes , cultures , geostrategic locations , and the like ” ( emphasis added ) .
Venezuela is a very illuminating case of the impact of oil - booms in oil exporting countries whose institutions have been shaped by oil - led development .
Karl compares Venezuela ’s performance during the last two oil booms of the 20th century with that of similarly capital - deficient oil exporting countries like Mexico , Algeria , Indonesia , Nigeria , Iran , Ecuador , Oman or Cameroon .
The study left out capital surplus countries such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Libya , Qatar or the United Arab Emirates .
Two “ behaviours ” can be discerned with amazing regularity in petro-states going through an oil - boom .
Their governments first seem to be seized by a sort of schizoid “ manic ” spell and urgently demand from their citizens special powers to direct the capital accumulation from oil revenues into other productive activities and thus try to catch up to the developed world .
“ We have plenty of resources so now is the time ; everything can be done so everything must bedone ! ” become watchwords for these governments .
It ’s no wonder that for Venezuelan politicians of all colors , including Lt. Col.
Hugo Chávez , “ sowing our petroleum ” has been their only “ program ” for almost 80 years .
As Karl points out in chapter three of her book , “ ( b ) ecause oil revenues poured into the state and not into the private enterprise , each new discovery or price increase enhanced the role of the public sector ” .
So it is only natural that new agencies and jurisdictions are born .
And since it is the state , not the private sector , which has first access to the petro-rent , rent - seeking becomes the name of the game for everyone , including of course the small private sector .
Deadly fights over who controls the country ’s oil revenues become the only important issue in domestic political life .
These “ wars ” over petro-rents annihilate already weakened institutions , favor the concentration of power , promote the bending of the law , and , last but not least , increase corruption which is already all - pervasive .
While inflation is likely under a system of fixed exchange rates ( including various forms of managed float , such as Venezuela ’s ) , note that under a flexible rate system such as in the United States , inflation will not occur unless the Federal Reserve monetizes the increase .
Instead , the exchange rate will adjust .
For the definitions of fixed for flexible exchange rates , see “ Does the Exchange Rate Regime Matter for Inflation and Growth ? ” [ 1997 , IMF ] .
For descriptions of the differences between the systems , see “ Exchange Rates ” by Paul Krugman in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics .
Furthermore , the very large oil revenues which come into the hands of the state put pressure on exchange rates that foster imports and discourage exports .
Inevitably , inflation sets in .
The market is soon saturated with imported automobiles , electronic gadgetry , luxurious home appliances and name - brand whisky .
The currency becomes overvalued because the oil sector is the core of the economy and extensive reliance on imports undermines local production .
To make matters worse , the oil industry employs comparatively few people .
In Venezuela , for instance , by 2003 only about 40,000 people out of an economically active population of 11.7 million worked in the oil industry .
A second “ behavior ” closely associated with the idea of “ sowing our petroleum ” appears when the benefits of government spending are cancelled out by an overheated economy .
Again according to Karl , “ ( t ) he boom not only provokes a grander , oil - led economic model but also simultaneously generates new demands for resources from both the state and the civil society .
Policymakers , once torn between their twin preoccupations with diversification and equity , now think they can do both .
The military demands modernized weapons and improved living conditions ; capitalists seek credit and subsidies ; the middle class calls for increased social spending , labor for higher wages , and the unemployed for the creation of jobs .
As demands rise , unwieldy and inefficient bureaucracies , suddenly thrust into new roles , find themselves incapable of scaling down expansionist public - sector programs or warding off private - sector requests .
Thus they ultimately contribute to growing budget and trade deficit and foreign debt .
The boom effect is instantly at work . ” ( p. 65 )
Petro-states apparently cannot cope with oil booms without running into almost unrepayable debt and without undermining democracy in the end .
Such seems to be the curse of the petro-state : “ you shall never attain economic diversification and your people will grow poorer and angrier at you with each passing day . ”
Since the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s , the number of Venezuela ’s poor has climbed to almost 65 % of a population of 22 million .
Today , most Venezuelans agree that it was the harvest of inequality , frustration and political unrest , generated by the oil booms of the mid-1970s and 80s that made possible Lt. Col Chávez ’s ascent to power in 1998 .
The irony of it all is that , according to a well - respected research group at the Universidad Católica “ Andrés Bello ” led by Luis Pedro España , an expert on the study of poverty , after seven years of the longest oil - boom in Venezuelan history , with OPEC crude prices reaching unprecedented peaks , there are 2 million more Venezuelans living below the poverty line than in 1998 and , with 117 billion more dollars having passed through the hands of the Venezuelan state , there are almost twice as many government ministries than there were seven years ago .
Despite its radical rhetoric and its denunciations of “ neo-liberalism ” and “ Yankee imperialism ” as the enemies of Lt. Col.
Chávez ’s “ revolution , ” the Venezuelan petro-state seems unharmed and relatively sound whilst it continues to enjoy the longest oil - boom it has experienced in more than 80 years .
But if Karl ’s comparative analysis of “ the paradox of plenty ” is correct , the Venezuelan petro- state ’s extravagant squandering of resources , its massive subsidies which only reward inefficiency , the crude inequalities of income and opportunity , and the rampant corruption will mean that “ the curse of the petro- state ” will prove to be the real enemy of Chávez ’s “ revolution . ”
Quantum hologram pushes back the limits of information density .
A pattern of carbon monoxide molecules ( top ) creates a quantum hologram ( middle ) .
The input image can be accurately read ( bottom ) .

The ones and zeroes that propel the digital world — the fording of electrons across a transistor , or hard drives reliant on electrons ' intrinsic spin — are getting packed into smaller and smaller spaces .
The limit was thought to be set : no more than one bit of information could be encoded on an atom or electron .
But now , researchers at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , have used another feature of the electron — its tendency to bounce probabilistically between different quantum states — to create holograms that pack information into subatomic spaces .
By encoding information into the electron 's quantum shape , or wave function , the researchers were able to create a holographic drawing that contained 35 bits per electron .
" Our results will challenge some fundamental assumptions people had about the ultimate limits of information storage , " says graduate student Chris Moon , one of the authors of the work published in Nature Nanotechnology1 .
Pushing the limit
The researchers have built on a tradition of inscribing information in small spaces that began when eminent physicist Richard Feynman asked in 1959 , " Why can not we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica on the head of a pin ? " .
A benchmark was achieved in 1989 , when researchers at IBM manipulated individual xenon atoms on a nickel plate to spell out the letters ' IBM ' across a space just a dozen nanometres wide2 .
Feynman 's challenge was met — and then some .
But Moon and his colleagues saw a way to go smaller by using a quantum analogy to the conventional hologram .
They would use the quantum properties of electrons , rather than photons , as their source of ' illumination ' .
Using a scanning tunnelling microscope , they stuck carbon monoxide molecules onto a layer of copper — their holographic plate .
The molecules were positioned to create speckled patterns that would result in a holographic ' S ' .
The sea of electrons that exists naturally at the surface of the copper layer served as their illumination .
Just as water bouncing off stones in a show pond create a rippling wave patterns , these electrons interfere with the carbon monoxide molecules to create a quantum hologram .
The researchers read the hologram using the microscope to measure the energy state of a single electron wave function .
They showed they could read out an ' S ' — for Stanford — with features as small as 0.3 nanometres .
Quantum circuits
In addition to breaking the atomic limit for information storage , the researchers demonstrated one of the essential features of holography .
They stacked two layers , or pages , of information — in this case , an ' S ' and a ' U ' — within the same hologram .
They teased out the individual pages by scanning the hologram for electrons at different energy levels .
This led the Stanford team to think about the creation of quantum circuits .
In encoding the ' S ' , the researchers were concentrating the electron density at certain points and energy levels .
And a concentration of electrons in space is , in essence , a wire .
That led study co-author Hari Manoharan to think about using the holograms as stackable quantum circuits — which may eventually be needed to wire together a quantum computer .
" You would change the energy level and you would have a different set of a wiring , " he says .
The result is " very interesting " , says Alexander Sergienko , a quantum - optics physicist at Boston University in Massachusetts .
But he says that the technique is a long way from having any practical use .
Conventional optical holography — which has its own community of researchers who are trying to store information densely — can take advantage of charge - coupled device ( CCD ) cameras that read out the information in parallel .
The quantum electron holography , for now , requires the tunnelling microscope , which traverses the hologram more slowly .
" To make it practical , one needs to think about the future development of read - out systems , " Sergienko says .
" Right now , it is an excellent proof of principle . "

When you belly up to the bar , how well do you know the cocktail you 're ordering ?
The ingredients of these famous tipples may be familiar to bar patrons the world over , but some of their origins are as debatable as those of the Flaming Moe .
Here 's a quick rundown of where some of your favorite drinks entered a glass for the first time .
1. The Martini
Aficionados disagree , sometimes violently , on the correct ratio of gin to dry vermouth that makes a transcendent martini , and the debate over the true origin of the martini can be just as contentious .
Some claim that it 's simply a dryer version of an older cocktail called the Martinez ; Martinez , California , the birthplace of this cocktail , thus stakes its claim to the title of birthplace of the martini .
Others postulate that the drink 's name simply comes from Martini & Rossi , an Italian company that 's been exporting its vermouths to the U.S. since the 19th century .
Still others claim that the drink was created by and named for Martini di Arma di Taggia , the bartender at New York 's Knickerbocker Hotel , although there 's evidence that the cocktail may have been invented well before he started mixing drinks .
2. The Manhattan
The venerable Manhattan , a blend of whiskey , sweet vermouth , and bitters , is another cocktail that scores of people claimed to have invented .
It likely dates back to the New York bar scene of the 1860s , but there are also some more intriguing ( though almost certainly too good to be true ) tales about its origins .
According to one of these legends , Jennie Churchill threw a party at the Manhattan Club in 1874 to celebrate Samuel J. Tilden 's victory in New York 's gubernatorial election .
An enterprising bartender created a new cocktail for the event , which he dubbed the Manhattan in the club 's honor .
Both of these characters would go on to bigger things .
Churchill soon gave birth to a son , Winston , and Tilden made a presidential run in 1876 .
( Although Tilden won the popular vote , he lost out to his Republican opponent , Rutherford B. Hayes .
At least the cocktail saved Tilden from obscurity . )
3 . The Bellini
This delightful wine cocktail , a blend of white peach puree and Prosecco , has a well - established origin .
Giuseppe Cipriani , founder of Venice 's beloved Harry 's Bar , started mixing up the fruity tipples sometime between 1934 and 1948 .
The pink drink reminded him of the color of a saint 's toga in a painting by Italian Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini , so Cipriani named his concoction in honor of the painter .
4. The Kir
This popular French aperitif of crème de cassis and white wine has long been a favorite in France , but it did n't get its name until after World War II .
Felix Kir , the mayor of Dijon from 1945 to 1968 , was a huge fan of the cocktail , and whenever he entertained visiting dignitaries , he 'd invariably serve them the drink .
Kir did such a good job pushing the mixture onto his visitors that it eventually became inextricably linked with his personality , and that 's why the cocktail bears his name today .
5 . The Daiquiri
If you 're an American mine employee stuck working in Cuba , what do you do ?
In the case of intrepid engineer Jennings Cox , you start creatively mixing drinks .
The mixture of rum , lime , and sugar supposedly sprang to life in 1905 when Cox and some of his fellow Americans were hanging out in a bar in Santiago , Cuba .
By mixing together these handy ingredients , the Americans found a tasty tipple , and it eventually worked its way back to the states .
6. The Tom Collins
This refreshing summer drink owes its name to a 19th century hoax .
In 1874 , hundreds of New Yorkers heard some bad news while they were out on the town : a certain Tom Collins had been besmirching their good names .
Although these people did n't know Mr. Collins , they were outraged that he would slander them , and they often set out to find the rascal .
Of course , the root of the hoax was that there was n't really a Tom Collins , but that did n't keep aggrieved parties from searching him out .
To deepen the joke , bartenders started making the citrus cocktail that now bears the name , so when searchers asked for Tom Collins , they could instead find a thirst - quenching long drink .
7. The Cosmopolitan
Long before Sex and the City helped bolster the popularity of the cosmo , various bartenders were staking their claims as the cocktail 's " true "  creator .
According to various stories , the drink originated in Minneapolis , South Beach , San Francisco , Manhattan and Provincetown , Massachusetts .
Since the drink is basically just a kamikaze with a simple addition of cranberry juice , it 's possible that bartenders in all these locations came up with the drink independently , so we may never know exactly who was responsible for putting a glass in Carrie Bradshaw 's hand .
8. The Sazerac
Although it 's not the most widely known drink , the Sazerac is both delicious and one of America 's oldest cocktails .
The blend of rye whiskey , bitters , sugar , and absinthe or pastis dates all the way back to the 1830s when Creole pharmacist Antoine Peychaud came up with the recipe and began serving it .
The Sazerac became so popular that Peychaud 's apothecary business quickly became better known as a place to get a revitalizing potion .
The Sazerac is currently in the middle of something of a resurgence .
Kentucky distillery Buffalo
Trace has marketed two very good straight rye whiskeys under the Sazerac name , and last year the Louisiana House of Representatives proclaimed that the drink is the official cocktail of New Orleans .
9 . The Negroni
Count Camillo Negroni gets credits for creating this aperitif around 1919 .
As the story goes , Negroni really loved to throw back an Americano ( Campari , sweet vermouth , and club soda ) , but he wanted a little extra zing in his glass .
He asked a bartender to replace the club soda with gin to give the mixture some added kick , and the Negroni was born .
10 . The Black Russian
Surprisingly , containing vodka is the only thing this cocktail has to do with Russia .
Bartender Gustave Tops created the drink in 1949 or 1950 while working at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels .
Tops supposedly first mixed the combination of Kahlua and vodka for American socialite Perle Mesta , who was serving as the ambassador to Luxembourg at the time .
11 . Long Island Iced Tea
It might not actually contain tea , but at least the Long Island part of the name is accurate .
This spring break favorite is fairly young as cocktails go ; it 's only been around for about 32 years .
Rosebud Butt , a bartender at the Oak Beach Inn in Hampton Bays , invented the drink in 1976 , so if you ever need to find a patron saint of terrible hangovers and nights spent falling off of barstools , Rosebud may be your man .

“ The case for full nationalization is far stronger now than it was a few months ago , ” said Adam S. Posen , the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
“ If you do n’t own the majority , you do n’t get to fire the management , to wipe out the shareholders , to declare that you are just going to take the losses and start over .
It ’s the mistake the Japanese made in the ’90s . ”
“ I would guess that sometime in the next few weeks , President Obama and Tim Geithner , ” he said , referring to the nominee for Treasury secretary , “ will have to come out and say , ‘ It ’s much worse than we thought , ’ and just bite the bullet . ”
Image Speaker Nancy Pelosi has alluded to internal debate over whether large banks should be nationalized , while aides to President Obama have avoided the word and are looking into alternatives .

So far the Obama administration has signaled that it is trying to avoid that day , and members of its economic team  among them Mr. Geithner and the president ’s top economic adviser , Lawrence H. Summers  made the case during the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s that governments make lousy bank managers .
Indeed , the risks of nationalization they warned about then apply equally to the United States now .
The first is that nationalization can prove contagious .
If the Obama administration took over Bank of America and Citigroup , two of the largest banks in the United States , private investors could decide to flee from the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo , or other major banks , fearing they could be next .
Moreover , Mr. Obama ’s advisers say they are acutely aware that if the government is perceived as running the banks , the administration would come under enormous political pressure to halt foreclosures or lend money to ailing projects in cities or states with powerful constituencies , which could imperil the effort to steer the banks away from the cliff .
“ The nightmare scenarios are endless , ” one of the administration ’s senior officials said .
The argument in favor of nationalization , even a brief nationalization of a few months or years , is straightforward :
It might be the only way to pull America ’s largest financial institutions out of the downward spiral that makes it enormously difficult to raise the capital they need to keep operating .
After an hour of justifications by University of Saskatchewan administrators , followed by another hour of passionate pleas to accept or reject the proposal to restructure the College of Medicine , the institution 's university council passed the proposal last Thursday , with 38 votes in favour , 26 opposed , and 2 abstentions .
uSask 's provost says the result is an important step to ensure the medical college succeeds at teaching , research , and serving patients .
The next step , the provost says , is to strike a dean 's advisory committee within the medical college to develop a plan on how to implement the changes , which take effect in January 2013 .
The chair of the College of Medicine 's faculty council says medical faculty are disappointed by the university council 's decision , but will attempt to move on .

Josh Margolis keeps a grueling schedule , brokering deals between buyers and sellers and forecasting how government actions could affect his clients .
But his obsession is not stocks , or bonds , or oil futures .
As co-CEO of the San Francisco–based company CantorCO2e , Margolis is part of an exploding branch of finance in a new commodity : carbon .
Mainstream financial institutions including Merrill Lynch , J.P. Morgan , Deutsche Bank , and Goldman Sachs are joining the booming carbon market , which continues even through the current economic jitters .
According to the World Bank , global trades in this market in 2007 were valued at more than $ 64 billion , more than doubling since 2006 .
Skip Willis , president and CEO of Carbon Capital Management , a Toronto - based “ carbon monetization ” corporation , predicts that by the end of 2008 the global carbon trading system will have topped $ 100 billion .
“ This is a market that barely existed five years ago , ” Willis says .
The carbon market was born out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which mandates the curbing of carbon emissions .
To comply , the 182 nations that signed the protocol must meet targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases — climate - warming gases that include the common industrial by - products carbon dioxide and methane .
Meanwhile , many companies are participating in carbon trading voluntarily , either to build a green reputation or in anticipation of looming regulation .
( DISCOVER recently did its own carbon - offset experiment ; see the results on the bottom of the next page . )
The United States never signed the Kyoto Protocol , but growing concern in this country over climate change may soon bring some form of regulation here , too .
Joseph Romm , who served as acting assistant secretary of energy during the Clinton administration and now edits a climate policy blog as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , predicts that “ the United States is clearly going to have a carbon trading system in the near future . ”
He notes that the president - elect supports such a plan .
Behind the carbon wheeling and dealing lies a market mechanism called cap - and - trade .
“ What a cap - and - trade tries to accomplish is the most cost - effective way to achieve emissions reductions , ” says Eric Klein , a senior broker with the New York office of the emissions trading company TFS Green .
The government sets a cap limiting the total amount of greenhouse gases that an industry , sector , region , or the country may emit .
It then sells or grants permits to businesses covered by the cap .
Each permit essentially allows the license holder to release the equivalent of 1 ton of carbon dioxide and can be traded among emitters and financial institutions .
“ Over the course of the year , ” Klein says , “ if you emit above and beyond the amount covered by your permits , it ’s your responsibility to buy more of them on the open market .
If you emit less than your limit , you can sell your extras on the open market . ”
Mandatory carbon trading programs , such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) that began in 2005 , have their roots in the U.S. Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 .
That legislation , which Klein calls “ the granddaddy of all emissions trading markets , ” created a cap - and - trade system for utilities to reduce the sulfur - based pollutants that cause acid rain .
“ A cap - and - trade system says , ‘ You have to reduce overall emissions , but how you do it is your business . ’
That flexibility saves a lot of money , ” according to Robert Repetto , economist emeritus of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation .
Ultimately , Repetto says , the Clean Air Act resulted in the reduction of acid rain pollution more quickly than expected , and at much less expense than what traditional regulation would have cost .
Replicating that success is not as straightforward as it sounds .
First , carbon emissions are not currently well quantified .
The Clean Air Act amendments required power plants to install instruments that record their acid rain–causing emissions and to report the numbers to the Environmental Protection Agency .
Yet in Europe ’s carbon trading system — a likely model for the United States — businesses are not required to use monitoring instrumentation .
They are allowed to determine their carbon emissions by “ calculation . ”
Although third - party auditors check the process , Michael Wara , a Stanford Law School professor and a researcher at the Stanford Program on Energy and Sustainable Development , acknowledges that there is reason for concern when emitters are doing their own carbon accounting .
“ Enron is always a specter in the background , ” he says , referring to the accounting scandals that sank the giant energy - trading company in 2001 .
According to Larry Lohmann , a researcher with the U.K. - based nonprofit the Corner House and editor of a book criticizing the carbon trade , “ Even here in Europe , we ’re nowhere near being in possession of the technology and enforcement we would need to run a respectable cap - and - trade program , which we ’re already supposedly running .
The margin of error for what ’s coming out of the stacks is way too wide to say whether emitters are in compliance with regulations .
And when it ’s left up to the companies to do the reporting , they have a huge amount of discretion in saying how much they ’re emitting . ”
The second problem concerns the validity of offsets , a feature of most existing carbon trading systems .
“ Under a cap - and - trade program , ” Margolis says , “ offsets are a form of currency to help participants meet the regulations .
If you need to emit less carbon , you can change your process , you can change what fuel you use , or you can find a company that you can pay to reduce those tons for you , which is what happens when you buy an offset . ”
A company that needs to eliminate 1,000 tons of emissions from its ledger might pay for a project that will plant enough trees to absorb that amount of carbon dioxide .
Lohmann points out that to show that an offset project does what it claims — actually reduce emissions — “ you have to argue that there will be lower emissions than would have been the case without the project .
That type of measurement is just doomed from the start .
And people are aware that it ca n’t be verified , which opens the way to making any claim you want to make .
There have been a lot of complaints about so - called carbon cowboys making a lot of money on nonexistent carbon reductions , ” Loh­mann adds .
“ But since the question ca n’t be decided scientifically , there ’s no sheriff . ”
Stanford ’s Wara and his colleague David Victor recently investigated a group of offsets offered under the Kyoto Protocol ’s Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) , which can be purchased for compliance with the E.U. trading scheme .
“ The basic idea of the CDM is that you cut emissions in a place like China in lieu of reducing them in Europe , ” Wara says .
“ So we need to be certain that we ’re really cutting in China .
Otherwise the whole goal is undermined . ”
For instance , power from a new Chinese wind farm or hydroelectric plant might displace electricity that would otherwise come from carbon - spewing fossil fuels .
If the developers of these projects can show that these renewable energy sources would never have been built without offset money , then the carbon emissions saved by the new plants can be sold as offsets .
In their study , though , Wara and Victor found indications that offset funding is flowing to projects that would probably have been built anyway .
“ We can show that essentially every major wind and hydro project in China is claiming credit for CDM offsets , ” Wara says .
“ We know that China has been building about 10 gigawatts of hydropower every year for a long time .
Last year , suddenly all of that development was claimed as carbon credits .
Is it really the case that none of those projects would have been built without offset money ?
These offsets are being sold to the United States and Europe , and if they ’re not real reductions , we have a big problem . ”
Another popular type of offset demonstrates a different kind of problem with the carbon market .
HFC - 23 , an industrial greenhouse gas thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide , is produced as a by - product in the manufacture of refrigerant , and a number of major offset projects capture and destroy HFC - 23 , doing a huge service to the climate .
But Wara discovered that offset sales from destruction of the gas were far more lucrative than the sale of the refrigerant responsible for creating the pollutant in the first place , giving factories a perverse incentive to produce as much waste as possible and then create projects that sell offsets to destroy it .
Both Wara and Lohmann say that a cap - and - trade program that excludes offsets would probably be more effective at reducing emissions .
“ When you have offsets in a cap - and - trade system , ” Wara says , “ it ’s like not being able to tell counterfeit money from real money . ”
Lohmann notes that the acid rain program so often cited by carbon market proponents as a success story did not allow offsets .
David Orr , a professor of environmental studies at Oberlin College , agrees that the concept should be viewed with skepticism .
“ I ’m suspicious of offsets , ” he says .
“ The farther away they get , and the more abstract they get , the more difficult it is to know whether you got what you paid for .
And you ca n’t monitor them .
It opens up a can of worms . ”
The Presidential Climate Action Project , which Orr cofounded and advises , recommends that the United States bring a new , more streamlined approach to the carbon market .
Instead of regulating carbon at the many smokestacks where emissions occur , the group recommends regulating by cap - and - trade permits directed “ upstream ” at the wellheads , mine mouths , and import points where oil , coal , and natural gas enter the economy .
Repetto of Yale points out that unlike a market for emissions , which come from countless sources and can be complicated to calculate , “ an upstream system is very easy to administer .
There are only about 2,000 initial sellers of fossil fuel that you ’d need to keep track of , and their sales are already tracked anyway . ”
However , an upstream cap - and - trade program would be likely to face political resistance because it would bring a sharp increase in operating costs for power plants that emit greenhouse gases .
Orr notes that industry would prefer a downstream cap .
As the nation debates possible structures for federal climate change legislation , many states are already moving forward with carbon - cutting plans of their own .
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative ( RGGI ) , a mandatory cap - and - trade carbon market encompassing 10 Northeast and mid-Atlantic states , requires electricity producers to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent by 2018 .
The first batch of carbon permits were auctioned off to power companies in late September , and a second auction is scheduled for December .
RGGI does allow participants to buy offsets , but it limits the percentage of required cuts that can be met with such purchases .
Similar programs are arising across the United States .
The Western Climate Initiative , covering seven states and four Canadian provinces , and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord , signed by six states and one province , are both developing cap - and - trade markets .
The plans may speed the development of a nationwide program , since companies that do interstate business would probably prefer a single set of operating regulations .
Broker Klein points out that many firms now embrace the idea of carbon emission laws but need “ clear rules of the game ” in order to plan for them .
As for Wara , the shortcomings of current carbon markets are not enough to dissuade him from his belief that laws governing greenhouse gas emissions should be enacted as soon as possible .
“ We ’re going to stumble , and we need to be prepared for that , ” he says , “ but my criterion is , what can we do now ?
Even if we do n’t get it right the first time , we need to learn by doing .
This is the problem of the century . ”
Meanwhile , the carbon market keeps whirring , and Margolis keeps brokering — or , as he likes to put it , “ making the world a better place , one deal at a time . ”
DISCOVER experimented with carbon trading when we calculated our carbon footprint for the May 2008 issue and bought a $ 4,796 offset from Carbonfund.org to cover it .
The small but growing voluntary offset market ( operating outside of government programs like the one in Europe and reaching sales of $ 258 million in 2007 ) offers to erase emissions from your business , home , travel , or even your whole life .
We , like others who have sought to be a little more green , wondered what we got for our money .
Carbonfund.org finances a changing roster of renewable energy , reforestation , and energy efficiency projects , all certified by third - party auditors .
When we checked on the impact of our offset , a spokesperson told us our donation had been pooled with others earmarked for reforestation and renewable energy projects , as we had requested , but added , “ Unfortunately , it ’s not possible to pin it to a specific project . ”
So we called some of the projects listed on Carbonfund. org ’s Web site to find out how they use offset donations .
At a reforestation project in Nicaragua , offset money pays for plants and workers .
A power company that produces wind energy told us offset funds are used to reduce prices for consumers .
Anja Kollmuss , a staff scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute and the author of two recent industry reports , says that while problems exist , voluntary offsets “ have helped to get some good projects off the ground ?
that otherwise would not have existed . ”
They also help businesses and consumers develop an awareness of their carbon footprints , she adds .
If you would like to get involved with offsets , both Kollmuss and climate blogger Romm recommend projects certified by the Gold Standard Foundation as the most rigorously vetted ones on the voluntary market .
We ’ve arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements – transportation , communications , and all other industries ; agriculture , medicine , education , entertainment , protecting the environment ; and even the key democratic institution of voting – profoundly depend on science and technology .
We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology .
This is a prescription for disaster .
We might get away with it for a while , but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces .
— Carl Sagan , The Demon - Haunted World
A recent poll by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute found , as many previous surveys have found , that Americans ’ knowledge of political and historical facts about our country is abysmal .
But this one added a twist – it surveyed elected officials as well as ordinary citizens , and found that their knowledge of the same facts was , if anything , even worse .
( You can take the quiz yourself . )
I ’m astounded that elected officials did n’t do better than the average person .
This is a worrying development that suggests the pervasive anti-intellectualism in our society is making its way into government .
With some of these questions – for instance , the question about which branch of government has the power to declare war – the incorrect answers can likely be blamed on the influence of a right - wing movement that ’s actively hostile to the ideas of judicial review and separation of powers .
But many of the questions have no such ideological implications , and wrong answers can only be blamed on a more general hostility to empirical knowledge , education and other positive qualities commonly scorned in the media as “ elitism ” .

Commenters like Susan Jacoby have noted the pernicious effects of dumbing down our civil discourse , making us less able to evaluate the policy choices we face as a democratic nation .
But worse than not knowing is the attitude that we do n’t need to know – that subjective certainty or ideological dogma can stand in for consensus , empirical knowledge about the way the world works .
Religious faith is a special offender in this regard , teaching as it does that authority or tradition is a sufficient reason to believe something , and often praising believers as virtuous for believing things that are contradicted by the evidence .
An ignorant , poorly educated society is fertile soil for every kind of superstition .
Conversely , less educated people are far more likely to believe in ideas such as miracles , demons , and biblical literalism .
( See also . )
Anti-intellectualism is nothing new , of course .
There ’s always been a strong undercurrent of it in American society , one that dates back at least to the Scopes trial , and it ’s not a surprise that belligerently anti-science regions of the country elect representatives who act in kind .
That ’s not new , but what is new is that our society – stretching the limits of what Earth ’s resources will support – is increasingly dependent on science and technology , and increasingly beset with problems , such as global climate change , that only scientific understanding will give us a hope to comprehend or solve .
As the stakes get higher , we can less and less afford to have irrationalism poisoning the public debate and swaying our policy choices .
The risk is too great that it will lead us astray at a critical moment .
The problem of anti-intellectualism has no easy solution , particularly when so many people take pride in their ignorance rather than viewing it as something to be ashamed of .
Improving public schools is necessary , but at best it treats a symptom rather than a cause .
What we need more is a return to the attitude that being intelligent and educated is a good thing which people should aspire to .
This is part of the reason why atheists must take a greater role in public discourse .
Religious liberals and moderates can and often do join with us on specific social issues – but even they , for the most part , take the position that faith is an acceptable way of making policy decisions .
We have an altogether different message , and one that ’s far more vital : decisions that affect the common good must be made on the basis of reason .
That ’s a message worth promoting , and that ’s why we should disregard the squawking of those pundits who urge atheists to keep quiet and not criticize religion , because it ’s “ disrespectful ” .
Our message , in the long run , is crucial and necessary ; if we need to do damage to established superstitions to get it out , so be it .
Shotgun News 4 February 2008
Optical sights have come of age on fighting rifles .
Three examplary choices are the S&B Short Dot ( top ) , Aimpoint M3 ( middle ) , and Trijicon TA11 ACOG ( bottom ) .
Photo credit Jeff Carpenter .
Shown here at an EAG Tactical Carbine Operators class , Type I sights , red - dot optics with no magnification , are most popular .
The EOTech holographic red dot optic can be a viable fighting optic , however , manipulating it is more complicated than the Aimpoint .
The short yet accurate barrel has become popular recently due to demand for a compact carbine which can deliver sub -MOA accuracy at extended ranges .
Rules of engagement often dictate positive target identification and shot placement .
The " Recce " format originated in Naval Special Warfare ( NSW ) due to the need to equip snipers with a combat precision weapon which could use common ammunition .
The Recce has a 16 - inch stainless match barrel and free - floated railed hand - guard , and is fitted with a low - power magnified optic .
The concept has been shortened even further into sub-MOA short - barreled rifles in the ten to 12 - inch range .
A skilled shooter can hold these short carbines to MOA at 600 yards or further .
With those facts set out , it becomes clear that carbine capability is primarily determined by the sighting system .
The same weapon could be optimized for door kicking , close to mid-range engagements with target identification requirements , or can be stretched to the cartridge 's ballistic limit by merely changing the optic .
The EOTech provides fast , heads - up sighting , and suits the short - barreled rifle well .
It 's no surprise , then , that common themes in sighting systems arise .
I 'm going to break these down into three categories : Type I , Type II , and Type III .
Man I had gotten spoiled on my big Cintiq .

One of the more recent entries to the world of digital / analog notebooks is the Thinkers Notebook and its companion app .
When the makers contacted me to offer a sample for review , I was n’t sure what yet another proprietary notebook / app combo would do to distinguish itself , but the Thinkers Notebook actually fills a niche .
The Thinkers Notebook is a landscape format design , 9 inches wide by 6 inches tall .
The notebook is disc - bound , so you can easily remove or rearrange pages .
The front cover is an attractive matte black with dots and the company logo in a coppery orange .
The back cover is plain white , in a heavier cardboard that allows the notebook to stay fairly rigid if you are n’t using it at a desk .
At the beginning of the notebook , there is a 2 - sided sheet with information about the companion app and how to use it with the notebook .
The body of the notebook is 50 sheets of specially designed paper .
One side is dotted , and the other is lined .
Both sides have a footer with space for a title and date , boxes you can tick to assign tags , and a QR code recognized by the app .
The page design is attractive , but I wished the QR code was a bit smaller .
Some users might prefer the option of a larger notebook– the 9 x 6 ″ size is nice , but it ’s not a ton of space for sketches , especially when you lose a lot of the margin to the footer and the rings .
The paper quality is great : bright white , smooth and pleasant to write on .
Fountain pens work beautifully , with no feathering or bleed - through and almost zero show - through .
The app can be downloaded for Apple or Android devices .
You can sign up for an account via Apple , Google or Facebook , or just using an email address .
A few quick introductory screens instruct you on how to capture a page image , but it is very intuitive .
The camera will automatically snap a photo when you are correctly aligned .
The first image I shot came out upside down even though I had turned the camera to the correct orientation , but that problem did not reoccur .
Once you have captured the image , you can save it as is , or convert to black and white , or greyscale .
It is uploaded to the Thinkers Notebook cloud .
The notebook has boxes where you can assign 4 tags by striking through the boxes .
I tried a single strike - through , which was not recognized , but an X worked .
In addition to these 4 tags , you can create additional custom tags in the app .
You ca n’t rename the built - in tags .
While editing your image , you can crop and rotate it if you want .
In my images the app captured part of the previous page , since I did n’t have it flipped to the back .
I would have expected the app to crop to the page margins automatically , but maybe I was doing something wrong .
The app does not offer any handwriting recognition , which is a downside .
The other weakness is that the app does n’t seem to let you re-title an image .
It just names it with the date and time it was taken .
The app shows a list of images that can be filtered by tag , and you can sort by date ascending or descending , but these are the only view settings .
It always shows a thumbnail view , without any option for a list view .
If you have hundreds of images saved , it could be awkward to scroll through all of them this way .
The FAQs / help articles for the app are limited to a few basic things about login .
When I did my testing ( on a weekday ) the app showed that their support desk was offline , so I sent a message with my question about editing the title .
On my iPhone SE 2020 , the “ send ” button to submit this request was small and awkwardly placed in such a way that I had to tap around several times before actually being able to hit it correctly .
I heard back from the support team at Thinkers a few hours later : the iPhone app does n’t currently support changing the title , but they are working on that for a future version .
But let ’s get to what is really cool about the app : the sharing feature .
By hitting the share button , you can share the image by text , email , Facebook message , Dropbox , etc .
It is sent as a link that brings the recipient to an online Thinkers app page where they can view the image , and also tap on spots in the image to leave comments .
The key thing is that the recipient does not need to download the Thinkers app to view or comment .
The image creator gets a message as soon as the comment is left .
All comments then show up in the Thinkers app .
( I had to manually refresh the app for new comments to show up .
I am not sure if it automatically refreshes at some interval .
On my iPhone settings , it looked like Thinkers Notebook is set so you ca n’t turn “ background app refresh ” off .
I like how the sharing works .
I can see it being very useful in a collaborative work environment where sending quick sketches and notes to others within and outside of the company and compiling their responses is part of the work flow .
I do n’t know what other software , if any , might allow this kind of comment process on sketches in such a simple way , so I ca n’t speak to whether there is competition for this feature .
Obviously there is plenty of competition for various kinds of digital notebook page capture , such as Evernote , Livescribe , Hamelin ’s Scribzee , and Moleskine ’s Smart Notebooks .
After signing up for an account , one of the emails I got from Thinkers had a tip about how you can also use the app with a whiteboard .
It made me wonder how the app would work with other notebooks .
I snapped a photo of a random page in my squared Moleskine journal and it worked at a minimal level as an uncropped photo of a legible notebook page , but the app added the default tags , I guess mistaking the background or the squares on the page for the tag icons .
So is the Thinkers Notebook right for you ?
If you want a quality writing experience with the ability to easily share ideas and collect feedback , it is definitely worth a try .
There are some limitations to the system , as the app lacks certain features and there is only one notebook option .
The notebooks are also a little pricey , at least at the list price .
The list price is $ 24.95 per notebook , but they are currently marked down to $ 17.99 per notebook on the website .
A 50 - sheet refill pack is $ 9.95 ( no covers or rings , just the loose sheets that you can add to your existing notebook ) .
A 5 - pack of notebooks is currently $ 74.96 with free shipping , marked down from $ 99.95 .
The companion app is free , at least for now .
They may introduce a premium paid version in the future , with more features .

PAWTUCKET , Rhode Island ( Reuters ) -
The city of Pawtucket in Rhode Island offers a vivid glimpse into the depth of America ’s worsening recession -- and a warning of the dangers of rising unemployment .
A woman walks past the entrance to the New Cafe bar in Pawtucket , Rhode Island December 2 , 2008 .
Few U.S. states are feeling the financial crisis quite like Rhode Island , which boasts the nation 's highest unemployment rate and where food banks report a 12 percent increase in people seeking emergency food .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
About 50 miles south of Boston , Pawtucket was a pioneer in America ’s industrial revolution .
Now more than 11 percent of its workforce is jobless , the worst anywhere in a state that rivals economically battered Michigan for the highest unemployment rate in the country .
Main Street is pockmarked by empty storefronts .
In just 100 yards ( meters ) , six shops have “ for lease ” signs in their windows and a 32,000 - square - foot ( 2,973 - square - meter ) retail and office complex stands empty .
“ I do n’t have much business left , ” said Sait Sado , 56 , who repairs and alters clothing at Sado ’s Tailor Shop .
“ I ’ve worked this area for 26 years .
I ’ve never seen it like this . ”
One business that ’s busy on Main Street is a pawn shop .
“ Business has been very good , ” said David Katz , a clerk at Pawtucket Pawn Brokers .
“ You can see for yourself , ” he said , pointing to shelves packed with televisions , stereos and music equipment .
“ We have been picking up for the past six or seven months .
We ’re also getting a lot of gold and jewelry . ”
When President - elect Barack Obama puts his economic rescue plan together this month , he is expected to channel significant aid to state and local governments .
Rhode Island illustrates the scale of the problem as many states consider dramatic cuts to local services to balance budgets .
Strained by a loss of tax revenue as unemployment worsens and real - estate values plummet , the state of 1 million people faces its biggest budget shortfall in 17 years , spending $ 1 million a day more than it collects and forecasting a $ 357 - million budget deficit for the fiscal year to June 30 .
That is projected to swell to $ 486 million in the 12 months from July 1 , with lawmakers predicting the red ink will grow by about $ 80 million a year to reach a $ 770 million deficit in 2012 unless new revenue sources are found .

Schools are bracing for cuts .
Lawmakers have not ruled out tax increases and are warning cities and towns to tighten their belts .
They are considering a big public works program , a consolidation of state services and possibly the nation ’s only tax on residents for each mile they drive .
Under that tax proposal , residents would have to report their mileage and pay a fee when registering their vehicles every two years .
“ You really have two choices in this state .
You can try to cut more expenses which means that you are going to be laying off more people , or you are going to have to look at taxes , ” said Edward Mazze , a professor of business administration at the University of Rhode Island .
“ Anything else that we do now is eventually going to affect the local cities and towns , and the provision of every type of state service .
And that in itself becomes a deterrent to attracting industry , ” he added .
PROBLEMS ECHOED ACROSS U.S .
Rhode Island ’s problems are echoed across the United States in various degrees .
Data on Friday showed U.S. employers axed 533,000 jobs from payrolls in November , the most in 34 years , with unemployment reaching 6.7 percent , a 15 - year high .
“ With the exception of the states that are rich in oil and gas , you can pretty much say that all the states are revising their revenue downwards , ” said Edith Behr , a senior credit officer at credit - ratings agency Moody ’s Investors Service , which maintains a negative outlook on U.S. state governments .
At least 21 states face budget shortfalls this year .
Some may cut spending by as much as 15 to 20 percent , Behr said in an interview .
Utah , for example , is suspending all planned road construction that is n’t yet under construction .
But few feel the pain quite like Rhode Island , a southern neighbor to Massachusetts that lost its manufacturing base in the 1960s and 1970s and is struggling to find a new economic engine .
The state reported a record 53,000 people out of work in October and its unemployment rate of 9.3 percent tied with Michigan , home of the devastated auto industry , for the highest rate in the country .
It reports November figures on December 19 .
Demand for emergency food programs is growing .
About 47,000 households , or about 11 percent of the state , cannot afford food , said Andrew Schiff , executive director of the Rhode Island Community Food Bank , which reported a 12 percent rise in demand for emergency food in the year to August -- a gain of about 2,000 people per month on average .
“ That trend is certainly continuing , ” Schiff said in an interview , projecting the number of people seeking emergency food aid to double over the winter as home heating bills rise .
And few places in Rhode Island suffer as much as Pawtucket , a city of 73,000 people that earned a place in U.S. history by opening the nation ’s first water - powered cotton textile mill in 1793 , an event that many historians say marked the start of America ’s Industrial Revolution .
It ’s once - thriving textile industry is in steep decline .
Unemployment has shot up to 11.3 percent -- doubling from a decade ago .
At the city ’s biggest food bank , the number of people looking for an extra bag of groceries to carry them through the month has climbed from about two a day before September to about five or six a day , activists say .
“ It ’s getting busier and busier , ” said food bank worker Glenn Marmol at the nonprofit Blackstone Valley Community Action Program as he packed groceries for Maxima Gonzalez , a 36 - year - old mother who lost her job three months ago .
“ Even people who are already getting assistance from the state with food stamps are here because they need extra help , ” he added .
The deep river of private money that helped knit together the global economy has abruptly dried up , new government figures show .
As the global financial crisis grew more severe this summer , foreigners sold almost $ 90 billion of U.S. securities — the greatest quarterly fire sale by overseas investors since the government began keeping track in 1960 .
U.S. investors also are retrenching ; they unloaded about $ 85 billion worth of foreign holdings in the quarter , says the Commerce Department 's Bureau of Economic Analysis .
" We 've had a global panic .
Everyone is pulling their money home , " says economist Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute in Washington , D.C.
That 's bad for economic growth in the U.S. because it threatens to starve capital - hungry companies and entrepreneurs .
But it 's especially serious for emerging - market countries that rely heavily on outside financing .
Capital flows into countries such as South Korea , Turkey and Brazil were evaporating even before the mid-September Lehman Bros.
bankruptcy made things worse .
The reversal of private capital flows signals an abrupt end to a nearly two - decades - long era of financial globalization , says economist Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Private flows into and out of the U.S. for purchases of stocks , corporate bonds and federal agency bonds have dropped from around 18 % of economic output to near zero " in a remarkably short period of time , " Setser says .
The past five quarters — roughly since the August 2007 onset of the financial crisis — private foreign investors have been net sellers of U.S. securities .
The turnabout represents a dramatic change from the first half of 2007 when foreign purchases of U.S. securities other than Treasuries averaged about $ 250 billion per quarter .
The past two quarters also have seen an about - face in cross - border bank flows as institutional investors found lenders unwilling to extend credit .
In the first quarter of 2008 , foreigners deposited more than $ 79 billion with U.S. banks .
That flow reversed in the second quarter , as foreigners withdrew a staggering $ 256 billion , and the outflow continued in the third quarter with an additional $ 147 billion .
Likewise , banks in the U.S. brought home more than $ 151 billion in the quarter , as overseas institutions repaid loans .
" Institutional investors , including banks , across the board are pulling their capital back home , " says economist Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution .
One bright spot : Foreign central banks continue to spend heavily on U.S. government securities , allowing the U.S. to finance the gap between what it produces and consumes .

KINGSTON , Tennessee ( CNN ) --
The Environmental Protection Agency has found high levels of arsenic and heavy metals in two rivers in central Tennessee that are near the site of a spill that unleashed more than a billion gallons of coal waste .
Four days after the spill , the water is cloudy on the east bank of the Clinch River in Kingston , Tennessee .
The agency said it found " several heavy metals " in the water in levels that are slightly above safe drinking - water standards but " below concentrations " known to be harmful to humans .
" The one exception may be arsenic , " the agency said in a letter to an affected community .
" One sample of river water out of many taken indicated concentrations that are very high and further investigations are in progress . "
However , arsenic was not detected in a water intake facility near Kingston , Tennessee , where the spill happened , said EPA spokeswoman Laura Niles .
The metals were found in the Emory and Clinch rivers , near the site of a major spill last week that unleashed enough sludge to fill 1,660 Olympic - size swimming pools .
The EPA 's letter comes as the head of the largest public power company in the nation pledged to clean up the massive spill .
" This is not a time where TVA holds its head high , " said Tom Kilgore , president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority .
" But we wo n't hang our head , either , because that wo n't get the job done .
I 'm here to tell you that we will clean it up , and we will clean it up right . "
The sludge is a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion .
A retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority 's power plant in Kingston , about 40 miles west of Knoxville , contained the waste until a wall breached last Monday , sending the sludge downhill to damage 15 homes and cover at least 300 acres .
All residents in the area were evacuated , and three homes were deemed uninhabitable , according to the TVA .
The TVA 's initial estimate for the spill tripled from 1.8 million cubic yards , or more than 360 million gallons of sludge , to 5.4 million cubic yards , or more than 1 billion gallons .
The plant sits on the Clinch River , which is a tributary of the Tennessee River .
Video footage from the river , a popular fishing site , reveals piles of dead fish on its banks .
The TVA says that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge , though environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic .
TVA officials have said water quality tests from a nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water .
But coal operation critics remain concerned about the long - term effects of the spill , and residents have expressed concerns about drinking water , especially from wells .
Roane County Emergency Management Director Howie Rose said the county has asked the state and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to monitor groundwater from wells around the area .
He and Kilgore spoke at a town hall meeting Sunday .
Rose said the county has also requested air quality tests from the state and federal agencies .
Steve Ahlstedt , an independent aquatic biologist , told CNN that a spill of this magnitude probably will affect the area 's ecological balance .
" Once the ash has settled to the bottom of the rivers , all heavy metals will hang around for a long time , " he said .
" When coal releases into the water , the mussel population goes into deep freeze .
They are the ' canary in the coal mine . '
They are the main indicator of how healthy our water is . "

Wardens have successfully hand - reared a beaver in the UK for the first time .
The animal became ill just a few weeks after being born , but is now thriving thanks to the efforts of the staff at the Martin Mere nature reserve in Lancashire .
And I would n't want that one .
Here 's why : I would n't expect to win it , and if I did win it , I 'd expect to lose money on it .
I might take it just for the publicity if I were personally wealthy already and could afford to do so .
It 's hard to prove that a tree farm is a common carrier .
Common carriers ( hotels , restaurants , etc. ) can't deny services on the basis of race .
Employers can not discriminate on the basis of race .
The government can not discriminate on the basis of race .
But because this tree farm is neither a common carrier , nor an employer of the injured parties , nor the government , this would be a tough case to win , I think .
Generally speaking , individuals are free to discriminate , at will , without recourse .
This is a case for attorneys who are willing to do a whole lot of work for free ( ACLU , SCLC , etc. ) .
Of course , the behavior is reprehensible , and should be fought .
I just could n't afford to do it .

A militarized police state is coming to this country — into your own neighborhood , and with you and your family as its targets — unless you start , right now , to enforce the Constitution , as is your right and your duty .
In addition to their long - standing strategy of “ federalizing ” and para- militarizing State and Local police departments under the General Government ’s Department of Homeland Security , the big brains in the Disgrace of Columbia have two additional schemes openly in the works : ( i ) the overtly military , which depends upon the deployment of the Armed Forces as domestic police ; and ( ii ) the covertly military , which depends upon the creation of SOME new , ostensibly civilian , “ national - security force . ”
The question is , “ What should patriotic Americans do about this situation ? ”

BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
An Australian author was sentenced Monday to three years in prison in Thailand after falling foul of a Thai law that makes it a crime to insult the country 's royal family .
Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell on Monday .
Harry Nicolaides was arrested last August over a 2005 book called " Verisimilitude , " which includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that the authorities deemed a violation of the Lese Majeste law .
Nicolaides , 41 , was bombarded with questions from foreign journalists as he arrived at the court Monday , wearing shackles as he stepped from a prison bus .
In tears , he said he would plead guilty .
" Truth is stranger than fiction , " he said .
" It 's been an ordeal for months .
It feels like a bad dream . "
Watch shackled Nicolaides at court »
The Thai Criminal Court originally sentenced Nicolaides to six years in jail but cut the punishment in half because of the guilty plea .
He listened calmly as the verdict was translated to him .
After hearing his verdict Nicolaides said : " I wish my family the best . "
Watch Nicolaides ' brother 's reaction »
One of his lawyers said no decision had been made about whether to appeal or seek a royal pardon .
King Bhumibol Adulydej has pardoned foreigners in other similar cases in the past .
CNN has chosen not to repeat the allegations made by Nicolaides because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand .
Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003 , lecturing at two universities about tourism .
He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31 last year .
It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him .
" I think there are individuals who have exploited an obscure law for their own self - interest , " he said .
Only 50 copies of the book were published , and only seven were sold .
The law Nicolaides was convicted of breaking is section 112 , known as the Lese Majeste law .
It says : " Whoever defames , insults or threatens the King , the Queen , the Heir - apparent or the Regent , shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years . "
Thailand 's king is highly revered in this Buddhist nation , but even he has said in the past that he can be criticized .
Thailand 's new prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , also told CNN he is concerned about the misuse of the Lese Majeste law .
" There are cases in the past where this law has been abused for political purposes , and I agree this has to stop , " he said .
Despite the rhetoric there 's little sign the prime minister will change the law .
Other cases are pending against both foreigners and Thais .

As the first African - American president in United States history takes office , researchers have shown that it may be possible to scientifically reduce racial bias .
After being trained to distinguish between similar black male faces , Caucasian test subjects showed greater racial tolerance on a test designed to to measure unconscious bias .
The results are still preliminary , have yet to be replicated , and the real - world effects of reducing bias in a controlled laboratory setting are not clear .
But for all those caveats , the findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that science can battle racism .
" Any time you can get people to treat people as individuals , you reduce the effect of stereotypes , " said Brown University cognitive scientist Michael Tarr .
" It wo n't solve racism , but it could have profound real - world effects . "
Tarr 's findings overlap with other results suggesting that the key to reducing racial bias — at least in a short - term , laboratory setting
— is exposure to people in personalized ways that challenge stereotypes .
This is hardly a new notion : it 's the essence of the contact hypothesis , formulated in the mid-20th century and the basis of integrated schooling .
But unlike carefully structured social mixing , with precisely controlled conditions of interdependence and equality , Tarr and others raise the possibility of a a lab - based shortcut to bias reduction .
Underpinning this research is the Implicit Association Test , used by psychologists to measure deep - rooted , often unconscious biases .
During the test , subjects are measured on the time it takes to associate faces with positive or negative words .
If , for example , someone more quickly associates negative words with minority rather than white faces , they 're likely to have a bias — a bias that translates into a tendency to hire same - race workers , choose same - race partners , and find minority defendants guilty .
If the bias can be changed , perhaps the behavior will follow .
" The entire idea of neural plasticity is a new one .
We did n't think that the brain was capable of change as we now know it to be , " said Mahzarin Banaji , a Harvard University psychologist whose online Project Implicit has administered 4.5 million bias tests in the last decade .
" The bias stuff we learn is heading in that direction , telling us that there is the ability to change . "
" It 's remarkable that our brain is so flexible that 10 hours of training will affect something that is the product of your whole life experience , " said Tarr , who hopes his work will lead to race training for people working in potentially race - sensitive situations , such as police officers , social workers and immigration officials .
In a study published Tuesday in Public Library of Science ONE ,
Tarr 's team put 20 Caucasian college students through ten hours of face - identification training , testing their ability to discern previously - seen from unknown faces .
Students with the largest improvements in face memory also showed significant improvements on a variation of the Implicit Association Test .
According to Banaji , a brief talk about working for women suffices to reduce gender bias .
City University of New York psychologist Curtis Hardin showed that having black experimenters administer a test produced lower bias scores among white subjects .
In one of the few attempts to measure bias change and brain activity , Princeton University psychologist Susan Fiske simultaneously presented test subjects with pictures of black people and vegetables .
When asked what the person in the picture liked to eat , activity in the amygdala — a brain region that modulates fear — subsided .
" Amygdala activation goes away as soon as you start to think of people as individuals , " said Fiske .
These results are promising , but it 's too soon to say whether they 're long - lasting , or will translate to real - world improvements in behavior .
" Our biggest concern is that if we have participants come into a lab and do some exercises , then the context is so specific that it may only work if they see an African - American in a lab , " said Bertram Gawronski , a University of Western Ontario cognitive scientist .
" It 's really important that it 's done in different contexts , and that people are repeatedly bombarded with counter - attitudinal information . "
For at least the next four years , however , the United States will collectively undergo a real - world experiment in stereotype defiance .
" The first black president — that 's going to have a huge effect on things that come to mind , " said Ohio State University psychologist Richard Petty .
" Instead of just negative associations , there will be all sorts of positive associations . "
Let 's just hope they last .

An employee of a south Phoenix social - services agency was arrested Monday on charges of embezzling nearly $ 200,000 in government checks intended to fund parenting programs .
Rosalie Magana was indicted on three counts of theft and one count of fraud after authorities say she stole the checks from Friendly House in December 2006 and January 2007 .
Two other women were arrested and sentenced in 2007 for depositing the checks in a credit union , but investigators were unable to link the thefts to Magana until last week .
Friendly House is a 90 - year - old social - services agency in south Phoenix .
It offers a range of programs , including job training , adult education , family counseling , immigration - law assistance , elder care , a charter school and a food bank .
Magana , 60 , has worked in the finance department for six years , according to agency CEO Luis Ibarra .
She also picked up the mail .
Three checks totaling $ 198,000 from the Arizona Department of Economic Security went missing in early 2007 .
Magana was indicted last week .
Postal inspectors arrested her at Friendly House on Monday .
Bond was set at $ 5,000 .

The very fact that Google put Aaron Boodman on the Chromium project should have told us something .
Aaron invented the popular GreaseMonkey add - on for Firefox , and on Saturday he announced the publication of a design document for adding extensions to Google Chrome .
The lack of extensions for Chrome has been a major barrier to adoption of the new browser .
I ’ve been using Chrome as my default browser since I reviewed it back in September , and add - ons are perhaps my most missed Firefox feature — with the possible exception of RSS autodiscovery and customizable subscription .
Many Firefox users identify a single extension as the main reason they have n’t moved to Chrome : AdBlock .
For Google to allow an extension in its browser that would block its own ads might seem like cutting off your nose to spite your face , but it appears that these users may get their wish .
AdBlock is specifically mentioned as a use case in the design document for the new feature .
Many of the design goals seem specifically designed to overcome the frailties of Firefox add - ons .
Here are a few that scream out , “ I ’m looking at you , Firefox ! ” :
We should not need to disable deployed extensions when we release new versions of Chromium .
Extensions should not be able to crash or hang the browser process .
Chromium should assign blame to extensions that are overusing resources via tools like the task manager and web inspector .
Poorly behaving extensions should be easy to disable .
Extensions need to be loaded immediately at startup , ideally before pages are loaded , yet should n’t affect startup time .
Most extensions should be able to load in place without forcing a browser restart or even a page reload when they are installed .
Similar to Google Chrome , it is important for security that extensions be able to silently update .
The authors mention that each extension should run in its own process , just as Chrome handles separate web pages — and that these processes should be “ sandboxed ” to prevent access to the local machine .
The one exception would be content scripts ( like GreaseMonkey ) that would have to run in the same process as the content they ’re modifying ( really ?
you could n’t pipe it through ? ) .
The “ silent update ” facility will be driven by a central repository of extension updates .
A central service will also keep track of known harmful extensions .
The browser can check this service to disable those extensions .
The APIs have not yet been specified at all , other than to mention some hopeful categories : “ toolbars , sidebars , content scripts ( for GreaseMonkey - like functionality ) , and content filtering ( for parental filters , malware filters , or adblock - like functionality . ”
Each extension will be accompanied by a manifest , written in JSON , which seems to be the most detailed part of the proposal so far .
No word yet on when we can expect more .
Personally , I ca n’t wait .
The new conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has forced dozens of rangers to flee Africa 's oldest national park , leaving hundreds of threatened mountain gorillas at the mercy of rebel fighters and poachers .
Wildlife officers escaped into the forest when fighters loyal to renegade general Laurent Nkunda occupied part of the park as they launched their march on Goma , the main city in the east of DR Congo .
Set up in 1925 , Virunga covers some 7,800 square kilometres .
Its varied terrain includes two of Africa 's most active volcanoes , swamps and snow - capped mountains .
It is also home to more than half of the world 's 700 remaining mountain gorillas as well as 20,000 hippopotamus , according to the World Wildlife Fund .
UNESCO named Virunga a World Heritage site in 1979 and placed it on the organisation 's endangered list in 1994 when a first civil war broke out in the country .
DR Congo's Environment Minister Jose Endundo Mononge said that the fighting between the army and Nkunda 's rebels poses a great threat to the park and would hit tourism income , while opening up worrying opportunities for poachers .
" In just 2007 , we recorded the slaughter of 15 mountain gorillas ... and more than 20,000 antelopes , " he told a press conference in Kinshasa .
Park rangers told how they fled Virunga on October 26 after Nkunda 's forces moved in as part of their campaign to take over Nord - Kivu province .
" We were at our posts when we heard an exchange of gunfire between the rebels and the army .
At around 6:30 am , the gunshots got closer so we fled into the forest , " said Desire , a 31 - year - old ranger .
Benjamin , a ranger at Kalengera , 60 kilometres north of Goma , told how his father was killed by rebels and how he has no news of his wife and five children .
Benjamin spent four days hiding in the forest before arriving in Goma a week ago .
" There are a lot of people in the forest .
Not just park rangers , but families as well .
Some have died there ; from exhaustion , lack of food and water , " he said .
" The rebels came and started killing people .
My father lost his life over there .
I was hidden in a house with friends .
We fled into the forest while my family stayed in the village and they are still there .
" They said that my father has been buried but I was n't there to see it . "
Desire and 52 others headed for the town of Rumangabo as Nkunda 's National Congress for the Defence of the People ( CNDP ) took territory around Goma , 50 kilometres to the south of the park .
Desire and 180 of the park 's 680 rangers are now hiding in a small camp set up on the outskirts of Goma by the Congolese National Park Authorities .
" We spent three days and two nights in the forest , " Desire explained .
" We survived by eating fruit , leaves and drinking water in the volcanic rocks . "
Jules , the 35 - year - old head of an anti-poaching unit , took cover at his grandfather 's house in Goma after having taken a more dangerous route to the north of the city - straight through the area where rebels and pro-government militia had clashed .
" We fled and spent two days in the forest .
We ate bean leaves .
We had no water .
It did rain but we had no way of storing it , " he said .
" We left our uniforms and we headed back towards Kiwanja .
But the Mai - Mai ( a pro-government militia ) had already started an attack against the rebels . "
Jules was eventually escorted back to Goma by a UN convoy .

Robert Evans smiled as he was pictured outside Mold Crown Court
A rapist who photographed his victim and who a judge said showed her " no mercy " has been jailed for six years .
Mold Crown Court heard how Robert Evans , 40 , from Wrexham , stripped the woman , in her 20s , then attacked her in a bedroom .
Police were alerted after a neighbour heard the woman 's screams .
Evans , who admitted rape and assault , photographed the woman 's body on his phone and within hours boasted of having sex with her in a text message .
Prosecutor Karen Mullin said Evans tried to silence the woman 's screams by putting his hand over her mouth .
She added : " He also put a cushion over her mouth , which covered her nose , and he applied pressure .
She could not breath . "
A neighbour told police they had heard screams , as well as the woman shouting : " Why are you doing this ? "
Scratch marks
The court heard the victim tried to escape , naked , but Evans stopped her and assaulted her again .
He was arrested the same night , and police discovered he had scratch marks on his face where the woman had tried to fight him off .
The court heard he took pictures on his mobile phone then , before he was arrested , sent text messages to a man where he spoke about having sex with the woman and taking photographs .
He admitted rape , sexual assault and assault by penetration following the incident in November 2008 .
Judge John Rogers QC ordered Evans to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life , and told him : " These offences were committing during a bout of persistent violence in which you showed her no mercy . "
Sen .
Barack Obama ’s campaign manager told donors Wednesday the candidate will need $ 39 million to compete in Florida and said battleground - state voter - registration numbers are a good sign for the Democratic nominee .
David Plouffe said in a Web video he would “ open up the hood a little bit ” to reveal a number that campaigns usually keep secret so he could underscore the “ sheer magnitude ” of the race between Mr. Obama and Republican Sen.
John McCain .
He said the spending on Florida television and radio ads , turnout operations , staff , mailers and fliers and office space “ is going to cost a little over $ 39 million , which is a big number . ”
“ It just lets you know why every dollar that you send us is so important , ” he said .
“ We ’re trying to leave nothing to chance . ”
The video appeal came as a new CNN poll of the state showed Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain tied at 48 percent of the vote .
However , the poll of 907 registered voters was a bit of an outlier - every other poll taken in Florida since Sept. 6 , all of which surveyed likely voters , showed Mr. McCain leading by five to eight percentage points .

Obama urged to sharpen rhetoric
The $ 39 million figure is nearly half the $ 84 million Mr. McCain will be allowed to spend in the entire country over the next seven weeks .
Mr. Obama had $ 77 million cash on hand at the end of August after raising a record $ 66 million that month .
President Bush won Florida in 2004 by about 380,000 votes .
Mr. Plouffe detailed the more than 500,000 registered black voters and 900,000 registered young voters in Florida who did not go to the polls four years ago .
“ We have enough base voters in Florida to win the election , if we can just turn them out , ” he said .
He lauded “ remarkable ” voter - registration figures in Pennsylvania , where there has been a “ net gain ” of 375,000 Democrats .
There have been smaller but noticeable gains in swing - state Nevada as well .
“ That makes John McCain ’s margin for error even smaller and gives us a better electorate , ” Mr. Plouffe said .
In an e-mail accompanying the video , Mr. Plouffe tells supporters the details “ have n’t been shared publicly before . ”
“ Our fight in the battleground states is going to be tougher than a lot of you may think , ” he wrote , adding that to meet the $ 39 million Florida goal , the campaign is aiming for 50,000 new donors by midnight Friday .
Obama supporter Rep. Debbie Wasserman - Schultz of Florida said the figure appeared to be in line with the general amounts needed to compete in the state , given its 11 different media markets .
Republican Gov. Charlie Crist spent nearly $ 20 million , a record , and was aided by $ 42 million from the Republican Party of Florida to win the governor ’s race in 2006 , according to the Orlando Sentinel .
Mrs. Schultz predicted the margin would be “ absolutely razor thin . ”
“ We ’re a 50 - 50 state ; our state is purple , ” she said .
“ We ’re trying to turn it blue . ”

Banco Santander , the Spanish owner of Alliance & Leicester , Abbey and Bradford & Bingley 's saving business , plans to cut 1,900 British jobs next year , adding to the toll the credit crunch has taken on financial workers .
The group , which shocked the market with an emergency € 7.2bn ( £ 6.4 bn ) rights issue last month , is nonetheless one of the European banks to have come out best from the financial crisis so far .
It has rescued by acquisition both Alliance & Leicester and parts of Bradford & Bingley as the small banks faced troubles .
It has owned Abbey since 2004 .
Santander said the job cuts were part of plans to save £ 180 m by the end of 2011 following the Alliance & Leicester deal .
It expects the move to have a minimal impact on customer - facing roles in branches , because the focus of the reductions will be on back - office functions and across operational and head office sites .
There has been much blather by Bush apologists decrying and denouncing as ' Bush - haters ' those who seek the prosecution of George W Bush .
This is nothing but blatant , unabashed name - calling in lieu of having a viable argument against appropriate legal action .
It is a well - rehearsed tactic meant to incite emotional response divorced from logic .
The call for the prosecution of George W Bush is not made out of hatred for the man .
It is a rational , legitimate response to the hateful actions for which Messrs .
Bush and Cheney are directly responsible .
That , for many , the crime and the criminal are conflated ( as is likely the case with Bush apologists ) and seen as one and the same is of small account .
That erroneous conflation does not diminish the righteousness of the call for justice nor does it obfuscate the legal arguments .
The facts are well - known .
More than 4,000 US men and women have died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for dubious aims and for reasons proved false .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi men , women and children – by some accounts more than a million - are dead as a result of the illegal and immoral invasion and occupation of their country .
Untold thousands of Afghani men , women and children are dead as result of the invasion of that nation .
Both of these countries are in shambles with millions of people reduced to the pitiable plight of internal and external refugees .
Torture , extraordinary rendition , extra- judicial incarceration , illegal wire - tapping and surveillance of US citizens , and the loss of habeas corpus for US citizens ; all were the official policy of the Bush administration .
If this has all been the result of a few ' bad apples ' then those ' bad apples ' have included those at the ' top of the tree ' by the tacit admission of Bush / Cheney themselves and the clearly stated admission of Susan Crawford , of the Guantanamo military commissions , and former NSA analyst , Russell Tice , amongst many others .

Manfred Nowak , the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture holds Mr Bush and former Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld responsible for the brutal interrogation methods and the inhuman treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo .
Mr Nowak stated " One should not quibble , it was torture , " and asserting " The evidence is on the table , " urged the indictment of both Bush and Rumsfeld for their role in the torture and abuse of prisoners in Gitmo .
These proposed indictments would surely lead to subsequent investigations of other authorized sites of torture .

Some have squeamishly implored that we simply ' Let it go ! ' as if those advocating the prosecution of Bush and Cheney are nothing more than kids contesting bad behavior on the playground .
One wonders if Bush apologists would offer the same sage advice had the perpetrators of such death and destruction been Latin - American dictators or Asian despots or Soviet commissars or National Socialist party members .
What were the Nuremberg trials all about if not to provide legal precedent ?
Apologists now urge us to apply a ' let - bygones - be - bygones ' attitude toward those who are suspected of committing crimes against humanity simply because the charges are now leveled at American leaders .
This is extremely hypocritical , to say the least .
That such hypocritical inaction would be extremely dangerous and irresponsible is also clear .
The failure to prosecute George W Bush would provide a de facto immunity from prosecution thus emboldening other ideological authoritarians to violate Constitutional precepts and further undermine our fragile American republic .
The crimes of Bush , Cheney and members of their administration are crimes against us , the people ; the people he duped , the people he mislead , the people displaced , the people tortured , the people wounded , the people murdered as a result of the policies of his administration .
If we want to return to a rule of law , if we hope to return to a democratic republic based on life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness , freedom and justice for all , we have to face the unpleasant facts .
Foremost is this : by failing to bring them to justice , we are complicitous in their heinous acts .
I , for one , refuse to be an accomplice in their crimes .
That I am one of many is becoming more and more obvious .
In addition to those cited previously , Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , as reported at this site and by Fox News , has intimated that prosecutions , though unpopular , might be unavoidable .
Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , the chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee said " There needs to be , I believe , an accounting of torture in this country , " stating that he had suggested to Attorney General - nominee Eric Holder that he appoint " an outside person who 's got real credibility " to continue to investigate .

Now , here is where the rubber meets the road .
We can't just think since Obama has taken office everything will be a hunky - dory springtime stroll in a rose garden .
That is a ridiculous notion ; to think one man – no matter how charismatic – will carry our hopes to fulfillment without our pitching in to help .
( That mind - set is suitable for a king but not an elected president . )
We , the citizens of the United States , must envision , engender , inspire , and empower the change we seek .
We must be the change .
Moreover , an integral part of that change must be a return to the rule of law and the concurrent , rightful expectation that law - breakers will be brought to justice .
As citizens of a free and democratic society , each of us has the duty to participate actively in our democracy , not simply as ballot - casters , but as commissioned guardians of our freedom , our liberty and our Constitution .
Speaking for those who seek the prosecution of George W Bush , I offer this declaration : we want justice .
We want our Republic back .
We want our self - respect back .
This is why there is a hue and cry calling for the arrest of George W Bush .
We must insist that George W Bush , Richard B Cheney and all of their administrative accomplices be brought to justice for the sake of our republic and our way of life .
We must demand it .
Whatever it takes ; short of armed insurrection .
Each Christmas , the M - Network blogs celebrates the 12 days of Christmas with 12 posts on personal finance .
Of course , these are n’t the real 12 days of Christmas , but since those come after Christmas it ’s rather anti-climactic .
We ’ll be posting from December 1st to December 12th .
Today , I ’m introducing three worksheets which can help you manage your financial life .
If you have n’t started yet , the New Year is a great time to get your finances in order !
The first two are spreadsheets , the third is a Word document ( since it ’s most likely to be modified and should be easiest to modify ) .
If you do n’t have Microsoft Word / Excel / Office , you can still use them .
Just get the free Open Office suite .
Basic Budget Spreadsheet
This basic budget spreadsheet ( [ download #8 #nohits ] ) is based off the one I use .
Jeff at My Supercharged Life points out that a rigid budget normally dies quickly .
Take that into consideration , look for ways to give yourself flexibility of possible and remember that it ’s ok to spend more in one area as long as you reduce in others .
That ’s why the sheet has a balance tally at the bottom .
As long as that ’s 0 , you ’re perfect .
If it ’s positive , then you have extra in your accounts and if it ’s negative , you spent more than you earned .
The budgeted amount areas have numbers such as $ 100 pre-entered as placeholders .
They bear no reflection on what I think a budget should be .
Simply enter your budgeted amount in the budget column , your actual spending in the next column , and you ’ll find out how much you have left in the third .
It all adds up at the bottom .
At the top , there is a section for income .
I put in two incomes , since it ’s easier to delete a row than add one .
I added a third section for misc .
income from such things as blogging , freelance , consulting , and odd jobs .
You can also put any planned withdrawals from savings in the third line .
There are sections for variable monthly spending ( groceries , gas ) and fixed monthly spending ( cable bill , rent / mortgage payment , insurance payments and money saved for biannual / annual insurance payments ) .
Fixed monthly spending includes debts .
You may want to budget the amount of your snowball or just snowflake on as you decide .
Either way , your income should still equal your outflow .
There ’s onepagefor each month , since your needs will probably vary month - to - month .
You can download it here : [ download#8#nohits ]
Blogger / Freelance Spreadsheet
This one ( [ download #9#nohits ] ) has already been introduced on the blog , but I ’ve updated it for 2009 .
It has two pages , one for recording income from advertisers and the other for recording specific consulting jobs .
The first allows you to easily enter a series of payments from one advertiser or spread out effective payments which were made in a lump sum .
So not only can you keep track of your earnings , you know when a pre-paid ad is due to come down .

It ’s that time of year again .
The Oscar nominees have been announced , and that means that the Oscar Best Picture Marathon will be coming to a theater near me in about a month .
Until then , I shall be dreaming of a day filled with free popcorn and all its buttery goodness .
For those not in the know , AMC Theaters plays a marathon of all the Oscar nominated movies for best picture ( hence the name ) .
In addition to the movies , you get a cool collector ’s pass , and , best of all , all the free popcorn you can cram in your face hole .
I attended my first marathon last year and enjoyed it so much that I decided that it was something I would like to do again .
This year , rather than just providing a recap of each movie after the fact , I decided to go above and beyond by providing some insight beforehand .
You ’re welcome .
So for those who do n’t have any idea about this year ’s Best Picture nominees , I have provided the list of nominees along with their directors ( all of whom were also nominated in the Best Director category ) , as well as a brief plot synopsis , written as a haiku because , why not ?
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button – David Fincher
A wrinkled baby ,
Turns out he ages backwards ,
An adverse journey .
Frost / Nixon – Ron Howard Disgraced President ,
Gets some time in the hot seat ,
A battle of wits .
Milk – Gus Van Sant Openly gay man ,
Running for public office ,
A hero for all ?
The Reader – Stephen Daldry A woman on trial ,
Crimes against humanity ,
Hiding a secret .
Slumdog Millionaire – Danny Boyle
Poor kid on game show ,
How does he know the answers ?
A story of love .
This list has some movies that I ’m pretty excited about seeing , although there ’s a couple movies that I would ’ve liked to have seen on this list that are n’t , but we ’ll get to that later .
For now , I ’ll just break down my thoughts and level of anticipation for each of the nominees .
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button :
The premise of this movie is certainly offbeat , but based on reviews it apparently does n’t add to the film and ends up just being a gimmick .
Despite that , I like Fincher ( Seven , Fight Club , Zodiac ) so I ’m confident in that regard .
Level of Anticipation : B
Frost / Nixon :
On a whole , I find Ron Howard ’s work to be a bit “ Meh ” , but I will admit that I ’m interested in this movie .
I like the idea of putting ‘ the Man ’ in check , and the fact that it ’s based on actual events makes it all the more appealing .
Level of Anticipation : A-
Milk :
I seem to be in a minority in saying that I like Gus Van Sant , and I ’m alright with that .
I ’m looking forward to his return to something mainstream , well , sort of mainstream any way .
And if this is like anything he ’s done over the past several years , it ’ll be wonderfully shot , if nothing else .
Level of Anticipation : A
The Reader :
Honestly , the only reason that I have any interest in this movie is because of Roger Deakins .
He was nominated in the Cinematography category for his work on this movie .
He also received two nominations last year for No Country for Old Men and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford .
Level of Anticipation : C +
Slumdog Millionaire :
Having won a handful of awards already ( see Golden Globes , et cetera ) this movie is the ‘ big dog ’ of the nominees .
Because of this , I ’m interested in seeing what all the hype is about .
It does look like an inspiring movie with an interesting premise .
Level of Anticipation : A-
The Oscars , as we all know , are notable for their ‘ snubs ’ and this year is no exception .
This year , two unlikely movies that managed to balance the fine line of critical and mass acclaim made bids for a Best Picture nomination but came up short .
I ’m , of course , speaking of WALL-E and The Dark Knight .
It would appear that both movies suffered for not being standard Oscar genres , although if you ask me , both of these movies had more than what it takes to make the cut , but what do I know ?
At least WALL - E is a given to win the Best Animated Feature and The Dark Knight should take home a couple technical awards , as well as a Best Supporting Actor statue for the late Heath Ledger .
For those interested in enjoying the festivities , tickets go on sale today , and the showcase will take place February 21 .
And for those curious about which movie I think is going to win the Best Picture Oscar , I do n’t know .
I have n’t seen any of them yet .
Ask me after I ’ve had a day ’s worth of movie theater popcorn .

Trapping any inflow of productivity since 2008
The Thai military has been accused of seizing hundreds of refugees , towing them out to sea and “ leaving them to die ” without engines and barely any food or water .
Aid groups said that hundreds of water - borne refugees from the Burma - Bangladesh border were arrested and held on an island in the Andaman Sea before being forced out into the ocean .
Around 500 are now being treated for severe dehydration after being rescued by the Indian coast guard .
Survivors have said that scores of other refugees are still unaccounted for
“ The Thai government is taking highly vulnerable people and risking their lives for political gain , ” said Sean Garcia , a lawyer with the group Refugees International .
“ It should be engaging the Burmese government on improving conditions at home … if it wants to stem these flows . ”
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The refugees that were allegedly abandoned belong to the Rohingya group , a stateless Muslim minority that live on the border between Burma and Bangladesh , in particular in the west of Burma in Rakhine state .
The Rohingya have long been persecuted by the Burmese authorities , which have banned them from either marrying or travelling without permission and from owning property .
They are even denied citizenship .
As a result , large number of the group have regularly sought to escape to neighbouring Bangladesh .
In 1978 , around 200,000 of the group fled there after a particularly brutal crackdown against them , known as the Dragon King operation .
In 1992 a similar number fled to the Cox ’s Bazaar area of Bangladesh , though many were subsequently forced to return to Burma .
Experts say that with the refugees camps in Bangladesh long having stopped taking people , the Rohingya are now seeking to travel to Thailand and then make their way overland to Malaysia , a Muslim majority nation .
They are also seeking to reach other countries in the region , including Indonesia .
The latest flood of refugees began in December .
At the end of the year , several hundreds refugees were feared drowned after they jumped into the sea after their boat broke down .
Indian coastguard officials found some bodies washed ashore .
Campaigners say this week ’s seizure of hundreds of refugees marks a new policy by the Thai authorities , who have now tasked the military rather than the immigration service with countering the flood of Rohingya .
“ We have heard from survivors that their boats were towed out to sea and then they were abandoned with two drums of water and four bags of rice - basically left to die , ” said Chris Lewa , a Bangkok - based campaigner who runs the Arakan Project group .
“ It is very brutal and that is why the Thai government needs to stop it now and find an alternative solution . ”
With the refugees fleeing towards more and more countries , the issue is to be discussed at next month ’s ASEAN summit in Thailand .
But campaigners say that only once Burma recognises the Rohingya as citizens and stops discriminating against them , will they stop seeking to leave .
“ The Rohingya have taken to the sea because they are desperate , ” said Mr Garcia , of Refugees International .
“ They have no hope for a better life in Burma .
Pushing them back out to sea is not an effective deterrent . ”
Official figures claimed that 1,225 refugees arrived in Thailand in 2005 - 2006 .
They were 2,763 in 2006 - 2007 and 4,886 in 2007 - 2008 .
From 26 November to 25 December last year , 659 Rohingya were seized in eight separate incidents .
While official sources in Thailand have confirmed to the BBC that the refugees were forced back out to sea , the immigration service deny such a policy .
“ Thai immigration office will never send illegal immigrants back to their countries by putting them back in the boat then let them go , ” Police Lieutenant General Chatchawal Suksomjit , a commander of the Thailand Immigration Office , told reporters .

A Princeton - led team of researchers has discovered an entirely new mechanism for making common electronic materials emit laser beams .
The finding could lead to lasers that operate more efficiently and at higher temperatures than existing devices , and find applications in environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics .
" This discovery provides a new insight into the physics of lasers , " said Claire Gmachl , who led the study .
Gmachl , an electrical engineer , is the director of the Mid-Infrared Technologies for Health and the Environment ( MIRTHE ) center .
The phenomenon was discovered in a type of device called quantum cascade laser , in which an electric current flowing through a specially designed material produces a laser beam .
Gmachl 's group discovered that a quantum cascade laser they had built generated a second beam with very unusual properties , including the need for less electrical power than the conventional beam .
" If we can turn off the conventional beam , we will end up with a better laser , which makes more efficient use of electrical power , " said Gmachl .
The team that conducted the study includes Gmachl 's graduate student Kale Franz , who built the laser that revealed the new phenomenon , and Stefan Menzel , a graduate student from the University of Sheffield , UK , who unearthed the unique properties of the phenomenon during an internship at Princeton University last summer .
The study was published online in Nature Photonics on Dec. 14 .
Quantum cascade lasers are small and efficient sources of mid-infrared laser beams , which are leading to new devices for medical diagnostics and environmental sensing .

The light emitted by a laser differs fundamentally from light produced by common sources such as the sun , fire , or electric lamps .
According to the field of physics called quantum electrodynamics , light is made up of particles called photons .
Common sources of light emit photons that are in a random order , like crowds milling about a busy marketplace .
In contrast , photons in a laser are " in sync " with each other , like a music band marching in formation .
This property , called coherence , allows laser light to shine in an intense , narrow beam of a single , very pure color .
One way to produce a laser beam is to pass an electric current through a semiconductor such as gallium arsenide .
The electric current pumps energy into the material , forcing a large number of its electrons to a higher energy level than normal .
Under certain conditions , these electrons drop to a lower level of energy , and emit the extra energy in the form of synchronized photons of light .
This is the mechanism underlying lasers used in CD writers , laser pointers and other common electronic devices .
The laser used in the Princeton study is a special type called a quantum cascade laser .
Built at Princeton University 's nanofabrication facility , the device is about one - tenth as thick as a human hair and 3 millimeters long .
Despite its tiny size , it is made of hundreds of layers of different semiconductor materials .
Each layer is only a few atoms thick .
In this device , electrons " cascade " down through the layers as they lose energy and give off synchronized photons .
In an earlier study published in Applied Physics Letters in June 2007 , Franz , Gmachl and others had reported that a quantum cascade laser they had built unexpectedly emitted a second laser beam of slightly smaller wavelength than the main one .
Further studies by Menzel and others revealed that the second beam could not be explained by any existing theory of quantum cascade lasers .
Unlike a conventional semiconductor laser , the second beam grew stronger as the temperature increased , up to a point .
Further , it seemed to compete with the " normal " laser , growing weaker as the latter strengthened when more electric current was supplied .
" It 's a new mechanism of light emission from semiconductor lasers , " said Franz .
To explain this mechanism , the researchers invoked a quantum property of electrons called momentum .
In the conventional view of quantum cascade lasers , only electrons of nearly zero momentum participate in " lasing " ( producing laser light ) .
Further , a substantial number of electrons has to attain the same level of energy and momentum – be in a so - called " quasi- equilibrium " condition -- before they can participate in laser action .
In contrast , studies by Gmachl 's group showed that the second laser beam originated from electrons of lower energy , but higher momentum that were not in equilibrium .
" It showed , contrary to what was believed , that electrons are useful for laser emission even when they are in highly non-equilibrium states , " said Franz .
The new laser phenomenon has some interesting features .
For instance , in a conventional laser relying on low momentum electrons , electrons often reabsorb the emitted photons , and this reduces overall efficiency .
In the new type of laser , however , this absorption is reduced by 90 % , said Franz .
This could potentially allow the device to run at lower currents , and also makes it less vulnerable to temperature changes .
" It should let us dramatically improve laser performance , " he said .
The device used in the study does not fully attain this level of performance , because the conventional , low - efficiency laser mechanism dominates .
To take full advantage of the new discovery , therefore , the conventional mechanism would need to be turned off .
The researchers have started to work on methods to achieve this outcome , said Franz .
Unlike other lasers , quantum cascade lasers operate in the mid- and far - infrared range , and can be used to detect even minute traces of water vapor , ammonia , nitrogen oxides , and other gases that absorb infrared light .
As a result , these devices are finding applications in air quality monitoring , medical diagnostics , homeland security , and other areas that require extremely sensitive detection of different chemicals .
The new discovery should help make these devices smaller , more efficient , and more sensitive , said Gmachl .

C overwhelmingly proved the most popular programming language for thousands of new open - source projects in 2008 , according to license tracker Black Duck Software .
The company , which monitors 180,000 projects on nearly 4,000 sites , said almost half - 47 per cent - of new projects last year used C. Black Duck said 17,000 new open - source projects were created in total .
Next in popularity after C came Java , with 28 per cent .
In scripting , JavaScript came top with 20 per cent , followed by Perl on 18 per cent .
PHP attracted just 11 per cent and Ruby six per cent .
The numbers are a surprise as open - source PHP has proved popular as a web - site development language , while Ruby 's been a hot topic for many .
Overall , most projects used more than one language .
Black Duck also listed the top 10 new open - source projects from 2008 in terms of number of releases .
Top was the Gnutella - based peer - to - peer file - sharing Beacon Cache , with 191 downloadable releases .
Second was Anime management software AnimeVision , while Wordpress Themes and Plugins , for the popular blogging platform , was third .
A testament to the unreliable and inconsistent nature of the beast that can be open - source , 57 per cent of new projects offered just a single downloadable release .
The rest averaged nearly four , with the top 185 managing at least one release per month of the year .
Black Duck qualified its figures by saying some projects - like Beacon Cache - leverage previous projects , such as Gnutella noting there 's tremendous re-use in open source .
Mobile saw 120 new open - source projects , with 40 targeting the iPhone .
The number - one project was 2D famework cocos2d - iphone , followed by zipper image viewer iphone - comicviewer and iphone - com , for iPhone applications that use Win32 serial COM ports . ®
There was a time when the Linux community used BitKeeper as its source code control system , after switching from the open - source CVS .
But then Samba developer Andrew Tridgell figured out you could telnet to a BitKeeper server , type " HELP , " and get a list of commands .
Upon hearing of Tridgell 's daring hack , BitMover - the company that maintains BitKeeper - got all license - revokey on the community , changing the terms of the agreement and demanding that Linux developers start paying for its software .
There were other free source control systems available , and the popular one was Subversion , which was billed by its creators as " CVS done right . "
If you 've never used CVS , the dark humor in that statement is that it does n't make sense .
Labeling something " CVS done right " is about the same as labeling something " a urinary tract infection done right . ”
Many developers , Linus included , find CVS and the like completely unacceptable .
Now , the Legend of Linus is part truth and part mythology .
Nobody really knows where the facts end and the tall stories begin .
But one common theme in all of them is that Linus has the power of many men .
While that multiple is up for debate , the editorial staff here at The Reg has decreed that Linus has the power of ten .
It 's a conservative estimate , but it keeps our fact checkers happy .
With the power of ten men , Linus reacted swiftly .
Rather than cry about it like a little bitch , he created his own source control system called git .
In a self - deprecating style that only a developer on Linus 's level could pull off , Linus said , " I 'm an egotistical bastard , and I name all my projects after myself .
First Linux , now git . ”
( We Americans do n't really get the joke , because while “ git ” is British slang for a worthless person , we have come to acknowledge the fundamental law of British insults : do n't be insulting ) .
Git , which works very differently from other source control systems like CVS and Subversion , took the freetard world by storm when it came out .
Many enterprise developers just saw git 's popularity as open source programmers suckling from the teat of Linus , but it kept growing .
Programmers started to use git for their side projects and got hooked .
Git is gaining traction because given all other source control systems out there , git is the superior technology .
One of the most compelling features is the cheap , local branching .
With git , it 's very easy to branch your entire codebase , try out some new feature or development path , and either merge it to the main branch or cast it aside like an unwanted child .
Plus , since git does n't need to run from a central server , nobody will be able to look at your branch commit logs and see the atrocities you 've committed .
It 's only when you 're sure your code is ready for public consumption do you push your local repository to the remote one , so that other developers can admire the code you 've written .
Developers will almost always select the best technology , and management must be dragged along kicking and screaming .
It 's no surprise that while git is making some headway in the enterprise , sometimes it 's very under - the - radar and slow going .
After yesterday ’s bumbling , the Chief Justice re-administered the Oath of Office to President ( - Elect ? )
Obama this evening .
The Constitution is very clear about the importance of the Presidential Oath of Office ( “ Before he enter on the execution of his office , he shall take the following oath or affirmation : –“ I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States ” ) .
I am glad to hear it ’s official .
President Obama took the oath of office — again — on Wednesday , out of an abundance of caution , a White House official said .
“ We believe that the oath of office was administered effectively and that the president was sworn in appropriately yesterday .
But the oath appears in the Constitution itself .
And out of an abundance of caution , because there was one word out of sequence , Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath a second time , ” said White House Counsel Greg Craig in a statement early Wednesday night .
Linux 2.6.27 kernel released 9 October 2008 .
Note : The 2008 Linux Kernel Summit was held September 15 and 16 in Portland , Oregon , immediately prior to the Linux Plumbers Conference .
LWN , as always , has excellent coverage of the event .
You can also download all the papers of Linux Symposium 2008 here - in two PDF files .
LWN also has coverage of the Linux Plumbers Conference
Summary : 2.6.27 add a new filesystem ( UBIFS ) optimized for " pure " flash - based storage devices , the page - cache is now lockless , much improved Direct I/O scalability and performance , delayed allocation for ext4 , multiqueue networking , an alternative hibernation implementation based on kexec / kdump , data integrity support in the block layer for devices that support it , a simple tracer called ftrace , a mmio tracer , sysprof support , extraction of all the in - kernel 's firmware to /lib / firmware , XEN support for saving / restorig VMs , improved video camera support , support for the Intel wireless 5000 series and RTL8187B network cards , a new ath9 k driver for the Atheros AR5008 and AR9001 family of chipsets , more new drivers , improved support for others and many other improvements and fixes .
1. Prominent features ( the cool stuff )
1.1. Lockless page cache and get_user_pages ( )
Recommended LWN article : " Toward better direct I /O scalability " , " The lockless page cache "
The page cache is the place where the kernel keeps in RAM a copy of a file to improve performance by avoiding disk I/O when the data that needs to be read is already on RAM .
Each " mapping " , which is the data structure that keeps track of the correspondence between a file and the page cache , is SMP - safe thanks to its own lock .
So when different processes in different CPUs access different files , there 's no lock contention , but if they access the same file ( shared libraries or shared data files for example ) , they can hit some contention on that lock .
In 2.6.27 , thanks to some rules on how the page cache can be used and the usage of RCU , the page cache will be able to do lookups ( ie. , " read " the page cache ) without needing to take the mapping lock , and hence improving scalability .
But it will only be noticeable on systems with lots of cpus ( page fault speedup of 250x on a 64 way system have been measured ) .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 )
Lockless get_user_pages ( ) : get_user_pages ( ) is a function used in direct I/O operations to pin the userspace memory that is going to be transferred .
It 's a complex function that requires to hold the mmap_sem semaphore in the mm_struct struct of the process and the page table lock .
This is a scalability problem when there 're several processes using get_user_pages in the same address space ( for example , databases that do Direct I/O ) , because there will be lock contention .
In 2.6.27 , a new get_user_pages_fast ( ) function has been introduced , which does the same work that get_user_pages ( ) does , but its simplified to speed up the most common workloads that exercise those paths within the same address space .
This new function can avoid taking the mmap_sem semaphore and the page table locks in those cases .
Benchmarks showed a 10 % speedup running a OLTP workload with a IBM DB2 database in a quad - core system
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 )
1.2. Ext4 : Delayed Allocation
In this release , Ext4 is adding one of its most important planned features : Delayed allocation ( also called " Allocate - on - flush " ) .
It does n't change the disk format in any way , but it improves the performance in a wide range of workloads .
When an application write ( ) s data to the disk , the data is usually not written immediately to the disk but instead is cached in RAM for a while .
Without delayed allocation , despite the data not being written immediately to the disk the filesystem allocates the necessary disk structures for it immediately .
Delayed allocation consists of not allocating space for that cached data - instead only the free space counter is updated when write ( ) is called .
The procedure is changed so on - disk blocks and structures are now only allocated when the cached data is finally written to the disk - not when a process writes something .
This approach ( used by filesystems such as XFS , btrfs , ZFS and Reiser 4 ) noticeably improves the performance of many workloads .
It also results in better block allocation decisions because when allocation decisions are done at write ( ) - time , the block allocator cannot know if any other write ( ) s are going to be done .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 )
There is also a new implementation of the default data=ordered journaling mode based nn inodes , not nn jbd buffer heads .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )
1.3 . Kexec jump : kexec / kdump based hibernation
Recommended LWN article : " Yet another approach to software suspend "
Kexec is a Linux feature that allows loading a kernel into memory and executing it , allowing to reboot to a new kernel without rebooting .
This infrastructure was used to implement kdump , a kernel crash dump system : A " safe kernel " is loaded into memory as soon as the system starts , and if the running kernel crashes , the oops code kexec's to the " safe kernel " , which is able to dump the memory that it 's not using to the disk or somewhere else .
This infrastructure has been enhanced in 2.6.27 to be able to be used as an hibernation implementation : Instead of kexec'ing a safe kernel to dump the system memory , a system can kexec to a kernel that will dump all the memory on the disk and then shutdown the system .
When the systems boots , the initrd can load the dumped system , and restore it .
This hibernation implementation does not replace the existing hibernation implementations , it 's just an alternative .
It has some advantages , like not depending on ACPI .
For now it only works on x86 - 32 .

1.4 . UBIFS and OMFS
Recommended LWN article : " UBIFS " " OMFS "
UBIFS is a new filesystem designed to work with flash devices , developed by Nokia with help of the University of Szeged .
It 's important to understand that UBIFS is very different to any traditional filesystem : UBIFS does not work with block based devices , but pure flash based devices , handled by the MTD subsystem in Linux .
Hence , UBIFS does not work with what many people considers flash devices like flash - based hard drives , SD cards , USB sticks , etc ; because those devices use a block device emulation layer called FTL ( Flash Translation Layer ) that make they look like traditional block - based storage devices to the outside world .
UBIFS instead is designed to work with flash devices that do not have a block device emulation layer and that are handled by the MTD subsystem and present themselves to userspace as MTD devices .
UBIFS works on top of UBI volumes .
UBI is a LVM - like layer which was included in Linux 2.6.22 , which itself works on top of MTD devices .
UBIFS offers various advantages to JFFS2 : faster and scalable mount times ( unlike JFFS2 , UBIFS does not have to scan whole media when mounting ) , tolerance to unclean reboots ( UBIFS is a journaling filesystem ) , write - back ( which improves dramatically the performance ) , and support of on - the - flight compression .
Documentation : UBIFS FAQ , more documentation
Code : ( commit ) , ( commit ) , ( commit )
OMFS stands for " Sonicblue Optimized MPEG File System support " .
It is the proprietary file system used by the Rio Karma music player and ReplayTV DVR .
Despite the name , this filesystem is not more efficient than a standard FS for MPEG files , in fact likely the opposite is true .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 )
1.5 . Block layer data integrity support
Recommended LWN article : " Block layer : integrity checking and lots of partitions "
Modern filesystems feature checksumming of data and metadata to protect against data corruption .
However , the detection of the corruption is done at read time which could potentially be months after the data was written .
At that point the original data that the application tried to write is most likely lost ( if there 's not data redundancy ) .
The solution is to ensure that the disk is actually storing what the application meant it to .
Recent additions to both the SCSI family protocols ( SBC Data Integrity Field , SCC protection proposal ) as well as SATA / T13 ( External Path Protection ) try to remedy this by adding support for appending integrity metadata to an I/O .
The integrity metadata includes a checksum for each sector as well as an incrementing counter that ensures the individual sectors are written in the right order .
And for some protection schemes also that the I/O is written to the right place on disk .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 )
1.6 . Multiqueue networking
Recommended LWN article : " Multiqueue networking "
From that article :
One of the fundamental data structures in the networking subsystem is the transmit queue associated with each device [...]
This is a scheme which has worked well for years , but it has run into a fundamental limitation : it does not map well to devices which have multiple transmit queues .
Such devices are becoming increasingly common , especially in the wireless networking area .
Devices which implement the Wireless Multimedia Extensions , for example , can have four different classes of service : video , voice , best - effort , and background .
Video and voice traffic may receive higher priority within the device - it is transmitted first - and the device can also take more of the available air time for such packets .
Linux 2.6.27 adds support for those devices
Code : ( commit )
1.7 . ftrace , sysprof support
Ftrace is a very simple function tracer - unrelated to kprobes / SystemTap - which was born in the - rt patches .
It uses a compiler feature to insert a small , 5 - byte No-Operation instruction to the beginning of every kernel function , which NOP sequence is then dynamically patched into a tracer call when tracing is enabled by the administrator .
If it 's disabled , the overhead of the instructions is very small and not measurable even in micro-benchmarks .
Although ftrace is the function tracer , it also includes an plugin infrastructure that allows for other types of tracing .
Some of the tracers that are currently in ftrace include a tracer to trace context switches , the time it takes for a high priority task to run after it was woken up , how long interrupts are disabled , the time spent in preemption off critical sections .
The interface to access ftrace can be found in / debugfs / tracing , which are documented in Documentation / ftrace .

1.8 . Mmiotrace
Recommended LWN article : " Tracing memory - mapped I /O operations "
Mmiotrace is a tool for trapping memory mapped IO ( MMIO ) accesses within the kernel .
Since MMIO is used by drivers , this tool can be used for debugging and especially for reverse engineering binary drivers .
Code : ( commit ) , Documentation : ( commit )
1.9 . External firmware
Recommended LWN article : " Moving the firmware out "
Firmware is usually compiled with each driver .
For some reasons ( mainly , licensing reasons ) , distributing firmware is not allowed by some companies and some drivers have also supported loading external firmware for a long time .
But even if the firmware compiled and shipped with each driver is redistributable , is not libre software , and some people thinks that this breaks the GPL .
It also has some disadvantages for distros .
In 2.6.27 , the firmware blobs have been moved from the drivers ' source code to a new directory : firmware / .
By default , the firmware wo n't be compiled in the kernel binary , or in the modules .
It 's installed in / lib / firmware when the user types " make modules_install " , and drivers have been modified to call request_firmware ( ) and load the firmware when they need it .
There 's also a configuration option that will compile the firmware files in the kernel binary image , like it was done previously .

Improved video camera support with the gspca driver
Linux 2.6.26 was a big improvement to linux webcam support thanks to a driver that supports devices that implement the USB video class specification , which are quite a lot .
2.6.27 includes the gspca driver , which implements support for another large set of devices .
With this driver , most video camera devices on the market are supported by Linux .

Extended file descriptor system calls
Recommended LWN article : " Extending system calls "
When Unix was designed , some of the interfaces did n't envisioned functionality that would be needed in the future .
Many interfaces that allow creating a file descritor do n't take a flag parameter , for example .
That makes impossible to create file descriptors with new properties things like close - on - exec , non-blocking , or non-sequential descriptors .
Being able to do such things today is neccesary - not just for fun : it also closes a security bug that can be exploited in multithreaded apps .
To solve this issue , Linux 2.6.27 is adding a new set of interfaces and syscalls that will be used by glibc .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 )
1.12 . Voltage and Current Regulator
This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to voltage and current regulators .
The intention is to allow systems to dynamically control regulator output in order to save power and prolong battery life .
This applies to both voltage regulators ( where voltage output is controllable ) and current sinks ( where current output is controllable ) .
This framework is designed around SoC based devices and has also been designed against two Power Management ICs ( PMICs ) currently on the market - namely the Freescale MC13783 and the Wolfson WM8350 , however it is quite generic and should apply to all PMICs .

Sometimes you get to eat your words — this is one of those occasions ( " however " tastes kind of bland and overused ) .
In nearly every quantum computing article , particularly those involving atomic gases , I end with something along the lines of " It 's great work , and demonstrates a much needed proof of principle , but atomic vapors are never going to scale - up conveniently enough to provide the number of bits required for realistic quantum computing . "
I can now say that this is probably wrong , dead wrong , which just goes to show that gainsaying the folks at JILA and Innsbruck is really stupid .
Quantum computing takes advantage of the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement to obtain , in some cases , a speed up in computation .
Superposition allows quantum bits , called qubits , to be both one and zero simultaneously .
When you ask the qubit its value , it will always return either a one or a zero , but the probability of a particular value depends on the details of its superposition .
Entanglement , on the other hand , allows the values of multiple qubits to be correlated : if qubit A is determined to be a one , then an entangled partner qubit B must be a zero .
No operations are required to keep A and B entangled , so changes to the superposition state of one qubit are automatically reflected in changes to the superposition states of all the other entangled qubits .
Unfortunately , entanglement is delicate , and even the smallest amount of noise in the environment can strip the correlations out of the system .
Entanglement between two superconducting quantum interference devices typically lasts a 100ns or so , while dilute alkali gases can remain entangled for several seconds .
Photons can be entangled for even longer , but you rapidly run out of lab space when your qubit is traveling at 300 million meters per second .
This highlights the biggest problem in quantum computing : control .
Ions , for instance , can be stored individually and individually addressed by laser pulses .
But ions are difficult to work with because they are charged and will try and interact with everything — control gets lost despite your best efforts .
Neutral atoms , which interact far less strongly with their environment , only help a little .
Addressing individual atoms is difficult because they are generally all in the same quantum state , so any action performed on one atom is performed on them all .
The latest research out of UCLA , JILA , and Innsbruck has figured out the technical details of a scheme that could overcome this problem .
To appreciate the solution , we need to describe the problem in more detail .
To start with , all the atoms are fermions , which means that , given a population of atoms , they will stack up in terms of quantum states — starting from lowest energy to highest , the atoms fill each available state .
To make quantum computing manageable , we would prefer them to be occupying just a few quantum states .
To separate each atom from its neighbor , two laser beams , traveling in opposite directions , are passed through the very cold atomic gas ( note that the laser has to have the right color ) .
This creates a lattice of regions with high intensity and low intensity — the atoms move into the dark spots , and the electromagnetic potential shields them from the other atoms , allowing them to all occupy identical quantum states .
This also has the advantage of spatially separating each atom so that they can be individually addressed by other lasers .
To perform an operation , atoms are moved so that they end up in the same lattice site and interact with each other .
This can be done by changing the color of one of the laser beams slightly so that the entire lattice starts to move .
I think you can see the problem here : all the atoms move , not just the ones that we want .
This new research has looked at the possibility of using two atomic states instead of one .
The idea is that the atoms you want to shift around go into one state ( call it state A ) , while the atoms you want to keep still stay in the second state ( we name thee state B ) .
You can then use two different color lasers to create two lattices , each storing a different group of atoms .
Normally this wo n't work .
Although laser one and state A might be tuned to each other so that they interact strongly , the neighboring state B will still see the laser light and interact with it .
This weaker interaction destroys these prepared states , leaving your qubits with a random value .
To get around this , the researchers have looked carefully at how strontium atoms respond to various colors of light .
Under the right conditions , the color used to control state A has two interactions with state B that exactly cancel , meaning that state A can be controlled without destroying state B. Likewise a second color that controls state B does n't effect state A .
The team has also worked out how to transfer atoms selectively between the two states and how to perform collisional qubit operations .
This essentially gives them a register , a bus , and arbitrary gates — sounds like everything you might need for quantum computing .
Things are made even easier by the fact that these states have life times on the order of tens of seconds , while operations take only a few milliseconds .
Although this is a theoretical paper — based on the properties of a real atom though — the real kicker comes when you think about scalability .
The systems that cool atoms to just a few microkelvin can usually manage to capture between 100,000 and one million atoms .
Optical lattices can usually hold between a few hundred and a few thousand atoms .
Suddenly , we are looking at going from 8 qubits to several hundred — that is what I call scalability .
Before I head off to eat my hat , I 'll just mention that this system will still not be out - of - the - lab , desktop friendly .
However , that does n't mean it wo n't find plenty of applications in relatively cheap facilities - based computers , much like the supercomputing centers we use today .
Now , where did I put that hat ?
Physical Review Letters , 2008 , DOI : 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.170504
If reducing that abdominal paunch is part of your goals for the year , consider adding green tea to your diet .
Several studies have hinted that green tea provides a boost to exercise - induced weight loss .
Another study , published in the February issue of the Journal of Nutrition , supports that link and shows that tummy fat may be the first to go .
The study evaluated 132 obese adults .
All consumed a diet that was consistent in daily calories and participated in 180 minutes a week of moderate - intensity exercise .
They also drank a daily beverage containing 39 milligrams of caffeine , but one group consumed green tea with 625 milligrams of catechins , an antioxidant that is the main component of green tea .
After 12 weeks , the participants drinking the green tea had greater loss , 4.4 pounds compared with just over 2 pounds in the control group .
The green - tea group also had larger declines in total abdominal fat , subcutaneous abdominal fat and triglycerides .
How green tea works its magic is not completely understood , but scientists believe it speeds the rate at which fat is broken down in the body .
It may also help the body 's sensitivity to insulin , lowering the risk of diabetes .
The study was conducted by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University as well as research centers in Florida and Japan .
Another study on green tea , also featured in this issue of the Journal of Nutrition , shows that drinking plentiful amounts of the beverage over many years may have a subtle influence in decreasing the risk of breast cancer .
The study examined almost 7,000 women , ages 20 to 74 , in China .
The women were evaluated for breast cancer incidence and consumption of green tea .
Compared with nondrinkers , women who drank green tea had a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer .
The benefit was strongest for women who drank the most green tea over longer periods of time .

KATE MOSS
This Vanity Fair caption accompanied the smoldering 1935 Bruehl - Borges image ( photographed on the set of the film Desire ) on which this picture was based : “ Mary Magdalene Dietrich — called Marlene — was born in Berlin two days after Christmas [ 1901 ] .
As a child , she studied the violin , but grew up to be a singer of chansons vulgaires in Berlin music halls .
In 1929 , Josef von Sternberg saw her in a German theatre and hired her for the lead opposite Emil Jannings in the film The Blue Angel .
Then he brought her to America to make Morocco .
The rest is history .
Somehow , from the complete inertia of her movements and her expressionless face , comes a mysterious emanation which is deadly to the male . ”
Deadly indeed .
Here , British model Kate Moss does Dietrich Reconfigured , in this 2006 study by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott .
Wrote A. A. Gill , in his essay introducing the image : “ No tears .
No excuses .
Kate Moss looked out from a thousand pages of editorial vilification , and then a thousand more of luxury advertising , and did n’t dignify a single word [ of press criticism ] .
There is an old , stiff - lipped , patrician motto that could be stitched on her pillow : never explain , never complain . …
No words — just a picture . ”

HELL EXPLAINED BY CHEMISTRY STUDENT
The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid-term .
The answer by one student was so " profound " that the professor shared it with colleagues , via the Internet , which is , of course , why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well .
Bonus Question : Is Hell exothermic ( gives off heat ) or endothermic ( absorbs heat ) ?
Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle 's Law ( gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed ) or some variant .
One student , however , wrote the following :
First , we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time .
So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving .
I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell , it will not leave .
Therefore , no souls are leaving .
As for how many souls are entering Hell , let 's look at the different religions that exist in the world today .
Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion , you will go to Hell . '''
Since there is more ''' than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion , we can project that all souls go to Hell .
With birth and death rates as they are , we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially .
Now , we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle 's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same , the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added .
This gives two possibilities :
If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell , then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose .
If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell , then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over .
So which is it ?
If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that , " It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you , " and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night , then number two must be true , and thus I am sure Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over .
The corollary of this theory is that since
Hell has frozen over , it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore , extinct ...... leaving only
Heaven , thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why , last night , Teresa kept shouting " Oh my God . "
THIS STUDENT RECEIVED THE ONLY " A "

I am not a religous person but I am spiritual .
" HELL EXPLAINED BY CHEMISTRY STUDENT " borders blasphemy if not in fact .
Shame on you !
Brent — 12 February 2008 , 15:56
I suppose blasphemy is in the eye of the reader .
I would use a similar label for myself , not religious but spiritual , and I found this piece funny .
I do n't feel ashamed of that ; you think I should .
Where do we go from here ?
Probably just ignore each other .
Or we could explore why you feel this is blasphemous ... or perhaps we should begin by defining blasphemy .
Lucky Scheppf — 29 February 2008 , 09:46
At first glance , I concede , it could be construded as " funny " .
But we ( as a society ) must look deeper into why someone would think this is " funny " .
You have the " right " to feel it is funny " if you choose .
You live in American and have that right .
We have fought and shed our blood ( as maybe your parents and relatives have done also ) to defend your rights to believe or not to believe and to protest .
The " shame on you " is relative to being insensitive to the religious and spiritual faiths of all other communities that believe in God as a Supreme Being and is not a " shame on you " for your belief .
Defining blasphemy ?
I think we both know what borders blasphemy and what does not and is determined by one 's own interpretation .
The shame is that , however creative the " student " was in his story , this talent could be best served in helping serve the world community in way creative ways to eliminate world hunger , find a cure for cancer , and ease the pain and suffering of humanity instead of finding humor on the feelings and backs of people of faith .
Thank you Brent for excerising your right to differ and keeping an open mind in a civil manner .

Oh , that 's sooo cool that you commented back .
Good points all .
I 've been struggling with the question of how much we should " respect " others ' beliefs .
Indeed , until recently , asking such a question would have felt blasphemous .
I suppose " respect " is n't the right word .
My point or question is :
How much should let we the religious beliefs of others go unchallenged or unquestioned ?
Where do we draw the line and step in and question a person 's religious beliefs ?
Does this work ?
" Until their religious beliefs lead to actions that hurt others . "
Or is this better ?
" We never question religious beliefs . "
Though it 's taboo , I believe never questioning religious beliefs is foolish because beliefs lead to behavior , and if the behavior is harmful , those beliefs NEED to be questioned .
Problem is , religious beliefs are a matter of faith , which means they carry no objective evidence .
As an example : Suppose a child needs a blood transfusion to treat a terminal disease .
If the parents are of the Jehovah 's Witness religion , they will refuse to give the lifesaving procedure to their child .
Here we have a situation where a religious belief can lead to the death of a child .
What to do ?
Do we challenge the belief or respect it unquestioned ?
( PS - - Oppologies for the crappy commenting system .
I need to integrate something more useful for comments , something that emails you when a commment is made to a particular page .
In time . )

Your Comment : " Though it 's taboo , I believe never questioning religious beliefs is foolish because beliefs lead to behavior , and if the behavior is harmful , those beliefs NEED to be questioned . "
My Reply : I agree with your concept in that we can question various religious belief 's and concepts .
I agree 100 % .
Why ?
Because this makes sense .
It is called " common sense . "
We must find balance between respect vs. disrespect .
Your Comment : " How much should let we the religious beliefs of others go unchallenged or unquestioned ?

" We never question religious beliefs . "
My Reply : I am 56 years old and I am an educated man ( greduate engineer ) and an avid supporter of human rights and civil rights although I am a conservative .
Protest is the American way and is how our Country was founded .
I support religious freedom .
But that is balanced with the rights of other to feel and believe the way they wish without persecution from other members of our society or the government .
My rights end where the next persons rights attach .
Example ?
Someone believes in a religion that killing people is ok according to his religion because they do not believe as their religion .
That person has a right to believe this , however he does not have a right to act out his belief .
If this is the case , then we will go back to the Witch Trials that were conducted by Christians in Winston - Salem and burn people at the stakes .
We cannot allow this , no more than we can allow radical muslims to behead people who do not believe in Islam .
People certainly have the right to believe what they want and to think what they wish , but when it comes to harming others in effort to carry out their agenda and destroy property and create anarchy in the streets of America where innocent people will be harmed , they they do not have the right to do this .
This is called " common sense . "
Unfortunately , some people and religions do not have this type of balance and humanity .
To that end , we must keep vigiliant and not be " asleep " when they come .
If more than one peoson believes like this , and they discuss plans to carry out their belief 's , that is called a conspiracy .
Two or more people must be involved .
We cannot allow this to happen .
When good men stand by and do nothing , evil will flourish .
Your comment : " As an example : Suppose a child needs a blood transfusion to treat a terminal disease .

Here we have a situation where a religious belief can lead to the death of a child .
What to do ?
Do we challenge the belief or respect it unquestioned ? "
My Reply :
We respect their right to believe as they desire .
That is what we do .
We also , with respect , balance that right to believe with the right of the child to live .
The child , because he / she is a child , does not automatically lose their right to have a say .
Certainly , we as a society have a right to question that belief , BUT , we should do with with respect .
I personally disagree with that position and support the transfusion BUT I respect their right to believe that way , and I would question it too , but with respect of their right to believe .
You are obviously an intelligent young man and I encourage you to continue your deep and sustained thought process , and always balance it with empathy and I am sure that you will do the right for the right reason the first time .
Please remember this , few of us can do great things , but we can all do small things with great love .
Mother Theresa once said this and it has left an inspiring mark on my life .
Lsstly , we have to be careful Brent about what we puslish .
Why ?
Because young children are easily influenced .
We see this in the school shootings , drugs and ect .
We need to lead by example and I am sure you are one of this young men based on your previous correspondence and questions .
I am sure that your mom and dad are proud of you .
Just a bit of advice .
Whatever you do in life , ask yourself , what would mamma think if she were watching .
If you were a girl , it would be , what would dad think if he were watching .
You will always make the right decision .
Thank you for the very thought provoking dialogue .

Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply , Lucky , and kind words of advice .
It 's such a struggle , this question of accepting ( respecting ) beliefs and not accepting the behavior which is derived from those beliefs .
Again , while much of my life has been guided ( in part ) by the principle of " respecting others ' beliefs , " I find myself at a crossroads .
I continue to butt against beliefs that I feel harm the world .
I think you 're right when you state or imply that in a free society , we must accept and respect the beliefs of others , no matter how much we disagree ; but when those beliefs lead to violate human rights , then we intervene .
I 'm sure this is correct , or the best we can do if we do if we hope to maintain a free society .
For me , part of " respect " has always meant to avoid questioning a person 's beliefs .
This is where I find myself changing .
I now want to question those beliefs , again because I feel some beliefs are very harmful .
The struggle is to remain respectful in that process since one person 's respect is another person 's disrespect .
I had an unfortunate situation many years ago when I questioned the belief of a man ( a fairly close friend from college ) who came from another culture .
I thought I was being polite in my inquiry , but the man felt quite different .
He never spoke to me again .
This experience solidified the equation that respect equals not questioning , at least until recently .
Thanks again for your thoughtful , compassionate replies .
You live by your words , and I appreciate your advice and wisdom .
Lucky Scheppf — 01 March 2008 , 07:08

Your Words = " ... but when those beliefs lead to violate human rights , then we intervene . "
My Response : Yes , you are is 100 % correct and on target .
We can go a step further .
We as a civilized society have a responsibility and are duty bound to intervene not only when human and civil rights are violated , but to do so before they are violated , otherwise waiting for the act itself would shock the conscience of a civilization and society .
We can do this and not infringe upon the delicate right to believe or free worship or lack thereof .
And we must be free to worship as we choose and yet find balance and harmony in the next persons right to do the same .
Please remember , and you are 100 % on target , we must be vigiliant and not allow this to get " out of control " to a point where people and institutions are threatened .
Your Comment : " For me , part of " respect " has always meant to avoid questioning a person 's beliefs .
My Reply : Oh Brent , there is a difference .
We can question a person (s ) or a society or a religion (s ) beliefs , and you have that right which is connected to a Divine and Constitutional Right , and a Human Right .
( My Thoughts ) .
Do not ever let anyone trick you into telling you differently .
" Respect " does not equate to " not questioning " so long as we treat that person with dignity in the manner in which we question the belief .
We can and should raise questions in order to understand .
Understanding does not mean " agree with " .
Never " ... avoid questioning a person 's beliefs " or feel that you should .
Winston Chirchill said this during the dark and devastating days of WW - II .
" Heros are born in the moment of crises , and some of the greatest deeds of inspiration emerge under the circumstance if the heart and will possesses the determination and strenght . "
You may ask : Lucky , where are you going with this ?
My reply : Continue to question , in a professioanl and gentle manner just like you have conducted yourself during this continued dialogue , and your deeds or actions will greatly inspire others as they have inspired me .
Continue to live by your principles which are your core values .
This does not mean you will have misjudgments of error .
It does mean that you will recognize them , and never - not ever - hesitate to say " I am sorry or I apologize if I offended you . "
You can do that and still maintain your principles .
Do not compromise or question your valuies or your principles on any position .
Stick to your guns .
It is part of your DNA and is what defines you as you .
Again , you are on target .
Have a great day !

@ Lucky and Brent ... I thoroughly enjoyed reading your conversation .
Brent , you and I parallel in our general approach to this issue .
And I fully subscribe to Lucky 's advice on approaching one 's inquiries with respect .
Your dialogue is refreshing .

Pleasantly surprised to find this conversation / blog whilst randomly looking for something else .
Nice to see consideration and thought unblinded by the passion that turn so many similar ' discussions ' into fist fights .
I do n't have a personal God , but still enjoy the advice Lucky .
Brent — 09 March 2008 , 11:30
It 's been a great discussion !
I 'm very glad so many people are getting the point -- that people with different views can still have constructive , civil discussions .
Lucky Scheppf — 17 March 2008 , 21:56
I agree with Brent in that , " It 's been a great discussion !
I 'm very glad so many people are getting the point -- that people with different views can still have constructive , civil discussions . "
We all came away with something positive and was a great learning experience for this 56 year Tennessee conservative .
Let 's take Jamneely — 08 March 2008 , 13:22 for example .
He stated that " I do n't have a personal God " .
I do .
His name is Jesus the Christ .
However , I respect Jamneely 's right to not have a " personal God . "
I do not agree with him , but I respect his right to believe as he chooses .
Our soldiers fight and sometimes die for him to have his belief and for him to have the freedom of expression to state that and although I do not agree with him , I would defend his right to believe what he does .
This is what America is suppose to be about .
Jesus died for our salvation .
( My Thoughts ) .
U.S. soldiers die for our Freedom .
( My Belief ) .
Happy everyone enjoyed the dialogue .

I have a very strong core of beliefs .
I am a Christian .
I thought this article was hilarious .
If I can find it funny being a Christian then there 's no reason someone should be a ashamed for doing it themselves .
There was nothing blasphemous about it .
It was a ridiculous answer to a ridiculous question , nothing more .
Now to respecting someone 's religion .
There is no greater respect of a anyone 's religion then to take an interest in it .
Even if it does n't sway your beliefs , does n't matter .
There was something I was once told about religion .
" Religion defies all logic . "
Even with my faith I can admit that .
So if your friend was offended .
Then he needs to check his beliefs .
They 're not as strong as he thinks .
On the child thing , a person life is always more important then someone 's beliefs .
No matter what country you live in or what rights a person has in that country .
There are three laws that are universal , you do not kill , you do not rape , you do not steal or any variant thereof of them .
Nothing supersedes those , not even religious freedom .

I am a Christ also .
I read the article and found it interesting as a retired UCLA professor .
The article may have been harmless but the responses were valid by all parties .
Had the article protrayed the Islamic Prophet Mohammad , there woyuld have been riots in our streets .
The fact Brent and Lucky agreed to discuss was a move in the direction of tolerance .
The problem with religion and extremism which includes Christianity , likened to Islam , sometimes our " strong " core " belief " tend to overshadow our sense or good reason and common sense .
This of course , leads to Christian anarchy and the " beliefs " described as " strong " tend to unjustly demonize more moderates and people of free thought .
To quote " Lucky " , he is correct in that this contributes to " witch hunts " as did our Christian brethren in Winston - Salem and such as the murder of talkshow host Allen Berg in Denver , Co. , by extremeist Christians who held strong core beliefs .
I wish to commend all for excerising their freedoms of expression and caution those that may unjustly demonize others for their beliefs and their expressions and caution against overt racism and extremism under the giuse of a " strong " core " belief " process .

Ha !
Well , it 's all about what interests you .
I find these discussions quite enriching , though I was surprised they were sparked by this piece , which I took as just a funny story .
Other 's disagreed and found it offensive , which intrigued me , and a wonderful discussion ensued .
You never know where something will lead , which is part of the wonder and joy of life .

To All : I am SSGT .
Jack McPherson , USMC , and I am stationed at Camp Liberty in Iraq .
This is my 2nd tour ( by choice ) .
Some of the guys ( male and female soldiers ) were reading this " Wanderings " just to pass some time .
This article provoked responses that were very interesting .
Although we ( Here in Iraq That Were Reading and Discussing This Article ) all had different opinions and our had our individual takes on it , it was amazing at how the dialogue evolved between Brent and Lucky Scheppf .
Also , it was enlightening to see the various " post " regarding other opinions in the respectful and civil manner most people have demonstrated .
We were all amazed at Dr. Bob Staggart 's guidance .
What an amazing professor !!!!
One day , maybe we can acheive our mission here in Iraq and people here can set down , however different and opposite their feelings and belief 's are , and freely communicate like Brent and Lucky Scheppf did and during the " proving of each of their points " , find common ground and become friends in a small way for the short time we pass through this world and life .
Mother
Therese said something that struck a common thread in is here .
She said something like this : " We can not all do great things , but we can all do small things with great love . "
Brent and Lucky , we thank you both for a thought provoking dialogue .
Please remember , neither of you can please everyone .
Do n't try .
There will always be critics .
They do not count .
Why ?
Because those are the ones whose faces are not marred with sweat and blood , and have chosen to be critics , and that have never lifted the unliftable cause and have never fought in a fight for nything worthy that was just and good , and will never know , not ever , the pains of defeat and the glory of victory .
Semper Fi !!!!

YOU HAVE JUST ENTERED THE " NO SPIN ZONE " .
If this is so ridiculous , and you critize the people who have the freedom to express themselves , and claim to be " amazed that ppl would waste so much time on this " , then why did you feel it was so important to respond and waste your time on something so " ridiculous " .
You are a jerk and a pinhead !!!!
Me and my friends enjoyed the exchanges and you are a jerk - off freak .
Pinhead !!!

Thanks Staff Sergeant McPherson !
Very kind of you to take the time to comment .
You are so right about there always being critics and not to try to please everyone .
That 's a fool 's errand .
However , I think the critics can be important because they force you to examine your own view more carefully .
Let me explain .
I do n't believe in objectivity or an unbiased point of view .
We all carry our own bias .
That 's a given .
But if we are satisfied with that bias and ignore critics we miss out on improving or view .
( of course some critics are just assholes with nothing to add , but that 's another story ) .
The critics force us to examine our own bias and to improve our view .
If we are closed to criticism , we are closed to potential growth .
This is NOT to say we should be pansy 's , changing our view with every critic .
No , I 'm just saying we need to have some openness to the critic .
They may have something constructive to add in our never - ending journey toward ... truth ?
That said , I totally agree with you that the talking - head ( bobble - head ) critics who have n't endured or fought for their own freedom have little understanding of the real issues involved .
Hence their words reveal enormous ignorance .
Problem is , those same people can have enormous influence , and that 's what 's so scary .

Katie and Tom call in FBI after ' death threats from anti-scientology group '
Under fire : Tom Cruise in his latest film , Valkryie
Actor Tom Cruise and his wife Katie Holmes are living in fear after receiving death threats .
Sources close to the star , a leading Scientologist , say the threats are believed to have come from groups opposed to the religious organisation .
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that security has been stepped up around Cruise , 46 , Holmes , 30 , and their two - year - old daughter Suri .
The couple now live at separate locations and move around in bomb - proof vehicles .
Other protesters have been angered by Cruise ’s portrayal of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg – who was at the centre of the 1944 plot by Nazi officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler – in the film Valkyrie .
Last week Cruise attended the Los Angeles premiere of the movie , which was targeted by protesters from the anti-Scientology group Anonymous .
He has been forced to increase security around his family since then .
' The threats are perceived to be so great that the FBI has been alerted , ’ said a source .
Cruise is due to fly to London for the UK premiere on January 21 .
‘ Tom is terrified .
He does n’t feel safe anywhere , ’ the source added .
Cruise has spent £ 5 million on an underground bunker in the grounds of his estate in Colorado .
In August , threats were made to place anthrax in the air vents of his Los Angeles office .

Gamers who tried to play Gears of War on the PC Thursday ran into a slight snag : it seems that the digital certificate that allows the game to run expired on January 28 , 2009 .
Basically that means if you keep your PC 's clock up to date , you can no longer play the game .
The official Epic forum is ablaze with complaints about this issue , as the still - kicking community becomes enraged .
" I had this problem this evening , I had to change the date and time ( from PM to AM ) and I am able to get in just fine , " one frustrated gamer posted .
" I also changed it back to the current date and time and it did n't work .
Change it back to yesterday AM and it works fine ...
EPIC games wo n't be on my list anytime soon .... "
Epic Games is aware of the issue , but do n't expect much hard news about what to do about the inability to play the game .
" We have been notified of the issue and are working with Microsoft to get it resolved , " a super moderator posted on the forum .
" Sorry for any problems related to this .
I 'll post more once we have a resolution . "
( Microsoft is the publisher , and GoW is a Games for Windows release . )
Until then ?
You can either fiddle with your computer 's clock or not play .
Neither choice is much fun .
While it 's not rare for games to ship with bugs every now and again , it 's pretty shocking when one ships with an issue that causes the title to stop working .
Update Mark Rein has released a statement clarifying that GoW 's anti-cheat technology is to blame for this issue , and not the game 's DRM . "

Two Palestinians in Gaza and two Israelis in the nearby town of Sderot give their reaction to the Israeli air strikes on Gaza on Saturday .
Palestinian medical officials say many of the 225 people killed were Hamas policemen .
MKHAIMAR ABUSADA , 44 , BEIT LAHIYA , GAZA STRIP
What happened was beyond imagination ; I 've never seen anything like it in my life .
It was a massive bombing campaign which created enormous fear in ordinary innocent Palestinians .
One attack hit an open citrus field 150 metres from my house .
A Qassam missile had been fired from that area before the latest truce started .
I could see bombings from my window , but no - one I know was hurt or injured .
I do n't think this will be followed by ground attacks right now .
I think these would have to come after Israel 's elections .
Also , I think Israel benefits greatly from the divide between Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
If Israel helps end that , it would then have to sit down and reach a political settlement with us , which it 's not ready to do .
Palestinians are very divided .
Some support Hamas , others support Fatah .
Yes , some people are angry with Hamas , but there is no way anyone can speak against them right now , it 's not the time .
This is the time for national unity and national healing .
EEKI ELMER , 45 , SDEROT , ISRAEL Gaza is run by a terrorist organisation and I do n't know any country in the world which would allow terrorists to run a state on its borders .
Sderot lies in the undisputed area of Israel .
This is not the West Bank , not part of the area Palestinians call " occupied " , it 's been part of Israel since 1948 .
So it 's about time Gaza accepted us .
A year and a half ago a missile hit my house - thank God I was n't injured .
But this is reality here .
You walk in the street , and suddenly the alarm comes and there 's nowhere to hide .
Politically I would say the current government , Kadima , might profit from this operation - not that this has anything to do with the election .
Pressure has been building on the government for a couple of years for a strong response to the terrorists in Gaza .
I was considered a leftist in Israel - you are not speaking to some lunatic nationalist here .
I never wanted to rule these people and I still support the notion of two states .
I pray the violence will be over and that we find some peaceful solution .
AMJAD SHAWA , 39 , GAZA CITY
This is a black day in Gaza 's history .
Never , ever have we had airstrikes of this intensity and not since 1967 have we had this number of victims .
I was holding a workshop for NGO workers on conflict transformation and non-violence , when the strikes began .
We went to the balcony to look ; we saw women running in the street , heard screams everywhere , we saw people carrying parts of human beings .
It went on and on .
The attack happened as schools were changing shifts , so children were arriving and leaving .
My children were evacuated from their school and they 're OK , although one of their classmates was hurt .
They saw the blood and screams of other children , so they have had a very difficult time which they wo n't forget .
We must work together , Hamas and Fatah .
The only way to face what is happening is to be united .
I did n't ask anyone in the street today " Are you Fatah or Hamas ? " .
Our blood was mixed .
MECHI FENDEL , MOTHER OF SEVEN , SDEROT , ISRAEL Finally , a month and a half before the elections , Israel takes some action .
I definitely see this as linked , but it 's OK , better late than never .
What 's been happening in Gaza is fantastic .
I feel very bad about the man killed in [ the Israeli town of ] Netivot .
We usually like to vote for someone quite right wing and who actually does something , so definitely not Kadima , and not Labour .
So that probably leaves Likud .
It 's unfortunate that we have to choose by a process of elimination .
The other day my daughter arrived at school in tears .
It 's only a six minute walk to school , and it was nice weather , but during that walk she had six rocket warnings .
The Arabs are reminding us again that they do n't think we have a right to Sderot and they want us out .
Mechi's husband David :
Whenever human life is taken , it 's tragic , but when we 're talking about murderers who are trying to kill us , it 's a big relief .
On the other hand we 're convinced that the innocent people who were killed , this is totally the fault of Hamas who use them as human shields .
We believe all life is sacred , so the Hamas regime is at fault .

Office of the Press Secretary THE WHITE HOUSEOffice of the Press Secretary
MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES
SUBJECT : Freedom of Information Act
A democracy requires accountability , and accountability requires transparency .
As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote , " sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants . "
In our democracy , the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , which encourages accountability through transparency , is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government .
At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike .
The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption :
In the face of doubt , openness prevails .
The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure , because errors and failures might be revealed , or because of speculative or abstract fears .
Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the personal interests of Government officials at the expense of those they are supposed to serve .
In responding to requests under the FOIA , executive branch agencies ( agencies ) should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation , recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public .
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure , in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA , and to usher in a new era of open Government .
The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA .
The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public .
They should not wait for specific requests from the public .
All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government .
Disclosure should be timely .
I direct the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing the FOIA to the heads of executive departments and agencies , reaffirming the commitment to accountability and transparency , and to publish such guidelines in the Federal Register .
In doing so , the Attorney General should review FOIA reports produced by the agencies under Executive Order 13392 of December 14 , 2005 .
I also direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to update guidance to the agencies to increase and improve information dissemination to the public , including through the use of new technologies , and to publish such guidance in the Federal Register .
This memorandum does not create any right or benefit , substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States , its departments , agencies , or entities , its officers , employees , or agents , or any other person .
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register .
Atheist ads are kicked off the
buses in Italy
A plan to put atheist slogans on buses in Italy has been shot down by the Roman Catholic Church .
The campaign , which follows a similar one in Britain , had caused controversy in the deeply Catholic country .
The ads read ' The bad news is that God does n't exist .
The good news is that you do n't need him ' and were to have made their first appearance today in the streets of Genoa .
Atheist campaign : Evolutionary biologist Professor Richard Dawkins has backed the campaign and helped launch it in London .
However , a similar campaign in Italy has infuriated the Catholic population
The city was targeted because it is home to the head of the Italian Catholic Bishops Conference Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco , an outspoken opponent of artificial insemination and gay marriage .
Cardinal Bagnasco was said to be ' furious ' about the plans and had his assistants write to the bus company and the advertising firm in charge of the £ 13,000 campaign to express their opposition .
At the last minute the campaign was cancelled .
A source said the cardinal was ' delighted ' .
A spokesman for The Italian Union of Atheists and Rationalist Agnostics , which organised the campaign , said yesterday : ' It appears that buses can carry campaigns for underwear and holidays with no problem but if you ask for space to say God does n't exist then you are denied . '
In Britain , the £ 140,000 campaign had posters saying : ' There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . '
The Best in the Wonderful World of SNES RPGs
Note from racketboy :
Thanks again to Ack , for all of his hard work on this comprehensive guide to the best RPGs the SNES has to offer .
For more RPG and other Genre - based guides , check out our Genre Guide section .
Also , you can learn even more about the SNES at our Beginner ’s Guide and Defining Games guides .
Were you one of the next generation of gamers that did n’t think RPGs were cool until Final Fantasy VII ?
Own a Super Famicom , but have no clue what to play for it ?
Wondering what the role - playing classics of Nintendo ’s entry in the 16 - bit generation were ?
Well look no further .
Here at Racketboy.com we ’ve got a list of suggestions that you just gotta try .
So sit back , chill with a nice frosty potion , and prepare yourself to experience the world of SNES RPGs .
Final Fantasy Series
The Super Famicom would see three releases from the main Final Fantasy series for the console , each one taking Square ’s popularity even further .
While Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI would get stateside releases ( as FF2 and FF3 , respectively ) , Final Fantasy V would stay obscure to American audiences for years afterwards .
Europe would be forced to wait even longer , not seeing the titles until their PlayStation re-release several years later .
While each Final Fantasy features different characters in different worlds , all three brought new ideas to the series .
While preceding titles for the NES had full casts , the characters that would populate the Super Famicom titles would prove to be some of the most memorable of the series , with many fans ranking them among the best titles of the series .
The SNES ’s audio capabilities were brought to the test by Nobuo Uematsu , with VI bringing some of the most loved songs from the series to the table .
The sprites and backgrounds would evolve slowly over time , and all would utilize Mode 7 technology for some extra visual flair .
But perhaps most endearing were the characters , designed from the concept art of Yoshitaka Amano .
Amano ’s art would pervade all three games , though his creature designs and character portraits are most obvious in VI .
The series would also broach potentially controversial topics , such as child abuse , prejudice , the deaths of loved ones , and a coming apocalypse , while also discussing love , duty , honor , and other themes commonly explored in the genre .
It should also be noted that the Final Fantasy Series had another game released for the SNES , entitled Final Fantasy Mystic Quest in the USA , Final Fantasy USA Mystic Quest in Japan , and Mystic Quest Legend in Europe .
This game did not feature the stunning artwork or music the main series was known for , the battle and equipment systems were cut down immensely , and a small party size of up to 2 characters was implemented .
The game is generally easy , excepting the first battle , which is arguably the hardest in the game .
The title is more of an attempt to bring new RPG players who have little to no experience with the genre into the fold .
Most RPG veterans avoided it .

Chrono Trigger
Chrono Trigger was considered quite revolutionary for an RPG , featuring a multitude of side quests , multiple endings , a unique battle system that combined aspects of the turn - based Japanese RPG with the action RPG flavor of titles like Secret of Mana that allows part members to combine attacks for greater effect , as well as a beautiful score and excellent characters designed by Akira Toriyama .
The game follows Crono as he and his friends attempt to stop the apocalypse , brought on by an extraterrestrial creature named Lavos .
To do this , he and his friends must wander through time , collecting weapons and items while becoming more powerful in anticipation of the final battle .
The story ’s a bit more complex than this , but I do n’t want to give anything away if you have n’t played it .
Chrono Trigger is quite epic , and also has lots of replayability as the party stays powerful between each game , allowing players who ’ve beaten the title several times easier access to the various endings .
While it has been criticized at times for its short length and generally low difficulty , Chrono Trigger is often considered one of the best games ever made .
If you are new to the world of RPGs , it ’s definitely worth a look .

Dragon Quest / Dragon Warrior Series
While the Famicom versions of Dragon Quest would make it to the states in the form of Dragon Warrior 1 - 4 , the Super Famicom versions would n’t see an official release either stateside or in the PAL regions .
The series forms two trilogies , comprised of Dragon Quest 1 - 3 and Dragon Quest 4 - 6 .
The game is well known for its art , done by Akira Toriyama , whose influence would grow more obvious in the series as graphics in the titles improved .
The series is also remembered for plots that are out of the ordinary .
For instance , Dragon Quest V : Hand of the Heavenly Bride follows the Hero through twenty years of his life as he finds a wife and starts a family .
The Dragon Quest games always focus on a character called the Hero , who must complete some kind of quest , ranging from fighting a Demon Lord to slaying dragons to getting married .
The earliest title only allowed the Hero in the party , though later games would include multiple party members , the ability to recruit monsters after random encounters , and even a job system that .
While not as expansive as what would come in the Final Fantasy titles , still held some interesting occupations .
While Dragon Quest V and VI were made for the Super Famicom , eventually the early Dragon Quest titles would find their way on as remakes , with improved graphics and sound as well as minor changes and tweaks to improve gameplay .
The Game Boy Color remakes also featured specialized borders if played on a Super Game Boy .
Obscure only that in the middle games never saw releases outside of Japan , the Dragon Quest series is one definitely worth looking up , and fan translations of ROMs can be found on the web .

Mother 2 / Earthbound
A SNES RPG that showed us the modern - day setting could work perfectly in an RPG , Earthbound could only be described as strange , quirky , and very fun .
From its off - beat music to its hilarious references to American culture and the RPG genre , this is definitely a title not to be missed .
Earthbound serves as the sequel to the Japanese only game Mother , released for the Famicom in 1989 .
It follows a boy named Ness , who discovers a meteor has crashed near his home .
There he encounters the alien Buzz Buzz , who informs him that he is from the future where an alien named Giygas has taken over the world .
From there Ness and his friends must venture from town to town , solving problems as they go .
And character names like Twoson , Threed , Fourside , and Magicant , are just an early indication of the bizarre experiences that are in store .
No random encounters occur , instead enemies are present on screen and attempt to rush the party .
If Ness and his pals are high enough in level , enemies will attempt to get away from them , and the party will automatically win battles .
Also , hit points roll downwards , like an odometer , and a character does not go unconscious until his hit points reach 0 , so a character whose hit points are rolling down can be healed , saving them .
Money is also earned by withdrawing it from ATMs , after Ness ’ father puts money in for him .
Originally meant to fit on an 8 megabit cartridge , Earthbound would eventually become large enough it required a 24 megabit cartridge , likely due to the large amounts of music in the game .
In all , Earthbound would require five years in development , being shared by both Ape , Inc. and HAL Laboratory , Inc .
When it did release in Japan , gamers had option of purchasing it boxed with the strategy guide and such promotional items as scratch and sniff stickers !
In America , though praised by reviewers , sales did n’t do so well , as RPGs were often overlooked at the time .
Still , what more could be said about a game that features the “ New Age Retro Hippie ” as an enemy ?

Breath of Fire Series
The SNES would see the start of Capcom ’s ongoing RPG series , Breath of Fire , where the player always follows the adventures of a blue haired hero named Ryu .
In every game except the fifth , Ryu has some sort of dragon - based heritage which allows him to learn to shape - shift into dragons to fight .
While the games all seem to fall into the same continuity ( except V , which Capcom says is a different universe entirely ) , the Ryu of each story is never the same character .
Capcom has never defined the order the games come in ( though IV - I - II - III seems the most plausible ) .
The Breath of Fire series features other constants as well .
Every game features a large cast of anthropomorphic characters .
There is always a female counterpart to Ryu named Nina , and in the first four titles she is always a blond woman with wings .
Ryu also has a love of fishing in every game , which serves as inspiration for a very common mini - game in the series .
Only Breath of Fire and Breath of Fire II were released on the Super Famicom , both seeing a release soon after in North America , though only II seeing release in Europe initially .
Both games were criticized on their release for being too difficult .
However once the player has advanced far enough in the game , the difficulty is countered by the size of the character roster .
The Breath of Fire series features the ability to switch out characters in the middle of a fight , so if one goes down , another can step in to take his place .
The games also show health bars of enemy creatures , though this feature does n’t work out for bosses , who often have more health than the bar registers .
While not the greatest RPGs on the console , the two Breath of Fire games are still solid titles , and definitely should n’t disappoint .

Super Mario RPG : Legend of the Seven Stars
This title would serve as the end of a relationship .
First , it was the final Mario game to be released on the Super Famicom .
Two , released in 1996 , it would be one of the final games to receive a major commercial release on the console in general .
And three , it would serve as one of the final collaborations that Nintendo and Square would have to for more than five years .
But despite all these endings , Super Mario RPG was worth it .
This game was incredible , featuring some of the best music on the console , 3D graphics absolutely phenomenal for the console , and an entertaining battle system that combines the play styles of a Squaresoft RPG with a Mario platformer .
Of course to handle this , the hardware had to be upgraded .
Super Mario RPG is one of three titles to be released outside of Japan with Nintendo ’s SA - 1 chip , improving clock speed and RAM while also employing copy - protection , thus ensuring the European crowd ( who never saw an official release ) would have to wait even longer for the ROM .
In the meantime , 210 sound effects were put in the game , along with music by Yoko Shimomura , who would incorporate the work of Koji Kondo and Nobuo Uematsu to round out the sound .
The game would combine many elements of both platformers and RPGs , fusing the two genres quite seamlessly even in the battle system , where well time commands could increase attack power and length .
For instance , one of Mario ’s most basic powers was to stomp on his enemies , but press a button at the right time , and he does it again .
And again , if the press is times right .
And again and again , and so on , dealing massive amounts of damage .
The game does feature many characters originally created for the game , though due to Square owning rights on many of them they are unable to appear in other games .
But the game is an excellent choice for fans of Nintendo or Squaresoft , and even Bowser is a playable character .
This title comes highly recommended .

Tales of Phantasia
While the first title in the Tales series of RPGs , Tales of Phantasia would n’t see a release outside of Japan until 2006 ( on the Gameboy Advance ) , which is a shame considering the quality of the game .
This title would be the first 46 Megabit game to be released on the Super Famicom , as well as the first game to feature streamed audio voices , thanks to the power of the “ Flexible Voice Driver . ”
This includes full vocals for the song “ Yume Wa Owaranai . ”
The plot follows two young men , Cless Alvein and Chester Burklight , who are out hunting when their village is destroyed .
When they return , they find their families killed , and Cress vows revenge .
Along the way , they make new friends and allies , adding to the party in skill , power , and capability .
It sounds stereotypical , yes , but the battle system goes above and beyond .
It ’s an early build of the Tales combat system , known as the Linear Motion Battle System .
Combat is on a 2D plane , similar to a fighting game , where characters can run around attacking one another .
The player generally controls one character , while the computer handles the rest .
In Tales of Phantasia , the system is not as refined as it would be in later games , so the player never has total control over their character .
But they can make general selections about the AI of other characters , improving the party ’s survivability .
On a side note , this title would lead to the creation of Tri-Ace , known for the Star Ocean line of RPGs .
The original creators , Wolf Team , were looking for outside publishers and financiers for their title .
Namco made the winning bid ( though Enix tried ) , and brought them into their company , then cut half the staff and began making massive changes to the game .
Incensed by this behavior , several team members protested the changes .
The controversy created delays , forcing Namco to slow Tales of Phantasia ’s development by a year .
After its release in 1995 , many Wolf Team members would leave to form Tri-Ace , leaving the others to stay at Namco .
Meanwhile , Nintendo was originally planning on publishing the title , but as they shifted gears to start working towards the Nintendo 64 , they dropped Tales of Phantasia .
Though the game was released , it created a schism with Namco , leading them to work almost exclusively with Sony , since Sega was a major rival of Namco’s .

Terranigma
One of the console ’s greatest and most overlooked Action RPGs , Terranigma was released only in Japan , Europe , and Australia .
So while PAL owners got to experience the joys of this title , most Americans went on with their lives , never knowing the greatness that lay across the oceans .
Terranigma tells the story of the resurrection of the world , progressing from millions of years ago to the near future .
The main character , named Ark , is a bit of a trouble maker , who just so happens to open a box that causes the inhabitants of his village the freeze .
The village elder , the only person besides
Ark not to be frozen , then tells him he has to fix things , and sends him on his way to bring life back to the Underworld , and then the Overworld .
The plot is heavy on ideas about good vs. evil , the creation of life , the progression of life , death , and reincarnation .
While not necessarily one of the greatest games in terms of graphics or music , the changes to the world that take place as Ark progresses with his mission , watching life grow into abundance , is an extremely beautiful change , and the music does a superb job of backing up the imagery .
Mode 7 graphics are utilized for the game world when moving between towns and dungeons , and appears to wrap around in a way that represents the curvature of the Earth .
As an Action RPG , the title also features an unusual combat system , where attacks differ depending on whether the character is running , standing still , or jumping .
There is also the option to block , though this does little more than stopping small projectiles .
The game also uses a magic system involving “ magic rings , ” which are made from Magirocks found in the game that the player takes to magic shops and has turned into rings .
Once a ring is used , it ’s destroyed , though the player will get the items used to make it back in their inventory to make more rings .
Terranigma was released in Japan along with a book by Kamui Fujiwara about the plot of the game that reads similarly to a “ Choose Your Own Adventure . ”
A two - part manga series , novel , and game atlas were also released .
For the German release , Club Nintendo put out a small comic book .

Star Ocean
Remember that mention of Tri-Ace ’s creation earlier ?
Well this is where it pays off .
Star Ocean is their first game release , published by Enix for the Super Famicom in 1996 , as well as the first title in the Star Ocean series .
While a North American release was initially in the works , it was canceled when Enix closed their America division .
A shame , too .
Star Ocean would be one of the most intensive games on the Super Famicom , coming in at a whopping 48 megabits .
The cartridge utilized the “ Flexible Voice Driver ” and featured even more voice work than Tales of Phantasia , though due to size limits the quality was lessened .
The game also featured surround sound .
Finally , the title was one of only two Super Famicom games to use the S - DD1 chip to help with graphics compression , the other being Street Fighter Alpha 2 .
But on to the good stuff .
The title follows Ratix , a young Fellpool from the planet Roak .
Rumors start spreading of a mysterious petrification disease , so one of his closest friend ’s father goes to investigate , subsequently becoming infected himself .
Ratix undertakes a quest to find a special plant that is said to cure any disease , but just as he reaches it a sudden light explodes , and two humans appear from space .
That ’s right , Star Ocean is a science fiction RPG , with many similarities to Star Trek .
It also features standard random encounters , but the battle system is real time , where the player controls a character as the rest of the party is controlled by computer AI , much like Tales of Phantasia .
After all , the original creators had just left Namco to found Tri-Ace , so the many similarities are quite striking .
The series also features the ability to gain up to 8 characters in the party , two of which are secret characters .
The title also serves as the first game to utilize the Private Action , where each character enters a town separately and does their own thing .
The player can use this to affect plot progression and character development , though its effects would end up far more important in later games in the series .
It was also the first to feature the Star Ocean system of item creation , which players could use to make powerful equipment , expensive objects to sell , and even cook food to get around the 20 - limit cap on individual items .
This would be one of the final hurrahs of the Super Famicon before the Nintendo 64 ’s release , hitting store shelves on July 19 , 1996 .

Seiken Densetsu ( Mana ) Series
The Seiken Densetsu series , often referred to as the Mana series , is a bit of an odd bird .
Originally intended as a sideline of games to the Final Fantasy line , the first Seiken Densetsu is also known as Final Fantasy Legend .
The next two in the series , Seiken Densetsu 2 and 3 , would release on the Super Famicom in a much different style .
While 3 never made it out of Japan , Seiken Densetsu 2 , better known in the USA and Europe as Secret of Mana , would reach wide acclaim , and is often considered one of the best games ever made .
Though originally designed for the Super Famicom CD add - on ( ie. the PlayStation ) as a launch title , the project was quickly turned into a cartridge upon Nintendo ’s dropping the peripheral .
The game was translated in less than a month , causing much of the text to be cut , so conversations are bare - bones at most .
Seiken Densetus 3 , meanwhile , was supposedly so large that translating it proved impossible on the SNES catridge , as well as plagued by some software bugs , and the game was never brought over .
Both games were definitely Action RPGs , with the player controlling one character while the CPU controlled two others in a pseudo - Zelda style combat system .
While both titles feature multiplayer , Seiken Densetsu 3 only supported two players .
Secret of Mana could support up to three via the use of a Multi Tap .
Both games also feature the Ring Menu system , where items , spells , equipment , and even various options settings can be changed on the fly .
Mode 7 would also be used occasionally in the titles , and Seiken Densetsu 3 featured surround sound .
Seiken Densetsu 3 also had players pick their characters at the beginning , heavily affecting gameplay and some plot elements .
It would feature a system to choose which stats to raise whenever a character leveled up , as well as job classes that would evolve over time .
Both titles would feature amazing graphics at the time of release , as well as large and epic soundtracks .
If you ’re a fan of the Action RPG , the two Seiken Densetsu titles for the Super Famicom are worth taking the time to check out .

Fire Emblem Series
And you thought the back story to the Seiken Densetsu series was complicated .
While the West would n’t see any Fire Emblem releases until after the popularity of Marth and Roy in Super Smash Bros .
Melee , Intelligent Systems was pumping them out like hotcakes in Japan .
There are four Fire Emblems for the Super Famicom , though most fans consider only three of them officially for the console , and only two were originally in cartridge form .
The first two releases , Fire Emblem : Monsho no Nazo and Fire Emblem : Seisen no Keifu , were released late in the Super Famicom ’s pre-Nintendo 64 days , in1994 and 1996 respectively .
The third game , BS Fire Emblem : Akaneia Senki , considered unofficial , was released in four individually playable parts in 1997 via the Satellaview .
And the fourth , Fire Emblem : Thracia 776 , was released in 1999 on Nintendo Power catridges .
For those not in the know , the Satellaview was a satellite modem Nintendo released as an add - on to the Super Famicom .
Many of the games were exclusive , and still are , and games had to be saved to a Memory Pak .
Since the Satellaview service has been discontinued , it is effectively impossible to play BS Fire Emblem : Akaneia Senki unless someone found a Memory Pak still containing the game , and even then the game would n’t be playable in its full glory , as the voice acting in the game was streamed .
Meanwhile , Nintendo Power catridges were flash RAM carts , which people could download games onto .
Fire Emblem : Thracia 776 was also released on a DX Pack , and so it is still possible to find the game .
Anyway , enough history .
The Fire Emblem games are Strategy RPGs , known for their difficulty due to permadeath .
Namely , if a character dies in a Fire Emblem , they stay dead for the rest of the game .
Any segments of story they were in are removed , and if necessary , plot will change , though if any of the major characters fall it usually spells game over .
Of course this also affects enemy units , so once you drop an enemy , they stay down .
Combat is handled on a large map which players must navigate in a turn - based approach , slowly moving their units one by one across it .
Instead of randomly generated player units , such as in titles like Final Fantasy Tactics , all characters have distinct personalities and skills , though they always fall under specific professions in Fire Emblem ’s job system .
Combat operates similarly to rock - paper - scissors , with certain weapon types being more or less effective against other types of weapons .
All the games take place in a continuous world on various continents , and many serve as sequels , prequels , or even between chapters of other games , and while interpersonal relationships were always an important part of the series , they ’re not fully delved into until after the Super Famicom titles .
If you enjoy medieval battles , turn - based combat , and engaging characters , the Fire Emblem titles are good places to look , though be wary :
They are n’t easy titles , though they are rewarding .

Front Mission
Want to try a Strategy RPG , but not into the fantasy setting ?
Enjoy near - future mecha combat ?
Want to blow the limbs off enemy mecha with all manner of destructive paraphernalia ?
Then , Sqauresoft ’s mech - combat - filled Front Mission is for you .
Front Mission is sometimes seen as more of a Strategy game than an RPG .
Units are moved about the field one by one and can either enter physical combat or take potshots .
All people drive battle mechs , called Wanzers in the series .
The Wanzers can be outfitted with all manner of different kinds of weapons , entailing a great deal of customization for every character .
The two arms , the legs , and the body all have their own hit points , and players can destroy different pieces to cripple their opponents .
While destroying the body will finish the Wanzer off , destroying their arms will remove their weapons and taking out their legs ruins their mobility .
Vehicles also exist , though they only have bodies .
The plot of Front Mission focuses on a war breaking out in the year 2090 on a small island in the Pacific , named Huffman Island .
The war , known as the Second Huffman War , occurs between the Oceania Community Union ( OCU ) and the United States of the New Continent ( UNC ) .
Though the main character , a man by the horrible name of Royd Clive , initially severs the OCU , the first mission in the game gets a bit bungled , and because of that he ’s effectively court - marshaled .
Which leads to is eventual recruitment as a mercenary for the OCU .
Unfortunately the plot remains rather vague , and is n’t fully explained .
Not even in the remake for the PlayStation , Front Mission 1st , is the plot fully explained , or in Front Mission 4 , which is directly related .
Finally , in Front Mission 5 is every mystery finally answered , so if you want the whole story , it ’ll require playing through every game .

Bahamut Lagoon
Another Strategy RPG that was never released outside of Japan , Bahamut Lagoon is a squad - based game where squads are moved one by one over battlefields in an attempt to destroy the enemy or finish specific objectives .
However , the defining thing about Bahamut Lagoon is that the squads also have dragons .
That ’s right , dragons .
The game ’s all about them .
You can fight with them , feed them to increase their stats , and by feeding them enough , get them to evolve into various forms to make them more effective at combat .
In general they have minds of their own , though they will accept simple commands .
The plot of the game centers around Byuu , head of the Resistance .
His aim is to defeat the Granbelos Empire , who recently conquered the world after a long and terrible war that destroyed Byuu ’s home kingdom .
They start by stealing a giant ship called the Farnheit , and set about on their open rebellion .
Now there is n’t much in the way of land in the game .
The world seems mostly composed of caves and floating continents , as well as ships made of land , including the Farnheit .
Flying around on a ship made of dirt and feeding dragons may not seem that interesting , but the game actually ends up rather fun .
Later on , mission modes become available , allowing the player to level themselves and their dragons without advancing the plot .
On a side note , Bahamut Lagoon shares designers with Final Fantasy VI , including an enemy .
In FFVI , an enemy Monster - In - A - Box can be found in the World of Ruin , named the Presenter .
The enemy is actually a commonly occurring one in Bahamut Lagoon , making an interesting tie - in between the games , though they are n’t officially related .
Also , Bahamut Lagoon released in Japan in early 1996 .
There were plans made by Square to release both it and Front Mission in North America , though events were quickly souring between Nintendo and Square .
This is often considered the ultimate reason for why they were never brought over , as Square would soon abandon Nintendo to make games exclusively for Sony .

Lufia Series
The Lufia Series is a set of currently four fantasy RPGs all set in the same world across multiple centuries , though only two were released for Super Famicom .
While America would get both Lufia & The Fortress of Doom and Lufia 2 : Rise of the Sinistrals , Europe and Australia would only see Lufia 2 ( called Lufia in Australia ) .
The two titles are actually out of order in the time line , with the ending of Lufia 2 serving as the intro to Lufia .
In the Lufia games , random encounters occur on the world map , but in Lufia 2 , dungeon enemies are represented by sprites similar to one of the enemies in the group , and only move when the player moves , making it possible to dodge them .
Both games are rife with puzzles throughout their dungeons , ranging from fairly easy to extremely difficult to figure out .
And then there ’s the combat system .
Lufia does n’t have characters target individual monsters .
Instead , you target the group .
If there are two lizards and two bats attacking , they ’re lumped into groups , and while you can target a specific group , you do n’t know which one you ’ll hit .
Also of note is that all characters take turns at the same time , and if one character kills an enemy that the next was targeting , that character will still attack the dead monster .
Strategies must be formed to effectively combat creatures .
As for story , a group of creatures called the Sinistrals emerge and attempt to take over the world , so some of mankind ’s greatest warriors go after them .
This story is the plot of Lufia 2 .
In Lufia , the story takes place 99 years later , when a new Sinistral army has emerged , and the player must take the hero they choose to name to fight against them .
While the games are sometimes criticized for not being as good as some of the heavy hitters of the genre like Chrono Trigger or Secret of Mana , and while the second one does suffer from a few glitches and spelling errors , they do make for a fun romp and any hardcore RPG fan should take the time to give them a spin .
Also of note , the original Lufia was considered for a port to the Sega Genesis , though the project was scrapped early on in its life .

Live A Live
Ok , I ’ll be honest .
This title is only on here because it ’s a personal favorite of mine .
The plot is actually a group of different stories about different characters from different times , ranging from a caveman in prehistory to a robot in the far future .
Each of the seven sections is very different , with some featuring without combat , to nothing but combat .
Every character is distinct , and while many may appear stereotypical , they still have likable personalities .
Ultimately after all seven sections are finished , a special section appears set in medieval Europe .
After completing this section , the final boss appears , asking the characters why they fight .
The player must then select who they will use to defeat him .
The battle system is something that really stands out as different from other RPGs Square produced .
Combat takes place on a 7×7 grid , though this may be divided up in various ways in different chapters .
Characters move around the grid , performing special moves that target specific areas .
Enemies do the same , and the two must fight until one side is finished off .
Skills work off charge times , and hit points are refilled after every battle , so the player can always fight at his hardest .
The game is also rife with little tributes to various films and historical characters .
Many of the chapters were written and designed by manga artists , as were character designs .
Yoko Shimomura also composed all the game ’s music , much like Super Mario RPG .
Unfortunately the game ’s relatively obscure and does n’t seem to have even been considered for a release outside of Japan .
So there you have it , 15 RPGs and series to look up for all you Super Famicom fans .
But just because I recommend these does n’t mean there are n’t many , many more RPGs on the console worth playing .
Here ’s a few more recommendations that should keep you occupied for a long time :

Illusion of Gaia
This is another Action RPG , known as Illusion of Time in Europe .
The game takes place in a psuedo - historical setting , with many well known locations like the Egyptian Pyramids serving as locales .
The player takes control of an explorer named Will and have them wander different areas attempting to reach new places and kill enemies .
In a bit of a twist , Illusion of Gaia features no experience system .
Instead , a jewel appears after clearing an area that will raise the characters ’ stats .
Money and equipment are also not present in the game , and there are few healing items .
Instead players can visit Dark Spaces to heal up and save .
It is this Dark Space that sets off the plot of the game .
Will accidentally stumbles into one where he is told by a being called Gaia that a comet is hurtling towards the earth and will bring great evil to it .
Will must do everything in his power to stop it .
While the game is n’t as acclaimed as many of the rest of its SNES RPG brothers , it is still considered quite good in its own right and deserves a look .
Nintendo also initially released the game with a t - shirt , so if you can , check it out .
On a side note , this title was created by Quintet , also known for Terranigma and Soul Blazer as well as other games like the ActRaiser series .
The titles see several similarities , and in a secret developer ’s room in Terranigma , the game is referred to as “ Illusion of Gaia 2 . ”
If you enjoyed Terranigma , definitely check this one out .

SaGa Series
While the SaGa games would eventually make their way out of Japan , only one of the three Super Famicom titles would see a release in America ( and not at all in the PAL regions apparently ) , and it would only take Squaresoft 13 years to do it .
The three SaGa titles on the Super Famicom are known as Romancing SaGa 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .
The games follow multiple characters , taking the time to focus on each separately .
After that …well , there really are n’t too many similarities , so I ’ll devote a quick paragraph to each one .
First , in Romancing Saga , the player selects one of 8 characters , follows their story to the end , then selects a new character who wanders around the world .
Often selectable characters will come across each other then continue on their merry way .
The world is your typical fantasy RPG fare .
The player can also recruit various party members from the world to continue with their storyline , and through this the overall plot of the game is discovered .
It ’s great for anyone who does n’t want to spend hours uncovering a long storyline and feeling like they ’re getting no where as each section is significantly shorter than a run through something like a Final Fantasy game
Second , Romancing Saga 2 mixes up the idea a bit by having the player play as a king or queen .
When they die , the player then controls their heir .
And upon their death , again the player controls the heir .
And again .
And again .
And so on and so forth until the game ends .
On a nifty note , only the first heir is chosen for the player as well , so after a while they player can decide who they wish to take over as .
The ultimate goal ?
Advance the kingdom , of course !
And third , in Romancing Saga 3 , the character is once again given a choice of 8 characters to pick from .
Battles can take a much more strategic approach than the standard RPG in Commander Mode , with the player creating battle formations that use teamwork to defeat enemies .
The game boasts a large cast , as well as a unique level system .
Characters do n’t level up .
Instead they gain stat boosts based on the way they fight .
If a character casts lots of spells , they become better at it .
Melee characters get better at physical attacks and defenses .
It allows the player to build them to their strengths , instead of the game forcing them down a specific tree or path .

Megami Tensei Series
Oh boy .
There ’s no easy way to talk about this one .
The Megami Tensei series happened to see a lot of releases on the Super Famicom , with no fewer than six releases , sometimes with three in one year .
Of course , while they ’re all related , they ’re not all sequels of each other .
The six titles are Shin Megami Tensei , Majin Tensei , Shin Megami Tensei 2 , Shin Megami Tensei if … , Majin Tensei 2 : Spiral Nemesis , Last Bible 3 , and Kyūyaku Megami Tensei .
They fall into four categories on the Super Famicom : the Shin Megami Tensei games , the Majin Tensei games , the Last Bible games , and the Digital Devil games .
The Shin Megami Tensei games are Shin Megami Tensei 1 , 2 , and if … .
And yes , it is actually called if ….
These games are First - Person RPGs , set in Tokyo in the year 199X , and revolve around high schoolers being sucked into the demon world .
Well , the first and if … do , while Tensei 2 is about what happens in the aftermath of 1 .
Combat is turn based , and every character has a specific alignment .
Many of the recruitable characters do n’t have official names either .
Then there are the Majin Tensei games , Majin Tensei and Majin Tensei 2 : Spiral Nemesis .
While these games are set in the same universe as the others , they are Strategy RPGs , similar to Fire Emblem in terms of gameplay and graphics .
The games feature some odd but interesting effects , such as moonlight affecting the strength of demon characters .
Again , they are set in a more modern setting , in locales in the series canon .
Next comes the Last Bible games .
Only one would be a Super Famicom release , while the others saw releases on Game Boy ( only one of which would see release outside of Japan ) .
Last Bible 3 is a bit different from the rest of the series in that it takes place in a fantasy setting instead of the modern day .
The main character is able to recruit monsters to join his party , and can then customize those monsters to fight in various ways for greater party benefit .
Monsters can also equip gear and level up like the main character .
It plays closer to the typical RPG than the other titles .
And finally there is the only Digital Devil game released for the Super Famicom , Kyūyaku Megami Tensei .
However , that ’s a bit of a misnomer , as this title is actually both of the Digital Devil games for the Famicom remade for the Super Famicom console .
Once again , the game is a First - Person RPG .
The plot is about a boy who summons demons via a computer program he wrote , hence the name Digital Devil .
The remake would see graphical improvements as well as valuable additions like a save feature for the first title .
It is important to note that all of this was spawned by a book series by Aya Nishitani .
The series did n’t stop on the Super Famicom either , but went on to see releases on PlayStation and PlayStation 2 , cell phones , Game Boy Advances , PSP , PC , Sega Saturn , and even a spin - off for the Virtual Boy .
Upcoming games include potential releases on the DS , PS3 , and Wii .
The series , sometimes referred to as MegaTen , is nothing short of HUGE , and is perhaps the most prolific series in game history , coming to 52 current releases since the Famicom if including every title ( there are a lot of cell phone titles ) .
It ’s considered a bit off the beaten path for most RPG fans , but if you really want something different , look the series up .
Shadowrun
Based on the popular pen and paper role playing game , Shadowrun is a cyberpunk RPG set in Seattle in the year 2050 .
The player follows Jake Armitage , a courier and shadowrunner , who suffers amnesia after an attempted hit on his life .
So now he has to find out who he is , found out why people want him dead , and get them back .
The game is an Action RPG with battles and assassination attempts occurring in real time .
It does feature a leveling up of sorts .
As Jake kills enemies he gains Karma , which can be spent to boost stats , power up abilities , or unlock new ones .
Jake can also speak with NPCs through a large database of terms that gets added to every time someone says a new keyword to him .
But finally , in a hark back to its roots and the novel Neuromancer , Jake can enter cyberspace to hack computers .
This gets him money and key information , though if you die in cyberspace , you die in the game .
While it did release in all three regions and English was the main language in all three , the Japanese version featured subtitles , a longer intro , and some small graphical differences .
The game did n’t sell very well despite it being considered pretty good .

Ys Series
The Ys series is a series of Action RPGs that follow a Germanic young man named Adol Christin , who goes around on various adventures , helping people as he goes .
Three of the games would see release on the Super Famicom , being Ys III : Wanderers from Ys , Ys IV : Mask of the Sun , and Ys V : Kefin , the Lost City of Sand .
The plots are : Adol learns that a village is being threatened by men in a castle so he helps out , Adol finds a message in a bottle asking for help so he boards a ship to help , and Adol hears a rumor about a lost city so he investigates .
It ’s simple , really .
Gameplay varies , though stays in the Action RPG genre , with camera position changing a bit in each of the titles , from a side - scroller to a top - down .
In the first two games , as in IV , Adol deals damage by running into his enemies , though in III and V , he manages to swing a sword .
In V he can even jump and pull out a shield , as well as use magic .
Ok , so it ’s extremely simple in concept and story so why include it ?
Because the Super Famicom featured a wide deal of diversity in its RPGs , enough for almost everyone to try .
If you ’ve tried one on this list and hated it , try a different one and see if it ’s more your style .
So many companies were putting out RPGs at the time that while there ’s lots of similarities , there ’s also lots of differences .
They ’re all worth spending a few minutes with .
But this is n’t all .
What follows is a short list of some other recommendations , though these are no where near the complete number of RPGs on the console .
There are literally hundreds on the console .
There ’s a good chance there ’s one for you .
