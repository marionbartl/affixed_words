Moore : Dem ban of Mich. , Fla. delegates ' is a crime ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday February 7 , 2008

Print This Email This Filmmaker Michael Moore , who got his start documenting the plight of laid off auto workers in Flint , Mich. , decried the Democratic Party 's decision to essentially disenfranchise voters in his home state as well as Florida after those states bucked party rules and scheduled presidential primaries in January .
" I live in Michigan so my votes did n't get counted .
...
It 's a crime that people in Michigan and Florida , our votes are not going to be heard or counted , " Moore told Larry King on his CNN program .
It 's not that the votes were n't counted -- Hillary Clinton squeezed out a victory over " uncommitted " in the state 's Jan. 15 vote -- but the Democratic National Committee decided to strip the state of its delegates to the national convention .
Candidates agreed not to campaign in the state and all the major contenders but Clinton removed their names from the ballot .
( Facing a tougher - than - expected battle with Barack Obama , Clinton now desperately wants those delegates back ; state party leaders are considering re doing the state 's vote with another primary or caucus ) .
Moore , whose latest documentary Sicko is nominated for an Academy Award this year , has n't endorsed a candidate in this year 's Democratic primary , saying anyone who 's nominated would be an improvement after " eight years of madness " under George W. Bush .
Already Moore has a Best Documentary Oscar statue on his mantel for Fahrenheit 9/11 , which was sharply critical of the Bush administration 's foreign policy .
His first film Roger & Me featured the Michigan native confronting General Motors CEO Roger Smith about the havoc caused by a plant closure in Flint , which cost the town 30,000 jobs .
Moore told King he was sad to see John Edwards drop out of the race , because he was drawn to the former North Carolina Senator 's populist appeal .
The filmmaker criticized Obama and Clinton 's healthcare plans for not cutting insurance companies out of the process , and his harshest words were aimed at the former First Lady .
" I actually liked her [ Clinton ] for a long time , " he said .
" But ... her continually voting for the war would make it almost morally impossible for me to vote for her . "

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Thom Yorke , Radiohead 's elfin lead singer , has talked in interviews about the apocalyptic changes that await us in the not - so - distant future .
So perhaps it was n't surprising that he and his band mates recently dumped EMI , their longtime record company , and released their new album on their Web site .
This decision by one of the music industry 's more revered acts begged the question :
How long will it be before record labels disappear entirely ?
Maybe not as soon as you 'd think , says Josh Deutsch , CEO of Downtown Records , a New York City - based label whose influence far exceeds its diminutive size .
Shortly after launching Downtown little more than two years ago , Deutsch enjoyed a tremendous success when his company released Gnarls Barkley 's genre - confounding " St. Elsewhere " , the breakthrough pop album of 2006 .
" St. Elsewhere " went on to sell 1.3 million copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan , and Deutsch became a music business star .
Since then , his track record has been mixed .
The 46 - year - old label head had high hopes for soul singer Kevin Michael 's self - titled first album .
But it only sold 10,000 copies when it was unveiled earlier this year despite a great deal of media buzz and a song on HBO 's " Entourage " .
Even so , Deutsch has been able to add some intriguing new artists to the Downtown roster like the Baltimore rapper Spank Rock and the French techno duo Justice whose single " D.A.N.C.E. " was almost inescapable last summer .
Downtown has also signed Mos Def , the talented rapper who lately has more success in Hollywood then on the mike .
Why are these artists flocking to Downtown when labels are supposed to be irrelevant ?
Because Deutsch is pursuing new businesses at a time when his industry sorely needs them .
One of the reasons Gnarls Barkely became such a rage was that Downtown released the duo's first single , " Crazy , " on MySpace , generating millions of streams before it hit stores , back when the social networking site was at its peak of coolness .
Now Deutsch is exploring ways to offer his artists ' songs for free and still ensure they are paid .
" There 's been a huge change in consumption patterns , " says Deutsch , who spent his earlier years in the music business working for big labels like Virgin and Elektra ( now part of the Warner Music Group ( WMG ) ) .
" Labels obviously have less control over distribution .
We 're dealing with the most powerful distribution medium ever created and for better or worse , it wants to share . "
Obviously , labels have been weakened .
But Deutsch argues they still have an important role to play .
What worked for Radiohead is n't practical for every artist .
The band built a ravenous fan base working with EMI , its longtime music industry .
That 's why it could handle the digital distribution of " In Rainbows " itself .
( It did need XL , an independent record company , to distribute the compact disc . )
That 's not necessarily true for less famous artists .
Says Deutsch : " For new artists , it 's a pretty expensive proposition to create compelling music and then create demand through video channels , online communities and radio , all which still drive real sales and increase the artist 's other revenue streams that are actually growing - like touring and merchandising . "
Deutsch is also trying to stay ahead of the curve online .
It 's not enough any more to preview songs on MySpace anymore .
He recognizes that younger music fans are increasingly discovering music on MP3 blogs like Pitchfork and Stereogum where bands often offer post their songs for no charge .
So he is using that template to create an entirely new business for Downtown .
In November , Deutsch launched RCRD LBL , which he describes as " the first online music label offering free , sponsor - supported MP3s . "
His partner is Peter Rojas , co-founder of Engadget , a popular tech blog and an old hand at creating thriving digital communities .
RCRD LBL 's selection is rich .
The site started with songs by over 275 artists from 15 independent labels including not just Downtown , but respected competitors such as Modular and Turntable Lab .
And unlike nearly after other MP3 blog ( at least the many this writer has visited ) artists are actually compensated even though fans have already downloaded hundreds of thousands of songs at no cost on the site .
" The kids can steal our music and I can still get paid , " says Spank Rock .
" God bless RCRD LBL , and God bless the Internet . "
Deutsch is also actively luring bigger acts to RCRD LBL .
In February , Moby , an artist on EMI 's Mute label , released a free " mega mix " from " Last Night , " his forthcoming album , on the site .
In return , RCRD LBL is sharing some of its revenues with the bespectacled rock star 's revenues based on page views .
Moby understandably finds all this intriguing .
" I Iove the fact that as the old / traditional infrastructure of the music business is breaking down , it 's being replaced by new and more compelling institutions like RCRD LBL , " he recently wrote on his own Web site .
" The vice - grip hegemony of the corporate labels and corporate radio stations is loosening every day , which can only be seen as a good thing for music and listeners . "
Well , maybe .
Of course , the reason RCRD LBL can afford to do this is that corporations like Puma and Virgin America are paying for advertising widgets on the site .
Still , both companies say they , too , are impressed its bleeding edge quality .
" It 's no secret that online media investment is rapidly increasing , and that the environments that are most compelling are the ones delivering great content for free , says Barney Waters , marketing vice president for Puma North America .
" RCRD LBL fits that bill . "
Deutsch declines to disclose RCRD LBL 's financial results .
However , he insists , " We 're months ahead of where we thought we would be . "
Now you can see why Deutsch is more optimistic than , say , Thom Yorke about the future .
If labels are to survive , they have to reinvent themselves .
That 's what Deutsch is busily doing at Downtown .
It looks like he 's going to be around for a while .
Harry Potter , James Patterson and Oprah Winfrey ’s book club aside , Americans — particularly young Americans — appear to be reading less for fun , and as that happens , their reading test scores are declining .
At the same time , performance in other academic disciplines like math and science is dipping for students whose access to books is limited , and employers are rating workers deficient in basic writing skills .
That is the message of a new report being released today by the National Endowment for the Arts , based on an analysis of data from about two dozen studies from the federal Education and Labor Departments and the Census Bureau as well as other academic , foundation and business surveys .
After its 2004 report , “ Reading at Risk , ” which found that fewer than half of Americans over 18 read novels , short stories , plays or poetry , the endowment sought to collect more comprehensive data to build a picture of the role of all reading , including nonfiction .
In his preface to the new 99 - page report Dana Gioia , chairman of the endowment , described the data as “ simple , consistent and alarming . ”
Among the findings is that although reading scores among elementary school students have been improving , scores are flat among middle school students and slightly declining among high school seniors .
These trends are concurrent with a falloff in daily pleasure reading among young people as they progress from elementary to high school , a drop that appears to continue once they enter college .
The data also showed that students who read for fun nearly every day performed better on reading tests than those who reported reading never or hardly at all .
At a fundamental level it ’s important to understand how JavaScript timers work .
Often times they behave unintuitively because of the single thread which they are in .
Let ’s start by examining the three functions to which we have access that can construct and manipulate timers .
var id = setTimeout ( fn , delay ) ; – Initiates a single timer which will call the specified function after the delay .
The function returns a unique ID with which the timer can be canceled at a later time .
– Initiates a single timer which will call the specified function after the delay .
The function returns a unique ID with which the timer can be canceled at a later time .
var id = setInterval ( fn , delay ) ; – Similar to setTimeout but continually calls the function ( with a delay every time ) until it is canceled .
– Similar to but continually calls the function ( with a delay every time ) until it is canceled .
clearInterval ( id ) ; , clearTimeout ( id ) ; – Accepts a timer ID ( returned by either of the aforementioned functions ) and stops the timer callback from occurring .
In order to understand how the timers work internally there ’s one important concept that needs to be explored : timer delay is not guaranteed .
Since all JavaScript in a browser executes on a single thread asynchronous events ( such as mouse clicks and timers ) are only run when there ’s been an opening in the execution .
This is best demonstrated with a diagram , like in the following :
There ’s a lot of information in this figure to digest but understanding it completely will give you a better realization of how asynchronous JavaScript execution works .
This diagram is one dimensional : vertically we have the ( wall clock ) time , in milliseconds .
The blue boxes represent portions of JavaScript being executed .
For example the first block of JavaScript executes for approximately 18 ms , the mouse click block for approximately 11 ms , and so on .
Since JavaScript can only ever execute one piece of code at a time ( due to its single - threaded nature ) each of these blocks of code are “ blocking ” the progress of other asynchronous events .
This means that when an asynchronous event occurs ( like a mouse click , a timer firing , or an XMLHttpRequest completing ) it gets queued up to be executed later ( how this queueing actually occurs surely varies from browser - to - browser , so consider this to be a simplification ) .
To start with , within the first block of JavaScript , two timers are initiated : a 10 ms setTimeout and a 10 ms setInterval .
Due to where and when the timer was started it actually fires before we actually complete the first block of code .
Note , however , that it does not execute immediately ( it is incapable of doing that , because of the threading ) .
Instead that delayed function is queued in order to be executed at the next available moment .
Additionally , within this first JavaScript block we see a mouse click occur .
The JavaScript callbacks associated with this asynchronous event ( we never know when a user may perform an action , thus it ’s consider to be asynchronous ) are unable to be executed immediately thus , like the initial timer , it is queued to be executed later .
After the initial block of JavaScript finishes executing the browser immediately asks the question :
What is waiting to be executed ?
In this case both a mouse click handler and a timer callback are waiting .
The browser then picks one ( the mouse click callback ) and executes it immediately .
The timer will wait until the next possible time , in order to execute .
Note that while mouse click handler is executing the first interval callback executes .
As with the timer its handler is queued for later execution .
However , note that when the interval is fired again ( when the timer handler is executing ) this time that handler execution is dropped .
If you were to queue up all interval callbacks when a large block of code is executing the result would be a bunch of intervals executing with no delay between them , upon completion .
Instead browsers tend to simply wait until no more interval handlers are queued ( for the interval in question ) before queuing more .
We can , in fact , see that this is the case when a third interval callback fires while the interval , itself , is executing .
This shows us an important fact :
Intervals do n’t care about what is currently executing , they will queue indiscriminately , even if it means that the time between callbacks will be sacrificed .
Finally , after the second interval callback is finished executing , we can see that there ’s nothing left for the JavaScript engine to execute .
This means that the browser now waits for a new asynchronous event to occur .
We get this at the 50ms mark when the interval fires again .
This time , however , there is nothing blocking its execution , so it fires immediately .
Let ’s take a look at an example to better illustrate the differences between setTimeout and setInterval .
setTimeout ( function ( ) { /*
Some long block of code ... */ setTimeout( arguments.callee , 10 ) ; } , 10 ) ; setInterval ( function ( ) { /*
Some long block of code ... */ } , 10 ) ;
These two pieces of code may appear to be functionally equivalent , at first glance , but they are not .
Notably the setTimeout code will always have at least a 10 ms delay after the previous callback execution ( it may end up being more , but never less ) whereas the setInterval will attempt to execute a callback every 10 ms regardless of when the last callback was executed .
There ’s a lot that we ’ve learned here , let ’s recap :
JavaScript engines only have a single thread , forcing asynchronous events to queue waiting for execution .
setTimeout and setInterval are fundamentally different in how they execute asynchronous code .
and are fundamentally different in how they execute asynchronous code .
If a timer is blocked from immediately executing it will be delayed until the next possible point of execution ( which will be longer than the desired delay ) .
Intervals may execute back - to - back with no delay if they take long enough to execute ( longer than the specified delay ) .
All of this is incredibly important knowledge to build off of .
Knowing how a JavaScript engine works , especially with the large number of asynchronous events that typically occur , makes for a great foundation when building an advanced piece of application code .
This is an excerpt from my work - in - progress book : Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja .

The United States has been working to guarantee equal opportunity for women in the new Iraq .
However , this effort conflicts with the recent decision to allow sectarian groups greater powers ( particularly Muqtada al - Sadr ) in the government .
Now , the Iraqi government has quietly ordered all women in the police force to turn over their weapons to men in an apparent bow to religious extremists .
Once again , the question raised by these stories is what we are building for $ 1.7 trillion .
In the end , Iraq appears likely to fall under the control of religious groups aligned with Iran or at least associated with anti-American views .
More importantly , we are building a system on principles that we find deeply offensive and abusive to minorities and women .
With Americans shouldering debt of $ 50,000 per family is it appropriate to expect working mothers to pay money to a country where they would be denied positions or authority due to their gender ?

In The World is a new column that explores the ways people from MIT are using technology -- from the appropriately simple to the cutting edge -- to help meet the needs of local people in places around the planet .
If you know of a good example and would like the News Office to write about it , please e-mail dlc1@mit.edu .
Tuberculosis has long been eradicated from the world 's industrialized nations but continues to take a terrible toll in a few poor , rural regions of Asia and Africa .
Every year , 10 million new cases are diagnosed and two million people die of the disease .
It 's not that new treatments are needed -- medical science long ago figured out how to cure tuberculosis using a cocktail of antibiotics .
The problem is getting the medicine to the people who need it and , most difficult , making sure they follow the six - month regimen of daily doses .
Failure to follow the regimen not only leads to likely death of that patient , but fosters the development of antibiotic - resistant strains of the disease .
" The problem is , how do you get people to take this complex regimen , " says Manish Bhardwaj , a doctoral student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science who works in the Microsystems Technology Laboratories .
After a year of hard work and about eight revisions , Bhardwaj and a team of collaborators think they may have found the answer .
It 's a high - tech solution in a simple , inexpensive and easy - to - use - package .
The first part of the two - component system is a kind of " smart " pillbox , called the uBox .
It has 14 chambers that can each be loaded with several pills , which it dispenses from one chamber per day .
To alert the patient that it 's time to take the medicine , the box flashes its lights and sounds a buzzer .
When the compartment is opened , the uBox records the exact time and prevents double - dosing by refusing to open again until the next treatment is due .
After two weeks , a health care worker reloads the box and digitally records and transmits the information stored in it .
Doctors and public health services can then get complete data on compliance , patient by patient , in almost real time , instead of having to wait until the end of the six - month treatment .
" How do you know if pills are getting to the patients or if patients are taking them ?
Today , there 's no good way of doing this , " Bhardwaj says .
If people fail to take all their pills , " it is possible to do harm by treatment that does n't have good adherence . "
Missing medication can lead to the development of resistant strains , which can then be spread by that noncompliant patient .
" The people they infect have no chance . "
Today , less than half of the patients that start the regimen successfully complete it ..
" We want to make sure the worker is motivated , " Bhardwaj says , and at present there 's no way to tell which workers are diligent about making the calls and which ones may skip some of their appointed - visits .
Accordingly , the uBox has an additional feature : a receptacle for a tiny key , like a headphone plug , which is carried by the visiting health care worker .
At each visit the worker inserts the key , thus recording the fact that the patient really has been visited -- another important gauge of compliance .
The second part of the group 's new system is a cell phone , called the uPhone .
By using special software , health care workers can record a patient 's temperature , weight , and answers to a list of questions related to symptoms , which adds to the set of detailed patient data analyzed by doctors monitoring the study .
By looking at patterns of effects , the doctors can tell which field workers are achieving the best adherence rates with their patients and find out just what it is that those people are doing right .
They can then be recruited to train additional workers .
Bhardwaj has been working with MIT alumni Goutam Reddy and Sara Cinnamon on the engineering and electronics of the pillbox , doctoral student Bill Thies and alumnus Pallavi Kaushik on the uPhone software , and MIT seniors Oliver Venn and Jessica Leon on fundraising and logistics .
Bhardwaj and Thiess went to Bihar province this January to begin their first field test of the product , conducting a training session for 22 workers who will , in turn , train the field workers to distribute the pillboxes in the field .
In late April , Bhardwaj will return to Bihar to train workers an two new sites .
The first actual field test with 100 of the boxes and 10 cell phones should start in mid-May .
If all goes well , a second round of testing , using 1,000 uBoxes , is set to begin .
After that , it all depends on the results -- and on the ability to raise funds for future deployment .
Health officials in India are already keenly interested in this test , and Bhardwaj is about to meet with representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to discuss possible collaboration and support ..
The Ven. Tenzin Priyadarshi , MIT 's Buddhist chaplain , helped to get the project started and says , " I am hopeful that the uBox - uPhone project will revolutionize the way we understand and provide health care in rural areas of the world . "
While Bhardwaj is proud of the product his team developed , he is not proprietary about it .
" We hope to make the uBox and the uPhone the standard of treatment in Bihar .
We worked very hard to make something very simple and elegant , " he says .
" But we'd be delighted if someone beats us to it and builds a uBox cheaper .
We hope other people will copy us . "

ちょっと古い話になってしまったが、Wiiテレビの友チャンネル、ありゃぁ相当家電業界にショックを与えたよ、という話。
Wiiの新いチャンネル 「テレビの友チャンネル」が先日リリースされた。日本のブログスフィアではあまり話題になっていないようだが、家電メーカーの中では蜂の巣をつついたような大騒ぎになって...いたはず。現に先日会った家電メーカーの人からも真っ先に出たのがこの話題だ。
このリリースで大きな意味を持つのは以下4点だ。
テレビの脇役だったゲーム機が" テレビ放送 " そのものに絡む機能を搭載してきたこと
デジタルEPGデータ＋ユーザー参加型メタデータという聖域にWiiというNot家電Butメジャーな商品で踏み込んできたこと
EPG データの新しい表示方法が発明*1されたこと
UI を工夫すればリモコンボタンは1〜2個で十分だということを実証したこと
順に解説していこう 。
テレビの脇役だったゲーム機がEPGを搭載 一部ネット系大手メディアでも書かれているが、TVを見ることが中心でゲームをすることはサブ、というのが従来のTVだったが逆になる可能性があるということ。テレビの友チャンネルが公開される前から、既に若年層の一人暮らしなどではこの傾向が始まっていた。テレビをあまり見ない20代独身一人暮らしの家などでは、TVを「外部入力１」から長らく切り替えていないなぁ、という人も多いのではないだろうか。
これは家電メーカー側にも責任があるといわざるを得ない。ぶっちゃけ「最後に見ていたチャンネルを表示する」なんて機能、いつまで積んでんだよって話である。
電源切って、30分以内に再度電源入れた場合はlastチャンネルを表示、そうでない場合はWindowsのデスクトップだかWiiのホーム画面だかに相当するメニューセレクト画面(今のTVだったらEPG＋外部入力選択画面)でも出してほしいものだ。いつまでたってもTVが古いUIに固執し続けていたツケがこんなところで回ってきたのかな、という印象である。
ゼロベースで構想した新しいTVのUIについてはまた機を改めて紹介したい。
デジタルEPGデータ＋ユーザー参加型メタデータ 東芝がHDDレコーダー向けに導入をはじめていたデジタルEPGデータにユーザーの予約履歴をかけあわせることで、番組予約ランキングなどを提示するサービスがあった。
これぞ家電ならではの要素、と家電メーカーの中では皆豪語していたものだが、あまりにも家電メーカー側のアクションが遅すぎたことがここでもつけいる隙を与えてしまったと言えるだろう。
DVDレコーダというDVDレコーダほぼ全てがネット接続機能を有し、視聴履歴・予約履歴・再生履歴・編集履歴・お気に入り番組リストなどを互いにシェアし合うことで提供される新しい価値(話題の番組を知る、面白い所だけ見る、など)サービスを早期に普及させてしまっていれば、Wiiテレビの友チャンネルを「そんな能動的にしか付与できないメタデータしか扱えない機器じゃぁ辛いねぇ（プププ」と笑い飛ばせた可能性も十分にあったのだが、もう遅い。
EPG データの新しい表示方法の発明 EPG データの表示手法については特許紛争が起きたりしていてちょっと根が深い問題なのだが、少なくとも素人目には3D表示をうまく使ったEPG表示手法は画期的なものだ。万人に使いやすいかどうかは別にしても、こういったEPGが世に出て高く評価されてしまうと、家電メーカーにとっては3重の苦しみが待っている。
1つは超複雑なあのEPGプログラムを完全リニューアルする必要性に迫られる可能性があること。もう1つは3D-EPGを表示するためのハードウェア側の仕組みを搭載しないといけないということ(現在のTVでは相当厳しい)。そして最後に、ボタン式赤外線リモコンから、ポインティングデバイスを備えた入力デバイスに変える必要性に迫られることだ。どれも目ん玉が飛び出るほどのコストと人的リソース、そして決裁書の山がなければ実現できないことであり、「任天堂め、ややこしいもん出してくれたなぁコンチクショウ」と思ってるギョーカイ人は少なくないはず。
逆に言えば業界全体が「先進的すぎるもの・価格が高いものはユーザに受け入れられない」というエゴ文句で進化を停滞させていた、言ってしまえば製品制限カルテルになっていたわけで、これで正しい競争に戻る可能性がでてきたとも取れる。エンドユーザーとしては歓迎すべきことである。
あと細かいところでは、今回の3D-EPGでどういった特許が発生していて、ADC*2並びにGML*3との力関係、今後の家電メーカーへのライセンスの有無などが気になるところだ。
リモコンボタンは1〜2個で十分!?
まぁこの話を書くとコアなユーザーからはいっぱい文句が来るのは覚悟の上だが、以前書いたことが現実になりつつあるなぁという印象。家電メーカーはハードのUI設計は得意だがソフトのUI設計はからっきしだ。にもかかわらず現実はその分野での戦いに引きずり込まれている。
携帯電話でiPhoneショックが起きたように、DVDレコーダーやTV、PMP( Personal media player ) などでも同様のプレイヤー入れ替えが起こる可能性がまだまだありそうだ。 参考 ：

The gunfire in Karachi on Monday night was celebratory
Voting explained
They are confident supporters of President Pervez Musharraf are heading for a heavy defeat .
Early unofficial returns suggest some of the president 's allies have lost their seats , but it is expected to be some time before a clear trend emerges .
Polling was delayed after the killing of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto .
On the streets of Karachi , young supporters of Ms Bhutto's PPP party celebrated late into the night , dancing and firing guns into the air , says the BBC's Jill McGivering .
But across the city , their main political rivals , allies of President Musharraf , were also claiming victory , our correspondent adds .
Most official counts will not be declared until later on Tuesday .
Street protest threats
A number of people were killed in clashes between rival party supporters during Monday 's election , and there were reports of missing ballot boxes .
But there was also widespread relief that there were none of the major bomb attacks which had marred the run-up to the election .
Fears of violence had dissuaded many of the country 's 80 million eligible voters from leaving their homes , and voter turnout was estimated to be less than 40 % .
Close to half a million security personnel , including about 80,000 soldiers , had been deployed to quell any outbreak of fighting .
Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif accused the PML - Q party that backs Mr Musharraf of fixing votes and attacking supporters of his PML - N party in some areas .
Asif Ali Zardari , Ms Bhutto's widower and the leader of her PPP party , had threatened to launch street protests if the election was rigged .
One international election observer , US Senator Joseph Biden , said he feared instability if electoral malpractice was suspected .
" If the majority of Pakistani people do not think the election was fair then I think we have a real problem , " he said .
No clear majority
For his part , Mr Musharraf , who voted in Rawalpindi , vowed to work in " harmony " with whoever won Monday 's election .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The difficulty is in foreseeing what changes will come .
Briscott , Pakistan
Polls suggest a fair vote is likely to result in a hung parliament , with none of the three biggest parties winning a majority , analysts suggest .
Attention will then turn on the PPP , and whether it chooses to join forces with pro-Musharraf parties , or with Mr Sharif 's party .
Mr Sharif is staunchly opposed to the president , and if the two opposition parties jointly gain two - thirds of the seats , they may try to impeach Mr Musharraf , correspondents say .
Mr Musharraf stepped down as army chief late last year .
He has ruled the country since seizing power in a coup in 1999 .

Check this one out about Sessions , it appears that he is an old vote suppressor from way back .
Wiki , under controversies Sessions had unsuccessfully prosecuted three civil rights workers ( including Albert Turner , a former aide to Martin Luther King , Jr ) , on a case of election fraud for the 1984 election .
Sessions hours interrogating black voters in predominantly black counties , finding only 14 allegedly tampered ballots out of the more than 1.7 million ballots cast .
The three civil rights workers were acquitted after four hours of jury deliberation Link

We can expect bushie league justice just us to continue in McCain .
Evidently McCain is not a natural born Citizen , and is unqualified to be the American President .
When asked , he said " it depends on what the meaning of is is " .
He also said he was running for the Amurkan Preznit position so it does n't matter anyway .
He finished by saying " preznit blush was n't qualified either , but to our 5 Supreme Republican Delegates on the Supreme Court , who choose preznit blush , that law only applies to democrats " .

So what else happened in Boston , besides Siegelman supporting Gore ?
Maybe Fuller 's sitting on the transcripts to run everything past " statutes of limitations " because that 's how lawyers play their little games .

So true 99 , but I sure would like to see this state secret shit challenged by a group of law makers who actually understand the Constitution .
That crap allows them to start wars , strip civil liberties , and falsely prosecute at will because nobody gets to see the evidence .
When I was reading Madison 's biography this passage could n't be anymore pertinent than today : James Madison in his 1795 “ Political Observations ” wrote :
“ Of all the enemies of true liberty , war is , perhaps , the most to be dreaded , because it comprises and develops the germ of every other .
War is the parent of armies ; from these proceed debts and taxes ; and armies , and debts , and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few .
In war , too , the discretionary power of the Executive is extended ; its influence in dealing out offices , honors and emoluments is multiplied ; and all the means of seducing the minds , are added to those of subduing the force , of the people .
The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes , and the opportunities of fraud , growing out of a state of war , and in the degeneracy of manner and of morals , engendered in both .
No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare .
War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement .
In war , a physical force is to be created ; and it is the executive will , which is to direct it .
In war , the public treasuries are to be unlocked ; and it is the executive hand which is to dispense them .
In war , the honors and emoluments ( medals ) of office are to be multiplied ; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed ; and it is the executive brow they are to encircle .
The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast ; ambition , avarice , vanity , the honorable or venal love of fame , are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace . ”
He would be puking to see this out of control executive and portions of our intelligence and defense communities coupled with the revolving door of the military industrial congressional lobbying oil complex .
Talk about inevitable endless war were always just one more false flag away from !

I just took a quick look at Kos .
I do n't go there very often .
Maybe I have missed this .
Maybe a good Kossack can inform us if Kos has made any posts about Siegelman .
I did see Kos mention Dan Abrams ' show today , so he has no excuse not to cover this story .

PST ..... Ha ha .
Jack Kingston goes on Dan Abrams ' show to blast Obama 's lack of flag lapel pin and , to Abrams ' amusement , goes on the air without a flag lapel pin .
If Kos has personally looked into this story , he 's not making that too easy to find .
And if he has n't posted on this , is that not more circumstantial evidence that Kos is a Republican in Democratic clothes ?

I wo n't list the # of comments for her entries like I did before , but they are very low .
So how exactly is Kos supporting " netroots ? "
Anyway , her last entry was on Nov. 27th , 2007 , and it did have to do with Mr. Siegelman .
I am not sure why this was never posted here , but I think it incredibly important that all Americans understand what has happened in this case .

ah , this is one of the hidden aspects of the amerikan judicial system .
i was once involved as a plaintiff in a major piece of anti-trust litigation .
the jury found for this plaintiff .
but two days later , the federal district judge , a republican appointed by ronald raygun , selected by james baker , reversed the verdict [ did you know that this can be done ] .
the defendant was a major creator of the modern fascist party [ aka republican ] .
call it one of the founders of the heritage foundation .
of course , i decided to appear this judges ' override of a jury verdict .
we actually received the trial transcript in a timely fashion .
but we could not make our appeal because the judge refused to enter an official order in the matter .
if a judge fails to enter an order , nothing further can proceed .
this becomes a very dicey situation .
what do you do ?
it as if your litigation never occurred .
the only recourse is going to the appellate level and seeking a writ of mandamus .
though this is not beloved by the federal judiciary , eventually we made that move .
and the relevant circuit eventually issued a writ of mandamus , which ordered the federal district court judge to issue his final order .
still he failed to do it .
after some months , we filed another request for a writ of mandamus .
and it was issued .
long and the short of it , it was n't until the third writ of mandamus and the retirement of warren burger that the judge finally issued his final order .
the story is much deeper than that , but suffice it to say , the barriers to achieving justice when the judiciary is part of a political apparat are virtually insurmountable .
it is also important to note , here , that virtually all federal judges receive their appointments based on their financial contributions to a political party .
as a lawyer friend of mine , with great family wealth in ohio , said to me shortly after being admitted to the ohio bar in the early 1970's , " if i gave $ 250,000 to either the republican or the democratic party , i could become a federal judge almost immediately . " there is the system .
still a spoils [ patronage ] system .

Thanks Ancient .
I 've been getting a bit more confident lately to post at this blog .
I was gonna make another one last night .
But to be honest , a good blogpost takes a lot of energy .
Anyway , good folks can try this for scorekeeping .
I went to Boston.com , the Boston Globe 's domain .
I plugged in Don Siegelman .
There were n't many results .
The few recent ones were from news wires .
A good chunk of the results only mention Siegelman in passing .
These could be found in the Business section where the main point of the stories were about Scushy or Scrushy , sorry , can't remember the spelling .
But then I plugged in Paris Hilton for the kicks .
Tons of results .
I am ashamed that until recently , I did n't know about this story .
It would be nice if a good Kossack has any knowledge if Kos personally has posted on this story .
If not , then what does that say about Kos? Brad and Larisa should consider making us a forum .

I rarely call people out for being disinfo .
If one is gonna do that , they better have some damn good proof .
Speaking of which , I have found closure with Fintan Dunne , Steven Hertzberg of ESI , Kos , Democratic Underground , Brad , Bev , and Raw Story .
Fintan Dunne has taken over my username at his breakfornews disinfo website .
He is doing what Kos does as regards to not letting people off his member list .

Fintan Dunne called out Brad , Larisa , and Bev as being CIA fakes .
Who did he leave off the list ?

One last thing .
There is nothing at Dunne 's place on Siegelman except for one obscure thread from a long time ago which Dunne ignored .
Before he stole my username , Paulo_Freire , I took him to task for having no proof for his fakes list and for ignoring the Siegelman story .
I requested that I be turned into a guest , i.e. , taken off the members list .
Members are unable to do that .
Only the admin can .
So Hertzberg is scrubbed and pruned , while I am held prisoner ?
I believe that Dunne and Hertzberg were attempting to disseminate disinfo through using tactics similar to those used by cults .
How was Hertzberg 's cover blown ?
He told his name to another member who requested it , in exchange for going on skype with him .
But Hertzberg later pissed that person off .
That dude revealed Hertzberg 's name .
Then that got scrubbed quick .
But a third poster took the name and ran with it .
Hertzberg was already all over Ron Paul , had already posted about his website ronpaulonline .
The third poster connected the dots .
He posted about ESI .
Hertzberg / Navari had already tried to bully me before .
When I learned that he was Navari , then I ran with the ball .
I am a nobody who is sick and tired of all the bull happening on the internet .
I have been fighting back .

We are extending the JVM with first - class architectural support for languages other than Java , especially dynamic languages .
This project will prototype a number of extensions to the JVM , so that it can run non-Java languages efficiently , with a performance level comparable to that of Java itself .
Our emphasis is on completing the existing bytecode and execution architecture with general purpose extensions , as opposed to a new feature for just one language , or adjoining an unrelated new execution model .
We want the new languages to co-exist gracefully with Java in the JVM , and to benefit ( like Java ) from its powerful and mature technologies .
We are looking to remove “ pain points ” already observed by implementors of successful or influential languages , as opposed to attempting more speculative work on unproven features or niche languages .
Sub - projects with major activity include dynamic invocation , continuations , tail - calls , and interface injection .
There is a large number of more speculative , lower - priority sub-projects .
These are included in hopes that someone in the community will become excited with us at the prospects of a more dynamic JVM , to the point of sharing in its creation .

A mother of five who says she was sexually harassed and assaulted while working for Halliburton / KBR in Iraq is headed for a secretive arbitration process rather than being able to present her case in open court .
A judge in Texas has ruled that Tracy Barker ’s case will be heard in arbitration , according to the terms of her initial employment contract .
Barker says that while in Iraq she was constantly propositioned by her superior , threatened and isolated after she reported an incident of sexual assault .
Barker ’s attorneys had argued that Halliburton / KBR had created a “ boys will be boys ” atmosphere at their camps and that sort of condition is not the type of dispute that she could have expected to be within the scope of an arbitration provision .
( Original Article )
BERKELEY , CA —
As structures made of metal get smaller — as their dimensions approach the micrometer scale ( millionths of a meter ) or less — they get stronger .
Scientists discovered this phenomenon 50 years ago while measuring the strength of tin " whiskers " a few micrometers in diameter and a few millimeters in length .
Many theories have been proposed to explain why smaller is stronger , but only recently has it become possible to see and record what 's actually happening in tiny structures under stress .
Compression of a nickel pillar whose free end has a diameter of about 150 nanometers .
Before compression ( left ) the pillar has a high density of defects , visible as dark mottling .
After compression all the defects have been driven out , a previously unobserved process known as " mechanical annealing . "
Andrew Minor , of the Materials Sciences Division in the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , with colleagues from Hysitron Incorporated and the General Motors Research and Development Center , used the In Situ Microscope at the National Center for Electron Microscopy ( NCEM ) to record what happens when pillars of nickel with diameters between 150 and 400 nanometers ( billionths of a meter ) are compressed under a flat punch made of diamond .
The transmission electron microscope is equipped so that samples can be stressed , measured , and videotaped while being observed under the electron beam .
" What controls the deformation of a metal object is the way that defects , called dislocations , move along planes in its crystal structure , " Minor says .
" The result of dislocation slip is plastic deformation .
For example , bending a paper clip causes its trillions of dislocations per square centimeter to tangle up and multiply as they run into one another and slide along numerous slip planes . "
In general , mechanical deformation tends to increase the number of dislocations in a material .
But for small - scale structures , with a much greater proportion of surface area to volume , the process can be very different .
The videotaped images from the electron microscope helped the researchers understand why nanoscale nickel pillars are so strong by allowing them to observe changes in the microstructure of the pillars during deformation — including a never - before - seen process the researchers dubbed " mechanical annealing . "
( In bulk materials , annealing , a treatment that reduces the density of defects , is usually accomplished by heating . )
Minor says , " The first thing we observed was that , before the test , the nanoscale pillars of nickel were full of dislocations .
But as we compressed the pillar , all the dislocations were driven out of the material — literally reducing the dislocation density by 15 orders of magnitude and producing a perfect crystal .
We called this effect mechanical annealing . "
The pillars Minor and his colleagues tested were machined from pure nickel using a focused ion beam ( FIB ) , a new technique for small - scale mechanical - compression testing first described in 2004 by Michael Uchic of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and his colleagues .
The FIB technique makes it possible to create much smaller structures than the metal " whiskers " first studied in the 1950s , which are made by growing crystals .
Some of the dislocations the researchers observed in the machined pillars were relatively shallow and caused by the ion beams themselves .
Others extended through the crystal and were presumably pre-existing defects .
Under compression , mechanical annealing caused both kinds of defect to vanish .
" Essentially all the dislocations escape from the crystal at the surface , and you do not get storage of dislocations like you would in larger crystals , " Minor says .
" What results is a process called ' dislocation starvation , ' recently proposed by William D. Nix of Stanford , among others , which has quickly became one of the leading theories of why smaller structures are stronger . "
Minor explains ,
" The idea is that if dislocations escape the material before they can interact and multiply , there are not enough active dislocations to enable the imposed deformation .
The structure can only deform after new dislocations are created . "
This is precisely the process he and his colleagues observed with NCEM's
In Situ Microscope , strong evidence that " dislocation starvation " is the correct explanation for the increased strength of small structures .
What happens if a defect - free nanoscale nickel pillar continues to be compressed ?
Something has to give , which happens when new sources of dislocation " nucleate " in the material .
As the existing dislocations disappear in the pillar because of mechanical annealing , the nucleation of new dislocation sources happens at progressively higher stresses .
In the pillar structures , plastic deformation may take the form of sudden flattening , bulging , twisting , or shearing of the pillar , as bursts of new dislocations propagate through it .
Or the hardened pillars , made stronger by mechanical annealing , may punch right down into the substrate — even though pillar and substrate are the same continuous piece of metal .
Both processes were captured in the In Situ Microscope 's dramatic videotaped experiments .
Andrew Minor with the In Situ Microscope at the National Center for Electron Microscopy .
The FIB machining used by the NCEM researchers produced nickel pillars that were slightly tapered , and the researchers noted that this geometry affected where and how plastic deformation occurred , generally being greater in the smaller - diameter , free end ( top ) of the pillar .
In larger pillars , those approaching 300 nanometers in diameter , mechanical annealing was not complete , and some dislocations remained visible even after compression .
Yet even these pillars exhibited enhanced strength , and progressively higher stresses were needed to continue deformation — underlining the point that it is the creation of mobile defects that determines strength in these small volumes .
" The beauty of the pillar - testing geometry is that we can straightforwardly define stress .
Then we can correlate the measured stresses with discrete plastic events recorded in situ and more clearly interpret the quantitative data from our experiments , " says Minor .
" The debate over what determines the strength of a small structure has come down to almost a chicken - and - egg question — is something strong because you need a high stress to move a dislocation that is already there ?
Or is it strong because you need a high stress to nucleate a new dislocation ?
In this case , it seems that source nucleation — that is , the 'egg ' — is the determining factor . "
" Mechanical annealing and source - limited deformation in submicrometre - diameter Ni crystals , " by Z.W. Shan , Raj Mishra , S.A. Syed Asif , Oden L. Warren , and Andrew M. Minor , appears in the January , 2008 issue of Nature Materials , advance online publication 23 December , 2007 at http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmat2085.html.

Khaled al - Maqtari's nightmare began when American troops arrived at the al - Ghufran market in Fallujah in January 2004 .
He was arrested along with other terrorist suspects and taken to Abu Ghraib jail .
For the next four years he was held captive , moved from country to country and suffered , he says , appalling torture .
Mr al - Maqtari , from Yemen , was one of the many inmates in the US 's secret " ghost detention " who disappeared into an international network of prisons , their whereabouts unknown to family and friends .
British soldiers , he claims , were involved in investigating him although they did not play any part in the abuse .
Details of what Mr al - Maqtari , 31 , says was done to him emerge after a recent admission from the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband ( after previous denials ) that the island of Diego Garcia , a British territory , had been used in American rendition flights .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Amnesty International , in a report into the Yemeni's case , has called for an independent inquiry into the extent of the UK 's role in the US 's " war on terror " and , especially , rendition flights .
An investigation across the Atlantic into the subject was also necessary , says the human rights group , to bring the torturers to justice and provide compensation for the victims .
During his incarceration
Mr al - Maqtari was moved from Baghdad to a prison near Kabul in Afghanistan and later in Yemen .
In between he was taken to another country , but does not know which .
What remained constant , he says was mistreatment which included beatings , cigarettes being stubbed out on his body , being hung upside down , the use of disorienting music and light , starvation , sleep deprivation and being kept naked , hooded and manacled .
Mr al - Maqtari was born in Tabuk , Saudi Arabia , but had lived most of his life in Hodeidah on the Red Sea coast of Yemen .
His reason for travelling to Iraq in early 2003 remains unclear as do the reasons for his stays in Mosul , Ramadi and Fallujah , cities which became centres of the Sunni insurgency .
Civil rights groups stress , however , that any involvement by Mr al - Maqtari in acts of violence against the Americans does not justify what he says was done to him .
Mr al - Maqtari was working part time in an internet centre in Fallujah when he was arrested in January 2004 , seven months after the US - led invasion , a time when insurgents were stepping up their attacks on American forces .
According to the US military , its operation " market sweep " led to the confiscation of rifles , machine guns , grenades and mortars .
Mr al - Maqtari vehemently denies any connection with this although he was repeatedly questioned about his supposed knowledge of terrorist weapons caches .
It was during the searches for hidden weapons that , Mr al - Maqtari claims , British troops became involved .
A unit of UK special forces working with the Americans took him from Abu Ghraib to a location in Baghdad , but no arms were found .
Ben Griffin , a former SAS man who was stationed in Baghdad in early 2005 , told Amnesty that British special forces would not have taken part in interrogations , but would have been aware of the methods likely to be employed in Abu Ghraib .
Mr al - Maqtari said one of the American interrogators used him as a footstool , trampled on his face and put a cigarette out on his shoulder while shouting , " I 'm from New York , the place you Arabs tried to destroy . "
The FBU says there are about 40 attacks every week on firefighters
Fire Brigades Union ( FBU ) general secretary Matt Wrack says it is not acceptable for firefighters to put up with verbal or physical abuse .
He is calling for a " government - led strategy " to tackle the problem of violence at work .
Zero tolerance
I will not tolerate firefighters coming under attack from thugs and vandals
Chief Fire Officer Phil Toase , West Yorkshire Fire Service
At present , every fire and rescue service has its own policy to minimise attacks on crews .
These include engaging with youth groups , dedicated training to deal with conflict , protection of crews using CCTV cameras , and practical measures including shatter - proof glass on fire appliances .
There is also new legislation covering England , Wales and Northern Ireland to protect emergency service workers from being obstructed .
It introduces a maximum £ 5,000 penalty for those who hinder emergency service personnel .
West Yorkshire Chief Fire Officer Phil Toase says : " I will not tolerate firefighters coming under attack from thugs and vandals and will take whatever steps I can to help the police bring these people to justice . "
But the FBU says attacks are so common , they often go unreported .
Its north west regional secretary , Kevin Brown , who has been a firefighter in Manchester for 31 years , says : " I'm a 6ft 5 in ex-rugby player and I 've been attacked many many times , firefighters feel vulnerable . "
The Greater Manchester Fire Service has fitted CCTV cameras to more than 60 of its front - line pumping appliances .
Greater Manchester : recording starts when an appliance is mobilised
There are four cameras , one on the front and rear , which can be moved from the cab , and two fixed side cameras that record on to a hard - drive as soon as the crews are mobilised .
" Ultimately this is the last line of protection , " says Station Commander Ian Holt , whose fire service has been using the cameras for two years .
He adds that funding for the project was provided through council grants .
' Silent witness '
In West Yorkshire , fire appliances have been fitted with cameras for more than 10 years , initially to deal with an isolated problem in one area of Leeds .
Their so - called " silent witness " cameras are now fitted to all front - line appliances .
CFO
Toase says :  We have taken this issue seriously for some years and have cameras on our fire engines , [ and ] shatterproof glass in our cabs " .
But the cameras are as not popular with the FBU .
" We 've seen very little evidence that cameras work for what they were intended - to identify and prosecute , " says Kevin Brown .
" We need to get to the bottom of why our members are being attacked . "
The union says that images are often not clear enough to ensure prosecution , and has reservations about how images could be used against its members , for example , if an appliance was involved in an accident .
Youth ' inclusion '
All fire and rescue services offer youth training - in Manchester there are two schemes .
It has a cadet scheme for 13 to 16 year - olds .
" We make it known through school visits that there are opportunities for pupils to join as cadets , " says Stn Cdr Holt .
There is also a scheme for young offenders , and those excluded from school - " to bring the fire service into young people 's lives " .
The FBU says such training should " incorporate initiatives to prevent / reduce the impact of violence at work " , and it suggests fire services encourage partnerships with other agencies .
This approach is also supported by the Chief Fire Officers ' Association - the collective voice for senior fire officer in the UK :
" The most productive way of reducing attacks on firefighters is to build relationships with the community .
" [ Fire services should ] engage with communities and agencies working with young people to reduce attacks on firefighters and anti-social behaviour in general . "
Greater Manchester Fire Service has also taken the lead with providing conflict training for its own crews .
In the past year , about 1,200 of the service 's 1,600 operational staff have been taking part in exercises with the police .
Crews are taught to read a situation early on , to try to engage in conversation , to diffuse potential conflict or simply walk away .
Fire appliances are often reversed into cul - de - sacs to allow for a quick withdrawal and to avoid ambush .
But the FBU says there is no nationally agreed protocol for requesting police assistance , and says that in some cases , the response came from community support officers with limited powers .
West Yorkshire Fire Service says it occasionally sends a second crew to assist firefighters under threat , but this could inevitably lead to areas being left with reduced fire - cover .
The FBU 's research suggests that firefighters were sometimes reluctant to withdraw from incidents as it is their moral duty to " save lives " .
Each party to the bargain compromises its professional standards .
Rather than hold police accountable , “ Dateline ” becomes their partners  and may well prod them to more invasive and outrageous actions than they had planned .
When Mr. Conradt did not show up at the “ sting house ”  the usual “ To Catch a Predator ” format  producers allegedly asked police as a “ favor ” to storm his home .
Ms. Conradt contends that the show encourages police “ to give a special intensity to any arrests , so as to enhance the camera effect . ”
The police make their own corrupt bargain , ceding law enforcement to TV producers .
Could Mr. Conradt have been taken alive if he had been arrested in more conventional fashion , without SWAT agents , cameras and television producers swarming his home ?
Judge Chin said a jury could plausibly find that it was the television circus , in which the police acted as the ringleader , that led to his suicide .
“ To Catch a Predator ” is part of an ever - growing lineup of shows that calculatingly appeal to their audience ’s worst instincts .
The common theme is indulging the audience ’s voyeuristic pleasure at someone else ’s humiliation , and the nastiness of the put - down has become the whole point of the shows .
Humiliation TV has been around for some time .
“ The Weakest Link ” updated the conventional quiz show by installing a viciously insulting host , and putting the focus on the contestants ’ decision about which of their competitors is the most worthless .
“ The Apprentice ” purported to be about young people getting a start in business , but the whole hour built up to a single moment : when Donald Trump barked “ You ’re fired . ”
But to hold viewers ’ interest , the levels of shame have inevitably kept growing .
A new Fox show , “ Moment of Truth , ” in a coveted time slot after “ American Idol , ” dispenses cash prizes for truthfully ( based on a lie- detector test ) answering intensely private questions .
Sample : “ Since you ’ve been married , have you ever had sexual relations with someone other than your husband ? ”
If the show is as true as it says it is , questions in two recent episodes seemed carefully designed to break up contestants ’ marriages .
Please be my friend !!!
I suppose its better than poking him .

As promised , I ’ve put together a PDF transcript
of the talk I did about the music industry .
( click to get the PDF ) .
I know it ’s not a video , but I ’m afraid this is the best I can offer right now .
I find that if you read it out loud and wave your arms a lot , you get the entire effect .
Have fun .
[ Cory asked for it in plain text .
Here you go ] :
On the future of the music business
… I keep writing books , and writing books about this industry and the industry has never invited me over , so thank you .
So , I ’m going to start by pointing out that for the period I ’m talking about , which is my entire youth , not ill - spent enough , but my entire youth , the record business was perfect .
It was a perfect industry .
And I want to tell you why .
Each one of these factors is important .
Number one :
An entire medium and entire section of the spectrum devoted to promoting the stuff you make … thats great right … for free !
An entire thing built around helping you sell more stuff .
Number two : An oligopoly .
For those who did n’t grab an MBA [ an oligopoly ] is where there is a small number of people competing against each other .
If you are a band hoping to break out in 1974 , 1984 , 1993 , you did n’t have a lot of choices , and since you did n’t have a lot of choices guess who had a lot of power , a few companies .
And , those companies could demand certain things that they needed from the world .
The third thing that made it perfect is it was a key part of out lives .
Look up senior prom on the internet and all you ’ll see are stupid pictures , ugly dresses , and people remembering the songs they were listening to .
It was the soundtrack for generation after generation .
The people in the shoe business do n’t have this advantage .
The people at almost every business are n’t featured on the prom pages , you guys are .
The next thing , entire chains of retailers devoted to selling your product .
In malls they ’re paying the rent , not you , Sure they ’re extracting shelf space allowances from you , but is n’t that really cool ?
Whole stores you do n’t even have to own , devoted to promoting what you sell .
Next thing , you have God on your side .
( slide of “ Clapton is god ” )
Where was the last time you saw a piece of graffiti that said Starbucks is God .
This is really good times .
The next thing , one of my favorites , this piece of technology is so cool , it is really cheap to make .
You can sell it for a fair amount of money .
You ca n’t copy it , you wear it out and then you need another one .
Its pretty , other people can see you own it , and they want one too .
And once I do n’t have it anymore and give it to you , I do n’t have it anymore .
This was a really cool thing , bad idea to get rid of this .
( audience clapping )
Alright , I ’m on a roll here .
The next thing , a magazine , not one magazine , several magazine devoted to promoting the product you sell .
Again , no magazines about coffee , plenty of magazines about music .
And , a whole cable TV channel about it .
Lets see if I understand this .
Everyone else has to buy TV commercials , you guys get your own channel …and you ’re allowed to put scantily clad women on it .
( laughter )
This is amazing .
I ’m almost done - almost done with all the good news .
It used to cost a wicked lot of money to make a record .
( laughter )
Thats good for you because that means the artists need you .
Because you ’re the ones who pay all the money it costs to make a record .
And the last amazing piece of news is this guy .
The voice of Scooby Doo ( slide of Casey Kasem ) .
Because , if you made it to the top 40 , you made it !
There is really something special about best seller lists .
Something magic happens when you make the best seller list .
What happens is people buy your stuff because other people are buying it .
Think about that .
You ’re popular because you ’re popular .
And it ’s an ever going cycle .
And that is underlying a lot of what is going on .
So !
We can look at this and say , “ this was good ” , and I ’ll grant you , it was good .
But that does n’t mean it ’s going to last forever .
Just because all of those things lined up to make this the greatest business in history , thats legal , does n’t mean that you should assume it ’s all gonna stay .
So , rather than me going through each one of those and bumming you out I ’m just going to pick a couple of them and remind you of how the dynamic changed .
Obviously , it ’s really hard to make money doing that .
Also , remember those guys who bought Beach Boys records ?
This is what they look like now .
( slide of aging couple ) ( laughter )
Now this is really important to understand because when the typical person is a teenager , they ’re spending a lot of time looking for more .
“ What ’s the new thing , what ’s the next thing , what ’s the new thing ? ”
But these guys do n’t want that .
They want to remember THEN , they do n’t go looking for the new thing .
And , it ’s not your fault they were baby boomers , it ’s not your fault the baby boomers are getting old .
It ’s just true .
The next thing we talked about , this technology was n’t as good as we hoped when we started .
And it ’s had a lot of side effects , the biggest one of course being it ’s digital .
And once you make it digital , all of a sudden the math changes .
Because , it used to be if I gave you my record , I did n’t have my record anymore .
And now , it ’s if I give you my record , I still have my record .
And that ’s different .
I ’m not saying it ’s better , I ’m not saying it ’s worse .
I ’m not saying it ’s moral , or immoral , I ’m just saying it ’s different and we got to accept that .
And , one of the side effects of that is that something has fundamentally shifted here .
Now , I ’m going to give you a little bit of a preview which is , I think the internet is the new radio .
And I think we ’re needing , in the record business , people in the record business are going to have to think about the fact that , that might be a really good thing , not a really bad thing .
And , we ’ll come back to that in a minute .
The next idea is this idea that American Top 40 , Casey , I do n’t even know if he is still alive but its does n’t matter so much anymore .
And the reason it does n’t matter is because of something called the long tail .
I do n’t know if you ’ve read this book , you should go out and read it right now , you can read it in 45 minutes .
And what Chris Anderson [ author of The Long Tail ] pointed out is this , if I look at Netflix , what I see is that Netflix rentals , half of them are products Blockbuster does n’t even carry .
If I look at Amazon sales , half of Amazon sales are products that are unavailable in any Barnes & Noble store .
If I look at the iTunes music store , half of iTunes sales are titles that you could not buy if you went into any record store .
What happens when you give people an infinite number of choices in any genre , polka , does n’t matter , they spread out .
And two things occur .
One , they go down the tail and start finding what ’s just right for them , and two , sales go up .
And so what this means is that the very structure of “ how do we force as much attention as we can to the top 40 ” is actually the opposite of what leads to more consumption .
And then the last one , you ’ve seen it before , is this idea of suing the very people you ’re trying to talk to is unfortunate .
So , what ’s next ?
And where do we go from here ?
I want to start by saying this really clearly .
Music is not in trouble .
I believe more people are listening to more music now than any time in the history of the world .
Probably five times more than twenty years ago … that much !
But , the music business is in trouble .
And the reason the music business is in trouble is because remember all those pieces of good news ?… every single one of them is not true anymore .
Every .
One .
Now , if you want to , you can curse the fact the Solomon ’s could n’t figure out how to keep the tower going .
You can curse the fact that it ’s really easy to copy a CD .
You can curse the fact that we do n’t care about the American top 40 .
You can curse the fact that there is n’t top 40 radio that matters .
What good is that going to do ?
Or , we could think about the fact that you have more momentum and more assets and more talented people than any body else .
[ And ] , at the very same time that people are listening to more music than ever before .
Thats really cool .
And , so when we think about transitions what we know is that timid trapeze artists are dead trapeze artists .
And , that the only way you get from here to there is to just do it .
Now , you might be wrong but the alternative is you WILL be wrong .
There is no way to go from the perfect music business to the new music business with guaranteed ROI and written assurances - it does n’t exist .
So what will happen , I will guarantee this to you , is that 90 % of the people in this industry will timidly start walking their way over and they will all fail .
Thats why when you go to look up something online , you do n’t go to RandomHouse.com , you go to Google.com .
Thats why when you go to buy something on auction online you do n’t do to Sothebys.com , you go to Ebay.com .
Go down the list , what happened was AOL lost their nerve and did n’t start AOL Book where you could meet friends .
They forgot .
They were too busy trying to get people to buy a CD and start joining a membership internet service because they were n’t willing to do this .
So it ’s a little quixotic on my part but I ’ve devoted my career to try and get people to do this .
So , I think there is a new business here that might even be more perfect than the last one .
It ’s not the same business , the waves are shaped differently , and you need different skills but someone is going to win big in this business .
So , what I want to do , and I ’m excited - I ’m talking too fast , we do n’t have a lot of time here and thats fine with me , is tell you some of the tactics that I would use if I were in your shoes .
But I do n’t think I ’m necessarily right .
And if Berry Gordy had called me on the phone in 1964 , I would have given him bad advice too .
But , I hope what you ’ll see in this is the thinking process about some of the realities of what really “ is ” in the world because you guys are much better than I am at turning those realities into an actual business .
So let me try .
The first one is that people do n’t listen to companies , they listen to people .
And what is unique , almost entirely , compared to the movie business , the book business , whatever , is that you sell people .
And , there is something magical about the connection between one person and another person .
There is something magical about the way we treat celebrities .
And so part of the thing that is out there is that there is a large number of people who want to be led .
There is a large number of people who want to connect .
There is a large number of people who want to join a tribe .
And you have the ability , from where you stand , to make some of those connections happen .
What ’s really neat is …my friend gets all excited because he needs to score some Bruce Springsteen tickets .
Is n’t that interesting , right , because he ’s using Greg to get to this tribe of people .
That ’s really valuable .
He does n’t need to have somebody get a copy of an album , he can just get that , you know , from Amazon for ten bucks , or for free .
But the tickets , the connection , the insider , the handshake to one handshake - thats worth a lot !
And so far you guys have been treating it like an interesting side effect .
But it might be something right at the core of what you do every day .
The next one is my biggest one , and what started me down this whole path which is , if I asked you for the name and address of your 50,000 best customers , could you give it to me ?
Do you have any clue ?
Then what happens every day is you guys go to a singles bar and you walk up to the first person you meet and propose marriage and if that person wo n’t marry you , you walk down the singles bar to every single person until someone says I do .
Thats a stupid way to get married .
A better way to get married is to go on a date .
If it goes well , go on another date .
Wait to tell them on the third before you tell them you ’re out on parole .
( laughter )
Then you meet their parents , they me your parents , you get engage , you get married .
Permission is the act of delivery .
Anticipated , personal , and relevant messages to people who want to get them .
I have every record Ricky Lee Jones has ever made including the boot legs that she sells .
Rick Lee Jones should know who I am ! ( laughter ) I have bought many of them ( pause ) well her agents , her people [ should know who I am ] .
I ’ve bought many of them directly from her site .
I desperately want Ricky Lee to drop me a note telling me when she is going to be in town .
I want her to ask me , “ should I do a duets album with Willie Nelson , or should I do one with Bruce Springsteen ? ” .
I want to have these interactions .
And I want her to say , “ I ’m making another bootleg , but not until I get 10,000 people to buy it as patrons before I make it ” .
Because I ’d sign up .
I ’d buy five if it would help , but she does n’t know who I am .
She does n’t know who I am , she never talks to me .
And then every once in a while her record label tries to yell at me , but I ’m not listening because they ’re yelling at me in a place where I ’m not paying attention .
And so we look at these phrases , “ paying attention ” .
That ’s what you ’ve wanted people to do all along .
“ Pay attention to this artist ” .
Paying is a weird word is n’t it ?
You want me to pay you something - my attention .
And if you ’re wrong , I get nothing back .
I had to listen to the Backstreet Boys … AHH !
I want those three minutes back .
So , it ’s a weird relationship .
The next thing is this idea that people care very much about who is sitting next to them at the concert .
They care very much about the secret handshake .
They care very much about the tribal identification .
“ Oh you like them , I like them ” .
The Grateful Dead is an amazingly successful paradigm for many of the things I ’m talking about .
They did n’t make any money selling records compared to the way they made money doing everything else .
Part of it was , you knew if you met someone at a dead concert , they had some things in common with you .
The secret handshake , the clothes , whatever it was .
And that was important and you were willing to pay money to be with those people .
And after Jerry died it was very interesting .
Because obviously there was thousands of hours to listen to but that ’s not what the people missed .
The people missed the place they could go to meet the people like them .
At Facebook , it ’s all about that .
64 million people who go there every day so they can meet people like them because [ Facebook ] is very good at dividing people up .
The next thing is what I call the Seinfeld curve .
The Seinfeld curve shows us Jerry ’s life .
If you like Jerry Seinfeld you can watch him on television , for free , in any city in the world two or three times a day .
Or , you could pay $ 200 to go see him in Vegas .
But there is no $ 4 option for Jerry Seinfeld .
This is death .
You ca n’t make any money in here .
Because if you ’re not scarce I ’m not going to pay for it because I can get if for free .
And one of the realities that the music industry is going to have to accept is this curve now exists for you .
That for everybody under eighteen years old , it ’s either free or it ’s something I really want and I ’m willing to pay for it .
There is nothing in the center - it ’s going away really fast .
The next one is back to this long tail model .
The magazine business imploded a long time ago .
Saturday Evening Post , Time Magazine , they ’re all irrelevant .
But you can make a fortune with Playstation magazines , PC gaming [ magazines ] , Game Informer , because there are silos of people who care a great deal .
And if you know who those people are , if you have permission to talk to them , ready for this , if you stop looking for listeners for your music , and start looking for music for your listeners instead , the economics of your business totally changes .
Magazines make 10 x return on equity of books , you know why ?
Because magazines have subscribers and books do n’t .
So every time a book comes out they gotta run around looking for someone to buy it .
Where as the magazine people just look for the next author to write the next article in the next magazine .
The next idea is this idea of liking .
There is a lot of music I like .
There is not so much music I love .
They did n’t call the show , “ I Like Lucy ” , they called it “ I Love Lucy ” .
And the reason is you only talk about stuff you love , you only spread stuff you love .
You find a band you really love , you ’re forcing the CD on other people , “ you gotta hear this ! ” .
We gotta stop making music people like .
There is an infinite amount of music people like .
No one will ever go out of the way to hear , to pay for , music they like .
And the last one is back to this tribal thing .
It ’s really important to people to feel like they are part of that tribe , to feel that adrenaline .
We are willing to pay money , we ’re willing to go through huge hoops , trampled to death in Cincinnati if necessary , in order to be in the environment where we feel that ’s going on .
So if I put all this together I ’m going to come up with what I call the Merchant Solution .
It has nothing to do with stores , it has to do with Natalie Merchant .
( laughter )
So , Natalie Merchant shows up in the New York Times last week saying not only do I not have a record label , I ’m not going to make records anymore because I just figure out how to do it .
And that is the biggest opportunity times 10,000 because Natalie does n’t want to be in business , Natalie wants to make records .
Thirty years ago Natalie could n’t put together the scratch to record an album because she could n’t afford a recording studio .
Thats what you guys did for her .
She could n’t come up with the time and energy to go out to California to sell and pay for shelf space at Tower , thats what you guys did for her .
The point is , now she needs somebody to say “ let us take care of your tribe ” .
Let us figure out the business model that says you get to do what you ’re great at , write songs , perform them , find people who love you , not like you , and they are A LOT in the case of Natalie Merchant , and we will figure out not how to exploit that , not how to write a contract that you ’re going to regret for the rest of your life , but to sit next to you and say guess what , there are all these people in the tribe [ and ] we need to figure out how to make stuff for them .
And , because we have three other artists that are just like you , Cowboy Junkies , we can start mixing tribes together in appropriate ways that makes everybody happy .
Because you [ record label ] could go to the Cowboy Junkies tribe and say Natalie Merchant is coming to town and they ’ll all go .
Because they love her and they love each other and they want to see each other again because they can’t wait a whole year till the [ Cowboy ] Junkies come back .
So if the model that we loved about the record business in 1968 was A&R , taking care of artists , finding artists who people will love , and the model that we hated was brand management , I want to argue that the next model is tribal management .
That the next model is to say , what you do for a living is manage a tribe … many tribes …silos of tribes .
That your job is to make the people in that tribe delighted to know each other and trust you to go find music for them .
And , in exchange , it could be way out on the long tail , no one wants to be on the long tail by themselves , the polka lovers like the polka lovers , they want to be together .
But that you , maybe it is only one person , technology makes this really easy , your job is to curate for that tribe , like the curators upstairs [ at the museum ] .
There is a museum of modern art tribe , you can see them here every Thursday .
And if you can curate for them guess what the [ musical ] artists need … you !
Guess what the tribe needs … you !
You add an enormous amount of value by becoming a new kind of middleman .
So let me go through , real quick , a bunch of tactics and we can come back to these after I ’m done if you want .
So , old world , new world .
Old world : it mattered who you knew .
You know Jan Wenner … thats a good thing .
Now it does n’t matter because there ’s an infinite number of outlets - you can have your own channel .
Number two : limited number of physical outlets , now there ’s an infinite number of online outlets .
An infinite number of places where I can find music .
Number three : an emphasis on hits because you did n’t have a lot of channels , you had to own the ones you had .
Now , it ’s about niches .
I write the number one marketing blog in the world .
Who cares .
Well not many people here care , but lucky for me that niche has a bunch of people in it who care .
And so I enjoy my day writing that blog , I could never write a blog that appealed to everybody .
I could n’t write a Boing Boing blog or a blog about popular culture , but because I get to be the king of this little silo I get benefits out of it .
Number [ four ] : you yelled at the consumer .
You talked directly to the user .
Now it ’s about two things .
One , consumers talking to each other and two , consumers talking to you .
How easy is it for a fan to talk to you ?
Almost impossible because you ’re not organized for that and because you did n’t see that there was a benefit .
But if you ’re in tribal management thats the number one best thing that could happen to you all day is that you get an email or a phone call .
Alright ?
Back to the barrier between the consumer and the permeability .
The next one : your whole life was about interrupting people with messages they did n’t want to get .
Fortunately radio made that socially acceptable .
Unfortunately the government made it against the law for you to pay for that to occur but you still managed to pull it off .
I could get in the car , turn on the radio and hear a song I was n’t expecting and maybe I would like it .
If I did n’t like it , it did n’t cost you anything anyway .
Now it ’s about permission .
Now I get on the radio and in my car I have either my mp3s in there or I have satellite in there , I do n’t hear anything i do n’t want to hear .
So , the model has totally changed .
Next one : you used to have a factory .
The factory is the recording studio , you know , the ability to get the number of things on the shelf space at Tower .
You built everything around that factory .
There ’s no factory anymore !
If you guys put up one ad on Craigslist you ’d have records here tomorrow , done , finished , by email .
Because everyone has the ability to make a record now .
It used to take a long time .
Someone would go to the studio , Boston , and we ’d hear from them three or four years later .
Now you can put a State of the Union speech out as a hip - hop record one day after he gives his speech and you could sell a bunch on iTunes .
It used to be “ how big a share of the market can we have ? ”
Now it ’s about “ how do we touch a tribe , just for a minute ? ”
As long as the tribe is happy , we ’re happy .
It used to be about what features , checklist stuff , now it ’s “ is there a story behind this artist , is there a story behind the person ? ” .
Advertising , promotion , shelf space , that used to be what you paid cash money for .
Now you ’re going to have to figure out how to innovate in the way you interact with people .
And I think this is my last one : stability used to be “ we ’re big , you can trust us . ” .
Now small overhead , we own the polka silo , we only need one person to take care of it , gives you the ability to have low risk when taking care of the long tail .
Customer support is n’t as important as consumer support .
How do you get people to help each other ?
So , if I had to show you one slide again , it would be this one .
It would be , “ I really want to hear from you ” .
Ricky Lee. Please !
write to me , I want to be part of the tribe , I want you to talk .
It ’s not about , anymore , how many people can you reach .
Super Bowl , does n’t matter .
it ’s irrelevant .
The internet is the new radio .
What that means is this you ’ve been arguing and hassling and yelling and pushing for 40 years to get more air time .
Now you have infinite air time .
That ’s what the internet is for you .
The internet is the ability to get any song you want in front of the people who want to hear it with huge reach and no barriers .
What matters is n’t how many , it ’s who .
Who are you reaching , who are the thought leaders , who are the people who are going to tell other people ?
Who are the people who are out there trying to find the next big thing because those people are going to influence what the next trend is , and if you ’re in the middle of that trend , because you ’ve used this new medium to spread the ideas , you ’re going to start paying for internet airtime soon because it ’s worth it .
It ’s not that you need to say “ no , no , no , I ca n’t let you hear this ” it ’s “ I want you to hear this ” .
Because if you hear it you might join the tribe , and if you join the tribe then over time I ’ll take care of you so well you ’ll want to pay me .
And then people will be passionate when they hear what you do for a living , they ’re going to die to have you help them meet other people in the tribe .
Bush presses campaign for open - ended war in Iraq
By Patrick Martin
4 September 2007
Bush ’s Labor Day visit to Iraq marks the beginning of a month - long White House drive to win congressional authorization and funding to continue the war in Iraq for the duration of Bush ’s term in office , which ends January 2009 , and beyond .
It came only two days after administration officials revealed they would request an additional $ 50 billion in funding for the war , on top of the $ 100 billion appropriated by the Democratic - controlled Congress in May .
The six - hour visit — a stopover on Bush ’s trip to Australia for an economic summit of the Asia - Pacific region — was a publicity stunt aimed at presenting an image of progress in the US military occupation and generating favorable coverage in the servile US commercial media .
It comes at the start of a month of reports , hearings and congressional votes on war appropriations .
To press its claims of “ success ” in the military surge begun last February , the White House brought Bush to Al Asad Air Base in Anbar Province , the western region of Iraq which was the scene of the bloodiest clashes with Iraqi insurgents during the first four years of the US occupation .
As the result of agreements reached with Sunni tribal leaders since last fall — greased by substantial bribes in the form of cash and weapons — the US military has declared the occupation in Anbar Province to be on much firmer ground .
US officials claim that the Sunni sheiks , who once supported the insurgency against the US occupation regime , have switched sides , and they cite instances of open warfare between tribal factions and fighters still opposed to the occupation , including those loyal to Al Qaeda in Iraq .
The White House pointed to Bush ’s ability to visit Anbar — his first trip to any location in Iraq outside Baghdad — as proof of positive military and political trends in the province .
But Bush kept far away from ordinary Iraqis in Fallujah or Ramadi .
He traveled in complete secrecy to a huge US base , 17 miles in circumference , manned by 10,000 troops , located in relative isolation from Iraqi population centers , near the point where the Euphrates River crosses the Syria - Iraq border .
Al Asad is one of the four huge bases — more like transplanted American cities — which the Pentagon has built as garrison points for the indefinite stationing of American troops and warplanes .
These four bases would play a critical role in any future US war in the region , particularly against Iran or Syria .
Bush was accompanied by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Peter Pace , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley , and the newly appointed White House Iraq coordinator , Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute .
They conferred at the base with the US military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
While press accounts claimed that the purpose of these consultations was to discuss the testimony Petraeus and Crocker are giving to Congress September 10 and 11 , it is far more likely that the meeting , bringing all the top US decision - makers except Vice President Cheney , had a more sinister purpose — to review US military options against Iran , and the likely consequences within Iraq of a major US air assault on Iran .
Bush made two speeches threatening Iran last month , and there have been numerous reports of stepped - up US military planning for a massive air offensive against alleged Iranian nuclear facilities and training centers run by Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards .
The Times of London reported Sunday , “ The Pentagon has drawn up plans for massive air strikes against 1,200 targets in Iran , designed to annihilate the Iranians ’ military capability in three days , according to a national security expert . ”
The account cited discussions at a meeting organized by theNational Interest , a right - wing foreign policy journal .
One participant , Alexis Debat , director of terrorism and national security studies at the Nixon Center , told the Times that US military planners were not preparing for “ pinprick strikes ” against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
“ They ’re about taking out the entire Iranian military , ” he said .
While giving lip service to withdrawal as a goal , in a brief address to 700 troops stationed at the base , Bush declared that any US pullout from Iraq would be “ from a position of strength and success , not from a position of fear and failure . ”
The actual time frame of the US occupation is in years , if not decades .
According to a congresswoman who visited Iraq last week , General Petraeus said , in the course of his briefing to the delegation , that the US “ will be in Iraq in some way for nine to ten years . ”
Bush also ate a meal with the troops and made remarks to the media hailing the conditions in Anbar province .
“ The level of violence is down , local governments are meeting again , police are in control of the city streets and normal life is returning , ” he said , although this account bears no resemblance to the reality of life for ordinary Iraqis in Anbar or any other region of the country .
Just hours before the president ’s arrival , relief agencies reported an outbreak of cholera , the largest in 30 years , in the Kurdish - populated northern region which has long been touted as the “ success story ” of Iraq .
This is one expression of the destruction of Iraq ’s social infrastructure as the result of 17 years of war , sanctions , a second war and occupation .
Those Iraqis who did meet with Bush during his brief stay included Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki — who was as heavily guarded as Bush , given the widespread hostility among Sunnis to the Shiite - dominated regime in Baghdad — and a group of Sunni sheiks .
Only hours before the visit , the administration approved another huge bribe to the Sunni local leaders , over the objections of Maliki , who wants all US aid routed through Baghdad .
Both the agreement and the visit thus carried an implicit warning to Maliki , who has rebuffed US pressure for concessions to the Sunnis and greater distance from Iran , declaring that he could find other friends than the United States in the region .
Washington was telling the Iraqi prime minister that it too can find “ other friends , ” like the Sunni sheiks , and arm and finance them as a counterweight to the government in Baghdad .
Besides reviewing military options and bringing additional pressure on Maliki , a major purpose of the visit was to continue the administration ’s campaign of intimidation and fear - mongering against antiwar sentiment at home .
The White House has taken the measure of the congressional Democrats , who appealed to antiwar sentiment in the 2006 elections but have refused to take any action to force an end to the war , fundamentally because they support the goal of US imperialist domination of the Middle East .
The Democratic leaders in the House and Senate had claimed that they would push aggressively for an end to the war in Iraq when Congress ended its August recess and resumed work on the defense appropriations bills and on yet another emergency funding request for war .
But instead , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled last week that the Democrats ’ token opposition to the war would become even more toothless and two - faced when Congress resumes on September 4 .
The Washington Post reported , in a front - page story in its Friday edition , that Reid “ said he is now willing to compromise with Republicans to find ways to limit troop deployments in Iraq . ”
Reid blocked action on previous amendments to the defense budget bill that stopped short of setting a deadline for the withdrawal of US combat troops .
Reid is now saying he is prepared to take action on measures that would require an initial withdrawal of troops without specifying an end - date .
“ I do n’t think we have to think that our way is the only way , ” he told the Post .
Other measures could include legislation to require troops to have more time at home between deployments , as well as to adopt the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group as official US policy .
The Iraq Study Group opposed any set timeline for a US pullout from Iraq .
Two other leading Senate Democrats made similar comments to Congressional Quarterly magazine .
Carl Levin , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said he would seek a vote on a measure he introduced in the spring , calling for withdrawal of some troops within 120 days , but removing a deadline of April 30 , 2008 for pulling out all combat troops .
“ If we can pick up some more Republican support , it ’s certainly worthy of consideration , ” Levin said .
Ken Salazar , a Democrat from Colorado , said he would seek a vote on his resolution to adopt the Iraq Study Group proposals , but adding a provision that some US troops be pulled out of Iraq before the end of this year .
All of these measures would permit the stationing of US troops in Iraq indefinitely and in large numbers , as long as their function was not defined as “ combat ” — i.e. , for “ training ” Iraqi forces or to protect installations such as US military bases and Iraq ’s huge oilfields .
The entire process that will unfold this month in hearings and congressional debates and votes is an exercise in mass deception , aimed at convincing the American people that the Democrats are trying their hardest to end the war , but unable to overcome the resistance of the Bush administration and the legislative obstacles ( filibusters , etc. ) put in place by the congressional Republicans .
The truth is far different .
The Democratic - controlled Congress has had the power , since it took office in January , to end the war by cutting off funding .
But at every critical point , the Democratic leadership has bowed to the White House and approved the tens of billions required to continue the bloodbath .
The Democrats play a two - faced role : appealing to antiwar sentiment , in order to preserve the fiction that the official two - party system will respond to mass pressure , while ensuring that the war goes on to defend the interests of American imperialism .
MCALLEN , Texas ( Reuters ) - If Sen. Hillary Clinton fears she may be on the brink of losing her bid to become the first woman U.S. president , she is determined not to show it .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign event in McAllen , Texas February 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
The former first lady , once the red - hot favorite , has suffered a series of big losses to her rival for the Democratic Party nomination , Sen. Barack Obama , that have rattled supporters and helped prompt a shake - up in her staff .
But though tired and battling a cough picked up during weeks of endless campaigning days , Clinton is showing much of the stoicism she displayed during her sometimes troubled years in the White House as wife to President Bill Clinton .
The New York senator has plowed ahead with a relentlessly upbeat message about the state of her campaign , brushing off the predictions of pollsters who say it is in serious trouble .
“ I ’ve heard it before .
I heard it before New Hampshire and before Super Tuesday , ” Clinton told an ABC television affiliate on Tuesday .
“ This is a close race .
I ’m very optimistic , ” she said .
She was speaking several hours before Obama ’s big win in three contests in the Washington D.C. area on Tuesday as he appeared to gain momentum in the close state - by - state race to represent the party in the November election .
There have been some signs that her supporters are indeed nervous and indications of some confusion in a campaign machine that had looked almost invincible last year .
Some staffers have quietly acknowledged disappointment in recent results while also pressing the message that upcoming contests in Texas and Ohio will give Clinton the opportunity to rebound .
In an incident that puzzled her entourage of traveling reporters , the campaign on Tuesday called together the press for an undisclosed midday event in the Washington area , then abruptly canceled it .

Clinton has also struggled to keep pace with the millions Obama has been raising in contributions to fund an advertising blitz and this month loaned her campaign $ 5 million of her own money .
CLINTON : DON’T COUNT ME OUT
When asked if she was worried that Obama may be becoming unstoppable , Clinton cited her surprise win in the January 8 New Hampshire contest as showing that polls and pundits were often wrong and it would be a mistake to count her out .
In trying to make the case that she is the stronger Democratic candidate to vie against the likely Republican candidate , Vietnam war hero Sen .
John McCain , in November , Clinton often refers to herself as battle - scarred and tested .
The period in which her stoicism and determination was most on display was in the scandal the erupted over her husband ’s affair with a young White House aide , Monica Lewinsky .
Republicans pressed for the president ’s impeachment .
The then - first lady eschewed the part of the wounded wife and instead went into full battle mode to fight the impeachment charges .
She was seen as a key force in helping revive her husband ’s political fortunes .
Before Tuesday ’s voting was over , Clinton was in Texas , whose primary on March 4 is considered a must - win for her .
The state has a large Latino population which the campaign believes may offer an important base of support .
At a rally of 12,000 people in El Paso Clinton used what was left of her hoarse voice to shout that she was excited to kick off the Texas campaign .
“ I ’m tested , I ’m ready , let ’s make it happen , ” she said .
But as she spoke , news had just broken that her deputy campaign manager Mike Henry , was departing .
On Sunday Clinton had announced she was replacing her campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle with another longtime aide .
Clinton aides played down the move as a change in the “ day - to - operations ” and not an overhaul of the campaign .
In El Paso , Clinton did not publicly acknowledge Obama ’s victory but the next day , she spoke about it with reporters .
But in McAllen , on the southern tip of Texas , on Wednesday Clinton -- wearing a yellow blazer that reflected the sunny demeanor she was trying to project -- said the heavy losses in the Washington area had been expected .
Clinton also offered congratulations to her opponent .
“ It ’s been challenging , it ’s been intense , ” she said , while adding , “ We go on .
We are ready for the contests that are upcoming . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In a fresh sign that the nation 's housing crisis will worsen , home prices are likely to decline in 2008 for the second straight year , the National Association of Realtors said Thursday .
The Realtors , in its monthly economic and sales outlook , is forecasting a 1.2 % drop in prices of existing homes sold this year .
Only a month ago , the association was forecasting that prices would be flat in 2008 and that the home market would rebound in the last half of the year .
The group was forecasting that the first quarter would see a record 5.3 % drop from year ago levels .
Now it 's expecting the current quarter to see even a larger decline in prices of 6.1 % .
Last year , when the median price slipped 1.4 from 2006 levels , was the first on record that the Realtors recorded full - year decline in existing home prices .
The group is also forecasting a 4.8 % decline in the number of existing homes sold this year .
A month ago it was still forecasting a 0.9 % pickup in the sales .
Existing home sales plunged 12.8 % in 2007 , according to the group 's figures .
" We 're seeing a pattern that is consistent with skimming along the bottom of the cycle , and sales could ease modestly , " said Lawrence Yun , the group 's chief economist , in a statement .
The Realtors forecast further decline in sales and prices even though it projects the overall U.S. economy will stay out of recession .
It expects gross domestic product , the broad measure of the nation 's economic activity , to show 1.2 % growth in the first quarter and 2.2 % growth in the second quarter .
But a growing number of economists are forecasting that the economy has already entered into a recession and is like to see GDP in negative territory for at least the first half of the year .
In the year ahead , the Realtor 's see even greater weakness in new home sales - a 4.3 % drop in median prices and a 17.7 % plunge in the number of sales .
The Realtors have been recently lowering their price and sales forecasts with each monthly update .
The group still has a more bullish view of the market than other outside forecasts .
For example , investment firm Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) is forecasting a 15 % drop in home values this year , and an additional 10 % decline in 2009 .
The Realtors are forecasting a 3.2 % rebound in prices next year in this latest reading .
Christian Menegatti , lead analyst for online economic research firm RGE Monitor , is forecasting a much sharper drop in home prices in 2008 and beyond , probably double digit .
" What we 've seen so far are still mild declines , " Menegatti said .
" I think we 'll see much sharper declines through this year and the next .
I do n't think we are even close to a bottom yet . "
Pending home sales fall again
Menegatti points to the Realtors ' Pending Home Sales Index for December , which was also released Thursday .
That index showed that the number of homes under contract fell once again to the second - lowest level on record - indicating growing weakness on the demand side , which Menegatti said will keep the inventories of homes for sale at record levels .
" Our inventories are still very very high and they need to be worked off before we get to bottom , " he said .
The Pending Home Sales Index fell 1.5 % to 85.9 .
That was better than only the record low of 85.5 set in August , when the meltdown in the mortgage finance market made it difficult for many buyers to arrange financing .
While the index posted a modest rebound in September and October , it has fallen each month since then .
The four weakest readings on record have come in the last five months of 2007 .
Before that downturn , the previous record low had been 89.8 reached in September 2001 , the period in which the terrorist attack shook buyer confidence .
The pending home sales index is more forward looking than the group 's more widely followed reading on existing home sales , which tracks closings .
A home is generally under contract for a month or two before closing .
The Pending Home Sales Index is only seven years old , and a 100 reading represents the level of homes under contract in 2001 , the first year of the index .
The December report brought the index ' annual reading in at 96.3 , the first time the annual number has fallen under 100 .
Flatland
A romance of many dimensions With Illustrations by the Author , A SQUARE
( Edwin A. Abbott 1838 - 1926 ) To
The Inhabitants of SPACE IN GENERAL
And H. C. IN PARTICULAR
This Work is Dedicated
By a Humble Native of Flatland
In the Hope that
Even as he was Initiated into the Mysteries
Of THREE Dimensions
Having been previously conversant
With ONLY TWO
So the Citizens of that Celestial Region
May aspire yet higher and higher
To the Secrets of FOUR FIVE OR EVEN SIX Dimensions
Thereby contributing
To the Enlargement of THE IMAGINATION
And the possible Development
Of that most rare and excellent Gift of MODESTY
Among the Superior Races
Of SOLID HUMANITY
PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION , 1884 .
BY THE EDITOR
The first objection is , that a Flatlander , seeing a Line , sees something that must be thick to the eye as well as long to the eye ( otherwise it would not be visible , if it had not some thickness ) ; and consequently he ought ( it is argued ) to acknowledge that his countrymen are not only long and broad , but also ( though doubtless in a very slight degree ) thick or high .
His objection is plausible , and , to Spacelanders , almost irresistible , so that , I confess , when I first heard it , I knew not what to reply .
But my poor old friend 's answer appears to me completely to meet it .
" I admit , " said he - when I mentioned to him this objection - " I admit the truth of your critic 's facts , but I deny his conclusions .
It is true that we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension called `height , ' just as it is also true that you have really in Spaceland a Fourth unrecognized Dimension , called by no name at present , but which I will call `extra- height ' .
But we can no more take cognizance of our `height ' then you can of your `extra - height ' .
Even I - who have been in Spaceland , and have had the privilege of understanding for twenty - four hours the meaning of `height ' - even I cannot now comprehend it , nor realize it by the sense of sight or by any process of reason ; I can but apprehend it by faith .
" The reason is obvious .
Dimension implies direction , implies measurement , implies the more and the less .
Now , all our lines are equally and infinitesimally thick ( or high , whichever you like ) ; consequently , there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the conception of that Dimension .
No `delicate micrometer ' - as has been suggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic - would in the least avail us ; for we should not know what to measure , nor in what direction .
When we see a Line , we see something that is long and bright ; brightness , as well as length , is necessary to the existence of a Line ; if the brightness vanishes , the Line is extinguished .
Hence , all my Flatland friends - when I talk to them about the unrecognized Dimension which is somehow visible in a Line - say , ` Ah , you mean brightness ' : and when I reply , ` No , I mean a real Dimension , ' they at once retort ` Then measure it , or tell us in what direction it extends ' ; and this silences me , for I can do neither .
Only yesterday , when the Chief Circle ( in other words our High Priest ) came to inspect the State Prison and paid me his seventh annual visit , and when for the seventh time he put me the question , ` Was I any better ? '
I tried to prove to him that he was `high , ' as well as long and broad , although he did not know it .
But what was his reply ?
` You say I am " high " ; measure my " highness " and I will believe you . '
What could I do ?
How could I meet his challenge ?
I was crushed ; and he left the room triumphant .
" Does this still seem strange to you ?
Then put yourself in a similar position .
Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension , condescending to visit you , were to say , ` Whenever you open your eyes , you see a Plane ( which is of Two Dimensions ) and you infer a Solid ( which is of Three ) ; but in reality you also see ( though you do not recognize ) a Fourth Dimension , which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of the kind , but a true Dimension , although I cannot point out to you its direction , nor can you possibly measure it . '
What would you say to such a visitor ?
Would not you have him locked up ?
Well , that is my fate : and it is as natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching the Third Dimension , as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube for preaching the Fourth .
Alas , how strong a family likeness runs through blind and persecuting humanity in all Dimensions !
Points , Lines , Squares , Cubes , Extra- Cubes - we are all liable to the same errors , all alike the Slaves of our respective Dimensional prejudices , as one of your Spaceland poets has said -
` One touch of Nature makes all worlds akin ' . "
1
On this , point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable .
I wish I could say that his answer to the second ( or moral ) objection was equally clear and cogent .
lt has been objected that he is a woman - hater ; and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those whom Nature 's decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the Spaceland race , I should like to remove it , so far as I can honestly do so .
But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral terminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I were literally to transcribe his defence against this charge .
Acting , therefore , as his interpreter and summarizer , I gather that in the course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modified his own personal views , both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles or Lower Classes .
Personally , he now inclines to the opinion of the Sphere that the Straight Lines are in many important respects superior to the Circles .
But , writing as a Historian , he has identified himself ( perhaps too closely ) with the views generally adopted by Flatland , and ( as he has been informed ) even Spaceland , Historians ; in whose pages ( until very recent times ) the destinies of Women and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of mention and never of careful consideration .
In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular or aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally credited him .
While doing justice to the intellectual power with which a few Circles for many generations maintained their supremacy over immense multitudes of their countrymen , he believes that the facts of Flatland , speaking for themselves without comment
On his part , declare that Revolutions cannot always be suppressed by slaughter ; and that Nature , in sentencing the Circles to infecundity , has condemned them to ultimate failure - " and herein , " he says , " I see a fulfillment of the great Law of all worlds , that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is working one thing , the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another , and quite a different and far better thing . "
For the rest , he begs his readers not to suppose that every minute detail in the daily life of Flatland must needs correspond to some other detail in Spaceland ; and yet he hopes that , taken as a whole , his work may prove suggestive as well as amusing , to those Spacelanders of moderate and modest minds who - speaking of that which is of the highest importance , but lies beyond experience - decline to say on the one hand , " This can never be , " and on the other hand , " It must needs be precisely thus , and we know all about it . "

1 . Of the Nature of Flatland
Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines , Triangles , Squares , Pentagons , Hexagons , and other figures , instead of remaining fixed in their places , move freely about , on or in the surface , but without the power of rising above or sinking below it , very much like shadows - only hard and with luminous edges - and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen .
Alas , a few years ago , I should have said " my universe " : but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things .
In such a country , you will perceive at once that it is impossible that there should be anything of what you call a " solid " kind ; but I dare say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles , Squares , and other figures , moving about as I have described them .
On the contrary , we could see nothing of the kind , not at least so as to distinguish one figure from another .
Nothing was visible , nor could be visible , to us , except Straight Lines ; and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate .
Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space ; and leaning over it , look down upon it .
It will appear a circle .
But now , drawing back to the edge of the table , gradually lower your eye ( thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the inhabitants of Flatland ) , and you will find the penny becoming more and more oval to your view ; and at last when you have placed your eye exactly on the edge of the table ( so that you are , as it were , actually a Flatlander ) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all , and will have become , so far as you can see , a straight line .
The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a Triangle , or Square , or any other figure cut out of pasteboard .
As soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge on the table , you will find that it ceases to appear to you a figure , and that it becomes in appearance a straight line .
Take for example an equilateral Triangle - who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class .
Fig. 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were bending over him from above ; figs .
2 and 3 represent the Tradesman , as you would see him if your eye were close to the level , or all but on the level of the table ; and if your eye were quite on the level of the table ( and that is how we see him in Flatland ) you would see nothing but a straight line .
When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant island or coast lying on the horizon .
The far - off land may have bays , forelands , angles in and out to any number and extent ; yet at a distance you see none of these ( unless indeed your sun shines bright upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light and shade ) , nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water .
Well , that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other acquaintances comes toward us in Flatland .
As there is neither sun with us , nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows , we have none of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland .
If our friend comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger ; if he leaves us it becomes smaller : but still he looks like a straight line ; be he a Triangle , Square , Pentagon , Hexagon , Circle , what you will - a straight Line he looks and nothing else .
You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantageous circumstances we are able to distinguish our friends from one another : but the answer to this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland .
For the present let me defer this subject , and say a word or two about the climate and houses in our country .
2 . Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland
There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies , it is impossible for us to determine the North in the usual way ; but we have a method of our own .
By a Law of Nature with us , there is a constant attraction to the South ; and , although in temperate climates this is very slight - so that even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs northward without much difficulty - yet the hampering effect of the southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most parts of our earth .
Moreover , the rain ( which falls at stated intervals ) coming always from the North , is an additional assistance ; and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses , which of course have their side - walls running for The most part North and South , so that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North .
In the country , where there are no houses , the trunks of the trees serve as some sort of guide .
Altogether , we have not so much difficulty as might be expected in determining our bearings .
Yet in our more temperate regions , in which the southward attraction is hardly felt , walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where there have been no houses nor trees to guide me , I have been occasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together , waiting till the rain came before continuing my journey .
On the weak and aged , and especially on delicate Females , the force of attraction tells much more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex , so that it is a point of breeding , if you meet a Lady in the street , always to give her the North side of the way - by no means an easy thing to do always at short notice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is difficult to tell your North from your South .
Windows there are none in our houses : for the light comes to us alike in our homes and out of them , by day and by night , equally at all times and in all places , whence we know not .
It was in old days , with our learned men , an interesting and oft - investigated question , " What is the origin of light ? " and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted , with no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the would - be solvers .
Hence , after fruitless attempts to suppress such investigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax , the Legislature , in comparatively recent times , absolutely prohibited them .
I - alas ; I alone in Flatland - know now only too well the true solution of this mysterious problem ; but my knowledge cannot be made intelligible to a single one of my countrymen ; and I am mocked at - I , the sole possessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the introduction of Light from the world of three Dimensions - as if I were the maddest of the mad !
But a truce to these painful digressions : let me return to our houses .
The most common form for the construction of a house is five - sided or pentagonal , as in the annexed figure .
The two Northern sides RO , OF , constitute the roof , and for the most part have no doors ; on the East is a small door for the Women ; on the West a much larger one for the Men ; the South side or floor is usually doorless .
Square and triangular houses are not allowed , and for this reason .
The angles of a Square ( and still more those of an equilateral Triangle , ) being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon , and the lines of inanimate objects ( such as houses ) being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women , it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or perhaps absent - minded traveller suddenly therefore , running against them : and as early as the eleventh century of our era , triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law , the only exceptions being fortifications , powder - magazines , barracks , and other state buildings , which it is not desirable that the general public should approach without circumspection .
At this period , square houses were still everywhere permitted , though discouraged by a special tax .
But , about three centuries afterwards , the Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten thousand , the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house - angle that could be allowed consistently with the public safety .
The good sense of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature ; and now , even in the country , the pentagonal construction has superseded every other .
It is only now and then in some very remote and backward agricultural district that an antiquarian may still discover a square house .
3. Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland
Our Women are Straight Lines .
Our Soldiers and Lowest Classes of Workmen are Triangles with two equal sides , each about eleven inches long , and a base or third side so short ( often not exceeding half an inch ) that they form at their vertices a very sharp and formidable angle .
Indeed when their bases are of the most degraded type ( not more than the eighth part of an inch in size ) .
they can hardly be distinguished from Straight Lines or Women ; so extremely pointed are their vertices .
With us , as with you , these Triangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles ; and by this name I shall refer to them in the following pages .
Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal - Sided Triangles .
Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares ( to which class I myself belong ) and Five - Sided Figures or Pentagons .
Next above these come the Nobility , of whom there are several degrees , beginning at Six - Sided Figures , or Hexagons , and from thence rising in the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of Polygonal , or many - sided .
Finally when the number of the sides becomes so numerous , and the sides themselves so small , that the figure cannot be distinguished from a circle , he is included in the Circular or Priestly order ; and this is the highest class of all .
It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more side than his , father , so that each generation shall rise ( as a rule ) one step in the scale of development and nobility .
Thus the son of a Square is a Pentagon ; the son of a Pentagon , a Hexagon ; and so on .
But this rule applies not always to the Tradesmen , and still less often to the Soldiers , and to the Workmen ; who indeed can hardly be said to deserve the name of human Figures , since they have not all their sides equal .
With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold ; and the son of an Isosceles ( i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal ) remains Isosceles still .
Nevertheless , all hope is not shut out , even from the Isosceles , that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded condition .
For , after a long series of military successes , or diligent and skilful labours , it is generally found that the more intelligent among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of their third side or base , and a shrinkage of the two other sides .
Intermarriages ( arranged by the Priests ) between the sons and daughters of these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally result in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the Equal - Sided Triangle .
Rarely - in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births - is a genuine and certifiable Equal - Sided Triangle produced from Isosceles parents .
2
Such a birth requires , as its antecedents , not only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages , but also a long , continued exercise of frugality and self - control on the part of the would - be ancestors of the coming Equilateral , and a patient , systematic , and continuous development of the Isosceles intellect through many generations .
The birth of , a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs around .
After a strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board , the infant , if certified as Regular , is with solemn ceremonial admitted into the class of Equilaterals .
He is then immediately taken from his proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral , who is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his former home or so much as to look upon his relations again , for fear lest the freshly developed organism may , by force of unconscious imitation , fall back again into his hereditary level .
The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his serf - born ancestors is welcomed , not only by the poor serfs themselves , as a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their existence , but also by the Aristocracy at large ; for all the higher classes are well aware that these rare phenomena , while they do little or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges , serve as a most useful barrier against revolution from below .
Had the acute - angled rabble been all , without exception , absolutely destitute of hope and of ambition , they might have found leaders in some of their many seditious outbreaks , so able as to render their superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the Circles .
But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that , in proportion as the working - classes increase in intelligence , knowledge , and all virtue , in that same proportion their acute angle ( which makes them physically terrible ) shall increase also and approximate to the comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle .
Thus , in the most brutal and formidable of the soldier class - creatures almost on a level with women in their lack of intelligence - it is found that , as they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous penetrating power to advantage , so do they wane in the power of penetration itself .
How admirable is this Law of Compensation !
And how perfect a proof of the natural fitness and , I may almost say , the divine origin of the aristocratic constitution of the States in Flatland !
By a judicious use of this Law of Nature , the Polygons and Circles are almost always able to stifle sedition in its very cradle , taking advantage of the irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind .
Art also comes to the aid of Law and Order .
It is generally found possible - by a little artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State physicians - to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion perfectly Regular , and to admit them at once into the privileged classes ; a much larger number , who are still below the standard , allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled , are induced to enter the State Hospitals , where they are kept in honourable confinement for life ; one or two alone of the more obstinate , foolish , and hopelessly irregular are led to execution .
Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles , planless and leaderless , are either transfixed without resistance by the small body of their brethren whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this kind ; or else more often , by means of jealousies and suspicions skilfully fomented among them by the Circular party , they are stirred to mutual warfare , and perish by one another 's angles .
No less than one hundred and twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals , besides minor outbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty - five ; and they have all ended thus .
4. Concerning the Women .
But here , perhaps , some of my younger Readers may ask how a woman in Flatland can make herself invisible .
This ought , I think , to be apparent without any explanation .
However , a few words will make it clear to the most unreflecting .
Place a needle on a table .
Then , with your eye on the level of the table , look at it side - ways , and you see the whole length of it ; but look at it end - ways , and you see nothing but a point , it has become practically invisible .
Just so is it with one of our Women .
When her side is turned towards us , we see her as a straight line ; when the end containing her eye or mouth - for with us these two organs are identical - is the part that meets our eye , then we see nothing but a highly lustrous point ; but when the back is presented to our view , then - being only sub-lustrous , and , indeed , almost as dim as an inanimate object - her hinder extremity serves her as a kind of Invisible Cap .
The dangers to which we are exposed from our Women must now be manifest to the meanest capacity in Spaceland .
If even the angle of a respectable Triangle in the middle class is not without its dangers ; if to run against a Working Man involves a gash ; if collision with an officer of the military class necessitates a serious wound ; if a mere touch from the vertex of a Private Soldier brings with it danger of death ; - what can it be to run against a Woman , except absolute and immediate destruction ?
And when a Woman is invisible , or visible only as a dim sub- lustrous point , how difficult must it be , even for the most cautious , always to avoid collision !
Many are the enactments made at different times in the different States of Flatland , in order to minimize this peril ; and in the Southern and less temperate climates where the force of gravitation is greater , and human beings more liable to casual and involuntary motions , the Laws concerning Women are naturally much more stringent .
But a general view of the Code may be obtained from the following summary : -
Every house shall have one entrance in the Eastern side , for the use of Females only ; by which all females shall enter " in a becoming and respectful manner " 3 and not by the Men 's or Western door .
No Female shall walk in any public place without continually keeping up her Peace - cry , under penalty of death .
Any Female , duly certified to be suffering from St. Vitus 's Dance , fits , chronic cold accompanied by violent sneezing , or any disease necessitating involuntary motions , shall be instantly destroyed .
In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females , under penalty of death , from walking or standing in any public place without moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to indicate their presence to those behind them ; others oblige a Woman , when travelling , to be followed by one of her sons , or servants , or by her husband ; others confine Women altogether to their houses except during the religious festivals .
But it has been found by the wisest of our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race , but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code .
For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement at home or hampering regulations abroad , they are apt to vent their spleen upon their husbands and children ; and in the less temperate climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes destroyed in one or two hours of simultaneous female outbreak .
Hence the Three Laws , mentioned above , suffice for the better regulated States , and may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female Code .
After all , our principal safeguard is found , not in Legislature , but in the interests of the Women themselves .
For , although they can inflict instantaneous death by a retrograde movement , yet unless they can at once disengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of their victim , their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered .
The power of Fashion is also on our side .
I pointed out that in some less civilized States no female is suffered to stand in any public place without swaying her back from right to left .
This practice has been universal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all well - governed States , as far back as the memory of Figures can reach .
It is considered a disgrace to any State that legislation should have to enforce what ought to be , and is in every respectable female , a natural instinct .
The rhythmical and , if I may so say , well - modulated undulation of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and imitated by the wife of a common Equilateral , who can achieve nothing beyond a mere monotonous swing , like the ticking of a pendulum ; and the regular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the wife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles , in the females of whose family no " back - motion " of any kind has become as yet a necessity of life .
Hence , in every family of position and consideration , " back motion " is as prevalent as time itself ; and the husbands and sons in these households enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks .
Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute of affection .
But unfortunately the passion of the moment predominates , in the Frail Sex , over every other consideration .
This is , of course , a necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation .
For as they have no pretensions to an angle , being inferior in this respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles , they are consequently wholly devoid of brain - power , and have neither reflection , judgment nor forethought , and hardly any memory .
Hence , in their fits of fury , they remember no claims and recognize no distinctions .
I have actually known a case where a Woman has exterminated her whole household , and half an hour afterwards , when her rage was over and the fragments swept away , has asked what has become of her husband and her children .
Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a position where she can turn round .
When you have them in their apartments - which are constructed with a view to denying them that power - you can say and do what you like ; for they are then wholly impotent for mischief , and will not remember a few minutes hence the incident for which they may be at this moment threatening you with death , nor the promises which you may have found it necessary to make in order to pacify their fury .
On the whole we get on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations , except in the lower strata of the Military Classes .
There the want of tact and discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times indescribable disasters .
Relying too much on the offensive weapons of their acute angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and seasonable simulations , these reckless creatures too often neglect the prescribed construction of the women 's apartments , or irritate their wives by ill - advised expressions out of doors , which they refuse immediately to retract .
Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal truth indisposes them to make those lavish promises by which the more judicious Circle can in a moment pacify his consort .
The result is massacre ; not , however , without its advantages , as it eliminates the more brutal and troublesome of the Isosceles ; and by many of our Circles the destructiveness of the Thinner Sex is regarded as one among many providential arrangements for suppressing redundant population , and nipping Revolution in the bud .
Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families I cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in Spaceland .
There is peace , in so far as the absence of slaughter may be called by that name , but there is necessarily little harmony of tastes or pursuits ; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured safety at the cost of domestic comfort .
In every Circular or Polygonal household it has been a habit from time immemorial - and now has become a kind of instinct among the women of our higher classes - that the mothers and daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths towards their husband and his male friends ; and for a lady in a family of distinction to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a kind of portent , involving loss of status .
But , as I shall soon shew , this custom , though it has the advantage of safety , is not without its disadvantages .
In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman - where the wife is allowed to turn her back upon her husband , while pursuing her household avocations - there are at least intervals of quiet , when the wife is neither seen nor heard , except for the humming sound of the continuous Peace - cry ; but in the homes of the upper classes there is too often no peace .
There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye are ever directed to wards the Master of the household ; and light itself is not more persistent than the stream of feminine discourse .
The tact and skill which suffice to avert a Woman 's sting are unequal to the task of stopping a Woman 's mouth ; and as the wife has absolutely nothing to say , and absolutely no constraint of wit , sense , or conscience to prevent her from saying it , not a few cynics have been found to aver that they prefer the danger of the death - dealing but inaudible sting to the safe sonorousness of a Woman 's other end .
To my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seem truly deplorable , and so indeed it is .
A Male of the lowest type of the Isosceles may look forward to some improvement of his angle , and to the ultimate elevation of the whole of his degraded caste ; but no Woman can entertain such hopes for her sex .
" Once a Woman , always a Woman " is a Decree of Nature ; and the very Laws of Evolution seem suspended in her disfavour .
Yet at least we can admire the wise Prearrangement which has ordained that , as they have no hopes , so they shall have no memory to recall , and no forethought to anticipate , the miseries and humiliations which are at once a necessity of their existence and the basis of the constitution of Flatland .
5 . Of our Methods of Recognizing one another .
Recall what I told you above .
All beings in Flatland , animate or inanimate , no matter what their form , present to our view the same , or nearly the same , appearance , viz . that of a straight Line .
How then can one be distinguished from another , where all appear the same ?
The answer is threefold .
The first means of recognition is the sense of hearing ; which with us is far more highly developed than with you , and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice our personal friends , but even to discriminate between different classes , at least so far as concerns the three lowest orders , the Equilateral , the Square , and the Pentagon - for of the Isosceles I take no account .
But as we ascend in the social scale , the process of discriminating and being discriminated by hearing increases in difficulty , partly because voices are assimilated , partly because the faculty of voice - discrimination is a plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy .
And wherever there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this method .
Amongst our lowest orders , the vocal organs are developed to a degree more than correspondent with those of hearing , so that an Isosceles can easily feign the voice of a Polygon , and , with some training , that of a Circle himself .
A second method is therefore more commonly resorted to .
Feeling is , among our Women and lower classes - about our upper classes I shall speak presently - the principal test of recognition , at all events between strangers , and when the question is , not as to the individual , but as to the class .
What therefore " introduction " is among the higher classes in Spaceland , that the process of " feeling " is with us .
" Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr. So - and - so " - is still , among the more old - fashioned of our country gentlemen in districts remote from towns , the customary formula for a Flatland introduction .
But in the towns , and among men of business , the words " be felt by " are omitted and the sentence is abbreviated to , " Let me ask you to feel Mr. So - and - so " ; although it is assumed , of course , that the " feeling " is to be reciprocal .
Among our still more modern and dashing young gentlemen - who are extremely averse to superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to the purity of their native language - the formula is still further curtailed by the use of " to feel " in a technical sense , meaning , " to recommend - for - the - purposes - of - feeling - and - being - felt " ; and at this moment the " slang " of polite or fast society in the upper classes sanctions such a barbarism as " Mr. Smith , permit me to feel Mr. Jones . "
Let not my Reader however suppose that " feeling " is with us the tedious process that it would be with you , or that we find it necessary to feel right round all the sides of every individual before we determine the class to which he belongs .
Long practice and training , begun in the schools and continued in the experience of daily life , enable us to discriminate at once by the sense of touch , between the angles of an equal - sided Triangle , Square , and Pentagon ; and I need not say that the brainless vertex of an acute angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest touch .
It is therefore not necessary , as a rule , to do more than feel a single angle of an individual ; and this , once ascertained , tells us the class of the person whom we are addressing , unless indeed he belongs to the higher sections of the nobility .
There the difficulty is much greater .
Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge has been known to confuse a ten - sided with a twelve - sided Polygon ; and there is hardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University who could pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a twenty - sided and a twenty - four sided member of the Aristocracy .
Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the Legislative code concerning Women , will readily perceive that the process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion .
Otherwise the angles might inflict on the unwary Feeler irreparable injury .
It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt should stand perfectly still .
A start , a fidgety shifting of the position , yes , even a violent sneeze , has been known before now to prove fatal to the incautious , and to nip in the bud many a promising friendship .
Especially is this true among the lower classes of the Triangles .
With them , the eye is situated so far from their vertex that they can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that extremity of their frame .
They are , moreover , of a rough coarse nature , not sensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized Polygon .
What wonder then if an involuntary toss of the head has ere now deprived the State of a valuable life !
I have heard that my excellent Grandfather - one of the least irregular of his unhappy Isosceles class , who indeed obtained , shortly before his decease , four out of seven votes from the Sanitary and Social Board for passing him into the class of the Equal - sided - often deplored , with a tear in his venerable eye , a miscarriage of this kind , which had occurred to his great - great - great - Grandfather , a respectable Working Man with an angle or brain of 59°30 ' .
According to his account , my unfortunate Ancestor , being afflicted with rheumatism , and in the act of being felt by a Polygon , by one sudden start accidentally transfixed the Great Man through the diagonal ; and thereby , partly in consequence of his long imprisonment and degradation , and partly because of the moral shock which pervaded the whole of my Ancestor 's relations , threw back our family a degree and a half in their ascent towards better things .
The result was that in the next generation the family brain was registered at only 58° , and not till the lapse of five generations was the lost ground recovered , the full 60° attained , and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally achieved .
And all this series of calamities from one little accident in the process of Feeling .
At this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers exclaim , " How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and degrees , or minutes ?
We can see an angle , because we , in the region of Space , can see two straight lines inclined to one another ; but you , who can see nothing but one straight line at a time , or at all events only a number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line - how can you ever discern any angle , and much less register angles of different sizes ? "
I answer that though we cannot see angles , we can infer them , and this with great precision .
Our sense of touch , stimulated by necessity , and developed by long training , enables us to distinguish angles far more accurately than your sense of sight , when unaided by a rule or measure of angles .
Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural helps .
It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles class shall begin at half a degree , or thirty minutes , and shall increase ( if it increases at all ) by half a degree in every generation ; until the goal of 60° is reached , when the condition of serfdom is quitted , and the freeman enters the class of Regulars .
Consequently , Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale or Alphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60° , Specimens of which are placed in every Elementary School throughout the land .
Owing to occasional retrogressions , to still more frequent moral and intellectual stagnation , and to the extraordinary fecundity of the Criminal and Vagabond Classes , there is always a vast superfluity of individuals of the half degree and single degree class , and a fair abundance of Specimens up to 10° .
These are absolutely destitute of civic rights ; and a great number of them , not having even intelligence enough for the purposes of warfare , are devoted by the States to the service of education .
Fettered immovably so as to remove all possibility of danger , they are placed in the class rooms of our Infant Schools , and there they are utilized by the Board of Education for the purpose of imparting to the offspring of the Middle Classes that tact and intelligence of which these wretched creatures themselves are utterly devoid .
In some States the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered to exist for several years ; but in the more temperate and better regulated regions , it is found in the long run more advantageous for the educational interests of the young , to dispense with food , and to renew the Specimens every month - which is about the average duration of the foodless existence of the Criminal class .
In the cheaper schools , what is gained by the longer existence of the Specimen is lost , partly in the expenditure for food , and partly in the diminished accuracy of the angles , which are impaired after a few weeks of constant " feeling . "
Nor must we forget to add , in enumerating the advantages of the more expensive system , that it tends , though slightly yet perceptibly , to the diminution of the redundant Isosceles population - an object which every statesman in Flatland constantly keeps in view .
On the whole therefore - although I am not ignorant that , in many popularly elected School Boards , there is a reaction in favour of " the cheap system " as it is called - I am myself disposed to think that this is one of the many cases in which expense is the truest economy .
But I must not allow questions of School Board politics to divert me from my subject .
Enough has been said , I trust , to shew that Recognition by Feeling is not so tedious or indecisive a process as might have been supposed ; and it is obviously more trustworthy than Recognition by hearing .
Still there remains , as has been pointed out above , the objection that this method is not without danger .
For this reason many in the Middle and Lower classes , and all without exception in the Polygonal and Circular orders , prefer a third method , the description of which shall be reserved for the next section .
6. Of Recognition by Sight
If however the Reader will take the trouble to refer to the passage in which Recognition by Feeling is stated to be universal , he will find this qualification - " among the lower classes . "
It is only among the higher classes and in our temperate climates that Sight Recognition is practised .
That this power exists in any regions and for any classes is the result of Fog ; which prevails during the greater part of the year in all parts save the torrid zones .
That which is with you in Spaceland an unmixed evil , blotting out the landscape , depressing the spirits , and enfeebling the health , is by us recognized as a blessing scarcely inferior to air itself , and as the Nurse of arts and Parent of sciences .
But let me explain my meaning , without further eulogies on this beneficent Element .
If Fog were non-existent , all lines would appear equally and indistinguishably clear ; and this is actually the case in those unhappy countries in which the atmosphere is perfectly dry and .
transparent .
But wherever there is a rich supply of Fog objects that are at a distance , say of three feet , are appreciably dimmer than those at a distance of two feet eleven inches ; and the result is that by careful and constant experimental observation of comparative dimness and clearness , we are enabled to infer with great exactness the configuration of the object observed .
An instance will do more than a volume of generalities to make my meaning clear .
Suppose I see two individuals approaching whose rank I wish to ascertain .
They are , we will suppose , a Merchant and a Physician , or in other words , an Equilateral Triangle and a Pentagon : how am I to distinguish them ?
It will be obvious , to every child in Spaceland who has touched the threshold of Geometrical Studies , that , if I can bring my eye so that its glance may bisect an angle ( A ) of the approaching stranger , my view will lie as it were evenly between his two sides that are next to me ( viz. CA and ab ) , so that I shall contemplate the two impartially , and both will appear of the same size .
Now in the case of ( I ) the Merchant , what shall I see ?
I shall see a straight line dae , in which the middle point ( A ) Will be very bright because it is nearest to me ; but on either side the line will shade away rapidly into dimness , because the sides AC and AB recede rapidly into the fog and what appear to me as the Merchant 's extremities , viz .
D and E , will be very dim indeed .
On the other hand in the case of ( 2 ) the Physician , though I shall here also see a line ( D' A ' E ' ) with a bright centre ( A ' ) , yet it will shade away less rapidly into dimness , because the sides ( A ' C ' , A' B ' ) recede less rapidly into the fog : and what appear to me the Physician 's extremities , viz .
D' and E ' , will not be not so dim as the extremities of the Merchant .
The Reader will probably understand from these two instances how - after a very long training supplemented by constant experience - it is possible for the well - educated classes among us to discriminate with fair accuracy between the middle and lowest orders , by the sense of sight .
If my Spaceland Patrons have grasped this general conception , so far as to conceive the possibility of it and not to reject my account as altogether incredible - I shall have attained all I can reasonably expect .
Were I to attempt further details I should only perplex .
Yet for the sake of the young and inexperienced , who may perchance infer - from the two simple instances I have given above , of the manner in which I should recognize my Father and my Sons - that Recognition by sight is an easy affair , it may be needful to point out that in actual life most of the problems of Sight Recognition are far more subtle and complex .
If for example , when my Father , the Triangle , approaches me , he happens to present his side to me instead of his angle , then , until I have asked him to rotate , or until I have edged my eye round him , I am for the moment doubtful whether he may not be a Straight Line , or , in other words , a Woman .
Again , when I am in the company of one of my two hexagonal Grandsons , contemplating one of his sides ( AB ) full front , it will be evident from the accompanying diagram that I shall see one whole line ( AB ) in comparative brightness ( shading off hardly at all at the ends ) and two smaller lines ( CA and BD ) dim throughout and shading away into greater dimness towards the extremities C and D .
But I must not give way to the temptation of enlarging on these topics .
The meanest mathematician in Spaceland will readily believe me when I assert that the problems of life , which present themselves to the well - educated - when they are themselves in motion , rotating , advancing or retreating , and at the same time attempting to discriminate by the sense of sight between a number of Polygons of high rank moving in different directions , as for example in a ball - room or conversazione - must be of a nature to task the angularity of the most intellectual , and amply justify the rich endowments of the Learned Professors of Geometry , both Static and Kinetic , in the illustrious University of Wentbridge , where the Science and Art of Sight Recognition are regularly taught to large classes of the lite of the States .
It is only a few of the scions of our noblest and wealthiest houses , who are able to give the time and money necessary for the thorough prosecution of this noble and valuable Art .
Even to me , a Mathematician of no mean standing , and the Grandfather of two most hopeful and perfectly regular Hexagons , to find myself in the midst of a crowd of rotating Polygons of the higher classes , is occasionally very perplexing .
And of course to a common Tradesman , or Serf , such a sight is almost as unintelligible as it would be to you , my Reader , were you suddenly transported into our country .
In such a crowd you could see on all sides of you nothing but a Line , apparently straight , but of which the parts would vary irregularly and perpetually in brightness or dimness .
Even if you had completed your third year in the Pentagonal and Hexagonal classes in the University , and were perfect in the theory of the subject , you would still find that there was need of many years of experience , before you could move in a fashionable crowd without jostling against your betters , whom it is against etiquette to ask to " feel , " and who , by their superior culture and breeding , know all about your movements , while you know very little or nothing about theirs .
In a word , to comport oneself with perfect propriety in Polygonal society , one ought to be a Polygon oneself .
Such at least is the painful teaching of my experience .
It is astonishing how much the Art - or I may almost call it instinct - of Sight Recognition is developed by the habitual practice of it and by the avoidance of the custom of " Feeling . "
Just as , with you , the deaf and dumb , if once allowed to gesticulate and to use the hand - alphabet , will never acquire the more difficult but far more valuable art of lipspeech and lip - reading , so it is with us as regards " Seeing " and " Feeling . "
None who in early life resort to " Feeling " will ever learn " Seeing " in perfection .
For this reason , among our Higher Classes , " Feeling " is discouraged or absolutely forbidden .
From the cradle their children , instead of going to the Public Elementary schools ( where the art of Feeling is taught , ) are sent to higher Seminaries of an exclusive character ; and at our illustrious University , to " feel " is regarded as a most serious fault , involving Rustication for the first offence , and Expulsion for the second .
But among the lower classes the art of Sight Recognition is regarded as an unattainable luxury .
A common Tradesman cannot afford to let his son spend a third of his life in abstract studies .
The children of the poor are therefore allowed to " feel " from their earliest years , and they gain thereby a precocity and an early vivacity which contrast at first most favourably with the inert , undeveloped , and listless behaviour of the half - instructed youths of the Polygonal class ; but when the latter have at last completed their University course , and are prepared to put their theory into practice , the change that comes over them may almost be described as a new birth , and in every art , science , and social pursuit they rapidly overtake and distance their Triangular competitors .
Only a few of the polygonal Class fail to pass the Final Test or Leaving Examination at the University .
The condition of the unsuccessful minority is truly pitiable .
Rejected from the higher class , they are also despised by the lower .
They have neither the matured and systematically trained powers of the Polygonal Bachelors and Masters of Arts , nor yet the native precocity and mercurial versatility of the youthful Tradesman .
The professions , the public services , are closed against them ; and though in most States they are not actually debarred from marriage , yet they have the greatest difficulty in forming suitable alliances , as experience shews that the offspring of such unfortunate and ill - endowed parents is generally itself unfortunate , if not positively Irregular .
It is from these specimens of the refuse of our Nobility that the great Tumults and Seditions of past ages have generally derived their leaders ; and so great is the mischief thence arising that an increasing minority of our more progressive Statesmen are of opinion that true mercy would dictate their entire suppression , by enacting that all who fail to pass the Final Examination of the University should be either imprisoned for life , or extinguished by a painless death .
But I find myself digressing into the subject of Irregularities , a matter of such vital interest that it demands a separate section .
7. Concerning Irregular Figures
The size of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the individual .
A Female at birth would be about an inch long , while a tall adult Woman might extend to a foot .
As to the Males of every class , it may be roughly said that the length of an adult 's sides , when added together , is two feet or a little more .
But the size of our sides is not under consideration .
I am speaking of the equality of sides , and it does not need much reflection to see that the whole of the social life in Flatland rests upon the fundamental fact that Nature wills all Figures to have their sides equal .
If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal .
Instead of its being sufficient to feel , or estimate by sight , a single angle in order to determine the form of an individual , it would be necessary to ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling .
But life would be too short for such a tedious grouping .
The whole science and art of Sight Recognition would at once perish ; Feeling , so far as it is an art , would not long survive ; intercourse would become perilous or impossible ; there would be an end to all confidence , all forethought ; no one would be safe in making the most simple social arrangements ; in a word , civilization would relapse into barbarism .
Am I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious conclusions ?
Surely a moment 's reflection , and a single instance from common life , must convince every one that our whole social system is based upon Regularity , or Equality of Angles .
You meet , for example , two or three Tradesmen in the street , whom you recognize at once to be Tradesmen by a glance at their angles and rapidly bedimmed sides , and you ask them to step into your house to lunch .
This you do at present with perfect confidence , because everyone knows to an inch or two the area occupied by an adult Triangle : but imagine that your Tradesman drags behind his regular and respectable vertex , a parallelogram of twelve or thirteen inches in diagonal : - what are you to do with such a monster sticking fast in your house door ?
But I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating details which must be patent to everyone who enjoys the advantages of a Residence in Spaceland .
Obviously the measurements of a single angle would no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances ; one 's whole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the perimeter of one 's acquaintances .
Already the difficulties of avoiding a collision in a crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a well - educated Square ; but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a single figure in the company , all would be chaos and confusion , and the slightest panic would cause serious injuries , or - if there happened to be any Women or Soldiers present - perhaps considerable loss of life .
Expediency therefore concurs with Nature in stamping the seal of its approval upon Regularity of conformation : nor has the Law been backward in seconding their efforts .
" Irregularity of Figure " means with us the same as , or more than , a combination of moral obliquity and criminality with you , and is treated accordingly .
There are not wanting , it is true , some promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that there is no necessary connection between geometrical and moral Irregularity .
" The Irregular , " they say , " is from his birth scouted by his own parents , derided by his brothers and sisters , neglected by the domestics , scorned and suspected by society , and excluded from all posts of responsibility , trust , and useful activity .
His every movement is jealously watched by the police till he comes of age and presents himself for inspection ; then he is either destroyed , if he is found to exceed the fixed margin of deviation , or else immured in a Government Office as a clerk of the seventh class ; prevented from marriage ; forced to drudge at an uninteresting occupation for a miserable stipend ; obliged to live and board at the office , and to take even his vacation under close supervision ; what wonder that human nature , even in the best and purest , is embittered and perverted by such surroundings ! "
All this very plausible reasoning does not convince me , as it has not convinced the wisest of our Statesmen , that our ancestors erred in laying it down as an axiom of policy that the toleration of Irregularity is incompatible with the safety of the State .
Doubtless , the life of an Irregular is hard ; but the interests of the Greater Number require that it shall be hard .
If a man with a triangular front and a polygonal back were allowed to exist and to propagate a still more Irregular posterity , what would become of the arts of life ?
Are the houses and doors and churches in Flatland to be altered in order to accommodate such monsters ?
Are our ticket collectors to be required to measure every man 's perimeter before they allow him to enter a theatre , or to take his place in a lecture room ?
Is an Irregular to be exempted from the militia ?
And if not , how is he to be prevented from carrying desolation into the ranks of his comrades ?
Again , what irresistible temptations to fraudulent impostures must needs beset such a creature !
How easy for him to enter a shop with his polygonal front foremost , and to order goods to any extent from a confiding tradesman !
Let the advocates of a falsely called Philanthropy plead as they may for the abrogation of the Irregular Penal Laws , I for my part have never known an Irregular who was not also what Nature evidently intended him to be - a hypocrite , a misanthropist , and , up to the limits of his power , a perpetrator of all manner of mischief .
Not that I should be disposed to recommend ( at present ) the extreme measures adopted in some States , where an infant whose angle deviates by half a degree from the correct angularity is summarily destroyed at birth .
Some of our highest and ablest men , men of real genius , have during their earliest days laboured under deviations as great as , or even greater than , forty - five minutes : and the loss of their precious lives would have been an irreparable injury to the State .
The art of healing also has achieved some of its most glorious triumphs in the compressions , extensions , trepannings , colligations , and other surgical or diaetetic operations by which Irregularity has been partly or wholly cured .
Advocating therefore a Via Media , I would lay down no fixed or absolute line of demarcation ; but at the period when the frame is just beginning to set , and when the Medical Board has reported that recovery is improbable , I would suggest that the Irregular offspring be painlessly and mercifully consumed .
8 . Of the Ancient Practice of Painting
How can it be otherwise , when all one 's prospect , all one 's landscapes , historical pieces , portraits , flowers , still life , are nothing but a single line , with no varieties except degrees of brightness and obscurity ?
It was not always thus .
Colour , if Tradition speaks the truth , once for the space of half a dozen centuries or more , threw a transient splendour over the lives of our ancestors in the remotest ages .
Some private individual - a Pentagon whose name is variously reported - having casually discovered the constituents of the simpler colours and a rudimentary method of painting , is said to have begun decorating first his house , then his slaves , then his Father , his Sons , and Grandsons , lastly himself .
The convenience as well as the beauty of the results commended themselves to all .
Wherever Chromatistes , - for by that name the most trustworthy authorities concur in calling him , - turned his variegated frame , there he at once excited attention , and attracted respect .
No one now needed to " feel " him ; no one mistook his front for his back ; all his movements were readily ascertained by his neighbours without the slightest strain on their powers of calculation ; no one jostled him , or failed to make way for him ; his voice was saved the labour of that exhausting utterance by which we colourless Squares and Pentagons are often forced to proclaim our individuality when we move amid a crowd of ignorant Isosceles .
The fashion spread like wildfire .
Before a week was over , every Square and Triangle in the district had copied the example of Chromatistes , and only a few of the more conservative Pentagons still held out .
A month or two found even the Dodecagons infected with the innovation .
A year had not elapsed before the habit had spread to all but the very highest of the Nobility .
Needless to say , the custom soon made its way from the district of Chromatistes to surrounding regions ; and within two generations no one in all Flatland was colourless except the Women and the Priests .
Here Nature herself appeared to erect a barrier , and to plead against extending the innovation to these two classes .
Many - sidedness was almost essential as a pretext for the Innovators .
" Distinction of sides is intended by Nature to imply distinction of colours " - such was the sophism which in those days flew from mouth to mouth , converting whole towns at a time to the new culture .
But manifestly to our Priests and Women this adage did not apply .
The latter had only one side , and therefore - plurally and pedantically speaking - no sides .
The former - if at least they would assert their claim to be really and truly Circles , and not mere high - class Polygons with an infinitely large number of infinitesimally small sides - were in the habit of boasting ( what Women confessed and deplored ) that they also had no sides , being blessed with a perimeter of one line , or , in other words , a Circumference .
Hence it came to pass that these two Classes could see no force in the so - called axiom about " Distinction of Sides implying Distinction of Colour ; " and when all others had succumbed to the fascinations of corporal decoration , the Priests and the Women alone still remained pure from the pollution of paint .
Immoral , licentious , anarchical , unscientific - call them by what names you will - yet , from an aesthetic point of view , those ancient days of the Colour Revolt were the glorious childhood of Art in Flatland - a childhood , alas , that never ripened into manhood , nor even reached the blossom of youth .
To live was then in itself a delight , because living implied seeing .
Even at a small party , the company was a pleasure to behold ; the richly varied hues of the assembly in a church or theatre are said to have more than once proved too distracting for our greatest teachers and actors ; but most ravishing of all is said to have been the unspeakable magnificence of a military review .
The sight of a line of battle of twenty thousand Isosceles suddenly facing about , and exchanging the sombre black of their bases for the orange and purple of the two sides including their acute angle ; the militia of the Equilateral Triangles tricoloured in red , white , and blue ; the mauve , ultra- marine , gamboge , and burnt umber of the Square artillerymen rapidly rotating near their vermilion guns ; the dashing and flashing of the five - coloured and six - coloured Pentagons and Hexagons careering across the field in their offices of surgeons , geometricians and aides - de - camp - all these may well have been sufficient to render credible the famous story how an illustrious Circle , overcome by the artistic beauty of the forces under his command , threw aside his marshal 's baton and his royal crown , exclaiming that he henceforth exchanged them for the artist 's pencil .
How great and glorious the sensuous development of these days must have been is in part indicated by the very language and vocabulary of the period .
The commonest utterances of the commonest citizens in the time of the Colour Revolt seem to have been suffused with a richer tinge of word or thought ; and to that era we are even now indebted for our finest poetry and for whatever rhythm still remains in the more scientific utterance of these modern days .
9 . Of the Universal Colour Bill
The Art of Sight Recognition , being no longer needed , was no longer practised ; and the studies of Geometry , Statics , Kinetics , and other kindred subjects , came soon to be considered superfluous , and fell into disrespect and neglect even at our University .
The inferior Art of Feeling speedily experienced the same fate at our Elementary Schools .
Then the Isosceles classes , asserting that the Specimens were no longer used nor needed , and refusing to pay the customary tribute from the Criminal classes to the service of Education , waxed daily more numerous and more insolent on the strength of their immunity from the old burden which had formerly exercised the twofold wholesome effect of at once taming their brutal nature and thinning their excessive numbers .
Year by year the Soldiers and Artisans began more vehemently to assert - and with increasing truth - that there was no great difference between them and the very highest class of Polygons , now that they were raised to an equality with the latter , and enabled to grapple with all the difficulties and solve all the problems of life , whether Statical or Kinetical , by the simple process of Colour Recognition .
Not content with the natural neglect into which Sight Recognition was falling , they began boldly to demand the legal prohibition of all " monopolizing and aristocratic Arts " and the consequent abolition of all endowments for the studies of Sight Recognition , Mathematics , and Feeling .
Soon , they began to insist that inasmuch as Colour , which was a second Nature , had destroyed the need of aristocratic distinctions , the Law should follow in the same path , and that henceforth all individuals and all classes should be recognized as absolutely equal and entitled to equal rights .
Finding the higher Orders wavering and undecided , the leaders of the Revolution advanced still further in their requirements , and at last demanded that all classes alike , the Priests and the Women not excepted , should do homage to Colour by submitting to be painted .
When it was objected that Priests and Women had no sides , they retorted that Nature and Expediency concurred in dictating that the front half of every human being ( that is to say , the half containing his eye and mouth ) should be distinguishable from his hinder half .
They therefore brought before a general and extraordinary Assembly of all the States of Flatland a Bill proposing that in every Woman the half containing the eye and mouth should be coloured red , and the other half green .
The Priests were to be painted in the same way , red being applied to that semicircle in which the eye and mouth formed the middle point ; while the other or hinder semicircle was to be coloured green .
There was no little cunning in this proposal , which indeed emanated not from any Isosceles - for no being so degraded would have had angularity enough to appreciate , much less to devise , such a model of state - craft - but from an Irregular Circle who , instead of being destroyed in his childhood , was reserved by a foolish indulgence to bring desolation on his country and destruction on myriads of his followers .
On the one hand the proposition was calculated to bring the Women in all classes over to the side of the Chromatic Innovation .
For by assigning to the Women the same two colours as were assigned to the Priests , the Revolutionists thereby ensured that , in certain positions , every Woman would appear like a Priest , and be treated with corresponding respect and deference - a prospect that could not fail to attract the female Sex in a mass .
But by some of my Readers the possibility of the identical appearance of Priests and Women , under the new Legislation , may not be recognized ; if so , a word or two will make it obvious .
Imagine a woman duly decorated , according to the new Code ; with the front half ( i.e. the half containing eye and mouth ) red , and with the hinder half green .
Look at her from one side .
Obviously you will see a straight line , half red , half green .
Now imagine a Priest , whose mouth is at M , and whose front semicircle ( AMB ) is consequently coloured red , while his hinder semicircle is green ; so that the diameter AB divides the green from the red .
If you contemplate the Great Man so as to have your eye in the same straight line as his dividing diameter ( AB ) , what you will see will be a straight line ( CBD ) , of which one half ( CB ) will be red , and the other ( BD ) green .
The whole line ( CD ) will be rather shorter perhaps than that of a full - sized Woman , and will shade off more rapidly towards its extremities ; but the identity of the colours would give you an immediate impression of identity of Class , making you neglectful of other details .
Bear in mind the decay of Sight Recognition which threatened society at the time of the Colour Revolt ; add too the certainty that Women would speedily learn to shade off their extremities so as to imitate the Circles ; it must then be surely obvious to you , my dear Reader , that the Colour Bill placed us under a great danger of confounding a Priest with a young Woman .
How attractive this prospect must have been to the Frail Sex may readily be imagined .
They anticipated with delight the confusion that would ensue .
At home they might hear political and ecclesiastical secrets intended not for them but for their husbands and brothers , and might even issue commands in the name of a priestly Circle ; out of doors the striking combination of red and green , without addition of any other colours , would be sure to lead the common people into endless mistakes , and the Women would gain whatever the Circles lost , in the deference of the passers by .
As for the scandal that would befall the Circular Class if the frivolous and unseemly conduct of the Women were imputed to them , and as to the consequent subversion of the Constitution , the Female Sex could not be expected to give a thought to these considerations .
Even in the households of the Circles , the Women were all in favour of the Universal Colour Bill .
The second object aimed at by the Bill was the gradual demoralization of the Circles themselves .
In the general intellectual decay they still preserved their pristine clearness and strength of understanding .
From their earliest childhood , familiarized in their Circular households with the total absence of Colour , the Nobles alone preserved the Sacred Art of Sight Recognition , with all the advantages that result from that admirable training of the intellect .
Hence , up to the date of the introduction of the Universal Colour Bill , the Circles had not only held their own , but even increased their lead of the other classes by abstinence from the popular fashion .
Now therefore the artful Irregular whom I described above as the real author of this diabolical Bill , determined at one blow to lower the status of the Hierarchy by forcing them to submit to the pollution of Colour , and at the same time to destroy their domestic opportunities of training in the Art of Sight Recognition , so as to enfeeble their intellects by depriving them of their pure and colourless homes .
Once subjected to the chromatic taint , every parental and every childish Circle would demoralize each other .
Only in discerning between the Father and the Mother would the Circular infant find problems for the exercise of its understanding - problems too often likely to be corrupted by maternal impostures with the result of shaking the child 's faith in all logical conclusions .
Thus by degrees the intellectual lustre of the Priestly Order would wane , and the road would then lie open for a total destruction of all Aristocratic Legislature and for the subversion of our Privileged Classes .
10 . Of the Suppression of Chromatic Sedition
A whole army of Polygons , who turned out to fight as private soldiers , was utterly annihilated by a superior force of Isosceles Triangles - the Squares and Pentagons meanwhile remaining neutral .
Worse than all , some of the ablest Circles fell a prey to conjugal fury .
Infuriated by political animosity , the wives in many a noble household wearied their lords with prayers to give up their opposition to the Colour Bill ; and some , finding their entreaties fruitless , fell on and slaughtered their innocent children and husband , perishing themselves in the act of carnage .
It is recorded that during that triennial agitation no less than twenty three Circles perished in domestic discord .
Great indeed was the peril .
It seemed as though the Priests had no choice between submission and extermination ; when suddenly the course of events was completely changed by one of those picturesque incidents which Statesmen ought never to neglect , often to anticipate , and sometimes perhaps to originate , because of the absurdly disproportionate power with which they appeal to the sympathies of the populace .
It happened that an Isosceles of a low type , with a brain little if at all above four degrees - accidentally dabbling in the colours of some Tradesman whose shop he had plundered - painted himself , or caused himself to be painted ( for the story varies ) with the twelve colours of a Dodecagon .
Going into the Market Place he accosted in a feigned voice a maiden , the orphan daughter of a noble Polygon , whose affection in former days he had sought in vain ; and by a series of deceptions - aided , on the one side , by a string of lucky accidents too long to relate , and on the other , by an almost inconceivable fatuity and neglect of ordinary precautions on the part of the relations of the bride - he succeeded in consummating the marriage .
The unhappy girl committed suicide on discovering the fraud to which she had been subjected .
When the news of this catastrophe spread from State to State the minds of the Women were violently agitated .
Sympathy with the miserable victim and anticipations of similar deceptions for themselves , their sisters , and their daughters , made them now regard the Colour Bill in an entirely new aspect .
Not a few openly avowed themselves converted to antagonism ; the rest needed only a slight stimulus to make a similar avowal .
Seizing this favourable opportunity , the Circles hastily convened an extraordinary Assembly of the States ; and besides the usual guard of Convicts , they secured the attendance of a large number of reactionary Women .
Amidst an unprecedented concourse , the Chief Circle of those days - by name Pantocyclus - arose to find himself hissed and hooted by a hundred and twenty thousand Isosceles .
But he secured silence by declaring that henceforth the Circles would enter on a policy of Concession ; yielding to the wishes of the majority , they would accept the Colour Bill .
The uproar being at once converted to applause , he invited Chromatistes , the leader of the Sedition , into the centre of the hall , to receive in the name of his followers the submission of the Hierarchy .
Then followed a speech , a masterpiece of rhetoric , which occupied nearly a day in the delivery , and to which no summary can do justice .
With a grave appearance of impartiality he declared that as they were now finally committing themselves to Reform or Innovation , it was desirable that they should take one last view of the perimeter of the whole subject , its defects as well as its advantages .
Gradually introducing the mention of the dangers to the Tradesmen , the Professional Classes and the Gentlemen , he silenced the rising murmurs of the Isosceles by reminding them that , in spite of all these defects , he was willing to accept the Bill if it was approved by the majority .
But it was manifest that all , except the Isosceles , were moved by his words and were either neutral or averse to the Bill .
Turning now to the Workmen he asserted that their interests must not be neglected , and that , if they intended to accept the Colour Bill , they ought at least to do so with full view of the consequences .
Many of them , he said , were on the point of being admitted to the class of the Regular Triangles ; others anticipated for their children a distinction they could not hope for themselves .
That honourable ambition would now have to be sacrificed .
With the universal adoption of Colour , all distinctions would cease ; Regularity would be confused with Irregularity ; development would give place to retrogression ; the Workman would in a few generations be degraded to the level of the Military , or even the Convict Class ; political power would be in the hands of the greatest number , that is to say the Criminal Classes , who were already more numerous than the Workmen , and would soon out - number all the other Classes put together when the usual Compensative Laws of Nature were violated .
A subdued murmur of assent ran through the ranks of the Artisans , and Chromatistes , in alarm , attempted to step forward and address them .
But he found himself encompassed with guards and forced to remain silent while the Chief Circle in a few impassioned words made a final appeal to the Women , exclaiming that , if the Colour Bill passed , no marriage would henceforth be safe , no woman 's honour secure ; fraud , deception , hypocrisy would pervade every household ; domestic bliss would share the fate of the Constitution and pass to speedy perdition .
" Sooner than this , " he cried , " Come death . "
At these words , which were the preconcerted signal for action , the Isosceles Convicts fell on and transfixed the wretched Chromatistes ; the Regular Classes , opening their ranks , made way for a band of Women who , under direction of the Circles , moved , back foremost , invisibly and unerringly upon the unconscious soldiers ; the Artisans , imitating the example of their betters , also opened their ranks .
Meantime bands of Convicts occupied every entrance with an impenetrable phalanx .
The battle , or rather carnage , was of short duration .
Under the skillful generalship of the Circles almost every Woman 's charge was fatal and very many extracted their sting uninjured , ready for a second slaughter .
But no second blow was needed ; the rabble of the Isosceles did the rest of the business for themselves .
Surprised , leaderless , attacked in front by invisible foes , and finding egress cut off by the Convicts behind them , they at once - after their manner - lost all presence of mind , and raised the cry of " treachery . "
This sealed their fate .
Every Isosceles now saw and felt a foe in every other .
In half an hour not one of that vast multitude was living ; and the fragments of seven score thousand of the Criminal Class slain by one another 's angles attested the triumph of Order .
The Circles delayed not to push their victory to the uttermost .
The Working Men they spared but decimated .
The Militia of the Equilaterals was at once called out ; and every Triangle suspected of Irregularity on reasonable grounds , was destroyed by Court Martial , without the formality of exact measurement by the Social Board .
The homes of the Military and Artisan classes were inspected in a course of visitations extending through upwards of a year ; and during that period every town , village , and hamlet was systematically purged of that excess of the lower orders which had been brought about by the neglect to pay the tribute of Criminals to the Schools and University , and by the violation of the other natural Laws of the Constitution of Flatland .
Thus the balance of classes was again restored .
Needless to say that henceforth the use of Colour was abolished , and its possession prohibited .
Even the utterance of any word denoting Colour , except by the Circles or by qualified scientific teachers , was punished by a severe penalty .
Only at our University in some of the very highest and most esoteric classes - which I myself have never been privileged to attend - it is understood that the sparing use of Colour is still sanctioned for the purpose of illustrating some of the deeper problems of mathematics .
But of this I can only speak from hearsay .
Elsewhere in Flatland , Colour is now non-existent .
The art of making it is known to only one living person , the Chief Circle for the time being ; and by him it is handed down on his deathbed to none but his Successor .
One manufactory alone produces it ; and , lest the secret should be betrayed , the Workmen are annually consumed , and fresh ones introduced .
So great is the terror with which even now our Aristocracy looks back to the far distant days of the agitation for the Universal Colour Bill .
11 . Concerning our Priests
For this reason I must omit many matters of which the explanation would not , I flatter myself , be without interest for my Readers : as for example , our method of propelling and stopping ourselves , although destitute of feet ; the means by which we give fixity to structures of wood , stone , or brick , although of course we have no hands , nor can we lay foundations as you can , nor avail ourselves of the lateral pressure of the earth ; the manner in which the rain originates in the intervals between our various zones , so that the northern regions do not intercept the moisture from falling on the southern ; the nature of our hills and mines , our trees and vegetables , our seasons and harvests ; our Alphabet and method of writing , adapted to our linear tablets ; these and a hundred other details of our physical existence I must pass over , nor do I mention them now except to indicate to my readers that their omission proceeds not from forgetfulness on the part of the author , but from his regard for the time of the Reader .
Yet before I proceed to my legitimate subject some few final remarks will no doubt be expected by my Readers upon those pillars and mainstays of the Constitution of Flatland , the controllers of our conduct and shapers of our destiny , the objects of universal homage and almost of adoration : need I say that I mean our Circles or Priests ?
When I call them Priests , let me not be understood as meaning no more than the term denotes with you .
With us , our Priests are Administrators of all Business , Art , and Science ; Directors of Trade , Commerce , Generalship , Architecture , Engineering , Education , Statesmanship , Legislature , Morality , Theology ; doing nothing themselves , they are the Causes of everything worth doing , that is done by others .
Although popularly everyone called a Circle is deemed a Circle , yet among the better educated Classes it is known that no Circle is really a Circle , but only a Polygon with a very large number of very small sides .
As the number of the sides increases , a polygon approximates to a Circle ; and , when the number is very great indeed , say for example three or four hundred , it is extremely difficult for the most delicate touch to feel any polygonal angles .
Let me say rather , it would be difficult : for , as I have shown above , Recognition by Feeling is unknown among the highest society , and to feel a Circle would be considered a most audacious insult .
This habit of abstention from Feeling in the best society enables a Circle the more easily to sustain the veil of mystery in which , from his earliest years , he is wont to enwrap the exact nature of his Perimeter or Circumference .
Three feet being the average Perimeter it follows that , in a polygon of three hundred sides each side will be no more than the hundredth part of a foot in length , or little more than the tenth part of an inch ; and in a Polygon of six or seven hundred sides the sides are little larger than the diameter of a spaceland pin-head .
It is always assumed , by courtesy , that the Chief Circle for the time being has ten thousand sides .
The ascent of the posterity of the Circles in the social scale is not restricted , as it is among the lower Regular classes , by the Law of Nature which limits the increase of sides to one in each generation .
If it were so , the number of sides in a Circle would be a mere question of pedigree and arithmetic , and the four hundred and ninety - seventh descendant of an Equilateral Triangle would necessarily be a Polygon with live hundred sides .
But this is not the case .
Nature s Law prescribes two antagonistic decrees affecting Circular propagation ; first , that as the race climbs higher in the scale of development , so development shall proceed at an accelerated pace ; second , that in the same proportion , the race shall become less fertile .
Consequently in the home of a Polygon of four or five hundred sides it is rare to find a son ; more than one is never seen .
On the other hand the son of a five - hundred sided Polygon has been known to possess five hundred and fifty , or even six hundred sides .
Art also steps in to help the process of the higher Evolution .
Our physicians have discovered that the small and tender sides of an infant Polygon of the higher class can be fractured , and his whole frame re-set , with such exactness that a Polygon of two or three hundred sides sometimes - by no means always , for the process is attended with serious risk - but sometimes overleaps two or three hundred generations , and as if were doubles at a stroke , the number of his progenitors and the nobility of his descent .
Many a promising child is sacrificed in this way .
Scarcely one out of ten survives .
Yet so strong is the parental ambition among those Polygons who are , as it were , on the fringe of the Circular class , that it is very rare to find a Nobleman of that position in society , who has neglected to place his first - born in the Circular Neo - Therapeutic Gymnasium before he has attained the age of a month .
One year determines success or failure .
At the end of that time the child has , in all probability , added one more to the tombstones that crowd the Neo - Therapeutic Cemetery ; but on rare occasions a glad procession bears back the little one to his exultant parents , no longer a Polygon , but a Circle , at least by courtesy : and a single instance of so blessed a result induces multitudes of Polygonal parents to submit to similar domestic sacrifices , which have a dissimilar issue .
12 . Of the Doctrine of our Priests
It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually Suppressed those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in the vain belief that conduct depends upon will , effort , training , encouragement , praise , or anything else but Configuration .
It was Pantocyclus - the illustrious Circle mentioned above , as the queller of the Colour Revolt - who first convinced mankind that Configuration makes the man ; that if , for example , you are born an Isosceles with two uneven sides , you will assuredly go wrong unless you have them made even - for which purpose you must go to the Isosceles Hospital ; similarly , if you are a Triangle , or Square , or even a Polygon , born with any Irregularity , you must be taken to one of the Regular Hospitals to have your disease cured ; otherwise you will end your days in the State Prison or by the angle of the State Executioner .
All faults or defects , from the slightest misconduct to the most flagitious crime , Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect Regularity in the bodily figure , caused perhaps ( if not congenital ) by some collision in a crowd ; by neglect to take exercise , or by taking too much of it ; or even by a sudden change of temperature , resulting in a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame .
Therefore , concluded that illustrious Philosopher , neither good conduct nor bad conduct is a fit subject , in any sober estimation , for either praise or blame .
For why should you praise , for example , the integrity of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client , when you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right angles ?
Or again , why blame a lying , thievish Isosceles when you ought rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides ?
Theoretically , this doctrine is unquestionable ; but it has practical drawbacks .
In dealing with an Isosceles , if a rascal pleads that he cannot help stealing because of his unevenness , you reply that for that very reason , because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours , you , the Magistrate , cannot help sentencing him to be consumed - and there 's an end of the matter .
But in little domestic difficulties , where the penalty of consumption , or death , is out of the question , this theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly ; and I must confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of the temperature has been too much for his perimeter , and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but on his Configuration , which can only be strengthened by abundance of the choicest sweetmeats , I neither see my way logically to reject , nor practically to accept , his conclusions .
For my own part , I find it best to assume that a good sound scolding or castigation has some latent and strengthening influence on my Grandson 's Configuration ; though I own that I have no grounds for thinking so .
At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating myself from this dilemma ; for I find that many of the highest Circles , sitting as Judges in law courts , use praise and blame towards Regular and Irregular Figures ; and in their homes I know by experience that , when scolding their children , they speak about " right " or " wrong " as vehemently and passionately as if they believed that these names represented real existences , and that a human Figure is really capable of choosing between them .
Constantly carrying out their policy of making Configuration the leading idea in every mind , the Circles reverse the nature of that Commandment which in Spaceland regulates the relations between parents and children .
With you , children are taught to honour their parents ; with us - next to the Circles , who are the chief object of universal homage - a man is taught to honour his Grandson , if he has one ; or , if not , his Son .
By " honour , " however , is by no means meant " indulgence , " but a reverent regard for their highest interests : and the Circles teach that the duty of fathers is to subordinate their own interests to those of posterity , thereby advancing the welfare of the whole State as well as that of their own immediate descendants .
The weak point in the system of the Circles - if a humble Square may venture to speak of anything Circular as containing any element of weakness - appears to me to be found in their relations with Women .
As it is of the utmost importance for Society that Irregular births should be discouraged , it follows that no Woman who has any Irregularities in her ancestry is a fit partner for one who desires that his posterity should rise by regular degrees in the social scale .
Now the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement ; but as all Women are straight , and therefore visibly Regular so to speak , one has to devise some other means of ascertaining what I may call their invisible Irregularity , that is to say their potential Irregularities as regards possible offspring .
This is effected by carefully - kept pedigrees , which are preserved and supervised by the State ; and without a certified pedigree no Woman is allowed to marry .
Now it might have been supposed that a Circle - proud of his ancestry and regardful for a posterity which might possibly issue hereafter in a Chief Circle - would be more careful than any other to choose a wife who had no blot on her escutcheon .
But it is not so .
The care in choosing a Regular wife appears to diminish as one rises in the social scale .
Nothing would induce an aspiring Isosceles , who had hopes of generating an Equilateral Son , to take a wife who reckoned a single Irregularity among her Ancestors ; a Square or Pentagon , who is confident that his family is steadily on the rise , does not inquire above the five - hundredth generation ; a Hexagon or Dodecagon is even more careless of the wife 's pedigree ; but a Circle has been known deliberately to take a wife who has had an Irregular Great - Grandfather , and all because of some slight superiority of lustre , or because of the charms of a low voice - which , with us , even more than you , is thought " an excellent thing in Woman . "
Such ill - judged marriages are , as might be expected , barren , if they do not result in positive Irregularity or in diminution of sides ; but none of these evils have hitherto proved sufficiently deterrent .
The loss of a few sides in a highly - developed Polygon is not easily noticed , and is sometimes compensated by a successful operation in the Neo - Therapeutic Gymnasium , as I have described above ; and the Circles are too much disposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a Law of the superior development .
Yet , if this evil be not arrested , the gradual diminution of the Circular class may soon become more rapid , and the time may be not far distant when , the race being no longer able to produce a Chief Circle , the Constitution of Flatland must fall .
One other word of warning suggests itself to me , though I cannot so easily mention a remedy ; and this also refers to our relations with Women .
About three hundred years ago , it was decreed by the Chief Circle that , since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in Emotion , they ought no longer to be treated as rational , nor receive any mental education .
The consequence was that they were no longer .
taught to read , nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to count the angles of their husband or children ; and hence they sensibly declined during each generation in intellectual power .
And this system of female non-education or quietism still prevails .
My fear is that , with the best intentions , this policy has been carried so far as to react injuriously on the Male Sex .
For the consequence is that , as things now are , we Males have to lead a kind of bi-lingual , and I may almost say bi-mental , existence .
With Women , we speak of " love , " " duty , " " right , " " wrong , " " pity , " " hope , " and other irrational and emotional conceptions , which have no existence , and the fiction of which has no object except to control feminine exuberances ; but among ourselves , and in our books , we have an entirely different vocabulary and I may almost say , idiom .
" Love " then becomes " the anticipation of benefits " ; " duty " becomes " necessity " or " fitness " ; and other words are correspondingly transmuted .
Moreover , among Women , we use language implying the utmost deference for their Sex ; and they fully believe that the Chief Circle Himself is not more devoutly adored by us than they are : but behind their backs they are both regarded and spoken of - by all except the very young - as being little better than " mindless organisms . "
Our Theology also in the Women 's chambers is entirely different from our Theology elsewhere .
Now my humble fear is that this double training , in language as well as in thought , imposes somewhat too heavy a burden upon the young , especially when , at the age of three years old , they are taken from the maternal care and taught to unlearn the old language - except for the purpose of repeating it in the presence of their Mothers and Nurses - and to learn the vocabulary and idiom of science .
Already methinks I discern a weakness in the grasp of mathematical truth at the present time as compared with the more robust intellect of our ancestors three hundred years ago .
I say nothing of the possible danger if a Woman should ever surreptitiously learn to read and convey to her Sex the result of her perusal of a single popular volume ; nor of the possibility that the indiscretion or disobedience of some infant Male might reveal to a Mother the secrets of the logical dialect .
On the simple ground of the enfeebling of the Male intellect , I rest this humble appeal to the highest Authorities to reconsider the regulations of Female education .
Part II : OTHER WORLDS
13 . How I had a Vision of Lineland
A noise of confused , multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from them at intervals as long as they were moving ; but sometimes they ceased from motion , and then all was silence .
Approaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women , I accosted her , but received no answer .
A second and a third appeal on my part were equally ineffectual .
Losing patience at what appeared to me intolerable rudeness , I brought my mouth into a position full in front of her mouth so as to intercept her motion , and loudly repeated my question , " Woman , what signifies this concourse , and this strange and confused chirping , and this monotonous motion to and fro in one and the same Straight Line ? "
" I am no Woman , " replied the small Line : " I am the Monarch of the world .
But thou , whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland ? "
Receiving this abrupt reply , I begged pardon if I had in any way startled or molested his Royal Highness ; and describing myself as a stranger I besought the King to give me some account of his dominions .
But I had the greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information on points that really interested me ; for the Monarch could not refrain from constantly assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be known to me and that I was simulating ignorance in jest .
However , by persevering questions I elicited the following facts :
It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch - as he called himself - was persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom , and in which he passed his existence , constituted the whole of the world , and indeed the whole of Space .
Not being able either to move or to see , save in his Straight Line , he had no conception of anything out of it .
Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him , the sounds had come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made no answer , " seeing no man , " as he expressed it , " and hearing a voice as it were from my own intestines . "
Until the moment when I placed my mouth in his World , he had neither seen me , nor heard anything except confused sounds beating against - what I called his side , but what he called his inside or stomach ; nor had he even now the least conception of the region from which I had come .
Outside his World , or Line , all was a blank to him ; nay , not even a blank , for a blank implies Space ; say , rather , all was non existent .
His subjects - of whom the small Lines were men and the Points Women - were all alike confined in motion and eye - sight to that single Straight Line , w
Forget the show - off flair of the MacBook Air .
The real excitement in mobile computing is much cheaper than that .
The Asus Eee PC has kick - started a whole slew of cut - down budget sub- notebooks that , although they can't play the latest games , are more than enough for most of our on - the - move needs .
Naturally there are many other thin and light notebooks on the market , from Sony and Toshiba , to name but two .
But here we ’re all about taking things back to basics – and that does n’t mean anything featuring Windows Vista …
1. Everex Cloudbook
We first glimpsed the Everex Cloudbook at CES .
It ’ll go on sale for around £ 200 and so is directly comparable to our Eee friend .
It ’s based on a VIA reference design , uses its 1.2GHz C7 - M ultra low voltage processor and promises five hours of battery life – significantly more than the Eee PC .
What ’s more , there ’s also 30 GB of internal storage and 512MB of DDR2 ; nice specs there .
Like the initial Eee , it supports Linux .
802.11b/g
Wi -Fi is also on board – but what ’s up with that weird raised screen .
Eee rival mark ( out of five ) : 3
2. MSI Wind
Spotted at CeBIT last week , this newly - seen contender looks beautiful , but Eee fans will surely proclaim it as a clear rip - off of their icon .
Indeed , one of the pics we ’ve seen shows it in resplendent Apple / Eee white .
Let ’s be honest , it ’s also got a pretty crap name .
It will take Intel ’s Atom CPU ( potentially with speeds of up to 1.6GHz ) and could have as much as 1GB of RAM , while reports suggest it will come in 8 - inch and 10 - inch variants .
Trouble is , we have it on good authority that the models at CeBIT were mere dummies , so all the specs are subject to change .
Pricing is expected to be around the £ 225 mark .
Eee rival mark : 5
3. Elonex One
' The UK ’s cheapest laptop , ' says Elonex ’s website .
It 's not wrong .
The One ’s best facet has to be its price – a mere £ 99 .
If you ’ve a long - standing awareness of IT you might be aware of Elonex as a UK - based business PC provider and latterly for its LCD TV - based range of Lumina Media Centers several years back .
Meant for education and designed with UK Government initiatives in mind , the laptop was shown off at this year ’s Education Show which took place in Birmingham at the beginning of the month .
The Linux - based sub -notebook has a 7 - inch display , 802.11b / g wireless , 1GB of memory , four - hour battery life and even an optional rubberised skin .
What more could you want ?
Eee rival mark : 4
4. Packard Bell EasyNote XS
The 7 - inch EasyNote XS can be picked up from your local PC World and made its debut in the autumn .
Trouble is , it 's £ 349 , so we ’re edging into full - blown laptop pricing , if not size .
The EasyNote XS is also pretty odd - looking , with its screen raised off the back of the keyboard like the Everex Cloudbook .
And like the new Cloudbook , it runs a 1.20 GHz VIA C7 - M Processor and packs 30 GB of internal storage .
Hang on , this is all sounding pretty familiar !
It basically is the Everex Cloudbook ; or rather both are based on a VIA platform .
The main difference is that the Packard Bell machine ships with Windows XP Home – just like the forthcoming edition of the Eee PC .
Eee rival mark : 2
5. OLPC XO and Intel Classmate
OK , so these are n’t exactly serious contenders at the moment – they ’re not currently available to consumers , for one thing .
If they were to go on sale tomorrow they would n’t be as much of a hit as the Eee PC though .
Despite the XO ’s sub -£ 200 price point , the lack of competitive specs would see other models win out – it only has 1GB of storage and 256MB of RAM , for example .
Mind you , for sheer ruggedness , it would surely win out .
Eee rival mark : 2
And then there ’s the new Eee PC of course .
You can get the existing 7 - inch model for under £ 200 from PC World now .
And there ’s the new model in the summer which will also feature Intel ’s Atom processor .
Indeed , apart from the screen size it will be extremely similar to the MSI Wind .
As we just mentioned , a version of the new Eee will also ship with XP .
Although you can install the OS yourself on Asus ’ current Eee PC , it ’s bringing that kind of full functionality to these sub-notebooks as standard that will really set the market alight .
Pythagoras , Euler and Fermat may not be nervously twitching in their caskets just yet , but the uniqueness of humankind 's mathematical abilities has taken yet another knock from the animal kingdom .
Fish are able to count to four , according to experiments which involved giving them the option of joining shoals of different sizes .
Their numerical ability is on a par with that of monkeys , dolphins and children aged between six months and 12 months .
" We have provided the first evidence that fish exhibit rudimentary mathematical abilities , " said experimental psychologist Christian Agrillo , of the University of Padova in Italy .
He and his team investigated the behaviour of mosquitofish .
The freshwater species - which is also known as the live - bearing tooth carp - is originally from North America but was introduced into Europe nearly a century ago .
To deduce whether the fish have a head for figures , the team made use of the fact that females who are being harassed by a male will bolt for the largest nearby shoal for cover .
In their experiment , the test fish is in a central tank separated from two side tanks containing shoals of different sizes which it can see .
When harassed it will go towards the larger one , even though it cannot actually join the fish there .
The researchers showed that the fish could distinguish between shoals containing one or two fish , two or three fish and three or four fish .
They could not tell the difference between shoals of four or five .
At larger numbers the difference between the shoals has to be bigger for the fish to make a meaningful choice .
A ratio of 1:2 is high enough , such as the difference between eight and 16 fish in a shoal .
But when the difference is smaller , such as 12 to 16 , the fish do not show a preference .
" We suggest that mosquitofish use two distinct systems for quantity discrimination , " the team wrote in the journal Cognition .
The story is reported today by loveearth.com , BBC Worldwide 's natural history site .
A variety of animals , including pigeons , parrots , raccoons , ferrets , rats , monkeys and apes have been shown to manage a selection of mathematical tasks , including counting , adding or subtracting numbers .
Mostly this requires training by experimenters .
But wild lions use an innate numbering system to handle other approaching lions .
If they hear the roar of one individual they will send two or three females to investigate the stranger .
But if there are two approaching lions they keep their number advantage by sending a welcoming committee of four .
MIAMI 
One of seven indigent men charged with plotting to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago as part of an Islamic jihad was acquitted on Thursday , and a mistrial was declared in the prosecution of the six others after the jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked .
The outcome was a significant defeat for the Bush administration , which had described the case as a major crackdown on homegrown terrorists .
Officials had acknowledged that the defendants , known as the Liberty City Seven for the depressed section of Miami where they frequently gathered in a rundown warehouse , had never acquired weapons or equipment and had posed no immediate threat .
But , the officials said , the case underscored a need for pre-emptive terrorism prosecutions .
In acquitting Lyglenson Lemorin , 32 , a Haitian immigrant who was cast by the prosecution as a junior foot soldier in the group , the jurors were compelled by evidence that suggested he had tried “ to distance himself ” from the others , Jeffrey Agron , the jury foreman , said outside the courthouse .
This week in the Huffington Post , my good friend Marty Kaplan has been documenting the scrambly responses of CNN to the charge that they protected the GOP candidates from difficult questions at the You Tube / CNN debate in a way they clearly did not protect Democratic candidates during their similar debate earlier this year .
CNN has dealt with the charges by trotting out various spokestoads to deny them , to confirm them and then to justify them .
( If you have n't read his piece , check the 12/7/2007 Huffington
Post for the full story with a full complement of updates . )
When one escapes the oxygen - free hilarity of the CNN response , one reflects that a phenomenon of the past seven to twenty - seven years has been infiltration of CNN , PBS , CPB , and other news organizations with bush - or reagan - party flacks who do n't think critically or analytically but only decide moment by moment what sounds least incriminating .
( I try to distinguish between the Constitution - respecting Republican party and the Constitution - defiling bush - and reagan - partisans . )
Their behavior is reminiscent of the irresponsible elementary school student who arrives at school ill prepared .
He asserts that the dog ate his homework until it 's discovered that he did n't even write down what the assignment was , at which point it becomes the teacher 's fault for not reminding him that there was homework .
And besides , they do n't even own a dog , so there 's no way they 'd use that as an excuse -- that would be ridiculous and an obvious lie .
What ?
Are you accusing them of LYING ???
etc .
And a hundred echo machines go forth to sing " dog ate it , teacher did n't assign it , schools failed the student -- the student did n't fail , and besides the dog ate it . "
Or as Al Franken liked to say , " He did n't lend me his platter , I returned the platter in perfect condition , and besides the platter was broken when he loaned it to me . "
The reason these folks are such poor and obvious liars is that they have achieved their positions after a lifetime of toadying instead of a lifetime of professionalism .
For those of us who have worked and struggled and learned the hard way to get the story straight , to tell the truth the first time , and to take our f*cking lumps if it comes to that , these little gems by bushites and reaganites sound like the excuses of children -- cute almost to the point of being amusing -- until one realizes that these children are n't going to grow out of this phase .
They are already in positions of authority and have enough fellow toadies around them to keep them in power no matter how they abuse it .
It would be no challenge for them to start spreading the most vicious lies about any of us , and they would not stop until we were unable to work , unable to pay a mortgage , homeless , hopeless , or dead .
The recent past is scattered with examples of people murdered or at least destroyed as human beings by the news .
This infrastructure lies crumbling under the hideous , fallen - circus - tent kudzuscape of the news like a dead forest awaiting patiently a carelessly tossed cigarette butt .
Just knowing this drains my soul of hope for the future .
( If you 've never traveled in the southeast , there are regions where you can drive for miles and rarely see a living , healthy tree because year after year the kudzu has climbed everything that protrudes from the ground and covered it with netting under whose weight buildings , fenceposts , telephone poles , and trees lean and rot , rust and crumble , and eventually collapse .
It always makes me think of the Soviet ambassador 's words in Dr. Strangelove : " ... a doomsday shroud ... " )
Well , there ’s some semi - good news .
Our courageous National Intelligence Council has just judged [ . pdf ] " with a high degree of confidence " that Iranian authorities had already halted , way back in 2003 , what the NIC inexplicably still characterizes as a covert " nuclear weapons program . "
Some details of that alleged program , obtained from the hard - drive of a laptop computer , allegedly stolen in Iran in 2004 , had been supplied to us a few months later , apparently by the same wonderful folks who had earlier supplied us the " intelligence " on Iraq , obtained by them from " Curveball . "
Now , a cynic , like Ebenezer Scrooge , might be forgiven for wondering who had provided us that " smoking laptop "  containing details of what we now are told were already abandoned activities  and why .
After all , a couple of years ago the Washington Post noted , that the smoking laptop did not even suggest that any chronicled activity was in any way related to  much less constituted  a nuclear weapons program .
According to the Post , the only laptop chronicled activity that was clearly nuclear related was the Green Salt Project .
" In the spring of 2001 , a small design firm opened shop on the outskirts of Tehran to begin work for what appears to have been its only client  the Iranian Republican Guard .
Over the next two years , the staff at Kimeya Madon completed a set of technical drawings for a small uranium - conversion facility , according to four officials who reviewed the documents .
" Several sources with firsthand knowledge of the original documents said the facility , if constructed , would give Iran additional capabilities to produce a substance known as UF4 , or “ green salt , ” an intermediate product in the conversion of uranium to a gas . "
That ’s it ?
For years , now , the neocrazies have been running around in circles of diminishing radii , hysterically demanding that we nuke Iran , all because the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards asked a small Iranian design firm way back in 2001 to produce a set of technical drawings for a small facility to convert Iranian yellowcake  even then all subject to Iran ’s Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency  into uranium - tetrafluoride ?
Well , they do n’t call them " neocrazies " for nuttin .
In 2001 , the Iranians still had under construction  but had already made subject to IAEA Safeguards  a large facility at Esfahan , to convert ( safeguarded ) Iranian yellowcake into ( safeguarded ) Uranium - tetrafluoride and then into ( safeguarded )
Uranium - hexafluoride , to serve as feedstock for the Iranian gas - centrifuge cascades then under construction at the ( safeguarded ) uranium - enrichment pilot plant at Natanz .
The Esfahan facility was completed and commenced initial ( safeguarded ) semi-successful operations in 2003 .
But , in the summer of 2003 Iran began negotiations with the IAEA on an Additional Protocol to Iran ’s basic Safeguards Agreement and in December not only signed the Additional Protocol , but volunteered to immediately adhere to it in advance of its ratification by the Iranian Parliament .
Now , according to the IAEA Statute , even under a basic Safeguards Agreement , the Director - General and his designated inspectors “ shall have access at all times to all places ” in an IAEA member state as necessary “ to account for [ Safeguarded ] source and special fissionable materials ” and “ to determine whether there is compliance with the undertaking against use in furtherance of any military purpose . ”
And , under an Additional Protocol , the authorities of IAEA inspectors are considerably enhanced , to go anywhere  effectively without advance notice  they have good reason to believe they need to go and to interview anyone they have good reason to believe they need to interview .
And when IAEA inspectors do determine that safeguarded materials have been used “ in furtherance of any military purpose , ” they “ shall ” report such “ non-compliance ” to the Director - General , who “ shall ” thereupon transmit the report to the Board of Governors , the UN General Assembly and to the UN Security Council .
As of this writing , IAEA inspectors have made no such report to ElBaradei about Iran .
In fact , ElBaradei consistently reports to the Board that “ all the declared nuclear material in Iran has been accounted for , and therefore such material is not diverted to prohibited activities . ”
ElBaradei says he frequently asks himself these questions ; “ Have we seen any proof of a weapons program ?
Have we seen undeclared [ uranium ] enrichment ? ”
ElBaradei ’s answer , then and now , is “ There is none of that . ”
In November 2004 , Iran had entered into the Paris Agreement with the French - Brits - Germans , with the explicit expectation that the French - Brits - Germans would " provide [ Iran ] firm guarantees on nuclear , technological and economic cooperation and firm commitments [ to Iran ] on security issues . "
On 23 March 2005 , the Iranians confidentially offered to give - up , indefinitely , many of those " inalienable " rights , but thanks to " diplomatic " intervention by Bush - Cheney meanies , the French - Brits - Germans were not even allowed to acknowledge the Iranian confidential offer , much less make a corresponding offer of " security guarantees " against Bush - Cheney attacks  or threats of attacks  on Iran , using nukes should Bush - Cheney deem it necessary .
So , on 1 August 2005 , Iran informed [ .pdf ] the IAEA General Conference that the French - Brits - Germans had failed to negotiate in good faith and so the Iranians were breaking off the negotiations .
Furthermore , the Iranian Parliament had decided to not ratify the Additional Protocol and had basically directed the Iranian Atomic Energy Agency to cease voluntarily complying with it .
Accordingly , Iran announced it was resuming [ subject to IAEA safeguards ] some of the uranium - enrichment related activities  including those uranium - conversion activities at Esfahan  it had voluntarily suspended almost two years earlier .
Now , how ’s that for a resounding triumph by the Bush - Cheney diplomatic weenies ?
So , someone in possession of the " smoking laptop " was hurriedly rushed to Vienna to share some of the mind - boggling " intelligence " on it with Director - General Mohamed ElBaradei and his IAEA Secretariat experts .
The NIC had just issued a National Intelligence Estimate  largely based , as we now know , on that mind - boggling " intelligence "  that assessed " with high confidence that Iran currently is determined to develop nuclear weapons . "
But the IAEA experts were not boggled , dismissing most of the " intelligence " as unconvincing and , in any case , irrelevant .
Far from immediately demanding the Iranians explain the smoking laptop " intelligence , " as of this writing ElBaradei has not even shared it with them .
So , in the summer of 2005 , the Bush - Cheney diplomatic weenies proceeded to launch their so - far largely successful campaign to corrupt , first , the IAEA Board , and then the Security Council , getting them to require Iran  in violation of the IAEA Statute , the NPT and the UN Charter  to give - up all inalienable rights guaranteed them by the IAEA Statute , the NPT , and the UN Charter .
Why is the news arising from the courageous issuance by the NIC of the 2007 NIE on Iran only semi-good ?
Well , on the basis of " intelligence " that may well turn out to be bogus about Iranian activities that were in no sense illegal or prohibited , Bush - Cheney diplomatic weenies have inflicted irreparable  perhaps fatal  damage to the international regime whose first duty was to facilitate the fullest possible transfer of the benefits of nuclear energy to all members of the United Nations , and whose collateral duty was to ensure " to the extent possible , " that no diversion took place of certain proscribed materials to a military purpose .
August 2006 The Vietnam Syndrome
By JAMES NACHTWEY / VII PHOTO VII derives its name from the number of founding photo - journalists who , in September 2001 , formed this collectively owned agency .
Designed from the outset to be an efficient , technologically enabled distribution hub for some of the world 's finest photojournalism , VII has been responsible for creating and relaying to the world many of the images that define the turbulent opening years of the 21st century .
Alexandra Boulat , Ron Haviv , Gary Knight , Antonin Kratochvil , Christopher Morris , James Nachtwey and John Stanmeyer were joined in 2002 by Lauren Greenfield and in 2004 by Joachim Ladefoged .
Eugene Richards joined in April 2006 .
Together they document conflict - environmental , social and political , both violent and non-violent - to produce an unflinching record of the injustices created and experienced by people caught up in the events they describe .
On September 9th 2001 , VII announced its formation .
On the following night , covering for the missed return flight of a colleague , James Nachtwey arrived at his Manhattan apartment close to the World Trade Center .
The next morning , he photographed some of the most haunting pictures of the collapse of the towers , at the same time eloquently conveying the destruction of a way of life .
While the stark realities of the battlefield loom large , VII turns its gaze with equal intensity to more subtle forms of conflict and documenting the changes and development of society and culture worldwide .
The work of Lauren Greenfield , particularly in her social documentary of youth culture and gender identity , adds a further perspective and depth to the work of the agency
But this is not merely artfully captured , neutral observation ; nor is it the doctrinaire elaboration of a political or social position .
Each photographer is inspired by an array of often very different motivations , and it is from this breadth of reference that the agency draws its originality and strength .
What unites VII 's work is a sense that , in the act of communication at the very least , all is not lost ; the seeds of hope and resolution inform even the darkest records of inhumanity ; reparation is always possible ; despair is never absolute .

The economy lost 17,000 jobs in January , the Labor Department reported on Friday , the first monthly decline in four years and the most striking evidence yet that the United States may be slipping into a recession .
Until now , the labor market had been growing at a steady if softening pace .
Many economists pointed to expanding payrolls as the final holdout in a sluggish economy weighed down by trouble on Wall Street , the collapse of the housing bubble , and a cascade of credit problems linked to soured subprime mortgages .
But the January employment report cast the job market in a startlingly darker light .
Jobs disappeared across a broad spectrum of professions , with the steepest losses coming in the manufacturing , construction and goods - producing industries .
Adding to the gloom , the government said that the level of employment was sharply lower in December than it had originally estimated .
The new figure was based on an annual review of every job covered by unemployment insurance .

純国産のソーシャルアドレス帳「 Ripplex 」のすごいところ
mixiやGmail 、Windows Messenger、携帯メール、私たちは日々かなりの数のコミュニケーションツールを使いこなしている。電話やファクシミリなどを含めると、多くの人は10以上のコミュニケーションツールを使っていることになるだろう。その時々に応じて最適な連絡方法が選べるのは便利だが、誰にどのようにして連絡を取ればいいのか混乱することも多い。2007年12月末に1.0をリリースしたアドレス帳ツール「
Ripplex 」は“ 自ら育つ”をキーワードにコミュニケーションツールの問題を解決しようとしている。
関連記事：あるテクノロジ・ベンチャーの肖像―リプレックスは「穴を掘る」
RipplexはmixiのIDや複数の電子メールアドレス、携帯電話番号、携帯メールアドレスなどを管理できるアドレス帳ツール。複数のPC間で情報を同期したり、既存の環境からID情報をインポートするなどの機能を備える。その程度の機能ならほかのツールでも実現しているが、Ripplexがすごいのは、アドレス帳が自ら育つことだ。
登録ユーザーの情報と利用可能なコミュニケーションツールを表示する（画像はRipplexサイトから、以下同）
自ら育つとはどういうことか。それはユーザーAがユーザーBの情報をRipplexに登録すると、ユーザーBがすでにRipplexを利用している場合、自動でAとBの情報がリンクされ、Aのアドレス帳に不足している情報が補われるということだ。つまり、ユーザーAがBの電子メールアドレスだけを入力すると、mixi IDや電話番号などが自動で補われる。一般のSNSのようにユーザーAはBを検索する必要はない。Bの情報の一部を入力するだけで、ほかの情報が補完される。
もちろん、ユーザーAがBの情報の一部を入力しても自動ですべての情報が入力されるわけではない。Bが「Aに対してこれらの情報を開示する」と認めた場合だけだ。RipplexはAとBがすでに知り合いでお互いの何らかの連絡先を知っていることが前提だ。ユーザーAがBの電子メールアドレスしか知らなくても、Bが許可すれば携帯電話番号やmixi IDが開示され、新しい手段で連絡を取り合うことができるようになる。
知り合いだけから探してもらえる
ユーザーごとに開示する自分の情報を設定できる
知り合いを探すということはSNSでも一般的に行われているが、そのプロセスは非常に危うい状況になっている。SNSでユーザーAがBを検索で見つけることができるということは、世界中のSNSユーザーがBを見つけられるということを意味する。ユーザーはBはそれを嫌って検索結果に出にくいようなプロフィールにしてしまう。これではSNSはネットワークの意味を成さなくなる。Ripplexはこの問題の解決をSNS外で実現するといえる。リプレックス代表取締役
CEOの直野典彦氏はRipplexの特徴を「自分の情報を公開せずに、すでに知っている人からだけ探してもらえる」と説明する。
どういうことか 。Ripplexはユーザーの個人情報、プロフィール情報をRipplexのサーバに登録しない。登録するのは、自分の情報と探してもらいたい人の情報を組み合わせた非可逆変換のハッシュ値のみだ。ユーザーBにだけ自分の情報をアドレス帳登録してもらいたいと考えているユーザーAの場合は、A＋Bのハッシュ値をサーバに登録する。実際にユーザーBがAの情報の探す場合は、同様にA＋Bのハッシュ値をサーバに投げて検索する。これでAとBの情報をサーバ上でつなげることができる。その後、ユーザーAはサーバから通知を受けて、Bに開示する情報を決定する。
面白いのは、ユーザーAとBはお互いの複数の情報をたすきがけしたハッシュ値をサーバに登録するということだ。つまり、AのメールアドレスとBのメールアドレス、AのメールアドレスとBの携帯電話番号、AのメールアドレスとBのmixi IDなどと、お互いの情報をマトリックスで組み合わせたハッシュ値を作る。リプレックスはこの技術を「PMM検索」（プロファイル・マトリックス・マッチング検索）と呼んでいる。
PMM 検索を使うことで、1つの情報から複数の情報を引っ張ってくることができる。複数の情報でマトリックスを作るため、ユーザーA、B以外のユーザーによるなりすましが難しくなり、自分の情報を知っているユーザーにだけ探してもらうことが可能になる。同姓同名のほかのユーザーからの登録もできるだけ排除可能だ。このPMM検索によって「明示的にユーザーが検索する必要はなくなり、アドレス帳が自ら育つ」（直野氏）ことが可能になる。
ローカルで稼働し個人情報をサーバに置かない
これまで触れなかったが、RipplexはWindows とMacで動作するクライアントアプリケーションだ。Webサービスではなく、ローカルで動作するクライアントアプリケーションとしたことで、ユーザーは自らの個人情報をネット上に置く必要がなくなる。Ripplexサーバにクライアントから送信されるのは非可逆なハッシュ値のみ。ローカルで動作し、Ripplexサーバ自体は個人情報を持たないということはRipplexの今後にとって大きな意味を持つ。
Ripplexが目指しているのは単体のアドレス帳ツールではない。SNSなどすでにあるさまざまなサービスのユーザー同士を接続するための結束点だ。ユーザーAがユーザーBの情報をRipplexに登録した際、ユーザーBがSkypeを使っていることに気付き、自分も使ってみようとする ―― Ripplexはこのように知り合いや友達同士のコミュニケーション手段を増やすソーシャルツールとしての可能性を秘めている。
ローカルで稼働しサーバ上に個人情報を持たないことで、Ripplexは存在感を薄くして自由に異なるサービス同士を接続することができるようになる。リプレックスはWebサイトで「Ripplexは、SNSと競合するものではなく、役割が全く異なります。SNSとRipplexの組み合わせで、おもしろい使い方が出てくるはずです」と記載している。

The recommendations could see an increase in rape convictions
Legal experts have agreed on a list of situations where consent cannot have been given , including when the victim is too heavily intoxicated .
The review , which was commissioned by the Scottish Government , also suggested that male rape be recognised by law .
The measures aim to improve conviction rates for the offence .
The government , which plans to bring forward a parliamentary bill next year , has promised to carry out a consultation on the review 's recommendations .
CASES WHICH PROMPTED THE REVIEW OF RAPE LAW
Rape tourist wins freedom appeal Judge dismisses rape charge
Along with defining consent as a " free agreement " , the commission has put forward a list of scenarios where permission has not been given .
It also proposed new offences of sexual assault and sexual coercion , but decided against dropping the need for corroboration in rape cases .
The review follows claims that as few as one in eight victims actually report sex attacks , while recent figures show that 4 % of alleged rapes which are reported to the police lead to a conviction .
Professor Gerry Maher , the lead commissioner on the project , said there was no one explanation for the low conviction rate .
But he claimed that offering a legal definition of consent will help override the preconceptions of jurors .
Conviction rates
He added : " We hope that by the law setting out clearly what is and what is not consent , then a jury could not bring their own attitudes about consenting sexual behaviour to the decision making .
" They would have to apply the law as it will become .
" If it is the case that one of the factors that explains conviction rates is social attitudes , then if you change social attitudes then clearly that would have an impact on conviction rates . "
The " non-exhaustive " list put forward by the report defining when consent has not been given contains seven different situations .
Today 's report brings us a significant step closer to achieving what I hope will be widely - welcomed reforms to benefit both the victims of sexual crimes
Kenny MacAskill
Justice secretary
These include when a person is unconscious or asleep , when they agreed under threat of violence , are held captive or deceived about what is happening .
Permission is also not given when a person agrees because the accused impersonated someone known by the victim or when agreement was made by a third party .
It also includes when a person has taken too much alcohol or drugs to be capable of consenting , unless permission was given earlier .
Prof Maher stressed the need for the law to recognise equally male and female victims of rape and sexual assault .
Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill acknowledged there had been considerable public , professional and academic concern that the current law on rape was unsatisfactory .
He said a consultation would be held on the commission 's findings and that a bill would be brought forward by next May .
Mr MacAskill said : " Today 's report brings us a significant step closer to achieving what I hope will be widely - welcomed reforms to benefit both the victims of sexual crimes - some of society 's most vulnerable individuals - and society as a whole . "

Mike Huckabee is not happy .
An email sent to reporters from his campaign :
NEWS RELEASE : MIKE HUCKABEE’S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DUBIOUS WASHINGTON STATE GOP CAUCUSES
Richmond , VA — The Huckabee Presidential Campaign will be exploring all available legal options regarding the dubious final results for the state of Washington State Republican precinct caucuses , it was announced today .
Campaign Chairman Ed Rollins issued the following statement :
“ The Huckabee campaign is deeply disturbed by the obvious irregularities in the Washington State Republican precinct caucuses .
It is very unfortunate that the Washington State Party Chairman , Luke Esser , chose to call the race for John McCain after only 87 percent of the vote was counted .
According to CNN , the difference between Senator McCain and Governor Huckabee is a mere 242 votes , out of more than 12,000 votes counted - with another 1500 or so votes , apparently , not counted .
That is an outrage .
“ In other words , more than one in eight Evergreen State Republicans have been disenfranchised by the actions of their own party .
This was an error in judgment by Mr. Esser .
It was Mr. Esser ’s duty to oversee a fair vote - count process .
Washington Republicans know , from bitter experience in the 2004 gubernatorial election , the terrible results that can come from bad ballot - counting .
“ Frankly , I am disappointed in the way that Mr. Esser has handled this urgent matter .
So I call upon Mr. Esser and his colleagues to cooperate fully with the Huckabee campaign - and all Republicans , everywhere , who care about honest and transparent vote - counting - to make sure that every vote is counted and that all Republicans in Washington have the chance to make their votes count .
Attempts by our campaign to contact Mr. Esser have been unsuccessful .
Our lawyers will be on the ground in Washington State soon , and we look forward to sitting down with Mr. Esser to evaluate this process , to see why the count took so long , and why the vote - counting was stopped prematurely .
“ It would be a disservice to every voter in Washington State to not pursue a full accounting of all votes cast .
“ This is not about Mike Huckabee .
This is not about Senator John McCain .
This is about the failings of the Washington State Republican Party .
All Republicans should unite to demand an honest accounting of the votes , so that Republicans can have full confidence in the results , and full confidence in the eventual Republican nominee .
As I said , we are prepared to go to court , and we are also prepared to take our case all the way to the Republican National Convention in September .
“ Our cause is just .
We must reemphasize the sacred American principle that all ballots be counted in a free , fair , and transparent manner . ”
Update : Huckabee still on the warpath , compares GOP vote - counting tactics in WA to “ old Soviet Union . ”

More than 800 people surged into the Knights of Columbus Hall in Hempstead , Texas , filling the building to capacity
Waller County officials are calling for the Texas Department of Transportation to hold another public meeting in their county on a proposed “ superhighway , ” after a Jan. 22 meeting was so packed that some people could n’t squeeze into the meeting hall .
TxDOT held a public meeting in Hempstead to gather public input on the Trans Texas Corridor ’s proposed I - 69 leg which could bring it through Waller and Austin counties , and small portion of Washington County .
More than 800 people surged into the Knights of Columbus Hall in Hempstead .
Officials said the hall is located on a narrow , dead end road that was choked with vehicles that had no place to park .
Police were forced to block off access to Mack Washington Street , resulting in some attendees having to park and walk over a quarter mile .
Many others went home , unable to find parking on the rain saturated shoulders of FM 1488 .
Among those witnessing the crowded conditions was state Sen.
Glenn Hegar , whose district includes Washington , Austin and Waller counties .
“ I was coming back through Hempstead from Brenham that evening after attending a chamber banquet and I personally realized the overcrowding and the inability of citizens to attend the meeting at the KC Hall , ” Hegar said .
Hegar was among those calling on TxDOT to hold an additional “ town hall ” meeting , along with state Rep. John Zerwas and Waller County Judge Owen Ralston .
They were urged to seek an additional hearing by Citizens for a Better Waller County .
All three officials submitted written requests to TxDoT .
In addition , officials also requested that one of the two environmental public meetings on the project scheduled for Feb. 27 be rescheduled to accommodate citizens who many not be able to attend either one .
Both are scheduled on the same day but in different locations .
Gov. Rick Perry first proposed the TTC six years ago .
If completed as much as 50 years from now , it would roughly parallel interstate highways with up to a quarter - mile - wide stretch of toll roads , rail lines , pipelines and utility lines .
Cost of the project has been estimated at approaching $ 200 billion , and at 4,000 miles or so it would be the biggest construction project ever in Texas .
Thousands of people have turned out for a series of public meetings , including a large crowd last Monday in Bellville .
The Texas Transportation Commission ’s plan outlines 4,000 miles of superhighway corridors that crisscross the state .
Four of those corridors have been identified as “ priority corridors ” to be constructed first , including the I - 69 portion .

Ms Jones dedicated much of her life to preserving the Eyak language
Marie Smith Jones was a champion of indigenous rights and conservation .
She died at her home in Anchorage .
She helped the University of Alaska compile an Eyak dictionary , so that future generations would have the chance to resurrect it .
Nearly 20 other native Alaskan languages are at risk of disappearing .
Ms Jones is described by her family as a tiny chain smoking woman who was fiercely independent , says the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles .
" To the best of our knowledge , she was the last full - blooded Eyak alive , " her daughter Bernice Galloway told the Associated Press news agency .
" She was a woman who faced incredible adversity in her life and overcame it .
She was about as tenacious as you can get . "
She believed passionately in preserving the Eyak language and wanted a written record of it to be kept so for future generations , our correspondent adds .
' Tragic mantle '
The Eyak ancestral homeland runs along almost 500 km ( 300 miles ) of the Gulf of Alaska .
She was very much alone as the last speaker of Eyak
Michael Krauss
University of Alaska Fairbanks professor
With her husband , a white Oregon fisherman , Ms Jones had nine children , seven of whom are still alive .
But none of them learned Eyak because they grew up at a time when it was considered wrong to speak anything but English , her daughter said .
According to Michael Krauss , a linguist and professor with whom she worked , " she was very much alone as the last speaker of Eyak " for the last 15 years .
" She understood as only someone in her unique position could , what it meant to be the last of her kind , " Mr Krauss said .
" It 's the first , but probably not the last , at the rate things are going , of the Alaska Native languages to go extinct .
She understood what was at stake and its significance , and bore that tragic mantle with grace and dignity . "
Obamamania , meet Hulkamania
Dem candidate scores Hulk Hogan support
Mike Huckabee has Chuck Norris and Ric Flair .
John McCain has Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger .
And now Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has a prominent muscle - bound supporter all his own .
Former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan declared his support for the junior Illinois senator on Jimmy Kimmel Live Thursday night .
" Nobody 's even asked me my opinion until now , " Hogan lamented when Kimmel wanted to know who Hulkamania 's momentum would be behind in the coming election .
" If I had to step out , and say who I really believe in  that catches my ear , that makes sense , that really can make a change  I would say Obama .
Everybody plays this card  the bad guy card , you know the dirty politics thing , talk about the way people dress , act and look  and , hes the choice .
He seems like the real deal , you know . 
Satire blog Wonkette decried the fact that non-political celebrities are being asked for presidential campaign endorsements :
" Scientists believe that the corpses of our Founding Fathers are weeping real tears in their graves right now . "
This video is from ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live , broadcast January 30 , 2008 .
Imagine my surprise , then , when I heard people saying that Obama was n't " substantive " .
It was exactly like my experience in 2004 when , after hearing Wes Clark for the first time , I went and looked up his positions on a whole host of issues of concern to me , and only then started reading media accounts of him in which I " learned " that no one knew what his positions were .
After the debacle that is the last 7 years , the duty is upon the Democrats to be something different .
I 've been wildly critical of their sameness ( remember " Dems to the Net : Go to hell " which earned me lots of friends in the Democratic party ) .
I would give my left arm to be able to celebrate their difference .
This man , Mr. Obama , would be that difference .
He has as much support as I can give . "
But the big part of this is a commitment to making data about the government ( as well as government data ) publicly available in standard machine readable formats .
The promise is n't just the naive promise that government websites will work better and reveal more .
It is the really powerful promise to feed the data necessary for the Sunlights and the Maplights of the world to make government work better .
Atomize ( or RSS - ify ) government data ( votes , contributions , Members of Congress 's calendars ) and you enable the rest of us to make clear the economy of influence that is Washington .
I came to Obama by an unusual route : as I explained here , I follow some issues pretty closely , and over and over again , Barack Obama kept popping up , doing really good substantive things .
There he was , working for nuclear non-proliferation and securing loose stockpiles of conventional weapons , like shoulder - fired missiles .
There he was again , passing what the Washington Post called " the strongest ethics legislation to emerge from Congress yet " -- though not as strong as Obama would have liked .
Look -- he 's over there , passing a bill that created a searchable database of recipients of federal contracts and grants , proposing legislation on avian flu back when most people had n't even heard of it , working to make sure that soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were screened for traumatic brain injury and to prevent homelessness among veterans , successfully fighting a proposal by the VA to reexamine all PTSD cases in which full benefits had been awarded , working to ban no -bid contracts in Katrina reconstruction , and introducing legislation to criminalize deceptive political tactics and voter intimidation .
And there he was again , introducing a tech plan of which Lawrence Lessig wrote :
I , too , endorse Obama for President , to no one 's surprise .
Since Katherine has already written a lot of what I would have wanted to say about his rhetoric , and since I 've already talked about one of my most important reasons for supporting him , namely the fact that he got Iraq right from the outset , I 'll say something about the peculiar idea that Barack Obama is all style and no substance .
... by the number of people who said : well , all this bipartisanship stuff sounds very nice , but how do we know it actually works ?
Is n't this just happy talk that will evaporate in the face of reality ?
Or , alternately : does n't this sort of thing involve selling our souls to our supposed partners in compromise ?
Curiously , Obama has an actual legislative record , and so it is possible for us to see both how he approaches bipartisan cooperation and what results it yields .
And it turns out that Obama does achieve results by working with Republicans , and does n't tend to compromise on core principles .
Last year , I considered some of his bipartisan initiatives in the Senate -- notably on nonproliferation and ethics reform -- and concluded that what Obama actually does has nothing to do with the sort of bipartisanship that people rightly object to :
" According to me , bad bipartisanship is the kind practiced by Joe Lieberman .
Bad bipartisans are so eager to establish credentials for moderation and reasonableness that they go out of their way to criticize their ( supposed ) ideological allies and praise their ( supposed ) opponents .
They also compromise on principle , and when their opponents do n't reciprocate , they compromise some more , until over time their positions become indistinguishable from those on the other side .
This is n't what Obama does .
Obama tries to find people , both Democrats and Republicans , who actually care about a particular issue enough to try to get the policy right , and then he works with them .
This does not involve compromising on principle .
It does , however , involve preferring getting legislation passed to having a spectacular battle .
( This is especially true when one is in the minority party , especially in this Senate : the chances that Obama 's bills will actually become law increase dramatically when he has Republican co-sponsors . ) "
Consider a different example :
" Consider a bill into which Obama clearly put his heart and soul .
The problem he wanted to address was that too many confessions , rather than being voluntary , were coerced -- by beating the daylights out of the accused .
Obama proposed requiring that interrogations and confessions be videotaped .
This seemed likely to stop the beatings , but the bill itself aroused immediate opposition .
There were Republicans who were automatically tough on crime and Democrats who feared being thought soft on crime .
There were death penalty abolitionists , some of whom worried that Obama 's bill , by preventing the execution of innocents , would deprive them of their best argument .
Vigorous opposition came from the police , too many of whom had become accustomed to using muscle to " solve " crimes .
And the incoming governor , Rod Blagojevich , announced that he was against it .
Obama had his work cut out for him .
He responded with an all - out campaign of cajolery .
It had not been easy for a Harvard man to become a regular guy to his colleagues .
Obama had managed to do so by playing basketball and poker with them and , most of all , by listening to their concerns .
Even Republicans came to respect him .
One Republican state senator , Kirk Dillard , has said that " Barack had a way both intellectually and in demeanor that defused skeptics . "
The police proved to be Obama 's toughest opponent .
Legislators tend to quail when cops say things like , " This means we wo n't be able to protect your children . "
The police tried to limit the videotaping to confessions , but Obama , knowing that the beatings were most likely to occur during questioning , fought -- successfully -- to keep interrogations included in the required videotaping .
By showing officers that he shared many of their concerns , even going so far as to help pass other legislation they wanted , he was able to quiet the fears of many .
Obama proved persuasive enough that the bill passed both houses of the legislature , the Senate by an incredible 35 to 0 .
Then he talked Blagojevich into signing the bill , making Illinois the first state to require such videotaping . "
Getting legislation like this passed is a real achievement .
Getting it passed unanimously is nothing short of astonishing .
Mark Kleiman , who knows this stuff extremely well , put it best :
" 1. Obama was completely right , and on an issue directly relevant to the more recent debates about torture .
Taping interrogations is an issue that really only has one legitimate side , since there 's no reason to think it prevents any true confessions , while it certainly prevents false confessions ( over and above the legal and moral reasons for disapproving of police use of " enhanced interrogation methods " ) .
2 . Pursuing it had very little political payoff , as evidenced by the fact that Obama has not ( as far as I know ) so much as mentioned this on the campaign .
Standing up for the rights of accused criminals in a contemporary American legislature requires brass balls .
3 . Getting it through required both courage and skill .
The notion that Obama is " too nice " to get things done can hardly survive this story : he wo n't face tougher or less scrupulous political opponents than the self - proclaimed forces of law and order .
Yes , in this case the change was helpful to the cause of crime control , since every innocent person imprisoned displaces a guilty person .
But that did n't make the politics of it any easier . "
***
Similarly , people often wonder whether Obama 's call for a new kind of politics is just empty words .
Here again , I think he has a real record to point to .
He has consistently worked for ethics reform .
In Illinois , where he helped pass what the WaPo called " the most ambitious campaign reform in nearly 25 years , making Illinois one of the best in the nation on campaign finance disclosure . "
In the US Senate , he was the Democrats ' point man on ethics , and was deeply involved in the ethics legislation passed this year .
He did n't get all he wanted -- for instance , he and Russ Feingold could n't get a bill establishing an Office of Public Integrity to deal with Congressional scandals .
But he accomplished a lot , and wants to accomplish more .
Moreover , he is very interested in open government .
The searchable database of government grant and contract recipients that I mentioned above is part of that .
But Obama 's proposals ( pdf ) go further .
For instance , consider these proposals :
* Centralize Ethics and Lobbying Information for Voters : Obama will create a centralized Internet database of lobbying reports , ethics records , and campaign finance filings in a searchable , sortable and downloadable format .
* Create a Public “ Contracts and Influence ” Database : As president , Obama will create a " contracts and influence " database that will disclose how much federal contractors spend on lobbying , and what contracts they are getting and how well they complete them .
* Expose Special Interest Tax Breaks to Public Scrutiny : Barack Obama will ensure that any tax breaks for corporate recipients — or tax earmarks — are also publicly available on the Internet in an easily searchable format .
* End Abuse of No-Bid Contracts : Barack Obama will end abuse of no - bid contracts by requiring that nearly all contract orders over $ 25,000 be competitively awarded .
* Sunlight Before Signing :
Too often bills are rushed through Congress and to the president before the public has the opportunity to review them .
As president , Obama will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House website for five days .
* Make White House Communications Public : Obama will amend executive orders to ensure that communications about regulatory policymaking between persons outside government and all White House staff are disclosed to the public .
* Conduct Regulatory Agency Business in Public : Obama will require his appointees who lead the executive branch departments and rulemaking agencies to conduct the significant business of the agency in public , so that any citizen can see in person or watch on the Internet these debates .
These are all proposals designed to allow public scrutiny of the business of government .
As I read it , one of Obama 's goals in introducing them is to permanently alter the incentives politicians have .
As long as legislators did not have to disclose their earmarks , there was no way of finding out that the person who stuck a favor for an obscure casino in one state into an appropriations bill was from another state entirely .
There was therefore no way for that person 's constituents to wonder why s/he was expending political capital on people outside the district , and no way for reporters to see just who was doing that casino favors .
Once legislators have to own up to their earmarks , however , that changes .
It wo n't make abuse go away , of course , but it does make it a lot easier for people to notice and object to the fact that their representatives are doing inexplicable favors for people they have no obvious reason for caring about .
Likewise , if all bills had to be posted to the internet five days before they were voted on signed ( oops ) , it would be much , much more difficult for Congress to sneak some appalling provision through in the dead of night .
If all contracts over $ 25,000 had to be competitively bid , certain sorts of corruption would be a lot more difficult to carry out .
And if there were a database of tax breaks and tax earmarks , not to mention a database of lobbyists , it would , again , be much , much easier to track who was doing favors for whom , and why .
( And I have n't even started on Obama 's proposals ( pdf , p. 5 ) to strengthen FOIA : " Barack Obama would restore the tradition of free information by issuing an Executive Order that information should be released unless an agency reasonably foresees harm to a protected interest . " )
I think of these proposals , collectively , as a means of empowering journalists , bloggers , and random citizens to discover corruption and the abuse of power , and to bring the power of shame to bear on politicians who practice it .
This clearly is n't all that Obama means when he talks about changing the way politics is practiced in this country .
But it 's part of it .
And I think it 's pretty powerful .
***
I sometimes wonder why , exactly , people go on saying all this stuff about Obama lacking substance .
Sometimes , I suspect it 's just laziness , as in the case of this dKos story in which mcjoan , who is usually much better than this , lists a whole lot of questions she wishes the candidates would answer , apparently unaware that Obama ( and , for all I know , Clinton ) , has already answered most of them .
I suspect , though , that part of it might be the assumption that idealism is necessarily woolly and misty - eyed and all about singing Kumbaya , while realism is necessarily cynical and disillusioned .
I have never believed this .
There are certainly hard - bitten , cynical people who do n't think particularly clearly about the world ( Dick Cheney leaps to mind . )
More to the point , I can't see any reason why there should n't also be people who are both genuinely idealistic and hardheaded at the same time .
I suspect Obama is one of them .
I do not for a moment imagine that he is perfect .
( Cough , clean coal technology , cough cough . )
But I do think that he's one of the best candidates I can remember , and that 's good enough for me .
News
After spending a little while poking at the GNU runtime , I came to two conclusions :
It was at least twice as complicated as it needed to be .
GNU coding style really hurts my eyes .
I 've spent a little while thinking about what I want from a runtime .
One of my recent projects has been writing a Smalltalk JIT that targets the GNU runtime ( still quite work - in - progress ) and so I know the GNU runtime can support Smalltalk as well as Objective - C. Quentin , meanwhile , has been working on the Io bridge .
While this works , it is a bit ugly because the Io object model does n't really mesh well with the Smalltalk object model that the GNU runtime uses .
More on this later .
Beyond better being able to support
Io , I read a few interesting papers recently .
The first was on Polymorphic Inline Caching .
This is quite a neat idea , and allows you to eliminate the cost of dynamic method lookups in a number of cases .
Unfortunately , this is quite hard to get right .
Consider the simple Objective - C line :
[ object message ] ;
With the Apple runtime , this will be translated roughly into something like this :
objc_msgSend(object , @selector ( message ) ) ;
I 'm cheating a bit here , and skimming over how the @selector ( ) directive is expanded .
In contrast , the GNU runtime does this :
IMP method = objc_msg_lookup( object , @selector ( message ) ) ; method ( object , @selector ( message ) ) ;
This is quite nice , since it means that a small compiler change is all that 's needed to cache the method .
We could replace this with something like this :
static IMP cached_method = NULL ; static Class cached_class = Nil ; if ( cached_class != object ->isa ) { cached_method = objc_msg_lookup( object , @selector ( message ) ) ; } cached_method ( object , @selector ( message ) ) ;
Now you only need to bother with the ( expensive ) method lookup if you reach this bit of code with two different object types .
There are a lot of places in code where you will get the same kind of object all of the time , and this can give a huge speed boost .
In other cases , you get a number of different ones and this is where polymorphic inline caching comes in .
Rather than keeping a single ( class , method ) pair cached , you keep a few .
Profiling can determine the optimal size for this cache relatively easily .
Nice and easy ?
Well , there 's a catch .
Objective - C is a dynamic language .
You can load bundles which will replace methods at runtime and languages like
Io allow even different objects to have different methods .
This means that you need to check that the cache is valid before you use it .
A problem .
This , and the difficulty in supporting Objective - C 2.0 on the GNU runtime caused me to write a new one from scratch .
This took just under 48 hours ( after which I ate and went out to a well - earned salsa class ) .
What 's new ?
First , inline caching can now be done safely .
Rather than looking up methods , the runtime looks up slots .
The slot contains ( among other things ) an IMP and a version .
How does the version help ?
Consider two classes , A and B . A inherits from B , which implements a - foo method .
Somewhere in my code , I call this method on an instance of A and cache the result .
Two things can cause this cache to become invalid :
B's implementation of the method being modified / replaced .
A having an implementation of the method added .
The first case Just Works ™ since a pointer to the the slot ( which contains a pointer to the method ) is cached .
You can modify the method without any problems ( great for debuggers and runtime optimisations ) .
The second case is more tricky .
When you add a method to A , it first performs a lookup on the selector .
If this returns a non-NULL slot , then the version of the located slot is incremented .
Any time you cache a slot , you should also cache the version ; if there is a version mismatch with the cached slot then you need to perform the lookup again .
The slots also contain an optional offset .
This can be used to implement very fast set / get methods .
A lot of the time you wrap instance variables up in set / get methods to insulate users of the code from changes to the instance variable layout .
This comes with a speed penalty .
I can't make this go away completely , but the new runtime allows you to avoid the method call and just access the ivar directly , while maintaining the dynamic lookup .
This can make things like KVO faster , since you can do direct ivar access while there are no observers and then switch to indirect access when there are some .
I said the new runtime was simpler ( no exaggeration ; it 's roughly 10 % of the code size of the GNU runtime ) .
That 's partly because it works in a slightly different way to other Objective - C runtimes .
While the GNU runtime provides the functionality required to implement Smalltalk in C , the new one provides the functionality required to implement Self in C , and then implements Smalltalk in Self ( which is very easy ) .
Every object has ( or , rather , can have ) its own dispatch table and its own lookup function .
Classes really are just objects .
Anything you do with classes , you can also do with objects ; for example you can add a method to a single object at runtime ( say hello to closures , prototypes , and all of the things Io and Lisp programmers have been mocking you for having to do without ) .
The class model contains a nod to that used by Animorphic Smalltalk .
This used mixins as a base type .
That 's effectively what I 'm doing although they 're called classes so as not to scare off the old Objective - C programmers .
Classes can be composed as mixins are , which is how concrete protocols are supported ( the only difference between a concrete protocol and a mixin is that the compiler does type checking for a concrete protocol .
From the perspective of the runtime they are the same ) .
Oh , and every object has an associated recursive mutex , so @synchronized can now be generated easily .
To get an idea of how the runtime is used , take a look at example.c , which contains some simple example Objective - C code in comments and the equivalent code the compiler should be producing .
I 'd love to see this supported in LLVM , so anyone familiar with that codebase who feels like lending a hand please let me know .
You can also find more information in the release announcement email , including a more detailed overview and the API docs .
None of the interfaces are set in stone yet , so any suggestions are welcome .
You can grab a copy of the code by doing :

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Sony Pictures
Home Entertainment is targeting April 8 as the date it will release its first batch of Blu-ray Disc titles that can be connected to the Internet for more bonus materials and features .
The musical spoof “ Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story ” and the Arnold Schwarzenegger sci- fi thriller “ The 6th Day ” will be the studio ’s first two BD - Live titles .
Their release coincides with the launch of a new software update for Sony ’s PlayStation 3 that makes the game console the first Blu-ray player with Internet connectivity , an ability known as “ Profile 2.0 . ”
Ultimately , all Blu-ray players will be Profile 2.0 .
When the format launched in June 2006 , Blu-ray players were of the basic Profile 1.0 kind , meaning they could offer neither picture - in - picture nor Internet connectivity , something the doomed HD DVD rival format offered from Day 1 .
Now , the big push is for Profile 2.0 players , which are slated to start coming to market in the next few months .
Accordingly , studios are scrambling to produce final spec BD - Live software as well , with Lionsgate leading the charge in January with “ War ” and “ Saw IV ” -- a bold move , considering there were n’t yet any players on the market that could tap into the discs ’
Web - enhanced content .
Sony ’s two BD - Live titles each include exclusive downloadable theatrical and home video previews along with a FAQ about BD - Live functionality .
“ Walk Hard ” includes three featurettes that star Bill Hader as Derek Stone , a historian and expert “ Coxologist . ”
These featurettes are available only via the BD - Live download .
BD - Live titles also have the potential to enable a wide range of Web - based features , including ringtone and wallpaper downloads , peer - to - peer interactions , live virtual events and gaming .

Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the satellite had lost power and propulsion , and could contain hazardous materials .
The White House said it was monitoring the situation .
A spokesman said " numerous " satellites had come out of orbit and fallen back to Earth harmlessly over the years .
" We are looking at potential options to mitigate any possible damage this satellite may cause , " said Gordon Johndroe , who speaks for the US National Security Council .
Questioned by The Associated Press , he would not be drawn on whether the US would try to destroy the satellite , perhaps with a missile .
An unnamed official quoted by AP said the US government was keeping lawmakers and other countries abreast of the situation .
Fuel hazard
The satellite contains the rocket fuel hydrazine , a government official told AP on condition of anonymity .
A colourless liquid with an ammonia - like odour , the fuel is a toxic chemical and can cause harm to anyone who comes in contact with it .
John Pike , director of the defence research group GlobalSecurity.org , said an uncontrolled re-entry could risk exposure of US secrets .
Spy satellites typically are disposed of through a controlled re-entry into the ocean so that no one else can access the spacecraft , he was quoted by AP as saying .
The military expert believes that shooting the satellite down would create debris that would then re-enter the atmosphere and burn up or hit the ground .
In his estimate , the satellite weighs about 20,000 pounds ( 9,000kg ) and is the size of a small bus .
It is possible , he adds , that this one died as long as a year ago and is just now getting ready to re-enter the atmosphere .
Another expert , Jeffrey Richelson of the National Security Archive , said the satellite was probably a photo reconnaissance satellite .
Into the ocean
AP notes that the largest uncontrolled re-entry by a US space agency ( Nasa ) craft was Skylab .
The 78 - tonne abandoned space station fell from orbit in 1979 .
Its debris dropped harmlessly into the Indian Ocean and across a remote section of western Australia , the US news agency says .
In 2002 , officials believe debris from a 7,000lbs ( 3,200kg ) science satellite hit the Earth 's atmosphere .
It rained down over the Gulf , a few thousand miles from where they first predicted it would crash .
And God created Darwin
I do not believe in God , I believe in the evolution theory .
What is it about ?
I give below the description as given in the first book of the Bible , Genesis , in chapter 1 , verses 20 to 27 .
( I chose the old King James translation here ; there are other translations with more modern language of which several also can be found on the Internet .
I hope to add a link . )
And God said ,
Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
And God created great whales , and every living creature that moveth , which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind , and every winged fowl ( : bird ) after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
And God blessed them , saying , Be fruitfull , and multiply , and fill the waters in seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth .
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
And God said ,
Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind , and it was so .
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
So God created man in his own image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
The Evolution Theory , first described by Darwin , seems to give a different explanation of how the different species came into being .
This scientific theory basically states that due to changes in the genes , sometimes children will be born of a couple of animals that are different in some aspect from their parents .
Such changes are caused by coincidence , and while in several cases , they will cause a miscarriage , sometimes they will cause a change that is possibly benificial for the animal .
Animals for which the genes caused a change that is benificial have a better chance of surviving , hence on the long run these kinds of animals will dominate .
For instance , when there are many trees with leaves high up in the tree , animals whose genes tell to have a longer neck will have a better chance of survival , and in some zillions of years or so , short - necked animals may have evolved into giraffes .
So , it seems that while the biblical view is that the species were formed as a result of the creation of them by God , the evolutionist view is that the species were formed as the result of a randomized process combined with selection - and often this is seen as a process that gives an explanation of the formation of the species without involved of a god , often used as a cornerstone in atheist arguments .
So , what is true ?
I would like to argue here a few things .
One of them is that evolution theory does not necesarily contradict the existence of God - in fact , there are many Christians that do also believe in evolution .
In the end , I am unasking the question posed here , replacing it by a different one .
Questionmarks
While this is not a scientifical argument , I find the idea that all these different kinds of animals and the humans with the very intricate systems in their and our bodies were just created by a process that mainly is based on chance is something hard to swallow .
I sometimes compare the idea to finding a watch on the street , and claiming that this was just created by some molecules that happened to meet each other in some lucky random way .
( That would imply that we could just act if it was ours , and not of somebody else .
Creation also means that we just borrow this world from God , and should not act as if it was entirely ours , hence we should , for instance , be careful for preserving the species that God created . )
But I am not a biologist ( or a theologist ) , and as a computer scientist , I can not totally judge the scientific value of all arguments given .
A question however is : is it necessary to judge these arguments ?
Guided evolution
Let me use a metaphore from computer science .
There are so called evolutionary programs , or other programs that use in some way a process of random changes to solutions combined with a selection process of better solutions over others .
Now , experiments show that these processes sometimes can come up with very good solutions for some problems .
However , in some cases , the experiments do not give any good solutions at all .
What is needed is that there is a programmer that makes the program , and someone that sets the parameters for the program in the right way .
In the process that is called evolution , similarly there may have been a Programmer .
God may have been steering the process and may have caused that essential steps during the evolution went in the direction
He planned .
I found this idea , at the time , the most plausible .
For one thing , I know God exists , and a theory about how the species came into existence that is without God contradicts already that fact , apart from the fact that the idea that all these animals and humans with their most intricate functioning are the result of a truely random process is hard to believe .
Some Christians may object to the idea of `evolution guided by God ' by saying that it is in contradiction with the Bible .
That depends on how literally one would take the verses in the Bible on creation .
Elsewhere it is written that for God , one day is as thousand years .
Additionally , we do not know for sure how long days have taken and whether the notion of day in the description of creation reflects literally the same notion as day as we know it .
In any case , I found the idea a liberation : there is no need to choose between science and God .
Even if evolution theory is the right model of the genesis of the different species , that still does not mean that God does not exist .
And the fact that there are different answers to the question than the two most prominently stated means that the question also loses importance .
Risking your soul for science ?
The Christian faith tells us about God who loves us , and has loved us so much that Jesus died for us on the cross .
If we accept that offer , the relation with God can be restored , and we can after our lives live for ever with Him .
In contrast , the Christian faith also tells about `hell ' , and we should take care not to go there after our death .
As I also wrote elsewhere , `hell ' is not my most popular part of the Christian religion , but it is there .
In addition , the Christian faith can also help to have a better life on earth .
I find it very sad that there are people that do not believe in God , with all consequences , just because of a dispute on something that is in the end not more than just a scientific matter .
If God exists , then the question how animals and mankind were created is just a scientific question - of scientific interest , but not a matter of life and death .
It is asking `how he did it ' , like wanting to know how a magician did his trick of getting a rabbit out of his hat .
Whether God used evolution or a literal creation out of nothing , in all cases we may know that it was His plan to have us on this earth .
He loves us and wants a relation with us .
And that is infinitely more important than whether we know whether the evolution theory is true , or understand relativety theory , know the proof of Fermats theorem or whether Shakespeare really wrote all those plays himself .
What are we talking about ?
Conclusion
In fact , given this , the question loses its importance and one cannot and should not base ones religion or atheism just on the correctness or incorrectness of the scientific theory of evolution .
And , yes , God also created Darwin .

NBC Rejects a Conservative Group Airtime for an Ad that Supports the Troops
A conservative group called Freedom ’s Watch was recently denied in their bid to buy advertising on NBC .
The ad that they wanted to run was an ad to tell everybody to say thank you to our troops over the holiday season .
Sounds like a controversial ad to me , does n’t it .
This is ridiculous , and the killer here is the lame reason they gave for not accepting the ad .
I would respect them more if they came out and said , “ your website supports President Bush and his policies , so we do not want to show your commercial . ”
That , at least , would be the truth .
The reason they gave was that the advertisement was an advertisement for the group ’s website .
They also called the ads too political .
How obscene is that ?
Since when can a website not advertise on network television ?
I see all these lame website commercials every day .
So , one can logically assume that NBC is not opposed to running an ad for a website , they are opposed to running an ad for THIS website .
One can then assume that the reason NBC does n’t want to run an ad for THIS website is because they agree with the president ’s policies .
Alan Wurtzel , NBC ’s head of standards and practices , even went so far as to say that the reason that Freedom ’s Watch refused to alter their ad for their own website was because Freedom ’s Watch wanted to create a controversy with NBC to gather even more media attention .
What a disgrace .
Here are the ads that NBC refuses to show .
Video Hat tip : Political Vindication
Read the breitbart article here .
UPDATE : NBC has reversed it ’s decision and is now running the ad .
NBC claims to have changed some policy that they were hiding behind in their decision to reject the ad in the first place .
Lazare Ponticelli celebrated his 110th birthday in December
President Nicolas Sarkozy announced the death on Wednesday , paying tribute to the last " poilu " , as French WWI veterans were known .
" Today , I express the nation 's deep emotion and infinite sadness , " he said .
Mr Ponticelli , originally Italian , had lied about his age in order to join the French Foreign Legion in August 1914 ,
aged 16 , Mr Sarkozy said .
There are a handful of surviving WWI veterans from other countries , including British pilot Henry Allingham and Austro - Hungarian artillery man Franz Kunstler .
France 's oldest surviving WWI veteran , Louis de Cazenave , died in January , also aged 110 .
The last of Germany 's veterans from the war died also died in January .
Day of remembrance
Mr Ponticelli was born on 7 December 1897 in Emilia Romagna , northern Italy .
He made his way , at the age of nine , to France to join his two brothers , and worked in Paris as a chimney sweep and paper boy .
Mr Sarkozy said there would be a national day of remembrance for France 's war dead in the coming days as he marked Mr Ponticelli 's death .
" I salute the Italian boy who came to Paris to earn his living and chose to become French , first in August 1914 when he lied about his age to sign up at 16 for the Foreign Legion to defend his adopted homeland , " the French president said in a statement .
" Then a second time in 1921 , when he decided to remain here for good . "
Mr Ponticelli , who lived with his daughter in a southern suburb of Paris , had initially refused a government offer of a state funeral , the AFP news agency reported .
But he later decided to accept " in the name of all those who died , men and women " , during WWI .
" Poilu " , a word meaning hairy or tough , is the affectionate name given since Napoleonic times to French foot soldiers .
Returning to the White House after a weekend at Camp David , the president said the bombing would not stop , unless the ruling Taliban " turn [ bin Laden ] over , turn his cohorts over , turn any hostages they hold over . "
He added , " There 's no need to discuss innocence or guilt .
We know he 's guilty " .
In Jalalabad , deputy prime minister Haji Abdul Kabir - the third most powerful figure in the ruling Taliban regime - told reporters that the Taliban would require evidence that Bin Laden was behind the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US , but added : " we would be ready to hand him over to a third country " .
The offer came a day after the Taliban 's supreme leader rebuffed Bush 's " second chance " for the Islamic militia to surrender Bin Laden to the US .
Mullah Mohammed
Omar said there was no move to " hand anyone over " .
Taliban ' ready to discuss ' Bin Laden handover if bombing halts
The Taliban would be ready to discuss handing over Osama bin Laden to a neutral country if the US halted the bombing of Afghanistan , a senior Taliban official said today .
Afghanistan 's deputy prime minister , Haji Abdul Kabir , told reporters that the Taliban would require evidence that Bin Laden was behind the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US .
" If the Taliban is given evidence that Osama bin Laden is involved " and the bombing campaign stopped , " we would be ready to hand him over to a third country " , Mr Kabir added .
But it would have to be a state that would never " come under pressure from the United States " , he said .
Mr Kabir urged America to halt its air campaign , now in its eighth day , and open negotiations .
" If America were to step back from the current policy , then we could negotiate , " he said .
" Then we could discuss which third country . "
Large explosions caused by American bombs and missiles have been reported to the south and east of the Afghan capital , Kabul , this evening .
The sky above the city has been filled with tracer fire from Taliban anti-aircraft guns once again .
Before the start of the air campaign , the Taliban had demanded evidence of Bin Laden 's involvement in the attack and had offered to try him before an Islamic court inside Afghanistan - proposals that the US promptly rejected .
Al - Qaida warning an ' admission of guilt '
Threats of new terrorist strikes against Britain and the US from Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaida group amount to an admission of guilt for the September 11 attacks , the deputy prime minister , John Prescott , said today .
Mr Prescott , speaking while on a diplomatic mission in Moscow , argued that the latest statement from al - Qaida strongly suggested Bin Laden 's culpability for last month 's attacks on New York and Washington .
" What I have heard about the message given ... is basically confirming , I think , the guilt of Bin Laden , who has made it clear that he wants to continue these actions , " he told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme this morning .
The new threats from al - Qaida came from spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith , in a video - taped statement broadcast on Qatar 's Al - Jazeera Arabic TV news network .
He said Muslims in the US and Britain " should avoid travelling by air or living in high buildings or towers " .
Americans and Britons were also warned to leave the Arabian Peninsula " because the land will burn with fire under their feet " .
Washington dismissed the comments as " propaganda " , while a Downing Street spokeswoman echoed Mr Prescott 's comment that the threats amounted to an admission of guilt .

Anti-US protests engulf Pakistani town
Thousands of anti-US protesters today converged on a southern Pakistani town , fighting pitched battles with police and paramilitary troops .
One person was killed and 24 were injured in the battles around Jacobabad , police said .
The desert city is the home of one of two air bases made available to US forces to support the air campaign against Osama bin Laden and his al - Qaida network .
As rage grew over US - led air strikes on Afghanistan , one militant leader exhorted followers to set Shabaz airbase in Jacobabad on fire " at any cost " , and another called on Pakistan 's generals to overthrow the country 's military ruler , General Pervez Musharraf .

Cathedral cleared in ' powder ' scare
Firefighters wearing protective suits were this afternoon attempting to clear up white powder dropped in Canterbury Cathedral by a man reported to be of Arab appearance .
The cathedral was evacuated at around 2.30 pm today after the man was seen dropping the powder in one of its chapels .
The fire brigade was called in to clear up the powder and take samples for analysis , amid heightened concerns about biological warfare attacks in Britain .
It is understood the powder is not thought to be a biological agent , such as anthrax , but the cathedral remains closed tonight as tests are carried out .

UN commissioner warns of Afghan starvation threat
United Nations human rights commissioner Mary Robinson has called for a pause in the US - led bombing of Afghanistan to allow food aid into the country and prevent a " Rwanda - style " humanitarian disaster .
The former Irish president said that otherwise America and its allies could preside over the deaths from starvation of millions of people in Afghanistan .
Mrs Robinson , speaking to BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme from Geneva , said helping Afghanistan 's civilian population through the winter had to be a top priority .

Sometimes it seems almost like a media conspiracy to ignore the former ob - gyn .
Except for not one ....
That 's not unusual , actually .
Hardly any other candidate and virtually no major media , especially CNN , has mentioned his name for the last year , so terrified are they of his stare and his libertarian - like views , including downsizing the federal government , bringing American troops home and abolishing the Federal Reserve .
Romney was so flustered in his dropout speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee in Washington Thursday , that he did n't even mention Ron Paul .
Clearly spooked by a few of Rep. Ron Paul 's second - place finishes kind of close behind him , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination .
but two Jay Leno appearances .
They even give Paul less speaking time in the debates , if they do n't ban him altogether .
Despite spending some $ 35 million of his own money and $ 55 million more that once belonged to other people , the 60 - year - old Romney youngster was forced to give way to the 72 - year - old , 10 - term congressman from Texas , who has fired up thousands of dedicated and determined and very vocal and frustrated followers , young and old , across the country and permeating the Internet .
He 's even got one big - name donor , one big - name endorser and another perhaps maybe .
Ron Paul signs are still flapping in the prairie winds across Iowa , where Paul 's caucus finish ahead of Rudy Giuliani launched the former New York mayor 's eventual political decline .
Then , in New Hampshire despite being barred from the nationally - televised Fox News debate , Paul beat former Sen.
Fred Thompson , which began his inevitable political death spiral .
In the face of Paul 's relentless campaigning here and there and his successful fundraising -- he raised nearly $ 20 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 , more than any other Republican -- Romney , who only has an estimated $ 165 million of his personal fortune left , had no choice really but to quit .
Romney 's exit follows the similar Paul - forced departures of other far more famous GOP candidates -- Giuliani , Thompson , Tommy Thompson , Sam Brownback , Jim Gilmore .
Jeb Bush did n't even consider trying .
That leaves only Pittsburgh - native Paul , somebody named John McCain and this Mike Huckabee fellow from Arkansas , who seems to have had considerable trouble keeping a job .
He 's been a radio talk host , a Baptist preacher , lieutenant governor and governor .
And Huckabee 's had trouble raising money .
He got only $ 1 million in the third quarter compared to Paul 's $ 5 million .
So Huckabee can't last much longer .
That will leave only McMaverick , a former Navy squadron commander and POW who endured nearly six years of solitary confinement in Vietnam and then , worse , 25 years of listening to congressional speeches .
He did n't get around to mentioning Paul either in his speech Thursday , but he was probably afraid .
Paul 's website reports he 's raised another $ 5.3 million just since Jan.1 , which is more than Hillary Clinton can loan herself in one week .
Paul has given the Democrats until early August to choose between Clinton and Barack Obama , who 's so young he can't remember life without color TV .
According to an authoritative Ron Paul campaign news release , with all of his accumulated fifth , fourth , third and second places , Paul claims to have 42 delegates to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul come September .
That puts him only about 660 delegates behind McCain and barely 1,149 shy of the number necessary to seize the party nomination in the name of the Ron Paul Revolution .
And Texas does n't vote until March 4 !

There are differing accounts of what caused Ms Bhutto 's death
CIA Director Michael Hayden told the Washington Post that the former Pakistani prime minister was killed by fighters allied to Baitullah Mehsud .
The Pakistani government accused Mehsud of the attack shortly after Ms Bhutto's death in Rawalpindi on 27 December .
Mr Hayden did not reveal the sources for his claim .
Correspondents say that Mr Hayden 's comments are the most comprehensive public assessment by US intelligence of Ms Bhutto 's death .
Controversy still surrounds the circumstances of the killing .
One or more attackers shot at her and detonated a bomb as she was leaving a rally in Rawalpindi .
Baitullah Mehsud has denied involvement .
The Pakistani government says it intercepted a phone conversation proving that he was behind the attack .
' Organised campaign '
CIA Director Michael Hayden is now backing the Pakistani government 's view .
" This was done by that network around Baitullah Mehsud .
We have no reason to question that , " Mr Hayden told the Washington Post .
He said the murder was " part of an organised campaign " that has included suicide bombings and other attacks on Pakistani leaders .
Mr Hayden said that the same forces were responsible for a new outbreak of violence sweeping across Pakistan which was undermining the stability of President Pervez Musharraf 's government .
" You 've got this nexus now that probably was always there in latency but is now active : a nexus between al - Qaeda and various extremist and separatist groups , " Mr Hayden said .
" It is clear that their intention is to continue to try to do harm to the Pakistani state as it currently exists . "
Forces belonging to Baitullah Mehsud have also been blamed by the government for seizing a fort from the military in the troubled region of South Waziristan on Wednesday .

Amr Zaki has scored four goals in tournament
Ahmed Fathi put the defending champions ahead on 12 minutes with a strike from the edge of the penalty area .
Amr Zaki made it 2 - 0 with a header after the break , but Kader Keita pulled a goal back a minute later with a stunning 25 - yard strike .
Zaki scored another from the edge of the area , and Mohamed Aboutrika added the fourth in stoppage time .
Earlier Cameroon , who lost 4 - 2 to Egypt in their opening group game , beat Ghana 1- 0 .
Egypt goalkeeper Essam Al - Hadari had a superb game and he made at least two world - class saves at key moments of the game to keep his side ahead .
In contrast the Ivory Coast goalkeeper Boubacar Barry had to be substituted in the first half due to injury and his replacement , the inexperienced goalkeeper Stephan Loboue , looked at fault for Egypt 's second and third goals .
Kolo Toure returned to the Ivory Coast defence , but was not at his sharpest , and he too was badly at fault for Egypt 's third goal .
606 : DEBATE
Egypt took a more physical approach to the game than usual , deciding to take on the Elephants ' power .
Didier Drogba worked his way into the penalty area in the 11th minute , but goalkeeper Al - Hadari had the shot covered .
The Pharoahs went ahead a minute later when a corner was not cleared decisively and after the ball came to Fathi he fired it in at the near post .
Al - Hadari used his body to save a Drogba shot from six yards out , then at the other end , a 20 - yard left - footer from Mohamed Aboutrika went narrowly wide .
Egypt continued to maintain their presence in the game with confident , incisive play , and there was a blow for Ivory Coast in the 37th minute .
Barry had to be replaced with Loboue , playing his first competitive international , having not featured for his German second division club all season .
But the Elephants were unlucky not to equalise in first - half stoppage time .
Drogba headed a corner goalwards with astonishing power , but the ball went straight into Al - Hadari 's body , and , with Aruna Dindane ready to pounce , it was cleared away by Hosni Abd Rabou .
Al - Hadari stopped another Drogba header with a brilliant fingertip save three minutes into the second half .
The Ivory Coast pressure intensified and on the hour Al - Hadari had to punch Arthur Boka 's inswinging free - kick over bar .
Zaki made it 2 - 0 in the 62nd minute after Ahmed Hassan swung in a corner that Didier Zokora tried to clear at the near post .
The ball went to Zaki , who headed in off the crossbar with Loboue not moving an inch .
Ivory Coast responded seconds later , when Keita was given room to dribble across to a central position and he unleashed a thunderbolt from 25 yards .
Zaki restored the two - goal advantage after Toure fatally turned his back on the ball allowing the striker to scored from 20 yards .
Ivory Coast applied continual pressure but Egypt held firm , and with the Elephants committed to attack , Aboutrika scored in stoppage time from an Egypt break .
Few would have predicted the scoreline , and the Pharaohs ' defence of the trophy remains on course .
Ivory Coast : Barry ( Loboue 37 ) , Boka , Toure , Eboue , Meite , Toure Yaya , Zokora , Kalou ( Bakari Kone 60 ) , Drogba , Dindane ( Arouna Kone 79 ) , Keita .

I said before this was going to get more interesting before it went away and it seems to have just taken another step in that direction .
I do think it 's noteworthy to point out that when trying to defend yourself against claims that you use fear and personal threats to silence your critics , using fear and personal threats to silence your critics might not be the best course of action when it comes to clearing your name .

OH GREAT , a troll war between channers and Scientologists .

RIVERDALE , California ( Reuters ) - Imagine a vat of liquid cow manure covering the area of five football fields and 33 feet deep .
Meet California ’s most alternative new energy .
A collecting pool of liquefied cow manure is shown at the Vintage Dairy Biogas Project in Riverdale , California March 4 , 2008 .
On a dairy farm in the Golden State 's agricultural heartland , utility PG&E Corp began on Tuesday producing natural gas derived from manure , in what it hopes will be a new way to power homes with renewable , if not entirely clean , energy .

On a dairy farm in the Golden State ’s agricultural heartland , utility PG&E Corp began on Tuesday producing natural gas derived from manure , in what it hopes will be a new way to power homes with renewable , if not entirely clean , energy .
The Vintage Dairy Biogas Project , the brainchild of life - long dairyman David Albers , aims to provide the natural gas needed to power 1,200 homes a day , Albers said at the facility ’s inauguration ceremony .
“ When most people see a pile of manure , they see a pile of manure .
We saw it as an opportunity for farmers , for utilities , and for California , ” Albers said .
In addition to being a partner in the 5,000 - head Vintage Dairy , Albers is also president of BioEnergy Solutions , the company that funded and built the facility which cost millions of dollars .
PG&E is simply a customer and the companies declined to give details of project finances .
As cow manure decomposes , it produces methane , a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide .
Scientists say controlling methane emissions from animals such as cows would be a major step in addressing climate change .
Enter the Vintage Dairy project .
As luck would have it , methane can be captured and treated to produce renewable gas , and California regulators have directed PG&E and other utilities to make renewable energy at least 20 percent of their electricity supplies by 2010 .
PG&E expects to reach 14 percent this year , thanks in small part at least to its partnership with BioEnergy Solutions .
To tap the renewable gas from cow manure , the Vintage Dairy farm first flushes manure into a large , octagonal pit , where it becomes about 99 percent water .
It is then pumped into a covered lagoon , first passing through a screen that filters out large solids that eventually become the cows ’ bedding .
The covered lagoon , or “ digester , ” is the size of nearly five football fields and about 33 feet deep .
It is lined with plastic to protect the ground water and the cover , made of high density polyethylene , is held down at the edges by concrete .
The digester ’s cover was sunken into the lagoon on Tuesday , but officials said it would be taut and raised in a few days as the gas collects underneath it .
Weights on top of the digester channel the gas to the small facility where it is “ scrubbed ” of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide .
The end product is “ close to 99 percent pure methane ” according to BioEnergy Chief Operating Officer Thomas Hintz .
Once it is treated , the gas is injected into PG&E ’s pipeline , where it will be shipped to a power plant in Northern California .
According to Albers , PG&E and California state officials , biogas is a major opportunity for dairy farmers to make extra revenue while helping the environment .
“ There are a lot of lagoons like this in California that do n’t have lining in them , ” said James Boyd , commissioner and vice chair of the California Energy Commission .
“ There is a business case to be made for this ... climate change has really provided the incentive to do this . ”
Both BioEnergy Solutions and PG&E are actively courting dairy farmers , whose cow manure is now simply being used as fertilizer , allowing the methane to be released into the air as a greenhouse gas .
“ With nearly 2 million dairy cows in California , the potential is great , ” said Roy Kuga , vice president of energy supply for San Fransisco - based PG&E .
The company has a partnership with another company , Microgy , which is currently setting up biogas projects at three California dairies .
In practice , however , not every dairy could participate in such a project because some are not located close enough to the necessary gas transmission lines , PG&E officials said .
Still , for now there are plenty of dairies to get on board .
A second dairy in Fresno county has already agreed to join the Vintage Dairy project and Albers estimated gas from the two dairies combined could power 2,500 homes a day .
The Vintage Dairy facility could accommodate gas from up to two or three more dairies , depending on the size , officials said .
There are some new bots called OSP on the drawing board .
Using advance robotics , these guys autonomously work together to contain an oil spill by surrounding it with an inflatable barrier .
Once contained , clean - up crews can jump in and suck the oil out .
After reading this , my Roomba just quit .
Designer : Ji-hoon Kim
With the help of its simple and modular structure , OSP unit can be transported to the accident site rapidly and commence its mission immediately .
Like a torpedo and mine operation in navy , OSP can be deployed from a helicopter or boat and accomplish its mission through the multi- robot control algorithms .
Man With the Muck - Rake
A group of men with muckrakes , combing through the sludge of misinformation and cover - up , bring to light the truths that scoundrels , cheats and other unseemly characters would rather not discuss .
What do Mike Huckabee and Hillary Clinton have in common ?
Neither seems to have heard the old Kenney Rogers tune , the refrain of which goes :
" You got to know when to hold em , know when to fold em ,
Know when to walk away and know when to run . "
Tuesday night 's results from Wisconsin were stunning , and telling .
But even more telling was what was going on behind the scenes .
Taken together with the poll results , if Hillary Clinton took Kenney Rogers ' advice above she would n't just walk away , she 'd sprint for the nearest exit .
In case you missed it , here 's what happened after the polls closed in Wisconsin .
Once it was clear to both campaigns that Obama had definitively won Wisconsin , the Obama folks let the Clinton folks know Obama would wait before he spoke to let Hillary speak first .
Their assumption being that she 'd concede the Wisconsin race and congratulate Obama for the win .
How little the Barackistas still understand the Clintons .
Like Lucy in the Peanuts cartoon , she pulls the football away just as Charlie Brown goes for the kick .
And so it came to pass , again -- Hillary , speaking before a crowd in Texas , launched right into a campaign attack speech .
Furious they 'd been had again , the Obama campaign " big footed " Hillary by having Barack begin his speech right there and then .
They knew that , as the winner last night , all the networks would switch from Hillary 's speech to his -- and that 's just what happened .
Hillary was blacked out -- right in the middle of her pitch .
Ouch .
But it was n't " ouch " for those of us watching on TV --- it was deal closer .
We were instantly transported from Hillary 's sing - song , robotic , entirely predictable remarks , to a soaring address by Obama .
( Watch it here )
As I listened to Obama I turned to my wife and said , " it 's over . "
It was so clear ... stunningly clear .
The Obama folks may have cut into Hillary 's speech in a moment of anger , but in so doing they created a contrast so startling in it 's starkness that only the most lobotomized Clinton Moonies could have resisted it .
The contrast was so immediate and so stunning it hit me like a truck .
The contrast forced the question on me , and I suspect millions of others who saw and heard it .
It reduced all the noise and posturing of this campaign down to a very simple choice :
Did I want four years of more of the same -- the same poll - tested nostrums , the same all - talk , process - pablum that has , for the past couple of decades masked a failure of either party to govern -- the failure to solve real problems rather than use them as brickbats against " the other side ? "
Was that what I wanted ?
Or did I want the candidate who was giving this hard - boiled , as - cynical - as - they - come , crusty old reporter goosebumps every time he opened his mouth ?
Did I want the candidate that included me in his equation , the candidate who did n't just ask for my vote , but my help , should he win .
Did I want the candidate that did n't tell me he / she was prepared to do it all FOR me " on day one , " but rather that he could not do any of it for me , only WITH me .

In this week ’s eSkeptic , Steve Salerno discusses the fundamental flaws of broadcast journalism as a tool for informing viewers .
For over 25 years , Salerno has perpetrated investigative and feature journalism for major publications including Harper ’s , New York Times magazine , Esquire , Playboy , the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post , Worth magazine and others .
His 2005 book , SHAM : How the Self - Help Movement Made America Helpless , explored the $ 10 billion American self - help movement .
He is now working on a book about vanity ’s role in American life .

Journalist - Bites - Reality !
How broadcast journalism is flawed
in such a fundamental way that its utility
as a tool for informing viewers is almost nil .
by Steve Salerno
It is the measure of the media ’s obsession with its “ pedophiles run amok ! ” story line that so many of us are on a first - name basis with the victims : Polly , Amber , JonBenet , Danielle , Elizabeth , Samantha .
And now there is Madeleine .
Clearly these crimes were and are horrific , and nothing here is intended to diminish the parents ’ loss .
But something else has been lost in the bargain as journalists tirelessly stoke fear of strangers , segueing from nightly - news segments about cyber - stalkers and “ the rapist in your neighborhood ” to prime - time reality series like Dateline ’s “ To Catch a Predator . ”
That “ something else ” is reality .
According to the U.S. Department of Justice , in a given year there are about 88,000 documented cases of sexual abuse among juveniles .
In the roughly 17,500 cases involving children between ages 6 and 11 , strangers are the perpetrators just 5 percent of the time — and just 3 percentof the time when the victim is under age 6 .
( Further , more than a third of such molesters are themselves juveniles , who may not be true “ predators ” so much as confused or unruly teens . )
Overall , the odds that one of America ’s 48 million children under age 12 will encounter an adult pedophile at the local park are startlingly remote .
The Child Molestation Research & Prevention Institute puts it like so : “ Right now , 90 percent of our efforts go toward protecting our children from strangers , when what we need to do is to focus 90 percent of our efforts toward protecting children from the abusers who are not strangers . ”
That ’s a diplomatic way of phrasing the uncomfortable but factually supported truth : that if your child is not molested in your own home — by you , your significant other , or someone else you invited in — chances are your child will never be molested anywhere .
Media coverage has precisely inverted both the reality and the risk of child sexual assault .
Along the way , it has also inverted the gender of the most tragic victims :
Despite the unending parade of young female faces on TV , boys are more likely than girls to be killed in the course of such abuse .
We think we know Big Journalism ’s faults by its much ballyhooed lapses — its scandals , gaffes , and breakdowns — as well as by a recent spate of insider tell - alls .
When Dan Rather goes public with a sensational expose based on bogus documents ; when the Atlanta Journal Constitution wrongly labels Richard Jewell the Olympic Park bomber ; when Dateline resorts to rigging explosive charges to the gas tanks of “ unsafe ” trucks that , in Dateline ’s prior tests , stubbornly refused to explode on their own ; when the New York Times ’ Jayson Blair scoops other reporters working the same story by quoting sources who do n’t exist …
We see these incidents as atypical , the exceptions that prove the rule .
Sadly , we ’re mistaken .
To argue that a decided sloppiness has crept into journalism or that the media have been “ hijacked by [ insert least favorite political agenda ] ” badly misses the real point ; it suggests that all we need to do to fix things is filter out the gratuitous political spin or rig the ship to run a bit tighter .
In truth , today ’s system of news delivery is an enterprise whose procedures , protocols , and underlying assumptions all but guarantee that it cannot succeed at its self described mission .
Broadcast journalism in particular is flawed in such a fundamental way that its utility as a tool for illuminating life , let alone interpreting it , is almost nil .
“ You give us 22 minutes , and we ’ll give you … what , exactly ? ”
We watch the news to “ see what ’s going on in the world . ”
But there ’s a hitch right off the bat .
In its classic conception , newsworthiness is built on a foundation of anomaly : man -bites - dog , to use the hackneyed j school example .
The significance of this cannot be overstated .
It means that , by definition , journalism in its most basic form deals with what life is not .
Today ’s star journalist , however , goes to great lengths to distance himself from his trade ’s man bites dog heritage .
To admit that what he ’s presenting is largely marginalia ( or at best “ background music ” ) deflates the journalist ’s relevance in an environment where members of Major Media have come to regard themselves as latter day shamans and oracles .
In a memorable 2002 piece , “ The Weight of the Anchor , ” columnist Frank Rich put it this way , regarding the then - Big 3 of Brokaw , Jennings , and Rather : “ Not quite movie stars , not quite officialdom , they are more famous than most movie stars and more powerful than most politicians . ”
Thus , journalism as currently practiced delivers two contradictory messages : that what it puts before you ( a ) is newsworthy ( under the old man bites dog standard ) , but also ( b ) captures the zeitgeist .
( “ You give us 22 minutes , we ’ll give you the world , ” gloat all news radio stations across the country . )
The news media cannot simultaneously deliver both .
In practice , they fail at both .
By painting life in terms of its oddities , journalism yields not a snapshot of your world , but something closer to a photographic negative .
Even when journalism is n’t plainly capsizing reality , it ’s furnishing information that varies between immaterial and misleading .
For all its cinema - verité panache , embedded reporting , as exemplified in Iraq and in Nightline ’s recent series on “ the forgotten war ” in Afghanistan , shows only what ’s going on in the immediate vicinity of the embedded journalist .
It ’s not all that useful for yielding an overarching sense of the progress of a war , and might easily be counterproductive :
To interpret such field reporting as a valid microcosm is the equivalent of standing in a spot where it ’s raining and assuming it ’s raining everywhere .
Journalism ’s paradoxes and problems come to a head in the concept of newsmagazination , pioneered on 60 Minutes and later the staple tactic of such popular clones as Dateline , 48 Hours , and 20 / 20 .
One of the more intellectually dishonest phenomena of recent vintage , newsmagazination presents the viewer with a circumstantial stew whipped up from :
a handful of compelling sound - bites culled from anecdotal sources ,
public - opinion polls ( which tell us nothing except what people think is true ) ,
statistics that have no real evidentiary weight and / or scant relevance to the point they ’re being used to “ prove , ”
crushing logical flaws such as post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning ,
faulty or , at best , unproven “ expert ” assumptions , or other “ conventional wisdom ” that has never been seriously examined ,
a proprietary knowledge of people ’s inner thoughts or motives ( as when a White House correspondent discounts a president ’s actual statements in order to reveal to us that president ’s “ true agenda ” ) , etc .
Case in point : On Nov. 5 , 2004 , NBC ’s Dateline built a show around the dangers of gastric bypass surgery .
The topic was a natural for Dateline , inasmuch as The Today Show ’s own Al Roker , who did much of the reporting , had undergone the surgery and achieved a stunning weight loss .
In setting the scene , anchor Stone Phillips noted that the expected mortality rate for gastric bypass is 1 in 200 .
( Translation : The survival rate is 199 in 200 , or 99.5 percent . )
Phillips then handed off to Roker ; the affable weatherman spent a few cheery moments on his own success , then found his somber face in segueing to the tragic saga of Mike Butler , who died following surgery .
The Butler story consumed the next 30 minutes of the hour long broadcast , punctuated by the obligatory wistful soliloquy from Butler ’s young widow .
So , in covering a procedure that helps ( or at least does n’t kill ) roughly 99.5 percent of patients , Dateline elects to tell the story in terms of the .5 percent with tragic outcomes .
Had NBC sought to equitably represent the upside and downside of gastric bypass , it would ’ve devoted 1/200th of the show — a mere 18 seconds — to Butler .
Further , would n’t it have been journalistically responsible for Dateline to devote a good portion of the broadcast to the risks of morbid obesity itself , which far outweigh the risks of surgical bypass ?
Do the math … please
One underlying factor here is that journalists either do n’t understand the difference between random data and genuine statistical proof , or they find that distinction inconvenient for their larger purpose : to make news dramatic and accessible .
The media need a story line — a coherent narrative , ideally with an identifiable hero and villain .
As Tom Brokaw once put it , perhaps revealing more than he intended , “ It ’s all storytelling , you know .
That ’s what journalism is about . ”
The mainstream news business is so unaccustomed to dealing with issues at any level of complexity and nuance that they ’re wont to oversimplify their story to the point of caricature .
The best contemporary example is the Red State / Blue State dichotomy , invoked as an easy metaphor to express the philosophical schism that supposedly divides “ the two Americas . ”
Watching CNN ’s Bill Schneider hover over his maps on Election Night 2004 , drawing stark lines between colors , one would ’ve thought there were no Republicans in California , or that a Democrat arriving at the Texas border would be turned back at gunpoint .
Well , guess what :
The dichotomy does n’t exist — certainly not in the way journalists use the term .
It ’s just a handy , sexy media fiction .
Although California did wind up in the Kerry column in 2004 , some 5.5 million Californians voted for George W. Bush .
They represented about 45 percent of the state ’s total electorate and a much larger constituency in raw numbers than Bush enjoyed in any state he won , including Texas .
Speaking of Texas :
That unreconstituted Yankee , John Kerry , collected 2.8 million votes there .
Two - point - eight million .
Yet to hear the media tell it , California is deep , cool Blue , while Texas is a glaring , monolithic Red .
Such fabrications are n’t just silly .
They become institutionalized in the culture , and they color — in this case literally — the way Americans view the nation in which they live .
The mythical Red State / Blue State paradigm is just one of the more telling indications of a general disability the media exhibit in working with data .
A cluster of random events does not a “ disturbing new trend ! ” make — but that does n’t stop journalists from finding patterns in happenstance .
Take lightning .
It kills with an eerie predictability : about 66 Americans every year .
Now , lightning could kill those 66 people more or less evenly all spring and summer , or it could , in theory , kill the lot of them on one really scary Sunday in May .
But the scary Sunday in May would n’t necessarily mean we ’re going to have a year in which lightning kills 79,000 people .
( No more than if it killed a half - dozen people named Johanssen on that Sunday would it mean that lightning is suddenly targeting Swedes . )
Yet you can bet that if any half - dozen people are killed by lightning one Sunday , you ’ll soon see a special report along the lines of , LIGHTNING : IS IT OUT TO GET US ?
We ’ve seen this propensity on display with shark attacks , meningitis , last year ’s rash of amusement - park fatalities , and any number of other “ random event clusters ” that occur for no reason anyone can explain .
Journalists overreact to events that fall well within the laws of probability .
They treat the fact that something happened as if we never before had any reason to think it could happen — as if it were a brand - new risk with previously unforeseen causation .
Did America become more vulnerable on 9/11 ?
Or had it been vulnerable all along ?
Indeed , it could be argued that America today is far less vulnerable , precisely because of the added vigilance inspired by 9/11 .
Is that how the media play it ?
Similarly , a bridge collapse is no reason for journalists to assume in knee - jerk fashion that bridges overall are any less safe than they ’ve been for decades .
Certainly it ’s no reason to jump to the conclusion that the nation ’s infrastructure is crumbling , which is how several major news outlets framed the collapse of the Interstate 35 W Bridge this past summer .
As Freud might put it , sometimes a bridge collapse is just a bridge collapse .
Alas , journalism needs its story line .
For a textbook example of the intellectual barrenness of so much of what ’s presented even as “ headline ” news , consider the Consumer Confidence Index and media coverage of same .
For decades , such indices have been telling America how it feels about its economic prospects .
The best known index has been compiled each month since 1967 by the Conference Board , a nonprofit organization dating to 1916 .
The Board ’s index is an arbitrary composite of indicators rooted in five equally arbitrary questions mailed to 5000 households .
( “ Do you see jobs as being easier or harder to get next year ? ” )
On Tuesday , October 30 , 2007 , the Board reported that its latest CCI had dipped to a two - year low .
The media jumped on the story , as is ever the case when the CCI dips .
( CCI upticks are seldom reported with the same fervor . )
Like many of its counterparts nationally , no doubt , a Philadelphia network affiliate sent its consumer affairs reporter trudging out to find consumers who lacked confidence .
She succeeded .
Few reporters bother to mention that , customarily , there has been only a tenuous connection between CCI numbers and actual consumer spending or the overall health of the economy as objectively measured .
In fact , just days after the release of the downbeat CCI , the Labor Department reported that the economy had generated 166,000 new jobs in October — twice the forecast .
That statistic , which measures reality , got nowhere near the same play as the CCI , which measures perception .
So let ’s recap .
We have a fanciful metric that ’s just a compilation of opinion , which is layered with further opinion from passersby , and then subjected to in - studio analysis ( still more opinion ) .
All of which is presented to viewers as … news .
The problem for society is that giving headline prominence to meaningless or marginal events exalts those events to the status of conventional wisdom .
“ Reporting confers legitimacy and relevance , ” writes Russell Frank , Professor of Journalism Ethics at Penn State University .
“ When a newspaper puts a certain story on page one or a newscast puts it at or near the top of a 22 minute program , it is saying to its audience , in no uncertain terms , that ‘ this story is important . ’”
The self - fulfilling nature of all this should be clear :
News organizations decide what ’s important , spin it to their liking , cover it ad nauseam , then describe it — without irony — as “ the 800 - pound gorilla ” or “ the issue that just wo n’t go away . ”
This is not unlike network commercials promoting sit-coms and dramas that “ everyone is talking about ” in the hopes of getting people to watch shows that apparently no one is talking about .
Tonight at 11 … the Apocalypse !
Far worse than hyping a story that represents just .5 percent reality , is covering “ news ” that ’s zero percent reality :
There literally is no story .
Even so , if the non-story satisfies other requirements , it will be reported anyway .
This truism was not lost on the late David Brinkley , who , towards the end of his life , observed , “ The one function that TV news performs very well is that when there is no news , we give it to you with the same emphasis as if there were . ”
On June 9 , 2005 , as part of its ongoing series of “ Security Updates , ” CNN airs a special report titled “ Keeping Milk Safe . ”
Over shots of adorable first - graders sipping from their pint cartons , CNN tells viewers that the farm - to - shelf supply chain is vulnerable at every point , beginning with the cow ; with great drama , the report emphasizes the terrifying consequences such tampering could have .
Nowhere does CNN mention that in the history of the milk industry , no incident of supply - chain tampering has ever been confirmed , due to terrorism or anything else .
Similarly , after the Asian tsunamis struck over Christmas 2004 , Dateline wasted no time casting about for an alarmist who could bring the tragedy closer to home : the familiar Could It Happen Here ?
motif .
The show ’s producers found Stephen Ward , Ph.D. , of the University of California at Santa Cruz .
In January , Dateline ’s East Coast viewers heard Ward foretell a geological anomaly in their very own ocean that could generate the equivalent of “ all the bombs on earth ” detonating at once .
The event Ward prophesied would unleash on New York City a wave containing “ 15 or 20 times the energy ” of the Asian tsunamis .
As a helpful backdrop , Dateline treated its viewers to spectacular visuals from The Day After Tomorrow , showing Manhattan ’s heralded landmarks disappearing beneath an onrushing , foamy sea .
But for sheer overwrought absurdity , it ’s hard to beat what took place in mid-September 1999 .
For six full days , journalists behaved as if there was one story and one story only : Hurricane Floyd .
The TV tempest commenced as the actual tempest still lolled hundreds of miles offshore , with no one certain how much of a threat Floyd posed , or whether it might fizzle before it hit land ( as so often happens — Katrina has changed the way we think about hurricanes , but Katrina was a once - in - a - generation event ) .
This was Saturday .
By Tuesday the hurricane - in - absentia had engulfed the nightly news .
While residents of areas in Floyd ’s projected path evacuated , the other side of the highway was clotted with news crews on their way in .
By Wednesday all of the networks had their parka clad correspondents standing on some coastal beach , each correspondent bent on looking wetter and more windblown than the next .
Sprinkled among all this were the requisite interviews with men ( and women ) on the street — as well as in insurance companies , emergency - services offices , local restaurants , and the like .
Bereft of an actual hurricane to show during this feverish build - up , The Today Show aired old footage of Hurricane Hugo ’s plunder of Charleston , in sledgehammer foreshadowing of the disaster to come .
Floyd caused a fair amount of damage when it finally hit on Thursday : 57 deaths and an estimated $ 6 billion in property loss .
But here ’s where things get curious .
By the time Floyd blew in , media interest clearly had ebbed .
On television at least , coverage of the aftermath was dispatched in a day or so , with occasional backward glances occupying a few moments of air time in subsequent newscasts .
Bottom line , the coverage of Floyd before it was a real story dwarfed the coverage given the storm once it became a story .
Evidently the conjured image of tidal waves crashing on shore was more titillating to news producers than film of real life homeowners swabbing brownish muck out of their basements .
Today ’s newspeople have substantially improved on one of the timeless axioms of their craft : “ If it bleeds , it leads . ”
They prefer the mere prospect of bad news to most other kinds of news that did occur .
The result is journalism as Stephen King might do it : the dogged selling of the cataclysm ’round the corner , complete with stage lighting and scenes fictionalized for dramatic purposes .
Sure , the camera loves suspense .
But … is suspense news ?
Is it really news that someone thinks a hurricane might kill thousands ?
It might kill no one , either , which is historically closer to the truth .
Honest journalism would wait to see what the storm does , then report it .
Granted , Floyd blew in during a slow week .
Following , though , is a sampling of the events that were largely ignored while the assembled media were waiting for Floyd :
The House of Representatives took a hard stand on soft money , approving limits on campaign spending .
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation of corporate America ’s fondness for cash balance pension plans , an issue that affected millions of workers , and stood to affect millions more .
The 17 member Joint Security Commission released a chilling report on America ’s handling of security clearance applications .
This , let us remember , was two years before the terror attacks of 9/11 .
Also covered with the media equivalent of a yawn that week were the terrorist bombings in Russia and the gruesome , continuing holocaust in East Timor .
The advance billing given to Floyd bespeaks a gloomy trend in broadcast news ’ continuing slide toward theater .
We witnessed this same phenomenon during the run-up to Desert Storm , Y2 K , and the Clinton impeachment , among others .
The Crusades — postmodern style
Nowhere are these foibles more noticeable — or more of a threat to journalistic integrity — than when they coalesce into a cause : so - called “ advocacy ” or “ social ” journalism .
To begin with , there are legitimate questions about whether journalism should even have causes .
Does the journalist alone know what ’s objectively , abstractly good or evil ?
What deserves supporting or reforming ?
The moment journalists claim license to cover events sympathetically or cynically , we confront the problem of what to cover sympathetically or cynically , where to draw such lines and — above all — who gets to draw them .
There are very few issues that unite the whole of mankind .
Regardless , as Tom Rosenstiel of the Project for Excellence in Journalism told USA Today , “ News outlets have found they can create more … identity by creating franchise brands around issues or around a point of view . ”
Worse , for our purposes , the data on which journalists premise their crusades are drawn from the same marginalia discussed above .
When Francisco Serrano was discovered to be living in the Minnesota high school he once attended , the media covered the 2005 story as if every American high school had a half - dozen homeless people living in it .
The actual episode , though exceedingly rare if not one - of - a- kind , became a window to the nation ’s social failings .
In his thinking and methodology , today ’s journalist resembles the homicide cop who , having settled on a suspect , begins collecting evidence specifically against that suspect , dismissing information that counters his newfound theory of the crime .
Too many journalists think in terms of buttressing a preconceived argument or fleshing out a sense of narrative gained very early in their research .
This mindset is formalized in journalism ’s highest award : the Pulitzer Prize .
Traditionally , stories deemed worthy of Pulitzer consideration have revealed the dark ( and , often as not , statistically insignificant ) underbelly of American life .
In 2007 the Pulitzer for “ public - service journalism ” went to The Wall Street Journal , for its “ creative and comprehensive probe into backdated stock options for business executives … ”
The Journal reported on “ possible ” violations then under investigation at 120 companies .
There are 2764 listed companies on the New York Stock Exchange ; NASDAQ adds another 3200 .
Not to dismiss the sincerity and diligence of the Journal ’s work , but what ’s the final takeaway here ?
That 120 companies ( 0.02 ) “ possibly ” cheated ?
Or that — so far as anyone knows — at least 5844 others did n’t ?
Food for thought :
Every time I fly , I ’m amazed that these huge , winged machines get off the ground , stay off the ground , and do n’t return to ground until they ’re supposed to .
Think about the failure rate of commonplace products : Light bulbs burn out .
Fan belts snap .
Refrigerators stop refrigerating .
But planes do n’t crash .
Actuarially speaking , they simply do n’t .
The entire process of commercial flight and the systems that support it is remarkable .
Do you fully understand it ?
I do n’t .
I ’m sure lots of people do n’t .
Still , you wo n’t win a Pulitzer for a piece that sheds light on the myriad “ little miracles ” that conspire to produce aviation ’s normalcy , stability and success .
You ’d be laughed out of today ’s newsrooms for even proposing such a piece ( unless you were doing it as the kind of feel - good feature that editors like to give audiences as gifts for the holidays ) .
Have a flight go down , however — one flight , one time — and have a reporter find some overworked ATC operator or other aberration that may have caused the disaster , and voila !
You ’re in Pulitzer territory for writing about something that — essentially — never happens .
Just as journalists who run out of news may create it , journalists who run out of real causes may invent them .
It ’s not hard to do .
All you need is a fact or two , which you then “ contextualize ” with more so - called expert opinion .
December 10 , 2004 was a banner night for exposing those well - known dens of iniquity that masquerade as Amish settlements .
Stories about rape and incest among the Amish appeared on both Dateline and 20 /20 .
The Dateline story even made reference to the principal character in the story that aired an hour later on 20 /20 — which gives you some idea how common the abuse may be , if seasoned journalists must choreograph their exposés around the same incident .
That brings us to Elizabeth Vargas and her question for 20 /20 ’s expert on Amish affairs : Just how widespread is this abuse ?
Amid stock footage of adorable children strolling down a dusky road in suspenders and bonnets , the expert tells America that it ’s “ not a gross exception . ”
What kind of reporting is that ?
Does it indicate that 1 percent of Amish children are abused ?
Ten percent ?
Forty percent ?
Who knows ?
This is what passes for investigative journalism nowadays .
Their world … and they ’re welcome to it
The world we ’re “ given ” has an indisputable impact on how Americans see and live their lives .
( How many other events are set in motion by the “ truths ” people infer from the news ? )
Here we enter the realm of iatrogenic reporting : provable harms that did n’t exist until journalism itself got involved .
In science journalism in particular , the use of anecdotal information can have results that would be comical , were it not for the public alarm that often results in response .
Pop quiz : How many Americans have died of Mad Cow Disease ?
Before you answer , let ’s look to Britain , where the scare began in earnest around 1995 after a few herd of cattle were found to be infected .
First of all , in the cows themselves , what we call “ Mad Cow ” is technically bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or BSE .
When BSE species - jumps to humans , it manifests itself as something called variant Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease , or vCJD .
( “ Non- variant ” CJD occurs independently of cows and can even be inherited . )
A link between BSE and vCJD was established in 1996 .
British reporters went scurrying to find epidemiologists who were alarmed by the discovery , some of whom obligingly put the death toll in the coming years above 500,000 .
By late 2006 , the end of Mad Cow ’s first documented decade , the U.K. had confirmed a total of 162 human deaths — nothing to be glib about .
But that ’s a long way from 500,000 .
( Undaunted , enterprising British reporters have begun talking about “ mad sheep . ”
No joke . )
And here in the U.S. ?
The CDC describes two confirmed deaths , both involving people born and raised abroad .
A third case involves a man from Saudi Arabia who remains alive at this writing .
Not what you might ’ve expected , eh ?
Nevertheless , when a New Jersey woman , Janet Skarbek , became convinced that an outbreak had killed off her neighbors , she found a warm welcome in newsrooms .
Her dire pronouncements touched off a mini hysteria .
Even after the CDC eliminated vCJD as a factor , the media kept fanning the fires of public concern , typically by quoting Dr. Michael Greger , a part time chef and full - time alarmist who labels Mad Cow “ the plague of the 21st Century . ”
When journalists want a fatalistic sound bite on the disease , they dial Greger ’s number .
However history may remember Mad Cow as an actual pathology , this much is sure :
The media inflamed scare has been fatal to jobs — most directly in the meat packing industry , but in related enterprises as well .
It has soured consumers on beef .
It has caused volatile swings in livestock prices .
It has mandated new protocols that add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the average cattle rancher ’s cost of doing business .
It has caused us to cut ourselves off from key beef suppliers , fomenting minor crises in diplomacy and commerce .
A 2005 survey reckoned the total cost of Mad Cow to U.S. agricultural interests at between $ 3.2 billion and $ 4.7 billion .
This , for something that has killed far fewer Americans in 10 years than the 200 who die each month from choking on food or food substances .
To hear the media tell it , we ’re under perpetual siege from some Terrifying New Disease That Threatens to End Life as We Know It .
It ’s too soon to render verdicts on the ultimate impact of avian flu , but that pathogen would have to wipe out many millions in order to justify the hype .
Lyme Disease ?
The Cleveland Clinic has this to say : “ Although rarely fatal and seldom a serious illness , Lyme Disease has been widely publicized , frequently overdramatized , and sometimes linked to unproven conditions . ”
Is it coincidence that visits to national parks began tracking downward in 1999 , amid media coverage that made it sound as if deer ticks and the rest of Mother Nature ’s foot - soldiers had declared war on humankind ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
In science reporting and everywhere else , there ’s no minimizing the psychic effects of regularly consuming a world - view rooted in peculiarity , much of which is pessimistic .
In a 2003 Gallup poll , just 11 percent of respondents rated crime in their own neighborhoods as “ very serious ” or “ extremely serious , ” yet 54 percent of those same respondents deemed crime in America as a whole “ very serious ” or “ extremely serious . ”
The catch - 22 should be apparent :
If crime were that pervasive , it would have to be occurring in a lot more than 11 percent of the respondents ’ “ own neighborhoods . ”
Such an enigmatic skew can only be explained in terms of the difference between what people personally experience — what they know firsthand — and the wider impressions they get from the news .
Figuratively speaking , we end up drowning in the tides of a hurricane that never makes shore .
I give you , herewith , a capsule summary your world , and in far less than 22 minutes :
The current employment rate is 95.3 percent .
Out of 300 million Americans , roughly 299.999954 million were not murdered today .
Day after day , some 35,000 commercial flights traverse our skies without incident .
The vast majority of college students who got drunk last weekend did not rape anyone , or kill themselves or anyone else in a DUI or hazing incident .
On Monday , they got up and went to class , bleary - eyed but otherwise okay .
It is not being a Pollyanna to state such facts , because they are facts .
Next time you watch the news , keep in mind that what you ’re most often seeing is trivia framed as Truth .
Or as British humorist / philosopher G.K. Chesteron whimsically put it some decades ago , “ Journalism consists in saying ‘ Lord Jones is dead ’ to people who never knew Lord Jones was alive . ”
Making your face presentable for high definition is tough , which is why the makeup brand Cargo is carrying a " blu_ray " brand makeup — trademarked , no less — that 's supposed to cover up any Cameron Diaz - level skin problems .
It 's unlikely that Sony will be pleased that someone 's calling dibs on a brand they spent billions on building , but since this is in the makeup space , they might be SOL .
We 're sure Cargo 's glad they do n't have to make an " hd_dvd " branded makeup kit .

Texans protest against planned NAFTA superhighway Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday February 21 , 2008
|
Print This Email This As Senators Clinton and Obama prepared to debate in their state , Texans were marching in protest over the NAFTA superhighway known as the Trans - Texas Corridor , or I - 69 , the primary purpose of which is to speed the delivery of goods coming in from Mexico to proposed inland ports .
The TTC is planned to span the state of Texas from Laredo , on the Mexican border , to Texarkana , on the border with Arkansas , to continue north to Canada .
The projected cost is $ 183 billion over fifty years , with no American companies expressing interest in financing it .
With no public approval required to begin construction , repeated calls against the TTC at public meetings , with seldom a word of support , may easily go unheeded .
" This is about international - - global companies that are coming in and having their way with our politicians , " says Terri Hall of TexasTURF .
" It does n't matter what does to the people in the path , " she continues , " it does n't matter what it does to our way of life ... "
" Citizens here , " says an unidentified man at a public hearing , " are not going to bear the burden so Wal - Mart can get their cargo into the U.S. cheaper and faster . "
Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) is among opponents of the TTC , doubting the intentions of those planning its construction .
He cites millions of acres subject to eminent domain , which the state promises to use against landowners who protest , and also notes that he has yet to encounter a person that supports the TTC .
" Frankly , " says Texas Department of Transportation 's Phil Russell , " we 're in a different day and age right now , and the way we built our roadways fifty years ago simply is n't keeping up with the congestion that we 're seeing here in Texas now . "
" This is really messing with Texas , " quips an incredulous Lou Dobbs to anchor Bill Tucker .
" You can't tell me that Governor Rick Perry and the head of the Department of Transportation down there -- that they 're dumb enough to say that , because all of this traffic 's coming out of Mexico , that Texas citizens should be funding the highway that is needed as a result of that traffic .
That 's absolutely idiotic . "
" If people are putting up with this nonsense from their state government , and Governor Rick Perry , and their Department of Transportation , " Dobbs continues , " these are n't the Texans that I know , and who I respect mightily . "
The report , broadcast on CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight on February 19 , 2008 , is available to view below .
Diablo Cody aka Candy Girl Wrote ' Juno ' Oscar Contender ( Photos )
is the pen name for .
The writer and blogger was first known for her yearlong stint of stripping and doing peepshows in Minneapolis .
She chronicled her escapades in a 2006 memoir , Candy Girl : A Year in The Life of an Unlikely Stripper .
Cody , 29 , wrote her first screenplay two years ago and against all odds , it has turned golden for her .
The 2007 movie , Juno , tells the story of a 16 year old who finds herself pregnant .
The movie , directed by Jason Reitman , was rolled out in limited release , beginning in early December .
It has picked up momentum , rave reviews and is developing an Oscar buzz .
She has several other screenplays in the works , including a Showtime pilot The United States of Tara , that she is working on with Steven Spielberg .
Calling herself an emotional scavenger , the writer admits to being fascinated with stripping and all things seedy .
She told David Letterman that the reason she changed her name was because Brook sounded tedious .
Diablo means devil .
She is married to graphic designer Jon Hunt .
The former exotic dancer called her current life both charmed and frenzied .
The media hype is way over the top right now but she is doing what she can to keep herself grounded under the sudden onrush of success .
Entertainment Weekly named Cody to their 50 Smartest People in Hollywood .
Her film is a runaway hit that has been nominated for three Oscars , including one for Writing ( Original Screenplay ) .
Not bad for a woman who is still young and finding her way .
Today ’s Wall Street Journal includes an editorial attacking Senate Democrats like Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for their work to stop retroactive immunity and pass legislation that includes congressional and judicial oversight of domestic surveillance .
Not surprisingly , a paper that has cheered every rollback of rights under the Bush administration does n’t miss this opportunity to proudly display their urine - soaked bedsheets of fearful anti-constitutionality .
“ We lost every single battle we had on this bill , ” conceded Chris Dodd , which ought to tell the Connecticut Senator something about the logic of what he was proposing .
Really ?
How , exactly , does the lack of political will to defend the rule of law challenge the logic of standing up for the rule of law ?
I suppose the WSJ thinks something is only worth doing if you know you ’ll win in the end , an attitude reflecting a complete lack of guiding principle .
I do n’t doubt that the WSJ would be happier if Dodd and others let the Bush administration shred the Constitution and give the big telecom companies special treatment behind closed doors , with no prying eyes , questioning journalists , or engaged citizens .
Business was certainly better for the telecoms when customers were n’t running away in response to their behavior .
To the extent that Dodd et alia were able to bring attention to what the Bush administration and companies like Verizon and AT&T have perpetrated , the WSJ has had to watch their pals get smeared with the truth .
It says something about his national security world view , or his callowness , that Mr. Obama would vote to punish private companies that even the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee said had “ acted in good faith . ”
But what does it say about the WSJ ’s national security world view or their editorial board ’s callowness that the other three congressional committees that considered retroactive immunity – the Senate Judiciary , House Intelligence , and House Judiciary Committees – all said that the telecoms did not act in good faith , but rather should be held accountable through normal judicial processes for their behavior ?
The WSJ and the Republican Party on whole have tried to spread the myth that because the SSCI thinks retroactive immunity is a good idea , all relevant committees think they do .
It simply is n’t true , though it ’s been used effectively and helped secure retroactive immunity in the Senate ( praise be to Jay Rockefeller ) .
Had Senator Obama prevailed , a President Obama might well have been told “ no way ” when he asked private Americans to help his Administration fight terrorists .
Mr. Obama also voted against the overall bill , putting him in MoveOn.org territory .
Really ?
Because according to the US Senate and , um , history Obama did not vote against the overall bill .
He voted for a number of good amendments earlier day and he voted against cloture , but the WSJ is not only playing fast and loose with the facts , but actually making things up .
I ’d have to guess Obama did not do what MoveOn.org wanted on final passage .
Getting to the actual hypothetical levied in this bumbling attack by the WSJ , I ’d hope telecoms say no if President Obama asks for their help .
If he makes the simple step of getting a warrant , I ’d certainly expect the telecoms to comply .
I have n’t heard of a single documented case where the telecoms refused to help the US Government spy on suspected terrorists when a warrant is forthcoming ; to do so would surely land them in far greater legal hot water than their current plight .
The defeat of these antiwar amendments means the legislation now moves to the House in a strong position .
Read that sentence again .
One word should stand out .
Antiwar ?
This legislation had nothing to do with the war .
It did n’t have anything to do with Iraq – it did n’t even have anything to do with Afghanistan .
It ’s a broad package of laws governing how the US government can monitor Americans .
Pretending otherwise goes beyond the realm of Republican framing and circles right back to , well , where they were in the previous paragraph , making things up about Obama ’s votes .
It ’s lunacy , derived from their need to lie about what is going on in order to present a favorable case for their positions .
I ’d say that this editorial farce is an embarrassment to their paper , but it ’s the Wall Street Journal , so this is pretty standard for them .
The rivalry and violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims is n't just limited to Iraq .
It is increasingly found in one place presumed shut off from the influence of faraway sectarian politics : New York 's state prisons .
In the last two decades , the state 's Muslim inmates , who number 7,987 , have been increasingly identifying as either Sunni or Shiite , a phenomenon that prison chaplains elsewhere say is most pronounced in New York .
Shiite inmates , who make up less than 4 % of the Muslims incarcerated here , have long reported religious persecution by the Sunni - dominated Muslim chaplaincy employed by the state .
The Sunni -Shiite divide has played a role in at least one stabbing between inmates in 2004 , e-mails by prison officials show .
Shiite inmates have long demanded their own chaplains and a separate place to pray on Fridays , apart from other Muslim inmates .
A little - noticed federal court ruling improves the prospects that Shiite inmates will see their demands met .
The recent ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opens the way for a trial in which jurors will weigh the demands of Shiite inmates seeking a separate Friday prayer service against the staffing and logistical concerns of prison officials .
The court ruling overturns a court decision by a federal judge in Syracuse , Paul Magnuson , who ruled last year that Shiite Muslims could either pray individually from their cells or join the general Muslim service , which Shiite inmates say is Sunni - dominated .
Noting that at least five Shiites are needed for a prayer quorum , Judge Magnuson said there even were n't likely enough participating Shiite inmates at any facility to constitute a valid communal prayer .
The 2nd Circuit 's decision asks Judge Magnuson to look closer at whether joint prayer with Sunnis impinges on Shiite beliefs and at the prison system 's capacity to accommodate separate prayer services .
The three federal judges who sent the case back to Judge Magnuson were Roger Miner , Jose Cabranes , and Paul Crotty .
One chaplain said he was not aware of any other state prison system currently offering a separate Shiite service .
" I 've not heard of that being a big issue in other places , " a vice president of the American Correctional Chaplains Association , A.J. Sabree , said .
Imam Sabree , who is a Muslim chaplain in Georgia 's state prisons , questioned why a prison system should distinguish between the two Muslim denominations when inmates from a variety of Protestant groups routinely pray together .
" That would be similar to Baptists saying they did n't want to worship with United Methodists , " he said .
The New York State Department of Correctional Services offers a general Catholic and Protestant service , as well as occasional Greek Orthodox , Jehovah 's Witness , and Seventh - day Adventist services , a prison spokesman , Erik Kriss , said .
The state offers services for Jewish inmates , but does not distinguish between the various movements within Judaism .
Services are also offered for inmates who follow Nation of Islam , Rastafarianism , and Native American religions .
But New York State has argued that a separate Shiite service in addition to the generic Muslim service would not be feasible because of space considerations and the funds required for staff to supervise another set of services .
The official tally of Shiite inmates is 60 , a prison spokesman , Erik Kriss , said , adding that the prison system estimated between 200 and 300 inmates identified as Shiite .
The prison system began counting Shiite inmates in 2001 , although some refused to cooperate in the count .
Doing so required filling out a " Change of Religious Designation Form , " which , according to court papers , bothered some inmates , who said it was the prison 's tallying system , not their religious beliefs , that had changed .
In a given prison facility , there might be between three and seven Shiite inmates , according to several estimates .
The Friday prayer service of the two groups is generally similar in content .
The most noticeable difference may be visual : Sunnis generally cross their arms during prayer , while Shiites leave them by their side .
One plaintiff , Antwon Dennis , who is serving a life sentence for murder , said in a deposition that he needs a separate service led by a Shiite inmate or chaplain for his prayers " to be valid . "
The prison system 's " failure to recognize that Shiite and Sunni Muslims have unique religious traditions , practices , and beliefs is incomprehensible , " a lawyer for the plaintiffs , Claire Coleman of Brune & Richard LLP , said .
Depositions and an interview with one former inmate suggest that some Muslim inmates started identifying as Shiite while in prison beginning in the late 1980s .
Several of the five Shiite plaintiffs were Sunni at one point .
One plaintiff , Hussein Razi-Bey , 57 , sentenced for attempted murder and kidnapping , found Shiite Islam after trying several other religions .
During sentences in Minnesota and Missouri in the 1960s , Razi - Bey converted first to Nation of Islam , then to Catholicism , then to Baptism .
Later , after several years with the Moorish Science Temple , he embraced Shiite Islam while incarcerated in New York , according to his deposition .
Inmates learn about Shiite Islam from other inmates and through mail order books received from publishing houses as far away as Iran , one former inmate , who asked not to be identified , said .
The plaintiffs say the more than 40 Muslim chaplains employed by the state are predominately Sunni and influenced by the Saudi Arabian movement of Wahhabism .
" In the places where it 's been most tense , a lot of times the chaplains have been at fault , " a Muslim chaplain who retired in 2006 from the prison system after 18 years , Dawoud Adeyola , said .
He is not connected to the lawsuit .
The Muslim prison chaplaincy has been under scrutiny since a 2003 Wall Street Journal article disclosed that after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , two New York chaplains spoke in support of the attacks .
The state prison system has reached out to Shiite leaders in the city for help in hiring Shiite chaplains for inmates , but those efforts have run into difficulties .
An early candidate to be the prison 's first Shiite chaplain was terminated during a try - out period after he was found trying to bring a knife into the Sing Sing Correctional Facility , one source said .
The only Shiite prison imam , Muhammad Abdulmubdi , currently employed by the state is in an unusual position :
He is barred from entering any prison pending the outcome of an internal investigation into whether he broke an undisclosed regulation , a source said .
Mr. Kriss , the spokesman would not comment , and further details were not available .
A few years ago , Rob Bateman worked as a programming lecturer at Bourenmouth University .
Like many instructors , Rob put his notes , assignments , and resources on his webpage , available for all to see .
It was n't anything particularly interesting or exciting , mostly just stuff like this ...
However , ever since posting his materials online , he 's received a steady trickle of e-mails from students around the world .
They 're not unlike this one that one arrived on 19th Nov 2007 ....
Dear Rob First of all sorry for my English is n't really good : -)

( CNN ) -- U.S. presidential candidates Wednesday condemned Saudi justice after a rape victim was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail .
Calling the decision " an outrage , " Sen . Hillary Clinton urged President Bush to protest the decision to the Saudi authorities .
" The Bush administration has refused to condemn the sentence and said it will not protest an internal Saudi decision , " the Democrat presidential front - runner said in a statement .
" I urge President Bush to call on King Abdullah [ of Saudi Arabia ] to cancel the ruling and drop all charges against this woman . "
Some of Clinton 's rivals also weighed in .
The decision to punish the victim of a gang rape " is an appalling breach of the most fundamental human rights , " said Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards .
" I am outraged that President Bush has refused to condemn the sentence , " he said .
Meanwhile , Democratic presidential hopeful Sen .
Joe Biden accused the Saudi judiciary of not only trying to silence this victim , but also trying to prevent future victims from coming forward .
The controversy relates to an incident in March 2006 when the woman , then age 18 and engaged to be married , and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif , Saudi Arabia , by a group of seven men .
She was later raped .
The man and woman met so she could retrieve an old photo of herself from him , according to Abdulrahman al - Lahim , her lawyer , who cited phone records from the police investigation that said the man was trying to blackmail her .
Al - Lahim says the photo did not show his client in a compromising position .
In October , the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years for the assault .
She was convicted of violating the kingdom 's strict Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall .
The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes -- but when she appealed , the court more than doubled her sentence to 200 lashes .
A court source told Arab News , an English - language Middle Eastern daily newspaper , that the woman 's sentence was increased after she spoke to the media about the case .
But a Saudi Justice Ministry statement said the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence .
Watch the Saudi government defend the court decision »
The case , which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system , drew a strong reaction from Washington , where State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. officials had " expressed astonishment " at the sentence , though not directly to Saudi officials .
He said that it was " within the power of the Saudi government to take a look at the verdict and change it . "
There also has been a strong international response .
Lamri Chirouf , director of Middle East Research for Amnesty International , said : " There is no doubt that this is a direct result of the severe discrimination to which women are subjected in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... which includes at the heart of it denial of the right of the freedom of movement .
" Human rights are universal values , they 're shared by all human beings .
They 're not to stop at frontiers , so they should be the concern of everyone . "
Human Rights
Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah " to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . "
Al - Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice next month , where he faces a possible three - year suspension and disbarment , according to Human Rights Watch .
He said he has appealed to the Ministry of Justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with Justice Minister Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ibrahim Al Al - Sheikh .
" Currently she does n't have a lawyer , and I feel they 're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights , " he said .
" We will not accept this judgment and I 'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place . "
He said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the Saudi king earlier this month .
" The Ministry of Justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because I consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz started and against Saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions , " he said .

Just For Fun : Autostereograms in Haskell
I ’ve added some code here , which I wrote last night , to generate autostereograms from depth maps .
It ’s written in Haskell , but that does n’t mean you should blame Haskell for its shortcomings .
To use :
Install GHC and gtk2hs .
Any recent version should do .
Copy this code into a file and build with ghc -- make - O2 The File.hs .
Generate a tiling background image of your choice .
GIMP ’s Filter -> Map ->
Make Seamless helps a lot with this , and it has some nice options under Filter ->
Render to generate nice - looking images .
The important thing is for your image to be seamlessly tileable , and have lots of easily identifiable points .
Save it as a PNG file .
Generate a depth map , on the order of about 100 x 100 pixels .
( Too much larger , and you ’ll have to profile and optimize my code for me . )
Save it as a PNG file again .
Run the program with the depth map and the background image ( in that order ) as parameters .
This code basically works , and realistically that ’s about all I am going to do right now .
There are lots of things that could be improved about it .
The big three are : lots of performance issues ; should be able to write out to a file instead of just the screen ; and there ’s something funky in the drawing that causes the depth to slope outward rather gently to each side no matter what the depth map looks like .
As far as performance , the problem is with a lot of fiddling with lists for control flow ; I was able to do considerably better with Cairo ; but unfortunately , Cairo ’s matrices only allow for affine transformations , which does n’t seem to be quite enough to scale between arbitrary trapezoids , so the result did n’t look great and I reverted to drawing pixel by pixel .
The last problem may be a rather fundamental issue in how I ’m approaching the problem ; but the current code works well enough to get the point .
Here are some obligatory screen shots .
The event has been described as " a once in a lifetime " show Tens of thousands of people have joined in a launch party for Liverpool 's year as European Capital of Culture .
Former Beatle Ringo
Starr helped get the party under way by performing on the 100 ft - high roof of St George 's Hall in the centre of the city .
He was joined by acrobats who dangled on wires from cranes - designed to reflect the building work which has transformed the area .
The opening party kicks off a year - long programme of more than 350 events .
Fireworks exploded from the top of St George 's Hall and lights and projections bathed the Neo-Classical masterpiece and other surrounding buildings , including the Empire Theatre and Lime Street station .
As well as suspending the acrobats , some of whom appeared to dash up the side of St George 's Hall , the cranes also hoisted shipping containers , which were designed to symbolise the city 's shipping heritage .
Organisers hope the Capital of Culture tag will attract an extra two million visitors and boost the economy by £ 100 m .
The ceremony began at 2008 GMT and boasted a list of 600 performers , including Starr , former Eurythmics frontman Dave Stewart and The Wombats .
Ringo Starr performed on the roof of St George 's Hall
Restoring city pride
The show 's design was drawn up by director Nigel Jamieson , responsible for the opening ceremony for the Sydney Olympic Games .
It took more than 100 tonnes of staging , 2.5 miles ( 4 km ) of fibre optic cabling and 250 people more than 40,000 hours to set up .
Two 40 ft ( 12 m ) screens were erected to help the crowd on Lime Street enjoy the show .
Despite earlier criticism , Phil Redmond , Brookside creator and deputy chairman of the Culture Company said he was sure it would go to plan : " It 's like a scouse wedding - a lot of rowing but it gets there in the end . "
On Saturday the new Echo Arena will play host to a musical extravaganza which will showcase some of the most famous names in Merseyside music .
Ringo Starr , Echo and The Bunnymen , The Farm , Riuven , The Wombats , Pete Wylie , Vasily Petrenko and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra took centre stage alongside community choirs and gospel groups in the " once in a lifetime show " .
At a news conference the former Fab Four drummer said he was proud to be a part of the celebrations .
" I 'm from Liverpool , I do feel that - it 's in my soul .
" It has changed so much over the years but the atmosphere of the city does n't change - it 's still here . "
Liverpool 's art galleries and museums will also be open to visitors until 2200 GMT .
Experts at the North West Development Agency have predicted that the year - long title and other planned events could net £ 50 m from tourists .
They also expect the same amount again to be generated on Merseyside .
Peter Mearns , executive director of marketing at the NWDA , said : " As the celebrations get under way for Capital of Culture the eyes of the world will be on England 's North West and it is critical that we seize this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to show the world exactly what we have to offer here .

Analysis
Every now and again , an event comes along and takes our breath away by reminding us just how far out of step the legal system can be with today 's changing world .
The latest example is last week 's attempt by a federal judge in California to shutter Wikileaks , a website devoted to disclosing confidential information that exposes unethical behavior .
Almost a week after US District Judge Jeffrey
White unequivocally ordered the disabling of the guerrilla outfit , it remains up , and its foot soldiers are as defiant as ever .
More to the point , it continues to host internal documents purporting to prove that a bank located in the Cayman Islands engaged in money laundering and tax evasion - the same documents that landed it in hot water in the first place .
It remains doubtful that Wikileaks will ever be shut down .
That 's because the site , as reported earlier by the The New York Times Bits blog , is hosted by PRQ , a Sweden - based outfit that provides highly secure , no-questions - asked hosting services to its customers .
It has almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs .
Oh yeah , PRQ is also run by Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij , two of the founders of The Pirate Bay , the BitTorrent tracker site that , as a frequent target of the Hollywood elite , has amassed considerable expertise in withstanding legal attacks from powerful corporate interests .
Not that attorneys from the Julius Baer Bank and Trust , the bank accused of the misdeeds , have n't demanded PRQ disconnect the site .
" We have the usual small army of stupid lawyers that think we will piss our pants because they send us a scary letter , " Svartholm said in a telephone interview .
" We do employ our own legal staff .
We are used to this sort of situation . "
Also making a take - down difficult , Wikileaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations , keeps no logs and uses military - grade encryption to protect sources and other confidential information , according to an unidentified individual who answered a press inquiry sent to Wikileaks .
" Wikileaks certainly trusts no hosting provider , " the person wrote .
There 's a name for arrangements such as these .
It 's called " bulletproof hosting , " and it 's historically been used to insulate online criminal gangs against take - down efforts by law enforcers or private parties .
As Wikileaks has demonstrated , the measure can also be used by those engaging in civil disobedience .
Wikileaks uses a different term : " an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking . "
White House officials have a new theory about why President Bush 's job approval ratings are so low — the media keep harping on it so much that it 's become a self - fulfilling analysis .
" It 's a drumbeat in the media , " says a senior Bush adviser .
" It 's a constant narrative that he suffers from low job approval .
It should not be in the second paragraph of every story .
The media should report what he 's doing . "
Officials are pointing to new survey research by GOP pollster Ed Goeas of the Tarrance Group to make their point that many of Bush 's policies are very popular .
Those data were obtained by U.S. News and are described in the magazine coming out Monday .
Among the findings :
While 62 percent of likely voters disapprove of Bush 's job performance , 73 percent support his policy of going " on the offense against terrorists , " 65 percent agree that he has " kept Americans safe from terrorist attacks , " and 64 percent approve of his economic stimulus package passed by Congress earlier this year .

Horror director George A Romero reveals why he made his latest zombie film - and why the undead can't run .
Romero made the original Night of the Living Dead in 1968
When it comes to zombie movies , there is no man more revered than George A Romero .
Made for just $ 100,000 in black - and - white , his 1968 film Night of the Living Dead became a cult classic that spawned an entire genre .
It also generated four sequels , the latest of which , Diary of the Dead , is released in the UK this week .
Laden with gore , blood and apocalyptic doom , Romero 's work is not for the faint - hearted .
Alongside the carnage , though , the 68 - year - old director presents a telling and often satirical commentary on American society , culture and politics .
" All these films have been motivated by observations of what is happening out there in the world , " he explains .
Paranoia
" If you look at the films in sequence , they reflect 40 years of what was happening in North America . "
In 1978 's Dawn of the Dead , for example , the shopping mall setting enabled Romero to allude to the dangers of rampant , soulless consumerism .
Diary of the Dead continues the series ' tradition of gory horror
Land of the Dead 's vision of a US metropolis under siege , meanwhile , can be read as a parable about America 's post - 9/11 isolationism and paranoia .
So what was the thinking behind Diary of the Dead , which follows a group of film students documenting a zombie attack ?
" I wanted to do something about emerging media , " says the director , citing the phenomenal success of video sharing website YouTube .
" All of a sudden we 're all somehow electronically connected to one another . "
Diary , of course , is not the only picture this year to present its escalating horror from the point of view of a camera - wielding observer .
Monopoly
Recent monster epic Cloverfield utilised a similar technique , while Brian De Palma 's upcoming film Redacted - about US soldiers stationed in Iraq - is entirely made up of so - called " found footage " .
" We thought we were going to be the first ones out there , " says Romero .
The film follows a group of students filming a zombie outbreak
" But now we have to settle for being part of a trend .
I guess there must be some sort of a collective subconscious . "
Some critics have been less than kind about his latest effort , though that has not stopped the director putting a follow - up into development .
Suggest he has the artistic monopoly on this bleak horror sub - genre , though , and he is quick to demur .
" My work is my work , and I do n't particularly care what other people are doing , " he says .
" But I certainly do n't think of my films as being more pure than the others . "
On one matter , however , he is prepared to take a stand - the vexed question on whether zombies can run .
Stereotype
It all started with 2002 British movie 28 Days Later , in which a mystery virus turned people into shrieking , sprinting banshees .
The zombies in the Dawn of the Dead remake of 2004 were no less active - an acquired characteristic Romero , who did not direct the film , has strong opinions about .
Horror film Cloverfield employed a similar subjective technique
" Zombies do n't run , " he states firmly .
" They can 't !
Their ankles would snap .
" What did they do - wake from the dead and immediately join a health club ?
I do n't get it . "
Aficionados will be happy to hear that the zombies in Diary of the Dead conform to the usual shuffling , stumbling stereotype .
It will also no doubt tickle them that Romero has taken pains to devise new and inventive ways of despatching them .
" Every time I do one of these , I spend all my time in the shower thinking how I 'm going to knock these guys off , " he laughs .
" That 's where the applause comes from in my films - good zombie kills ! "
George A Romero's Diary of the Dead is out in the UK on 7 March .
It 's amazing how some good practices limp on for decades beyond their expiration date .
I still encounter people who insist that a method should have only one point of return - as if we 're all still littering our code with GOTOs , and the concept of a " black - box " function was never invented .
The way these same people go on about multiple exit points , you 'd think they were headlining in one of the grislier episodes of ER trying to patch up the latest guest - star casualty while predicting dire consequences for the patient as they lie , bleeding to death .
People who prefer the single exit point tend to feel very strongly about it .
But the reasons they give have never struck me as especially convincing .
The following stream of generic reasons reminds me of the cookie - cutter platitudes that they roll out at the end of the more nauseating US TV series that seek to emulate ER , over the soul - grinding background warble of James Blunt :
Bailing out early causes resource leaks .
That 's why we have the " finally " block .
( If you 're determined to have a single exit point , finally is the only way to achieve it .
But purists take note , System.exit ( ) still gets around it . )
Multiple exit points make code harder to refactor .
Yes , because simpler , clearer code is always harder to maintain .
Multiple exit points is a return to GOTO and spaghetti code .
Ironically , it 's single - exit - point code that 's the anachronism .
The whole reason this misguided principle came about was the reaction to spaghetti code that was structured programming .
In modern languages and runtimes , single - exit - point code is outmoded and can even be dangerous .
For example , the ubiquity of exceptions means that no method is ever guaranteed to have a single exit point .
Code as if it is , and you 're asking to be caught out .
Bailing out early creates an invisible " else " clause .
What rubbish .
A guard clause such as this :
if ( account == null ) return ;
at the top of a method is much clearer , than :
if ( account != null )
{ // 20 lines of code
// ( that are totally irrelevant if account is null )
// later ...
}
// and out we pop
Sometimes , trying to weave your code into a single return point results in setting of pointless flags and excessive nesting of " if..else " conditions .
It 's like wrapping a paper napkin around a seven - dimensional helix and trying to read the agile documentation off it .
Figuring out whether each block of code is relevant to the current program state becomes a game of lining up the curly braces to figure out where each clause finishes .
It 's easier to simply say : " Hey , I 'm halfway through a method but I 'm done .
I 'm outa here ! "
Artificially stretching the program flow to the end of the method just results in misleading code : implying that a block of code is relevant to a given state when the runtime really has no business still noodling around in there .
If it 's time to exit a method , exit the method already .
Adhering to an outdated maxim like " single exit point " results in a " one size fits all " approach to programming , which is hardly a good thing .
But religiously hacking in multiple return points would of course be bad as well .
If in doubt , go for the simpler , more expressive option which best communicates what the code means .
It 's more an article of faith than anything else .
It 's important to be able to take a step back and make a rational judgement call : this alone helps sort out the thinkers from the believers . ®

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush ’s fellow Republicans in Congress on Tuesday upheld his veto of a bill to ban the CIA from subjecting enemy detainees to interrogation methods denounced by critics as torture .
President George W. Bush makes a statement about the economy outside of the Oval Office at the White House in Washington , March 7 , 2008 .
Bush 's fellow Republicans in Congress on Tuesday upheld his veto of a bill to ban the CIA from subjecting enemy detainees to interrogation methods denounced by critics as torture .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
A largely party - line vote of 225- 188 in the Democratic - led House of Representatives fell short of the needed two - thirds majority to override the president .
Bush maintains that the United States does not torture , but has refused to discuss interrogation techniques , saying that doing so could tip off terrorists .
The CIA has acknowledged using a simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding on three terrorism suspects , including accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , but says it stopped using that method in 2003 .
Waterboarding has been condemned by many U.S. lawmakers , human rights groups and foreign countries as a form of torture .
In voting to sustain Bush ’s veto , Rep. Pete Hoekstra , a Michigan Republican , attacked Democrats for failing to approve a stalled Senate - passed bill that would expand the government ’s ability to track foreign targets .
“ Rather than holding a vote to give terrorists our ( interrogation ) playbook , Congress should be voting to strengthen the intelligence community ’s ability to spy on them , ” Hoekstra said .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , a Maryland Democrat , said Bush ’s veto had degraded the country ’s moral standing , undermined its international credibility and could expose U.S. military and intelligence personnel to the treatment .
The bill vetoed by Bush was a sweeping intelligence authorization measure .
A key provision would have required the CIA to comply with the rules set by the Army Field Manual in questioning detainees .
The rules forbid eight interrogation methods , including waterboarding , electric shock , beatings and mock executions .
They permit 19 techniques , mainly psychological , such as trying to convince detainees that cooperation will shorten the war and save their country .
White House press secretary Dana Perino hailed the vote .
“ The CIA program has produced critical intelligence and helped us prevent a number of attacks , ” Perino said .
“ An override of the president ’s veto would have diminished the intelligence community ’s ability to protect our nation . ”
Sen .
John McCain , an Arizona Republican who was tortured while a prisoner in the Vietnam war and is now his party ’s presumptive presidential nominee , opposed the bill .
“ I think that waterboarding is torture and illegal , but I will not restrict the CIA to only the Army Field Manual , ” McCain said last month .
Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois , competing for the Democratic presidential nomination , both backed the bill and denounced Bush ’s veto .

By now everyone knows that our top general in Iraq , David Petraeus , has been personally devastated by an ad MoveOn published last week asking if Petraeus had “ Betray[ed ] Us ” ( a play on his name ) by cooking the books on Iraq .
( Petraeus has cooked the books before , most recently when he was in charge of training the still - non - existent Iraqi security forces and repeatedly lied about how well it was going , and got chewed out by Ambassador Negroponte as a result ) .
To hear the Republicans talk ( President Bush attacked MoveOn today in a press conference and the House and Senate Republicans want to pass legislation decrying MoveOn ) , Petraeus has been sitting in a tent in the desert crying his eyes out , unable to engage the enemy for an entire week .
Which leads me to ask a very serious and troubling question :
If David Petraeus can’t handle being called a name , how is he going to handle Al Qaeda ?
PS The Senate just passed its legislation , with Hillary and the other Dem presidential contenders voting against it ( hear hear ) – well , that is , everyone except Obama , who voted for the Democratic alternative and then was a no - show for the vote on the GOP MoveOn - bashing bill .

UPDATE : Obama has released a statement about why he did n’t vote on the GOP MoveOn - bashing amendment
In light of the MySpace photo breach ( due to their negligence ) a couple of months ago , I got to wondering about other recent data breaches .
It turns out Attrition.org keeps a Data Loss Archive and Database that contains known data breaches since 2000 .
Records include date , number affected , groups involved , summaries , and links to reported stories and updates .
It ’s surprisingly detailed and even better , it ’s all available for download .
The above graphic shows the 10 largest data breaches which affected millions .
I thought the 800,000 records thieved from UCLA a couple of years ago ( that my information was unfortunately a part of ) was a lot .
That ’s nothing compared to these .
Notice the higher frequency as we get closer to the present ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Results of recent experiments provide “ definitive evidence ” that human embryonic stem cells can be used to generate cells that secrete insulin in response to glucose , like the beta-cells in the pancreas .
“ Development of a cell therapy for diabetes would be greatly aided by a renewable supply of human beta-cells , ” Dr. Emmanuel E. Baetge and colleagues , from Novocell Inc. in San Diego , comment in the research journal Nature Biotechnology .
In the study , the researchers show that pancreatic tissue , derived from human embryonic stems cells , can generate cells that are “ morphologically and functionally similar ” to beta-cells after being implanted into mice .
In addition , the team goes on to show that implantation of the stem cell - derived tissue stops glucose levels rising excessively in the animals .
These findings suggest that human embryonic stem cells could , in fact , represent a renewable supply of insulin - producing cells for treating diabetes , the researchers conclude .

Bottom - dwelling sand dollars are related to sea urchins and sea stars ( Image : GNU licence ) Cloned larvae ( right ) are smaller than non-cloned larvae ( scale bar : 0.2 mm ) ( Image : Dawn Vaughn )
It ’s a novel escape route that makes a mockery of the status of the individual : if you run the risk of being eaten , just clone yourself .
That is the approach taken by the larvae of sand dollars – marine animals related to sea urchins .
Advertisement
Fish are voracious predators of sand dollar larvae .
Dawn Vaughn and Richard Strathmann of the University of Washington , Seattle , found that when they put four - day - old sand dollar larvae in a tank with fish mucus , the larvae cloned themselves .
They did this by either splitting in two or by producing a small bud which detached itself and developed into a new larva .
Either way , the clones were smaller than the original larvae .
Sand dollars did not clone themselves if there was no fish mucus in the water .
Vaughn and Strathmann believe the larvae sense the mucus , interpret it as a sign that fish are nearby , and respond by producing clones .
Better odds
There is no parental care in this species .
“ [ The mother ] is on the seafloor , ” says Vaughn .
“ She has no idea what types of risk her offspring are going to meet , so the larvae respond to cues from predators . ”
Cloning gives the larvae ’s genes a greater chance of survival in two ways .
With two copies around one is statistically more likely to escape predation .
Also , the smaller clones are less likely to be detected by predators .
“ Studies indicated there is an optimal size below which fish do not detect their prey , ” says James McClintock , an ecologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , US , who studies how “ things that ca n’t run away from predators defend themselves ” .
Cloning does have a cost , however .
Vaughn and Strathmann found that cloned larvae developed into smaller sand dollars : just before metamorphosing into adults , the clones were on average one - third the volume of non-cloned individuals .
Unique response
This could make it more difficult for clones to survive as adults , which only reproduce sexually , but suggests that overall , the benefits outweigh the risks .
Cloning has been seen before in echinoderms – a group of marine organisms that have a five - axis symmetry , including brittle stars , sea stars and sea urchins , and sand dollars .
But in all cases , it has been in response to conditions that are favourable for growth , such as plentiful food or favourable temperatures .
“ This is the first demonstration that cloning can be induced by predation , ” says McClintock .
“ What is so unique in Vaughn ’s study is that this defence becomes a reproductive response – making more of yourself in anticipation of risk . ”
While this is the first demonstration in nature , cloning as a response to predation is common in science fiction – it ’s how Cylons in the TV show Battlestar Galactica , for example , cheat death .

I drove my own car to the prom , but it ’s been so long I do n’t remember if I bothered to wash it .
In this century , high school students want to make the ride to the prom something they - and their friends - will always remember .
12 promgoers in Racine , Wisconsin rode on a homemade parade float to the Park High School prom in 2004 .
The float was built onto a flatbed trailer , highlighted by 1,500 twinkling lights powered by a generator .
The teens and their families designed , built , and painted the float .
It ’s hard to beat a romantic leisurely ride behind horses .

Firefighter Mike Shultz and his date Amy Cochran traveled to the North High prom in 2006 aboard a Long Meadow ( Maryland ) Volunteer Fire Department truck , chauffeured by Deputy Chief Eckstine ( scroll down to the bottom of the linked page for the story ) .
Yes , it helps if you or your date is a firefighter !
But there are commercial fire trucks you can rent .
Renting a fire truck is easy in Britain , with many resources like Casey ’s Cars , where you can rent a red or pink fire truck as well as an ambulance .
There are a few rentals available in the US , such a Hire a Fire Truck Nikki Kennedy was delivered to the Muhlenberg South ( Kentucky ) High School prom in 2006 in a helicopter !
But you wo n’t want to earn the ride the same way she did .
In 2005 , Nikki was seriously injured in a traffic accident that left her in a coma for two weeks .
She was pronounced dead at the scene , but recovered and finished her senior year as a homebound student .
The Air Evac Lifeteam later voted her as a “ miracle patient ” and awarded her a ride to the prom in the air ambulance .

You can rent a limo , or a bus , or a hearse , but if you really want to make an impressive entrance at your prom , you can rent a replica of a famous vehicle from TV or the movies .
If you live in the UK , there are quite a few places you can hire such vehicles .
We ’ve featured the A - Team Van on Neatorama before .
Star Car Hire in Britain has replicas of the General Lee from The Dukes of Hazzard , the Delorean from Back to the Future , James Bond cars , and more movie and TV cars available for your prom .

One of the pair , known as GRA 06128 , whose origin is unknown
Studies of the extra- terrestrial rocks have revealed qualities that set them apart from any meteorites previously known to science .
Researchers are pondering where in our Solar System the meteorites could have originated .
An origin on Planet Venus has been discussed , but now looks unlikely .
The notion of a meteorite hailing from this hothouse world is highly contentious .
As yet , nobody has found one , probably because it is very difficult for rocks to escape Venus ' thick atmosphere and strong gravity .
Several scientists propose that the Antarctic meteorites broke away from a previously unrecognised reservoir of asteroids before falling to Earth .
The space rocks are much older than the majority of Venus ' surface - appearing to rule the planet out as the source .
The results have been discussed here at the 39th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference .
Origins unknown
The paired meteorites , known as GRA 06128 and GRA 06129 , were discovered in the Graves - Nunataks region of Antarctica in 2006 .
The rusty , slab - shaped rocks have defied classification , not fitting into any of the existing groupings drawn up for meteorites .
The meteorite family tree is getting bigger and bigger
Dr Caroline Smith ,
Natural History Museum , London
The pair 's distinctiveness has been revealed by analyses of their mineral make - up and of the ratios of different forms - or isotopes - of oxygen present in them .
Dr Ryan Zeigler , from Washington University in St Louis , US , has been studying samples from GRA 06128 .
He told BBC News : " It 's unique - it 's the only meteorite that has this much plagioclase ( a form of feldspar ) of this composition .
" There are other meteorites that have minerals of the same composition but not in anything approaching the same proportions . "
Chip Shearer , from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque , US , raised the possibility of a Venusian origin in the title to his conference talk .
But at the meeting , he acknowledged the reference was intended to be " provocative " .
Dr Shearer agreed the 4.5 - billion - year ages of the meteorites indicated the likely source was an asteroid .
" The history of this rock involves partial melting on a fairly primitive body , " he explained .
Even if the rocks had been blown off Venus in an impact 4.5 billion years ago , they could not have drifted in space for such a vast length of time before landing in Antarctica recently , scientists said .
Narrowed down
The identity of the object that spawned the two meteorites may be elusive , but researchers have been able to draw up a basic profile .
They know , for instance , that the parent body had " differentiated " - that is , had been reprocessed into a layered object , usually with a core , a mantle and a crust .
Stony meteorites which have undergone this reprocessing are known as achondrites .
" There has to be a finite number of differentiated parent bodies , " said Dr Zeigler , who also thinks an asteroid was the likely parent body .
" It 's got to be 200 km across or so to make an achondrite - to differentiate into basalts and a core .
We think we know where they all are , and - greater than 200 km - there are about 25 .
" Now , some could have been destroyed and so the number might be higher than that , but it 's not like there 's an infinite number of parent bodies in our Solar System where these could come from . "
So far , just one asteroid has been tied to a class of meteorites on Earth .
Spectral observations of the object 4 Vesta suggest it has about the same composition as the so - called Howardite , Eucrite and Diogenite ( HED ) meteorites .
Dr Caroline Smith , meteorite curator at London 's Natural History Museum , who was not involved in the studies , commented : " The meteorite family tree is getting bigger and bigger . "
She told BBC News : " Like a family tree for humans , when the tree gets bigger , you begin to see the various relationships between them . "
The Graves - Nunataks space rocks do share some similarities with another rare class of meteorite known as the brachinites .
But there are important differences which would preclude their easy inclusion in this category .

Distant relatives who married were found to have more children
The Science journal study found third and fourth cousin couples had more children than those more distantly related .
These cousins may be biologically more compatible , the specialist genetics firm deCODE concluded .
However , there was no advantage in partnerships involving first cousins .
Our results show that couples related at the degree of third to fourth cousins exhibited the greatest reproductive success
deCODE researchers
Evidence that related couples have more children has been found before , but there has always been doubt whether this is the result of similarities in their genetic makeup , or just the result of differences in the societies in which cousin marriages are common .
The deCODE team have access to a unique genetic record which allows them to unpick the interlocking family trees of Iceland .
In addition , Icelandic society and culture has been historically uniform across its population , making it easier to rule it out as an influence on the results .
The study was able to detect a distinct pattern of childbearing .
Between 1800 and 1824 , for example , third cousin couples - those who share great - great grandparents - had on average 4.04 children and 9.17 grandchildren , compared with 3.34 and 7.31 for couples composed of eighth or higher cousins .
A similar ratio for couples between 1924 and 1949 was spotted .
Fourth cousin couples - those sharing a great - great - great grandparent - were also likely to have more children , although more closely related cousins were not .
City life
This , said the researchers , perhaps reflected the genetic disadvantages of trying to have children with someone more closely connected .
A child will get two copies of every gene - one from each parent - and if they have one copy of a mutated gene that could harm their development , normally the other copy , from the other parent , is normal .
Close relatives , however , are more likely to each pass on the same disadvantageous gene .
The researchers wrote that the shift from smaller , rural communities to large cities - a feature throughout the modern world , was " a new situation for humans in evolutionary terms " .
If " kinship " did offer an advantage , they said , then urban living , which reduced the chances of close cousins becoming partners , could slow the birth rate .
Laurence Shaw , a fertility specialist from the Bridge Centre in London , said that the research again raised the question of whether cousins found it easier to conceive because their immune systems were more " tolerant " of each others .
He added : " The other thing I wonder is whether the limit of 10 set by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority as to the number of times a single sperm donor can be used could be re-examined in the light of this . "
WHO would have thought that a friendless theocracy with a Holocaust - denying president , which hangs teenagers in public and stones women to death , could run diplomatic circles around America and its European allies ?
But Iran is doing just that .
And it is doing so largely because of an extraordinary own goal by America 's spies , the team behind the duff intelligence that brought you the Iraq war .
It does n't take a fevered brain to assume that if Iran 's ayatollahs get their hands on the bomb , the world could be in for some nasty surprises .
Iran 's claim that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful is widely disbelieved .
That is why Russia and China joined America , Britain , France and Germany at the UN Security Council to try to stop Iran enriching uranium .
Until two months ago they seemed ready to support a third and tougher sanctions resolution against Iran .
But then America 's spies spoke out , and since then five painstaking years of diplomacy have abruptly unravelled ( see article ) .
The intelligence debacle over Iraq has made spies anxious about how their findings are used .
That may be why they and the White House felt it right to admit , in a National Intelligence Estimate in December , that they now think Iran halted clandestine work on nuclear warheads five years ago .
As it happens , this belief is not yet shared by Israel or some of America 's European allies , who see the same data .
But no matter : the headline was enough to pull the rug from under the diplomacy .
In Berlin last month , the Russians and Chinese made it clear that if there is a third resolution , it will be a mild slap on the wrist , not another turn of the economic screw .
At the same time , Iran is finding an ally in the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Its director - general , Mohamed ElBaradei , is a Nobel peace - prize winner who is crusading to confound those he calls “ the crazies ” in Washington by helping Iran to set its nuclear house in order , receive a clean bill of health and so avert the possibility of another disastrous war .
Honest spies , a peace - loving nuclear watchdog .
What can be wrong with that ?
Nothing : unless the honesty of the spies is deliberately misconstrued and the watchdog fails to do its actual job of sniffing out the details of Iran 's nuclear activities .
Thanks for letting us off
Beaming like cats at the cream , a posse of Iranians went to January 's World Economic Forum in Davos claiming a double vindication .
Had not America itself now said that Iran had no weapons programme ?
Was not Iran about to give the IAEA the answers it needed to “ close ” its file ?
In circumstances like these , purred Iran 's foreign minister , there was no case for new sanctions , not even the light slap Russia and China prefer .
Yet Iran 's argument is a travesty .
Although the National Intelligence Estimate does say that Iran probably stopped work on a nuclear warhead in 2003 , it also says that Iran was indeed doing such work until then , and nobody knows how far it got .
The UN sanctions are anyway aimed not at any warhead Iran may or may not be building in secret , but at what it is doing in full daylight , in defiance of UN resolutions , to enrich uranium and produce plutonium .
We need this for electricity , says Iran .
But it could fuel a bomb .
And once a country can produce such fuel , putting it in a warhead is relatively easy .
Some countries , it is true , are allowed to enrich uranium without any fuss .
The reason for depriving Iran of what it calls this “ right ” is a history of deception that led the IAEA to declare it out of compliance with its nuclear safeguards .
So it is essential that Mr ElBaradei 's desire to end this confrontation does not now tempt him to gloss over the many unanswered questions .
With a lame duck in the White House and sanctions unravelling , Iran really would be home free then .
Would it be so tragic if a tricky Iran were to slip the net of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ?
North Korea quit the treaty and carried out a bomb test in 2006 .
Israel never joined , saying coyly only that it wo n't be the first to “ introduce ” nuclear weapons into the region — but wo n't be the second either .
India and Pakistan , two other outsiders , have already strutted their stuff .
Why should one more gate - crasher spoil the party ?
One obvious danger is that a nuclear - armed Iran , or one suspected of being able to weaponise at will , could set off a chain reaction that turns Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Syria , even Turkey rapidly nuclear too .
America and the Soviet Union , with mostly only their own cold war to worry about , had plenty of brushes with catastrophe .
Multiplying Middle Eastern nuclear rivalries would drive up exponentially the risk that someone could miscalculate — with dreadful consequences .
Time for Plan B
For some this threat alone justifies hitting Iran 's nuclear sites before it can build the bomb they fear it is after .
But if Iran is bent on having a bomb , deterrence is better .
Mr Bush has already said that America will keep Israel from harm .
By extending its security umbrella to Saudi Arabia and Egypt , America might stifle further rivalry before the region goes critical .
Much better , however , to avoid a nuclear Iran altogether .
Mr Bush says diplomacy can still do this .
It is hard to see how .
But he does have one card up his sleeve : the offer of a grand bargain to address the gamut of differences between America and Iran , from the future of Iraq to the Middle East peace process .
So far Iran 's leaders have brushed aside America 's offer of talks “ anytime , anywhere ” and about “ anything ” by pointing to the condition attached : that Iran first suspend its uranium enrichment .
Strangely enough , the best way to put pressure on Iran 's rulers now is for America to drop that rider .
There would need to be a time limit or Iran could simply enrich on regardless , with what looked like the world 's blessing .
Similarly Russia and China would need to agree to much tougher sanctions to help concentrate minds .
Iran 's leaders may still say no .
But the ayatollahs would have to explain to ordinary Iranians why they should pay such a high price in prosperity forgone for making a fetish out of not talking , and out of technologies that are n't even needed to keep the lights on .
If Iran 's leaders cannot be persuaded any other way , perhaps they can be embarrassed out of their bomb plans .
Celebrate Good Times
Whenever a bloodthirsty dictator resigns or , even better , dies , I pause to celebrate .
I would have celebrated at Hitler ’s death had I been alive then .
Ditto Stalin .
And I did celebrate when Mao died .
I look forward to Fidel Castro ’s death .
After all the murders he has committed , he deserves it .
End the Embargo
At the same time , despite the knee - jerk reaction of the Bush administration in favor of keeping the embargo , this is a good time to end the U.S. embargo on Cuba .
Actually , it has always been a good time .
The case for ending the embargo has little to do with making Americans better off and lots to do with spreading American values  the good ones , not the bad ones  to make Cubans better off , both in their degree of freedom and in their economic well - being .
And now that Fidel Castro is officially out of commission , ending the embargo would be easier because the U.S. government would not have to worry so much about saving face .
The Moral Case for the Embargo
Let ’s step back and consider the proponents ’ case for the embargo .
They make two arguments .
The first is a straight moral argument : Castro ( we need not quibble with whether it ’s Raúl or Fidel ) is an evil man who heads an evil regime .
The Castros have murdered many innocent people , stolen a lot of property , and put many innocent people , including homosexuals , in prison .
So far , I agree with the argument .
But here ’s the non sequitur : because of all this , the U.S. government should forcibly prevent Americans from trading with Cuba .
Why is it a non sequitur ?
Because for the trade embargo to be a logical response to the vicious facts about the Cuban government , one would have to show that the embargo would speed the end of the Cuban government .
No one has done that .
Jeff Jacoby , in a 1998 article in the Boston Globe , made the moral argument above .
He ended his article with the following flourish :
" The key to Cuba ’s salvation does not lie in constantly attacking U.S. policy .
It lies in washing away the corrupt and fetid stain of Fidelismo .
The embargo is regrettable and has its costs , but it is not what keeps Cubans on their knees .
The dictator is .
Instead of harping on the embargo , American leaders should be saying , loudly and insistently , what every Cuban yearns to hear :
" ’ Castro must go . ” ’
But notice something interesting .
American leaders did say , loudly and insistently , that Castro must go .
And , at the same time , President Bush II strengthened the embargo .
What happened to Castro ?
He lasted more years in power .
His leaving power had nothing to do with the embargo ; it was caused by his bad health .
It is possible that Castro ’s bad health is due to lousy socialized medicine , but , if so , that ’s more his fault than it is the effect of the embargo .
If your moral argument is that a policy must be kept in place to achieve a certain end , and the policy clearly does not achieve that end , are n’t you morally obligated to reconsider the policy ?
Make the Victims Hurt More
Which brings us to the second argument for the embargo , which seems to go as follows .
By squeezing the Cuban economy enough , the U.S. government can make Cubans even poorer than Fidel Castro has managed to over the past 48 years , through his imposition of Stalin - style socialism .
Ultimately , the theory goes , some desperate Cubans will rise up and overthrow Castro .
There are at least three problems with this " make the victims hurt more " strategy .
First , it ’s profoundly immoral .
It could succeed only by making average Cubans  already living in grinding poverty  even poorer .
Most of them are completely innocent and , indeed , many of them already want to get rid of Castro .
And consider the irony : A defining feature of socialism is the prohibition of voluntary exchange between people .
Pro-embargo Americans typically want to get rid of socialism in Cuba .
Yet their solution  prohibiting trade with Americans  is the very essence of socialism .
The second problem is more practical :
It has n’t worked .
To be effective , an embargo must prevent people in the target country from getting goods , or at least substantially increase the cost of getting goods .
But competition is a hardy weed that shrugs off governmental attempts to suppress it .
Companies in many countries , especially Canada , produce and sell goods that are close substitutes for the U.S. goods that ca n’t be sold to Cuba .
Wander around Cuba , and you ’re likely to see beach umbrellas advertising Labatt ’s beer , McCain ’s ( no relation ) French fries , and President ’s Choice cola .
Moreover , even U.S. goods for which there are no close substitutes are often sold to buyers in other countries , who then resell to Cuba .
A layer of otherwise unnecessary middlemen is added , pushing up prices somewhat , but the price increase is probably small for most goods .
Some observers have argued that the very fact that the embargo does little harm means that it should be kept because it ’s a cheap way for U.S. politicians to express moral outrage against Castro .
But arguing for a policy on the grounds that it ’s ineffective should make people question the policy ’s wisdom .
Third , the policy is politically effective , but not in the way the embargo ’s proponents would wish .
The embargo surely makes Cubans somewhat more anti-American than they would be otherwise , and it makes them somewhat more in favor of  or at least less against  Castro .
Castro has never talked honestly about the embargo : he has always called it a blockade , which it manifestly is not .
But he has gotten political mileage by blaming the embargo , rather than socialism , for Cuba ’s awful economic plight and reminds his subjects ceaselessly that the U.S. government is the instigator .
Some Cubans probably believe him .
Moreover , there is another negative political effect .
The embargo prohibits Americans , other than journalists , academics , and a few others , from traveling to Cuba .
Imagine what would happen if the U.S. government completely ended this restriction .
The U.S. dollar , though weak in Europe , is strong in Cuba .
Many Americans would travel to Cuba , spending money and showing Cubans what normal Americans can afford .
It ’s true that Raúl Castro , like his brother , would try to control exchange .
Currently , foreign investors do n’t hire Cubans .
Instead , Castro has implemented the system that the Nazis used in Poland when Oskar Schindler hired Jews .
Rather than paying the Jews , Schindler had to pay the Nazis , who paid the Jews nothing .
Rather than hiring Cubans , foreign investors pay the Ministry of Labor , which keeps a large percent of it , and gives the workers a wage comparable to the best they could earn in the Cuban economy .
In 2006 , incidentally , Forbes estimated Fidel Castro ’s net worth to be a cool $ 900 million , based on the state - owned companies he controlled for his own purposes .
Although the Cuban government would try to control exchange , it would not be completely successful .
There would be all kinds of leakages to normal Cuban citizens .
This travel by Americans would not make Cuba as free as , say , Venezuela , but average Cubans would be freer nevertheless .
Competing decentralized nodes break down centralized control .
The Conquest of the United States by Cuba
In 1996 , far from ending the embargo , the U.S. government moved in the other direction with the Helms - Burton Act , named for then Senator Jesse Helms ( R - North Carolina ) and then Representative Dan Burton ( R - Indiana ) .
Its most controversial provision permits U.S. lawsuits against foreign companies if they use any property in Cuba that was confiscated from U.S. citizens .
To enforce this provision of the Helms - Burton law , the U.S. government makes America off - limits to corporate officers , principals , or shareholders with a controlling interest in firms that profit from confiscated U.S. property in Cuba .
The government used the law against a handful of Canadian and Mexican executives .
Not just the violators , but also their spouses , minor children , and agents are to be kept out of the U.S. Again , note the irony .
One of the most important achievements of free societies  one that distinguishes them most from totalitarian regimes  is that when one family member breaks the law , that person , not the other family members , pays the penalty .
Totalitarian governments violate this principle of individual responsibility all the time , and Castro was one of the main such violators left .
The U.S. government joined him .
Helms and Burton said they wanted to beat Castro .
Castro beat them  and us .
The more open trade is between Cuba and the rest of the world , the more experience Cubans will have with foreigners and foreign goods .
They will learn that they do n’t have to be poor , that meat once a day does n’t have to be a luxury , and that they do n’t have to die from socialized medicine .
The “ dollarization ” of the Cuban economy , under which Castro allowed people to exchange dollars for goods , has already started this process .
The more dollars that flow into Cuba , even with the nasty government taking a big cut , the less dependent Cubans are on the Cuban government for their daily bread .
When President Bush reduced the amount Cuban - Americans and other Americans can spend in Cuba from $ 164 a day to $ 50 a day , whatever his intention , he made Cubans more dependent on their vicious government .
One piece of evidence that advocates of the embargo must confront is Castro ’s own actions just before Congress voted on the Helms - Burton Act .
Here was a law that President Clinton had opposed and that , therefore , faced an uphill battle .
Yet on Feb. 24 , 1996 , just days before the vote , Castro had his air force shoot down two unarmed civilian airplanes piloted by members of the Miami - based exile group Brothers to the Rescue .
I ’ve heard many people claim , correctly , that Castro is evil ; I have n’t heard many people say that he ’s stupid .
Surely he knew that shooting down the plane would cause the Helms - Burton
Act to be passed , which is exactly what it did .
It seems much more reasonable to assume that Castro wanted the Helms - Burton
Act to pass so that he could use it as new ammo for his propaganda .
A Double Standard ?
The Bush administration , in wanting to keep the embargo on Cuba , is applying a double standard .
Many other governments in the world repress their citizens as much as Cuba ’s does , or at least have done so in the recent past .
Exhibit A is China .
But the U.S. government has imposed no embargo on China .
One of the strangest recent arguments for keeping the embargo is that of Henry Louis Gomez .
Gomez wrote :
" For once I ’d like for someone to explain how U.S. policy toward Cuba prevents the Castro regime from restoring basic freedoms ?
How exactly does the U.S. create a situation in which political opposition in Cuba must be silenced or jailed ?
The answer is obvious : it does n’t . "
Mr. Gomez is absolutely right in one regard .
U.S. policy does n’t prevent the Castro regime from restoring basic freedoms .
It ’s not as if Fidel and Raúl are looking for ways to restore freedom .
But Mr. Gomez is attacking a straw man .
The argument that we free - market opponents of the embargo make has never been that the embargo prevents the Cuban government from restoring freedom : the Castros want to keep restrictions on freedom .
Our argument , rather , is that the embargo makes it easier for the Castros to keep their country repressed .
For Mr. Gomez and those who agree with him to make their case , they must confront the point I made above  namely , that Castro is not dumb and , therefore , his shooting down of the airplanes just before Congress voted was his purposeful way of getting Congress to keep and tighten the embargo .
Conclusion
Some advocates of the embargo have pointed out that if full trade relations are resumed between the U.S. and Cuba , then Cuba ’s government will qualify for U.S. government aid .
Such aid would definitely prop up Castro ’s regime , as similar aid has done for tyrants in Africa and elsewhere .
So let ’s end the embargo and not give foreign aid to Cuba .
Will this guarantee that the Castros fade into much deserved oblivion ?
No it wo n’t .
But it will increase the odds .
Cuba Si , Castros No , Embargo No .

While police forces around the world search for the Indian doctor who scammed hundreds out of their kidneys , his wife and children remain barricaded behind security doors at their Brampton home .
Interpol , the international police organization , last week issued a rarely used " red notice " warrant for Dr. Amit Kumar requesting his arrest anywhere on the planet .
Kumar , dubbed " Dr. Horror " by the Indian media where his story has led to nationwide revulsion , is alleged to be the kingpin of an underground kidney trafficking ring .
Indian police believe the ring illegally harvested kidneys from as many as 500 unsuspecting Indians .
Most of the kidneys came from Indian labourers or farmers who say they were either duped , or forced at gunpoint , to give up a kidney .
The organs were then transplanted into wealthy clients , Indian or foreigners , in well - equipped underground clinics in residential areas .
It is illegal in India to sell a kidney ; the Interpol warrant charges Kumar with " crimes against life and health " and being part of a criminal enterprise .
" If he has done what police say he did , I hope he gets punished severely , " a Brampton neighbour told the Star .
Neighbours said Kumar , his wife Poonam Ameet , and their two boys , 5 and 4 , moved into the area last April and the children attend a local private school .
Documents obtained by the Star show the couple bought the four - bedroom home on Pali Dr. , in the predominantly Indian neighbourhood of Bovaird Dr. and Airport Rd. , in April 2007 for $ 610,000 .
" He told us he was a cardiovascular surgeon , with clients around the world , but he never once mentioned anything about kidneys . "
Kumar , who Indian police say is not a surgeon , was last seen in Brampton before Christmas driving a leased $ 65,000 Lexus 350 SUV .
While some found him " standoffish , " others said he seemed to be up front and candid .
" I 'm absolutely in shock , " said the neighbour , calling Kumar a " gem of guy " who brought him gifts from his trips to India .
" This is strange .
I 'm baffled .
I feel so let down . "
Kumar told him he was going back to India to wind down his businesses , which he said included a hotel , a hospital and several clinics .
He planned to open a hotel in Canada upon his return and was going to live and work here permanently .
Those plans were cut short on Jan. 24 , when Indian police , acting on complaints from victims , raided a clinic in a well - to - do area of Gurgaon , near New Delhi , arresting a doctor , several nurses and drivers .
But Kumar , who police say has at least six aliases with matching phony passports , managed to escape , leading some outraged media outlets in India to claim he was tipped off about the raids in advance .
So far , four doctors , five nurses , 20 paramedics , three private hospitals , 10 pathology clinics and five diagnostic centres have been implicated , said Mohinder Lal , the officer in charge of the investigation .

While the scandal has been raging in India for the past 10 days , friends in Brampton only learned their neighbour is alleged to be the notorious " Dr. Death , " and " Dr. Kidney " – as he 's been dubbed by the Indian media – after seeing his photo on newscasts .
" I was shocked , blown away , " said a neighbour .
" We used to joke at parties that he must be loaded to get such a beautiful wife , but nothing prepared us for this . "
Added one : " It 's very unusual for someone to come here from India and buy a big house like this and a Lexus .
Doctors in India just do n't make that kind of money . "
Poonam , 28 , has told friends on the street that her marriage to Kumar was arranged when she was 18 .
Amit has also confided that his first wife left him after his arrest in 1994 on suspicion of running a kidney transplant racket in Mumbai .
But police say he jumped bail , changed his name and set up again .
No one was answering the door at Kumar 's champagne brick home yesterday , but children could be seen peeking through the closed blinds .
A glass security door installed on Thursday was locked and a taped phone message said service " is temporarily disconnected . "
Emails on computers seized in the raids suggest Kumar was getting transplant inquiries from Canada .
A spokesperson for the RCMP said last week Canadian authorities had limited information about the Indian investigation but police had been in touch through Interpol .
Police said teams of kidney scouts roamed labour markets in Delhi and cities in Uttar Pradesh , India 's poorest state , searching for potential donors .
Some prospects were asked outright if they wanted to sell a kidney and offered $ 1,000 to $ 2,500 .
Others were forced at gunpoint or drugged .
The ring charged $ 50,000 for a transplant .

This past Tuesday , when
Bear Stearns
( BSC )
was trading around $ 65 a share , there was huge put volume in the March $ 30 strike .
Over 55,000 contracts traded that day at an average price of 15 cents a contract .
This is an extremely unusual trade in terms of the number of contracts and how far out - of - the money those options were at the time .
This begs the question of why someone would execute such a transaction .
First , it 's important to understand that buying a put gives you the right to sell the stock at the strike price .
So to buy a put that requires the stock to decline over 50 % is essentially a bet that the company is possibly on the brink of going out of business or about to deliver some terrible news .
Remember , these options expire on March 20 , so that left only 10 days for some event to occur that would cause these puts to go into the money and have some value .
So it appears that as rumors began swirling early in the week that Bear was having liquidity problems and might possibly be bordering on insolvent , someone took that to heart and bought the puts as disaster insurance .
And today came news that several banks , including
Goldman Sachs
( GS ) - Get Report
, would no longer act as a counterparty to any transactions with Bear .
The inability to execute trades would essentially put Bear Stearns out of business .
Hence , we have today 's selloff in which shares of Bear are down some $ 25 , or 44 % to around $ 30 a share .
It 's not a surprise that those $ 30 puts are the most active strike today .
With an hour left in the trading day , over 40,000 contracts have traded .
This surpasses the open interest of 36,000 contracts that were open as of this morning .
So not only do people appear to be taking profits ( and , of course , some huge losses ) , active option traders are gravitating toward the activity and the fact that implied volatility is still above 100 % , which provides good short - term trading opportunities .
It also suggest that Thursday 's volume of 14,129 contracts were people liquidating or taking profits when Bear got slammed down to an intraday low of $ 50.50 , which was about an 18 % decline and would have seemed like " crash " in the stock , and they were able to get 90 cents for those puts .
Today they topped out at $ 9.40 a contract .
What a difference a day makes .
This is an extreme situation , but illustrates how put options can be used as insurance and / or to get downside protection from a decline in a stock 's price .
Other banks and brokerage firms are seeing put volume today and several names such as
Merrill Lynch
( MER )
saw above average activity last week .
Merrill saw 13,000 and 16,000 of the March $ 45 puts traded last Thursday and Friday , respectively .
That volume was over 13 times the 30 - day daily average .
At the time the stock was trading around $ 46 and the puts were valued at about $ 1.50 a contract .
Today Merrill is down to $ 44 and the puts are worth $ 2.60 a contract .
On Tuesday of last week ,
Citigroup
( C ) - Get Report
saw 57,000 of its March $ 20 puts trade .
But this volume was only about three times the daily average and represented less than half the open interest in the strike .
Still , on that day those puts were changing hands at around 40 cents , and today they are worth about 90 cents a contract .

Hubbard 's son Quentin also died under mysterious circumstances in 1976 .
He had disappeared from his home in Clearwater , Florida , and was found unconscious in a car next to the Las Vegas airport .
( Coroner 's report is attached as Exhibit U .
He died unidentified , as a " John Doe . " )
The engine of the car was on and a hose ran from the exhaust pipe ( although it appeared to have fallen off when the authorities arrived ) to the window , making it appear to be a suicide .
But , like his father 's death , there were a number of nagging questions .
For example , Quentin was found unkempt with a beard stubble , a state that no one who knew Quentin could accept .
( He was ultra-meticulous in his appearance . )
Or that the license plate of the car was missing and found under a rock some distance away .
Or that his wallet was gone , making identification impossible .
Or that a near - empty bottle of liquor was found , as if he had been drinking , when Quentin did not .
Or that there were needle marks on his arms , when he did not use drugs
Affidavit of Robert Vaughn Young
9 Mar 1994 .
When he ( LRH ) learned of his son , Quentin's , suicide in October of 1976 , he was heard shouting at the top of his voice , " That stupid fucking kid !
That stupid fucking kid !
Look what he 's done to me .... "
Chap 2 . L. Ron Hubbard -- Messiah ?
Or Madman ?
I just got off the phone to the Sphinx who reminded me that L. Ron Hubbard 's son Quentin was found dead in a car outside of Las Vegas .
A hose had been connected to the tailpipe of the car and Quentin 's death was quickly dismissed as a suicide by carbon monoxide .
Quentin was a gay man who had proven an embarrassment to his powerful father .
Shwan was a gay man who had proven an embarrassment to Scientology for showing the world how scared and robotic they were as they crossed the crosswalks of Clearwater only when the light said " Walk . " ***** The Sphinx said that this could have been an " Old School " hit , just like what they did to Quentin .
There are a few of these sleazy aging Mafioso - connected scum who work for the Cult .
These are like the old " Wise Guys " who meet in old bars that have dark red vinyl booths and where people go to buy illegal guns and complain about how the Colombians cut into their drug trade back in 1976 .
The similarities are shocking .
If this was a Cult hit done via a Third Party , it was meant to scare the kids in Anonymous .
They wo n't scare .
They will use their internet skills to investigate and cut past the PR .
If there was foul play , the Wise Guys have no idea what they are up against .
The forensics , some piece of DNA , will get them if they did this .
DM is no doubt rejoicing in the " unlamented demise " of Shawn Lonsdale .
It 's okay .
His turn will come someday and the world will dance on his grave .
I figured that with the escalating tension , someone was going to wind up dead because Scientology still uses Fair Game .
If Shawn 's death is ruled a suicide , they need to do a full toxicology panel and look for LSD .////
Cloned Trucks
Criminals are using cloned trucks to bypass security :
Savvy criminals are using some of the country ’s most credible logos , including FedEx , Wal - Mart , DirecTV and the U.S. Border Patrol , to create fake trucks to smuggle drugs , money and illegal aliens across the border , according to a report by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement . [ … ]
In August 2006 , the Texas Department of Public Safety , on a routine traffic stop , found 3,058 pounds of marijuana and 204 kilograms of cocaine in a “ cloned ” Wal - Mart semi-trailer , driven by a man wearing a Wal - Mart uniform .
In another case , a truck painted with DirecTV and other markings was pulled over in a routine traffic stop in Mississippi and discovered to be carrying 786 pounds of cocaine .
This is the same problem as fake uniforms , and the more general problem of fake credentials .
It ’s very hard to solve .
EDITED TO ADD ( 2/6 ) :

Each town reveals something different about aging
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
The quest to live longer is one of humanity 's oldest dreams and three isolated communities seem to have stumbled across the answer .
So what can they teach us about a longer life ?
Something remarkable links the remote Japanese island of Okinawa , the small Sardinian mountain town of Ovodda and Loma Linda in the US .
People live longer in these three places than anywhere else on earth .
Centenarian tips on living longer
At an age when the average Briton is predicted to die - 77 years for men and 81 for women - inhabitants of these three places are looking forward to many more years of good health .
Often they 're still working in jobs as demanding as heart surgery .
Okinawa has a population of one million and of those 900 are centenarians , four times higher than the average in Britain or America .
Even more remarkably , Ovodda is the only region in the world where as many men as women live to be 100 years of age , bucking the global trend .
But what is even more intriguing is that each community is distinct from the others and raises a different theory as to why residents live longer .
In all three communities scientists have dedicated themselves to trying to uncover these unique secrets .
So what can we learn from the towns where people live the longest ?
OKINAWA , JAPAN
There is one remarkable scientific fact that sets Okinawans apart from the rest of us , they actually age more slowly than almost anyone else on earth .
" The calendar may say they 're 70 but their body says they 're 50 , " says Bradley Willcox , a scientist researching the extraordinary phenomenon .
" The most impressive part of it is that a good lot of them are healthy until the very end . "
Finding the cause of their exceptional longevity is not simple but the spotlight has fallen on one hormone - DHEA .
It 's a precursor of both oestrogen and testosterone and produced in the adrenal glands .
While scientists do n't know what it does , they do know the hormone decreases with age and levels decline at a much slower rate among the Okinawans .
Aging explained by the experts Explanations for this mostly centre around the dinner table .
The Okinawans not only eat more tofu and soya products than any other population in the world , their diet also includes a vast range of different vegetables and fruit all rich in anti-oxidants .
Scientists refer to it as a rainbow diet .
But it 's what they do n't eat that may be at the heart of their exceptionally long lives .
The Okinawan 's most significant cultural tradition is known as hara hachi bu , which translated means eat until you 're only 80 % full .
In a typical day they only consume around 1,200 calories , about 20 % less than most people in the UK .
Culturally it is a million miles from attitudes in a lot of Western societies , where all - you - can - eat meal deals are offered in restaurants on most high streets .
Scientists call it caloric restriction , but do n't entirely understand why it works .
They think it sends a signal to the body that there is going to be a impending famine , sending it into a protective , self - preservation mode .
" It 's this ability to trick their bodies into starvation that may be keeping Okinawans physiologically so young .
It 's a stark contrast with the cultural habits that drive food consumption in other parts of the world , " says Mr Willcox .
OVODDA , SARDINIA
In stark contrast to Okinawans , the residents of Ovodda do n't count calories and meat is very firmly on the menu , while tofu and soya are not .
But this small town of just over 1,700 residents boasts five centenarians and , even more remarkably , as many men live to 100 as women .
The benefits of a Mediterranean diet are well known , but this still does not account for the number in Ovodda and other parts of Sardinia .
It 's even the case that Sardinians who emigrated at 20 , 30 or 40 years of age still manage to reach 100 , say researchers .
Over the years Professor Luca Deiana has tested every single Sardinian centenarian and has come up with a surprising theory about why there are so many .
Recipes for living longer
For hundreds of years families in Ovodda have lived in relative isolation from the rest of the world , marrying into each others ' families .
In fact most people living in the town today are descended from only a few original settlers .
" Marriage among relatives is not the rule but there are some cases of this taking place , " says Professor Deiana .
" From a genetic point of view when this happens there 's a higher probability of having genetic diseases , but also of having positive results like centenarians . "
In Ovodda , this interbreeding actually seems to have enabled people to live longer .
The limited gene pool has provided a unique opportunity to discover specific genes that are associated with long life .
Professor Deiana has detected a number of unusual genetic characteristics that seem to link the centenarians of Ovodda .
" One particular gene on the X chromosome seems to be faulty , failing to produce an enzyme known as G6PD .
This can often have a negative impact on health , but in Ovodda it may well have had a positive effect . "
The role G6 PD may play in living longer is now being researched further , but the professor is convinced the genetic elixir of life lies with the families of Ovodda .
LOMA LINDA , CALIFORNIA
In Loma Linda , California , one community is proving anyone can increase their chances of living a longer , healthier life .
The extraordinary longevity of residents may not have anything to do with genes .
The community has discovered a secret that 's much easier to find than any gene .
Its effect is so powerful that it enables them to live longer than anyone else in the US .
For many of those living in Loma Lindo long life is a matter of faith .
A significant number of people in the town are Seventh Day Adventist , a religion whose members live between five and 10 years longer than fellow citizens .
This can be partly explained by the fact Adventists do n't drink or smoke and many stick to a vegetarian diet the church advises .
But not all members do and even they live significantly longer than average .
" It does certainly raise the question if there 's something about spiritual life that also has an impact on longer life , " says Dr Gary Fraser , who is researching the community .
" At this moment we do n't really know that but there 's been one interesting fact that 's been known now for 20 or 30 years and that is that people that go to church regularly - whatever faith they have - live longer and there 's no question about that . "
It seems that regular churchgoers have significantly lower levels of stress hormones and so may be better equipped to cope with the challenges in life , say scientists .
" Religion and connection to something higher than oneself , connection to the sacred , connection to a tight - knit religious community allows you to modulate your reactions and your emotions to believe there is a broader purpose , " says Dr Kerry Morton , who is involved in a longer - term study on Adventist health .
" Therefore your body can stay in balance and not be destroyed by those stressors and traumas over time . "
Horizon - How To Live To 101 Without Trying will be broadcast on Tuesday , 19 February at 2100 GMT on BBC Two .
Here is a selection of your comments .
Quite incredible .
How long would you live if you were an Okinawan 7th Day Adventist who moved to Sardinia when they were 20 years old ?
I suppose it just goes to show that genetics , lifestyle and one 's psychology are linked on levels we only speculate about .
Sam Darby , Sutton Coldfield / Birmingham
So according to the last section , if you pass on the guilt / responsibility for your life to a " higher being " , you 'll live longer ?
Maybe we'd all live longer if those people responsible for running the country / world took more responsibility .
Heather , Willenhall
There is also Villcabamba in Ecuador .
It 's found in the vally of longevity .
I think there was a National Geographic study some years ago .
They found that a combination of a good climate all year round , lots of fresh fruit was the main reason why people lived longer .
Jez , Leeds Not only Okinawa , we say " Hara hachi bunme " , eat 80 % of what you think full stomach , throughout in Japan .
What may make a difference in Okinawa is partly stress free style of living there compare to the people in large cities in Japan .
We also say in Japan " Eat as many varieties of food as possible " rather than a meat and 2/3 veg in Britain .
" Ban Zai ! " , long life !
Takeo , London , UK I think the last one is less about being " religious " and more about having a calm and loving place to go .
Meditation , exercise , yoga , etc. can all get you the same things a religion can without any of the problems .
Connection with society , with the greater good , with nature is very important and god has nothing to do with it .
Jesse , Brooklyn , NY , USA
Have you noticed how close they all are to the coast ?
Maybe it 's about eating more fish and clean air .
Ben , London , UK I think there can be all sorts of reasons , diet and DNA clearly being two of them .
But I found it interesting to note that the third case , where a Christian relationship with God through Jesus Christ was the the only common factor , is the only one open to all the world .
I do n't guarentee 100 years here , but I 'm confident of eternity in heaven !
Parker , Guildford Abstnence is the key for logevity : no liquer , no smoking , no heavy fatty food .
Plus to feel less stress ; in this regard , the spiritual connection with God tremendously helps .
I am already 77 but still going very well with original teeth .
Sam Khan , Stratford , USA
These three places are all on nearly the same point in latitude .
Katy , Bristol , UK Try Wokingham .
You do n't live longer but it seems like it .

What are these ?
The Esquire article quotes Admiral Fallon as urging a “ combination of strength and willingness to engage . ”
Readers of the Esquire article who are among the admiral ’s boosters said they did not believe on reading that piece that Admiral Fallon himself had made comments that could be viewed as insubordinate to the president .
But the cast of the lengthy piece put the admiral at odds with the White House .
“ If , in the dying light of the Bush administration , we go to war with Iran , it ’ll all come down to one man , ” the article begins .
“ If we do not go to war with Iran , it ’ll come down to the same man . ”
Both Mr. Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , have maintained an unwavering public line that disagreements with Iran should be resolved diplomatically , and that any military option remained only the last resort .
“ I think that the secretary has made clear and I think Admiral Fallon has made clear that the first priority of this administration is to deal with our problems with Iran in a diplomatic fashion , ” Mr. Morrell said Monday .
“ That is our first hope .
That is our first effort .
However , we have all made clear , time and time again , that nothing , no avenue is off the table . ”
Democrats pounced on the retirement announcement , with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , calling it “ yet another example that independence and the frank , open airing of experts ’ views are not welcomes in this administration . ”
Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said he was sorry to see the admiral go .
“ Admiral Fallon is well known for his excellent diplomatic skills in representing the United States overseas , ” Mr. Levin said .
“ I can only hope that the decision to retire was his own . ”
And Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , who often differs with the administration on foreign - policy issues , said that “ the credibility which Admiral Fallon brought to the issues he was involved in will be sorely missed . ”

Mr Giuliani ( right ) can afford to lose early primaries and focus on Florida
We are looking at two elections , each with its own dynamic , the nomination battle - the primaries and caucuses - and the general election itself .
The landscape often changes dramatically during the course of the battle .
John Kerry was not the Democratic frontrunner before the Iowa caucus in 2004 .
George W Bush was nearly derailed by the New Hampshire primary in 2000 .
Two candidates bashing each other can allow a third to slip through and capture the affection of the voters .
The first hurdle
And the voters enjoy their power .
A recent poll suggested half of them in New Hampshire are not intending to make up their minds until the week before the contest on 8 January .
Both Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton have been waging national campaigns which might blow up in their faces .
EARLY PRIMARY TIMELINE 3 Jan - Iowa caucus 5 Jan - Wyoming caucus ( Rep ) 8 Jan - New Hampshire 15 Jan - Michigan 19 Jan - Nevada caucus , and South Carolina primary ( Rep ) 26 Jan - South Carolina primary ( Dem ) 29 Jan - Florida primary
Q : Primaries and caucuses
Rudy Giuliani has remained true - ( ish ) to his previously held conviction that abortion should be reasonably widely available to American women .
This might hurt him among conservative voters in rural Iowa , but it is close to the view of most Americans as expressed in national polls .
Hillary Clinton has voted in favour of sanctions on Iran demanded by the White House .
Among her party 's left wing anti-war supporters in the early primary states this caused dismay , but in the wider population it is probably the position the majority would back .
What would happen if either or both candidates came unstuck in Iowa and New Hampshire ?
The traditional view is that they would crash and burn - like Howard Dean in 2004 - and we would hardly remember their names by the summer .
But these candidates might be different ; they have national recognition , national campaign staff and national funds .
So Mr Giuliani could perhaps brush off early losses and focus on Florida which comes at the end of January and which he should win .
A third candidate ?
Hillary Clinton could do the same and focus on Super Tuesday in the first week of February where New York , New Jersey , and California will be among the big states she will expect to win .
Mike Bloomberg could spend $ 1bn on a campaign and not miss it
There is also less time this year between Iowa and Super Tuesday - less time for momentum to be built for an Iowa winner or lost for a loser .
The candidates from each of the main parties are likely to be anointed after Super Tuesday or within a month or so of that contest .
So by March it is very likely that a Democrat and a Republican will have emerged .
It is also possible , particularly if large segments of the middle ground in US politics are unhappy ( say , with a choice between John Edwards and Mike Huckabee ) that the Mayor of New York , Mike Bloomberg , might step in .
Mr Bloomberg does not need to raise any money .
He could spend $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) on the campaign and not miss it .
Although he was technically a Republican until recently , his gut sympathies are with the Democrats and he would attract large numbers of centre - left voters .
He is a serious politician ( do not think Ross Perot ) and he will only stand if he could win .
Iraq and the economy
His entry - perhaps as late as March - would focus on technical competence , leadership skills , and business acumen , allied with social awareness and concern .
It would be the ultimate " throw out the party hacks " candidacy and there is no doubt that polling in recent months suggests it strikes a chord with large numbers of Americans .
As for the issues in the second contest , the general election in November , Iraq is plainly important but is it necessarily damaging for the Republicans ?
In a nation of 300 million people , bristling with military power and at war around the world , managing an orderly transition of power is a majestic enterprise
Justin Webb 's blog
Might an Iraq narrative emerge that makes " staying the course " look statesmanlike and wise ?
The economy likewise , is plainly an issue , but will it be in catastrophic shape by next November or will it be powering ahead , with house prices on the up again and the market panic of recent times a distant memory ?
More than is normal in presidential politics , nobody knows .
Dodd : President uses ' scare tactics ' to usurp the law , torture David Edwards and Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Dodd repeats vow to block telecom immunity Continuing his vocal stand against President Bush 's dramatic expansion of executive authority , Chris Dodd took to the Senate floor Friday and called on his colleagues to stand up to the administration 's " scare tactics " and stop president Bush 's " wholesale disregard for the rule of law . "
Dodd was repeating his pledge to block a proposed foreign surveillance law that would grant legal immunity to telephone and internet companies that helped the National Security Agency spy on Americans without warrants as part of a post - 9/11 wiretapping scheme authorized by Bush .
" For six years this President has used scare tactics to prevent the Congress from reining in his abuse of authority .
A case and point is the current direction this body appears to be headed as we prepare to reform and extend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , " Dodd said .
" Many of the unprecedented rollbacks to the rule of law by this Administration have been made in the name of national security . "
Dodd , who has lately focused his presidential bid on a promise to uphold the Constitution , spoke as the White House agreed to let key senators see legal justifications of its warrantless wiretapping program before the Senate Judiciary Committee begins debating FISA revisions next week .
Although the Connecticut Democrat does not serve on either the Intelligence of Judiciary Committees , which has jurisdiction over the laws , he has mounted a one - man campaign to block any FISA bill that included telecom immunity , either through an informal " hold " Senators customarily can use to block certain legislation or by taking to the floor for a formal filibuster .
A chief administration critic who serves on both relevant committees , Sen . Russ Feingold , has said he will do whatever it takes to prevent letting telecom companies off the hook , and Sen. Barack Obama , another presidential candidate , has said he would join Dodd 's filibuster of any bill containing such a provision .
Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) has said she would commit to filibustering the particular bill passed last week by the Intelligence Committee if it does n't change , but she has been less precise over whether she will block all telecom immunity .
Clinton 's campaign did not respond to RAW STORY 's request for clarification Friday .
Dodd excoriated the administration in his floor speech Friday , accusing the president of ignoring laws at his leisure , resulting in grave harm to the country .
It is time for Congress to stand up to the administration , he said .
" Consider the scandal at Abu Ghraib ... Guantanamo Bay ... the secret prisons run by the CIA ... warrantless wiretapping , torture -- the list goes on , " Dodd said .
" Each of these policies ... has only been possible becasue Congress has not been able to stop this president 's unprecedented expansion of power . "
" Whether or not these policies were explicitly authorized is beside the point .
In every instance , Congress has been unable to hold this Administration to account for violating the rule of law and our Constitution , " Dodd said .
" In each instance , Republicans in the Congress have prevented this body from telling this Administration that 'a state of war is not a blank check . '
A transcript of Dodd 's speech is available at FireDogLake.com .

Chuck Norris is suing over the book ( left ) published by Penguin in November .
His claim ?
That the book 's title would mislead readers into thinking the facts were true , according to Yahoo News .
Like many of my collegiate friends , I first learned that Chuck Norris '
tears cured cancer or that there 's no evolution , just a list of creatures Norris has allowed to live , through email forwards and bar jokes about Chuck Norris Facts , a list of hundreds of one - liners that focus on
Norris ' alpha -male persona .
Actor , martial arts expert , and as some might like to believe , superhuman being , Chuck Norris was ( and still is ) the center of a mania that jump - started with the widespread circulation online of a list of " facts , " about the man himself .
The cultish popularity of Chuck Norris Facts became a pop culture staple , garnering references on the Daily Show , Rolling Stone , Family Guy – even Facebook has a CNF generator .
So why is Chuck being such a spoilsport ?
One could argue that the uniformly treasured lists rekindled a geek - hipster love of Norris , his mullet -y locks , tight jeans and flying roundhouse kicks .
According to Reuters , the lawsuit alleges that " Some of the ' facts ' in the book are racist , lewd or portray Mr. Norris as engaged in illegal activities . "
Yahoo
News reports that " the book capitalizes on ' mythical facts ' that have been circulating on the Internet since 2005 that poke fun at Norris '
tough - guy image and super - human abilities . "
In an October 2006 column on WorldNetDaily , Chuck Norris responded to the craze , writing : " It 's quite surprising ... I neither take offense nor take these things too seriously .
I 'm so grateful for my fans . "

Harpers , Scott Horton —
As the final eleven months of the Bush Administration are being counted off in Washington , the accepted wisdom is that impeachment must be taken off the table .
The end is now so close by — what ’s the point ?
Moreover , the American people would , we are told , view it as an act of over zealous partisanship , and would strike back at the polls .
But these responses reflect a misunderstanding of the role that impeachment has historically played in the American democracy , and the English roots of impeachment as a constitutional device .
They see in impeachment a measure which is purely ad hominem in nature , and avoid the much more important institutional aspect .
I predict that before Bush leaves office , the case for his impeachment will and should be given a more careful hearing .
It must not be pursued as a partisan remedy to force a transfer of power .
Rather it should be used as an institutional remedy .
Polling now shows that a large majority of Americans believe that President Bush and Vice President Cheney have committed serious transgressions against the Constitution which would merit consideration of the impeachment process .
Impeaching President Bush and Vice President Cheney for their attempts to hijack the Constitution would make a clear statement about abuse of power .
It would also serve to put reasonable constraints on the conduct of their successors ” “ who are likely to be Democrats .
This is a step which genuine Conservatives and Republicans who adhere to their party ’s former understanding of a government with an executive of carefully limited and checked powers should welcome and embrace .
But more importantly , the political stage in Washington will soon encounter facts that command the consideration of impeachment .
Let me posit a scenario which I believe likely to appear before the end of this summer .
The Justice Department ’s Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility have concluded their joint investigation into the “ Gonzales Eight , ”  namely the eight U.S. attorneys who were fired by Alberto Gonzales on December 7 , 2006 .
The legal standard governing these terminations can probably be summarized this way : the U.S. attorneys could be fired for no reason , or for any reason , but not for an improper reason .
But the inquiry has concluded , as I think it invariably must , that in several cases the firing occurred for an improper reason , to - wit : in order to corruptly influence a criminal investigation .
In one case , relating to New Mexico U.S. attorney David Iglesias , the facts establishing an improper purpose lie right at the surface , and they implicate Alberto Gonzales , Karl Rove and George Bush .
The Justice Department ’s internal investigation will not address the White House ’s involvement in the illegality ” ” surely not President Bush ’s and probably not even Karl Rove’s .
But it will make a series of adverse conclusions concerning Alberto Gonzales and it will note that Karl Rove and George W. Bush were intimately involved in the whole process .
This is because the jurisdictional remit of the investigation is limited ” “ it can only deal with employees and former employees of the Justice Department , so Rove and the president are off bounds .
But among the charges it is likely to lay at Gonzales ’s doorstep is that he failed to apprise the White House of the fact that their meddling with the U.S. attorneys for purposes of influencing criminal investigations connected to elections was a crime ” “ which it surely was .
Gonzales recently engaged savvy criminal law counsel .
He needs them .
But the facts will point to more systematic and potentially deeper culpability within the White House than the Justice Department itself .
If things unfold this way , it will be incumbent on the Congressional oversight organs , and particularly the House Judiciary Committee , to pick up where the Justice Department ’s investigation left off : it will need to scrutinize the role that President Bush , Vice President Cheney , Karl Rove and potentially others played in the whole affair , and generally in the corrupt influencing of criminal proceedings .
It ’s well settled at this point that if a criminal prosecution is manipulated for purposes of creating some partisan political benefit , that is a “ corrupt influencing ”  under federal criminal law ” ” a felony , and in the language of the Constitution , a “ high crime and misdemeanor . ” 
It ’s very rarely charged because , of course , prosecutors make the decisions to bring charges , and prosecutors very rarely charge themselves .
The key question of supervision of misbehaving prosecutors is rising to the top in Washington right now in a way it never has before in America ’s history .
But let ’s keep the focus for the moment on impeachment .
It may not necessarily start its inquiry under the rubric of “ impeachment , ”  but it may well be viewed as a preliminary to an impeachment .
And if the past is a guide , American impeachment proceedings have often started as a general inquiry and developed into impeachment ” ” particularly as facts are disclosed which generate public demand for stronger action .
In 1974 , Prof. Raoul Berger , the conservative Harvard legal historian and Supreme Court scholar , addressed the impeachment issue in a brief essay in Harper ’s . [… ]
Berger , in any event , studied and wrote about the notion of impeachment in English jurisprudence from the seventeenth century , and how it was incorporated into the American constitution .
He felt Americans were far too reticent about using it .
Impeachment , in his view , was an essential Constitutional safeguard ” “ it is an instrument for regeneration .
Impeachment , to most Americans today , seems to represent a dread mystery , an almost parricidal act , to be contemplated , if at all , with awe and alarm .
It was not always so .
Impeachment , said the House of Commons in 1679 , was “ the chief institution for the preservation of the government ”  ; and chief among the impeachable offenses was “ subversion of the Constitution . ” 
In 1641 , the House of Commons charged that the Earl of Strafford had subverted the fundamental law and introduced an arbitrary and tyrannical government .
By his trial , which merged into a bill of attainder and resulted in his execution , and by a series of other seventeenth - century impeachments , Parliament made the ministers accountable to it rather than to the King and stemmed a tide of absolutism that swept the rest of Europe .
Thereafter , impeachment fell into relative disuse during the eighteenth century because a ministry could now be toppled by the House of Commons on a vote of no confidence .
Anthony Van Dyck , Portrait of Thomas Wentworth , Earl of Strafford ( 1625 ) .
Strafford ’s impeachment in 1641 set the terms for the concept incorporated into the American Constitution 158 years later .
Historians regularly reach back to the Strafford case for another purpose : it marks one of the early chapters of what we would know today as “ parliamentary oversight . ” 
The Commons used a probe of Strafford as a vehicle for challenging abuses in government by the monarch .
The Stuart kings , including Charles I for whom Strafford was a favorite , claimed to be monarchs by divine right .
For them the maxim was not that the “ king is above the law , ”  but rather “ the king is the law ”  ( “ rex est lex ”  ) .
Strafford effectively served as a parliamentary whipping boy .
His impeachment was a means for holding the monarch to account .
And as Berger notes , the inclusion of the notion of impeachment in the U.S. Constitution was very plainly driven by the painful memory of parliament ’s struggles with the monarchy in the seventeenth century .
The reason lies in the fact that the Founders vividly remembered the seventeenth - century experience of the mother country .
They remembered the absolutist pretensions of the Stuarts ; they were haunted by the greedy expansiveness of power ; they dreaded usurpation and tyranny .
And so they adopted impeachment as a means of displacing a usurper ” “ a President who exceeded the bounds of the executive ’s authority .
The colonists , after all , regarded the executive , in the words of Thomas Corwin , as “ the natural enemy , the legislative assembly the natural friend of liberty . ” 
Throughout the colonial period , they had elected their own assemblies and trusted them as their own representatives .
The governors , on the other hand , were often upper - class Englishmen with little understanding of American aspirations , who had been foisted on the colonists by the Crown .
Hence , Congress was given the power to remove the President .
This power , it must be emphasized , constitutes a deliberate breach in the doctrine of separation of powers , so that no arguments drawn from that doctrine ( such as executive privilege ) may apply to the preliminary inquiry by the House or the subsequent trial by the Senate .
This last point is of vital importance for the present affair .
The Bush White House has put up enormous battlements in anticipation of what is coming .
They are asserting executive privilege in response to a series of outstanding Congressional subpoenas requiring Karl Rove , Harriet Miers and others to appear and testify and to produce documents .
They also have been playing a historically unprecedented game of deceit with respect to documents , asserting executive privilege in the most preposterous way ( for instance , claiming that emails on the servers of the Republican National Committee are shielded by executive privilege , as if the RNC were part of the White House , a claim which itself would support an impeachment count since it supposes an anti-constitutional restructuring of the government ) .
But they also suggest that the documents have been destroyed , then withdraw that statement , and then raise it again , in a bewildering volley of conflicting assertions .
All of this is done to one purpose , namely , to leave no doubt that the Bush Administration would view any probe of its dealings surrounding the U.S. attorneys and related scandals ( most of which go to corrupt manipulation of the Justice Department ) as an existential threat , to be challenged to the end .
Justice Department officials , many of whom are implicated in the matter under investigation , produce their own highly implausible arguments in support of executive privilege .
But the point to keep in mind is that the Congress holds all the aces in this struggle .
If it proceeds on the basis of an inquiry into impeachment , then no claim of executive privilege can stand because this is , as Berger notes , outside of the separation of powers framework .
More precisely it is the “ ultimate check ”  given to the legislature .

BERLIN , Nov 27 ( Reuters ) -
The German government plans to accelerate the scheduled degression in support for rooftop photovoltaic energy from 2009 and again from 2011 but will also “ substantially increase ” overall support for renewable energy .
A spokesman for the Environment Ministry in Berlin said the plan to accelerate the degression to seven percent per year from five percent per year currently will be discussed at a meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s cabinet on Dec. 5 .
“ There will be a 7 percent reduction in 2009 and an 8 percent reduction from 2011 , ” Environment Ministry spokesman Thomas Hagbeck said .
“ The photovoltaic industry has developed so well that the support levels can be reduced , ” Hagbeck said .
“ There ’s no need for excess support . ”
Hagbeck said that overall support for renewable energy would be raised substantially from 2008 .
Tiger cub may hold future in his paws Mike Aivaz

With his eyes open for little more than a day , an 11 - day old cub , the newest addition to one of the world 's rarest cat species , the South China tiger , was revealed at his birthplace in South Africa .
The birth of the exceptionally rare tiger has generated huge interest from around the world as he is the first of his species to be born in captivity outside of China .
" There has been humongous ( massive ) interest in this little baby , " said Li Quan , founder of the Save China 's Tigers Organisation , of the male tiger who was born on November 23 at Laohu Valley Reserve in the Free State Province .
" It is the first time a South China tiger is born into a project and born outside China .
Because of their highly endangered state there are only about 60 to 70 left ( in captivity ) and between 10 and 30 in the wild , " she told AFP .
" They are highly precious , there are so few of them . "
The cub , who has not yet been named , was the first born to mother Cathay and father TigerWoods , who have been successfully returned to the wild in South Africa .
The cub is being hand - reared after unseasonally cold weather meant he had to be removed from his mother to prevent him from dying from exposure .
" Our first priority is to have the mother rearing cub , but we had to take into account the weather and the fact that the mother could reject the cub . "
Quan said the goal would be to return the cub to the wild as well , for eventual return to China .
This rehabilitation process could start as early as when he is a month old when he will be taken to see his mother and other tigers .
" So he will know he is a tiger and not a human being , " said Quan .
Since the program in South Africa started in 2003 , four tigers have been returned to the wild at Laohu , where they have learned to adapt and hunt .
Quan said the cub 's birth should prove to detractors of the project that it could indeed be successful .
" I just hope critics stop criticising and help us to work together ( to save the tigers ) , " she said .

AT LAST , say some European Union leaders , it is time for tough talk about the future of farming .
Even the subsidy - mad French agree : a mid-term review of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) is to begin during their stint in the EU 's rotating presidency , later this year .
It all sounds encouraging .
Except for this : even as governments boast of tackling difficult reforms soon , France , Germany and others are trying to thwart an easy reform now that would let EU dairy farmers take advantage of soaring world prices .
The row centres on the EU 's milk quotas , which cap production in each country , with swingeing fines for producing too much .
It offers a revealing , and depressing , case study .
There may never be a less painful time to ease ( or scrap ) milk quotas .
They were designed in 1984 , when low market prices and high subsidies were filling EU warehouses with surplus “ butter mountains ” and mounds of milk powder , at ever greater cost to the EU budget .
Liberal - minded types wondered naively if cutting subsidies might be an idea .
They were outvoted by the farm lobby , which chose to curb production via quotas so as to boost prices .
As an instrument , it was blunt — but it worked .
Today , the conditions of 1984 are reversed .
Steady growth in demand for cheese , yogurt and so on , whether in Europe or Asia , has pushed up world prices ( with some wild spikes last year ) .
Surpluses are long gone : last year the EU undershot its milk quotas by about 2 m tonnes .
But because quotas cannot be traded between EU countries , go - ahead farmers in places ideally suited to dairy farming — the coastal areas of north - western Europe , such as the Netherlands , Denmark or Poland — cannot produce as much as they would like .
That does not worry those who see only today 's high prices for their dairymen .
But Gerrit Meester , a Dutch farm official in The Hague , calls the situation unsustainable .
The EU is acting like a would - be “ OPEC of the milk market ” , he says , referring to the oil producers ' cartel .
But OPEC had a bigger share of the world market ; and even its price - gouging lured new rivals into production .
“ That is the risk we take in the EU , ” says Mr Meester , pointing to Europe 's falling share of world dairy markets .
If Europe does not act “ more intelligently ” , rivals such as Brazil , Argentina and America will continue to ramp up production .
Each EU member sets its own rules for handing out quotas .
Some allow farmers to trade and rent them , others dole them out to favoured groups such as young farmers , farmers in disadvantaged regions or ( officials allege ) political supporters .
To dairymen in less profitable places , like the Bavarian hills , the Alps or chilly northern Finland , only the quota system can guarantee high enough prices to keep them in business .
Quotas are due to expire in 2015 , according to the latest in a string of political compromises .
Their fans will not hear of scrapping them earlier .
Absurdly , even a modest proposal by the European Commission to raise quotas by just 2 % in April has met stiff resistance from France , Germany , Austria and Finland .
Perverse effects abound .
German farmers from the plains of Schleswig - Holstein would “ love to see no quotas ” , says an official .
Yet the German government is resisting reform .
This is said to be because the German farm minister is both ambitious and from Bavaria , a hilly place with lots of small farms .
France fell far short of its quota last year , thanks in part to a system of state planning that ties quotas to individual regions , to prevent concentration of the industry in profitable areas .
In practice , this means that frustrated dairy farmers in Brittany and Normandy cannot expand , while quotas languish unused in other regions .
French officials proudly proclaim that EU quotas are the reason that milk is still produced in every corner of France .
This is all especially pleasing to Michel Barnier , the French agriculture minister .
He is from the Alps , and likes to say that one EU priority must be to save European palates from industrial , “ aseptic ” food .
One Eurocrat says more bluntly that the French have “ decided to save mountain farmers by kicking farmers in Brittany ” .
And while gourmet France under- produces , industrial America has been “ flooding ” world dairy markets , he adds : perhaps not the outcome France had in mind .
How to create a lobby group
It is an EU rule that unintended consequences , left for a few years , fossilise into special interests .
The Dutch , who sell most of their milk abroad ( largely in the form of cheese ) , want to liberalise the dairy trade .
But even in the Netherlands , milk quotas benefit some .
Older Dutch dairy farmers may hold quotas worth € 1 m , which they can sell when they retire .
The financial impact on these folk would make it politically hard to scrap quotas overnight , say Dutch farm officials , even if it would help younger farmers , for whom quotas are a big disincentive .
“ The quota system was never meant to be a retirement scheme , but it has worked out that way , ” says an official .
The 2 % quota increase will probably go through next month , even though the camp led by France says that the EU should wait to discuss it along with other CAP reforms under the French presidency ( delaying any change by at least another year ) .
The go - slow camp can probably be bought off with promises of extra money for small farmers or mountain herds .
In truth , even liberal countries such as the Netherlands have no objection to subsidies for preserving pretty ( but uneconomic ) landscapes or animal welfare .
Siem - Jan Schenk , a dairy boss at the Dutch farmers ' union , LTO , says that “ the direction we are going in is to say to France or Bavaria , give us the freedom to expand , and you will have instruments to protect production for the good of society . ”
Freedom for all , in return for subsidies for farmers who yodel or wear lederhosen .
It sounds like a fair exchange .
So why must Europe wait seven years to implement it ?
That , it seems , is a political question too tough for EU governments to answer any time soon .

As late as 1999 , oil was trading at $ 10 per barrel and gold at $ 250 per ounce , down from their nominal peaks in 1980 of $ 39 and $ 850 respectively .
And that 's not even adjusted for the fact that the value of a dollar was a lot lower in 1999 than in 1980 .
Many pundits at the time argued that prices would continue to go down .
The Economist had a cover in March 1999 entitled " Drowning in Oil " where it argued that oil would continue to fall well below $ 10 per oil .
And gold was of course deemed a barbarous relic which would continue to fall in price as central banks continued to dump it .
That forecast from The Economist turned out to be one of the worst in economic history — on a par with Irving Fisher 's stock - market forecast in 1929 — because just a few weeks later the price of oil started a new upward trend .
As this article is written , gold is trading at over $ 800 and oil at $ 95 .
The question facing us is , will commodity prices continue to boom in the foreseeable future or are we at or near the end of the rising trend we 've seen since 1999 ?
Jim Rogers , one of the world 's most successful professional investors tries to answer this in his new book , Hot Commodities : How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World 's Best Market , and as the title suggests his answer is that commodity prices will continue to rise .
Rogers is a bit biased on this issue as he manages a fund that invests in commodities , but that does n't mean he 's wrong .
And as we shall see , Rogers present powerful arguments for believing in a continued boom ; the main shortcoming of the book is that he overlooks another powerful argument for commodities .
Rogers , unlike many other professional investors , such as his former partner George Soros , is a libertarian , but many libertarians seem to believe that it is somehow unlibertarian to believe that commodity prices will rise .
This goes back to the old feud between the late Julian Simon and Paul Ehrlich .
Ehrlich has long advocated a Malthusian view that the world would run out of commodities and that draconian population control measures must be implemented to avoid a disaster .
Simon on the other hand argued that a larger population was the solution , not the problem , and that increased mining , recycling , more efficient use of resources , and other forms of technical innovations would ensure that we would never run out of commodities , but have them in abundance .
Based on this belief , he publicly challenged Ehrlich to a bet where he would win if the prices of a number of commodities of Ehrlich 's choosing were lower in 1990 than 1980 .
Simon won the bet , and this was taken by many as evidence that commodity prices were on a structural downward path , especially after adjusting for consumer price indexes .
As Simon made this bet with a Malthusian , many now fear that rising commodity prices would somehow vindicate Malthusian advocates of government population control .
Jim Rogers is certainly not a Malthusian and he does not believe we are going to run out of commodities permanently or that commodity prices will always rise .
Instead he argues that commodity prices will go through 10 - to 20 - year cycles where commodity prices will first rise , then fall .
In his book , he points to the experience of the last 100 years as evidence for his prediction .
Between 1906 and 1923 , the world saw a long commodity - price boom .
Then between 1923 and 1933 commodity prices fell sharply , particularly during the last three years .
After that , a strong commodity - price boom started that lasted a full 20 years , until 1953 .
There followed a 15 - year downturn in commodity prices that lasted until 1968 .
Afterwards came the great commodity price boom of the 1970s , or more specifically 1968 – 1982 ( 1980 was the peak year for oil and gold ) .
We saw the long commodity downturn between the early 1980s and 1999 , followed finally by the commodity - price boom that we 're seeing right now .
Within these cycles , there are corrections , as we saw when oil fell back from $ 78 per barrel in August 2006 to $ 50 in January 2007 .
And there will certainly be more corrections within this boom .
Why do commodity prices move up and down in such decade - long cycles ?
Rogers 's answer is that , while commodity production and demand do in fact respond to price changes , there is a long time lag in most cases , particularly with regard to production .
There are many reasons for this .
First , because commodity prices fluctuate so much , many producers want to wait and see if we 're really on an upward path before investing .
But far more importantly , particularly in the cases of mining and drilling for oil and natural gas , it takes quite a while to find new sources ; to determine whether or not mining or drilling is really economically viable ; to overcome red tape and objections from government bureaucrats and environmentalists ; and then finally to go very deep into the ground and actually extract it .
Any of these things can take a decade or more .
The response time is a lot faster when it comes to individual food commodities , as is illustrated by the sharp increase in corn production in response to the sharp increase in corn prices following US government subsidies of ethanol fuel produced with US corn .
However , while this caused corn prices to fall back somewhat , the prices of other farm products , such as wheat , then soared as the land previously used to grow other grains was diverted to growing corn .
We can also see how the substitution effect makes the price increases in some commodities contagious .
Rising oil prices caused increased interest in alternative sources of fuel , such as corn - based ethanol , which of course helps bid up corn prices .
Rising corn prices diverts farm land to the production of corn instead of other grains , which in turn helps bid up the prices of these other grains .
Rising oil prices increase demand for nuclear power , something that helps bid up the price of uranium .
Similarly , it often takes time for substitutes to respond to prices .
It usually takes years to install more fuel - efficient cars , not to mention how long it takes to finish nuclear power plants and wind - power installations , overcome objections from government bureaucrats and politicians , as well as those of environmentalists and the people living next door to these energy production facilities .
Later , however , when all these new mines and oil wells are finally fully operational , and when the fuel - efficient cars and new energy plants are put in place widely , then the commodity - price boom ends — and turns into a commodity - price bust .
When the lagged effect of all of these factors all finally show up , the effect could be a dramatically long period of overcapacity when new mining and drilling are simply not economically viable , while gas - guzzling cars are increasingly affordable .
But as there are so many production facilities in place , and as the marginal cost of production for these existing facilities is relatively low , then this situation could continue for quite a while , causing long periods of declining commodity prices .
Until , of course , the mines and wells get depleted .
Then we face undercapacity , which of course will precipitate a new commodity - price boom .
Rogers argues that the current commodity price boom is in part a result of how the declining commodity prices of the 1980s and 1990s caused low levels of investment in mining and drilling , which means that existing mines and wells got depleted .
In the book , Rogers reviews the supply - and - demand situation for a number of different commodities — including oil , natural gas , gold , lead , sugar , and coffee — and comes to the conclusion that supply is simply not growing as fast as demand , and wo n't do so for another few years , a period during which , therefore , the commodity - price rally will likely continue .
The other factor behind the commodity - price boom is the surge in demand from China and to a lesser extent India and the rest of Asia .
Rogers is very bullish on China and argues that it is inevitable that China will become the world 's dominant economic power .
He devotes an entire chapter of the book to China , where he details the case for being bullish about China and also describes how the sharp increase in demand for commodities that comes with its continued industrialization and consumption will continue to push commodity prices upwards .
Rogers also argues that investors who want to reap the full benefits of the commodity - price rally should buy commodities outright rather than stocks of commodity producers .
He presents statistics that show that stocks of commodity producers have generally not done as well as the real thing .
The reason for this is that when you 're buying stocks of commodity producers you 're not just buying the commodity but a company too .
And the company can in some cases be suffering from bad management or from political attacks .
To the extent that commodity prices increase because government bureaucrats and other obstacles hold back production , holders of stocks of commodity producers could in fact lose .
Rogers generally argues his case in a very persuasive , lucid , and instructive way , so my overall assessment of the book is very positive .
My main complaint is not so much what is in it , but rather what has been left out .
The key factor in analyzing commodity - price movements that Rogers has left out is the strong influence of monetary policy on commodity prices .
This is particularly puzzling since Rogers is in fact an advocate of hard money and has repeatedly condemned Bernanke for debasing the dollar and refers to him as " a nut " for cutting interest rates so much .
While monetarists and most other non-Austrians believe that money - supply increases will affect all prices simultaneously and proportionally , a more realistic Austrian approach recognizes that some prices will be bid up faster and higher by any money supply increase .
Which prices will be bid up the most and the soonest depends in part on who the early receivers of money are and also on how flexible the prices are .
While commodity prices traded on the market change from minute to minute — or even second to second — and often rise or fall by several percent ( or tens of percent ) within a day and between the days , the prices of regular finished goods in supermarkets generally do n't change very often .
So as commodity prices are more flexible than the prices of regular finished goods , they , like stocks and bonds , can be expected to be affected more and faster by monetary trends than consumer prices will be .
There are also other reasons for believing monetary policy affects commodity prices disproportionately .
If real interest rates fall , then the opportunity cost of holding commodities falls , making them more attractive .
And if there is a fear that inflation could get out of hand , commodities could be viewed as being good inflation hedges .
Moreover , when the Fed inflates more than usual and lowers interest rates , this will drive down the foreign - exchange rate of the dollar , making commodities cheaper for foreigners , a factor that will help push up the dollar price of commodities .
While monetary policy is n't everything , and the fundamental nonmonetary supply - and - demand factors that Rogers mentions are certainly very important too , we can see several instances where monetary policies have had a decisive effect on commodity trends .
A key reason why commodity prices fell so much in 1929 – 33 was certainly the contraction of the money supply during that period .
And it was hardly a coincidence that commodity prices started to boom after Roosevelt took America off the gold standard in 1933 and continued to boom during the coming 20 years of wars and massive inflation .
And the commodity price boom of the 1970s was certainly helped by the highly inflationary policies of Arthur Burns .
Similarly , a major factor in breaking that commodity price boom was the significant tightening of monetary policy implemented by Paul Volcker .
Indeed , the massive boom in commodity prices following the Fed 's rate cuts since August is another good example of the strong connection between monetary policy and commodity prices .
Since mid-August , the Fed has lowered the discount rate 125 basis points and the federal funds rate by 75 basis points .
The effect on commodity prices is very apparent , with the CRB Futures Index being up 15 % , gold is up 20 % and oil is up 35 % .
The Fed 's likely continuation of its inflation in an attempt to solve the problems created by its previous inflation and the consequence that this will drive down the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets will provide momentum for the commodity - price boom for some time .
While Rogers 's book is good , it would have been even better had it also mentioned that key point .
CHICAGO / DETROIT ( Reuters ) - U.S. automaker Chrysler LLC plans to shrink its dealer network and cut some vehicles that compete with its each other for customers to become a smaller , profitable company , an executive said on Friday .
The Chrysler logo is seen on the back of a 300C during the Chicago Auto Show February 6 , 2008 .
Chrysler LLC aims to cut its product lineup sharply and shrink its dealership network to sell its three brands under one roof as part of its corporate restructuring , the company said on Friday .
REUTERS / John Gress
The dealer consolidation is part of a plan to sell all three of its brands under one roof .
Chrysler President Jim
Press would not say just how deep the cuts might be for the automaker , which previously said it would cut a few slow - selling models .
Chrysler ’s dealer and vehicle model lineup is big enough to support production of 4 million vehicles per year , but it has retail sales of about 1.5 million and needs to be sized to sell about 2.5 million , Press said .
“ The product portfolio has to consolidate , ” Press said at a J.D. Power and Associates meeting in San Francisco .
“ We do n’t know how many models we ’re going to have .
Nobody knows that . ”
Chrysler has some 3,600 dealers and builds more than 30 models of cars , minivans and trucks , some of which compete more with each other than other automakers , Press said .
Eliminating duplicate vehicles would give Chrysler money to spend in creating vehicles to compete in more categories , he said .
Chrysler has moved quickly since its acquisition by Cerberus Capital Management last summer to address an unfocused vehicle lineup and to answer customer complaints ranging from materials , interiors , noise and vibration .
About 55 percent of its dealers now carry all three of its Chrysler , Jeep and Dodge brands .
The plan is aimed mainly at city and suburban dealers that do not carry all three brands to consolidate into larger sustainable dealerships .
Currently , a dealership might carry one or two of the brands , but not necessarily all three at the same location .
To be effective at current sales volumes , all three brands need to be under the same roof , Press said .
Chrysler expects to keep all of its brands , but the plan to eliminate duplicate vehicles among the brands , producing one minivan instead of both the Chrysler Town & Country and the Dodge Caravan for example , would spur dealer consolidation , Press said .
“ We do know that if all three brands are not under one roof , the dealer will not have the opportunity to sell the full array of products and profit from it , ” Press said .
Press said the process could take three to five years and would be much harder for dealers if the consolidation does n’t occur before the products begin to go away .
The new product portfolio could roll out over four to six years .
Chrysler will discuss details on real estate and other issues with dealers in each market , he said .
Chrysler will not offer huge financial incentives to dealers , he added .
Press noted that U.S. - based automakers had 75 percent of the dealers , with only a 48 percent share of the market .
ANALYSTS WELCOME LONG -OVERDUE MOVES
Analysts welcomed the idea of a dealer consolidation , saying a smaller , more focused Chrysler would have a better chance to thrive and the head of the largest U.S. dealer group said it would support his business as well .
“ It ’s an absolute imperative to have a viable business in North America , ” said John Casesa , a former Wall Street analyst who now heads an advisory firm in New York specializing in the auto industry .
Casesa said the strategy is decades overdue for Chrysler , which needs to eliminate waste from duplicate models in each brand and smaller stores with low profitability .
Jerry York , an advisor to billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian who has tried to buy Chrysler in the past , said on Friday that Chrysler needed to cut several vehicles and a lack of international business made it not viable over the long term .
York , a former Chrysler chief financial officer , said at the Reuters Autos Summit last November he ultimately expected Chrysler to be combined with an overseas automaker once Cerberus fixed it up .
Shrinking the number of dealers will be hard because of state laws that protect franchises and Chrysler likely would have to offer financial incentives to move quickly , analysts said .
Over the years , the automaker and its U.S. rivals , General Motors Corp GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N , have tried to shrink their dealer numbers , often facing great resistance .
However , analysts said some dealers may be more receptive now , given the weak U.S. economy , if the offers are generous .
Mike Jackson , chief executive of AutoNation Inc AN.N , the largest U.S. dealer , told CNBC Television on Friday the plan was " brilliant " and also would be extremely controversial .
“ You ca n’t survive unless you get the entire product offering .
You ’ll either be out of business or in a high throughput model , ” he said .
“ This is where they had to go . ”
Press just completed an eight - day tour of Chrysler dealers to unveil the new corporate initiative called “ Project Genesis ” ahead of the annual National Automobile Dealers Association meeting in San Francisco .
Since Cerberus acquired an 80 percent stake in Chrysler from Daimler AG DAIGn .DE , the company has been expected to shake up established practices in Detroit .

HDD が壊れたのかと思い、 BIOS で HDD を起動ドライブから外して USB メモリからブートを試みたが、 起動ドライブから外しても内蔵 HDD に問題があると先に進めないようだ 。
HDD を完全に取り除いてしまえば USB メモリからブートするらしいが、 このような中途半端な死にかただとスピン・アップ待ちになってしまって、 そこから先に進めなくなる ( 後で知ったのだが 、 実は上記画面で止まっているとき < F1 > を押すと、 ブートを継続できて USB メモリ等からブートできる ) 。

とはいえ、 いちおー無駄な抵抗は試みた ( ^^ ; ) 。 すなわち、 HDD が回転しなくなったときに、 HDD を振り回すことによってトルクを与える手法や、 あるいは結露等で回路に異常がおきたときに、 結露を霧散させる手法 ( 平たく言うとしばらく放置しただけ ;) を試したのだが、 HDD が回転音を発することは無かった。 出張初日で、 代替マシンの調達もままならず、 Advanced / W - ZERO3 [ es ] に USB キーボードをつないで急場をしのいだものの、 えらく難儀した 。

結論から言うと、 想像通りハードウェア的にはなんら故障していなかった。 単に HDD が 「 電源投入時にスタンバイ・モードに入る ( power - on in standby ) 」 状態になっていただけだった 。
1/9 に行なわれた Windows Update KB943899 が原因らしいです。 おそらくこの

VERY DANGEROUS .
Do not use unless you are abso - lutely certain that both the system BIOS ( or firmware ) and the operating system kernel ( Linux >= 2.6.22 ) support probing for drives that use this feature .
When enabled , the drive is pow - ered - up in the standby mode to allow the controller to sequence the spin-up of devices , reducing the instantaneous current draw burden when many drives share a power supply .
「 VERY DANGEROUS 」 と書いてある通り、 HDD がひとたびこの 「 power - on in standby 」 モードになってしまうと、 電源を投入してもスピン・アップしなくなる ( スタンバイ状態になる ) 。
HDD が沢山あるサーバなどで、 全ディスクが一斉に回転を始めると、 突入電流が電源の許容範囲を超えてしまったりするわけで、 それを回避するためのモードらしい。 つまり、 電源を投入したあと、 おもむろ に HDD を一台づつスピン・アップしていくことにより、 回転開始にともなう突入電流を分散させることができるというわけ。

A 23 - year - old woman is expected to appear in court today after reports of a bomb on a North Sea oil rig sparked a full - scale emergency operation involving the army , RAF and police .
According to one report , the scare started when a woman employee on the rig was overheard recalling a dream she had had about a bomb on the platform .
Jake Molloy , general secretary of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee , one of the biggest unions representing offshore workers , said : " It was complete madness .
This girl had a dream about a bomb being on board and she was a bit shaken .
The next thing anyone knew workers were being evacuated . "
He said the rumour that a bomb was on the accommodation block - or " flotel " - had spread to senior managers within an hour .
" It was complete madness on behalf of everyone .
There was never any reason to evacuate the platform . "
A Grampian Police spokesman last night said : " The female is expected to appear at Aberdeen sheriff court on Monday in connection with the matter . "
Earlier police confirmed that they were treating the incident as a false alarm , adding that a 23 - year - old woman was being brought ashore for questioning .
" The incident , which was reported to Grampian police force control room at 9.30 am today is not considered terrorism related , " said a police spokesman .
According to the company that runs the oilfield , Britannia Operator , the alarm was raised at about 9.15 am when a member of crew on board the Safe Scandinavia , a flotel stationed next to a rig 190 miles north - east of Aberdeen , said there could be a suspicious device on board .
Within minutes emergency procedures swung into action and the block was evacuated , with about 500 people crossing the gantry linking it to the oil rig .
A search of the platform began and army bomb squad officers were put on standby .
Five helicopters from RAF Kinloss and a Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft from RAF Waddington were scrambled to the scene .
By mid-afternoon the company confirmed that nothing had been found , and workers began to return to the platform .
The bomb squad was stood down and police said they were making arrangements to bring the woman ashore .
Kath McGill , managing director of Britannia Operator , said the company had acted sensibly .
" We are very relieved this has turned out to be a false alarm but we obviously had to treat it seriously and act appropriately to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all our people . "
However , the union described the decision to evacuate as " ludicrous " .
Molloy said : " It appears that the whole thing was started when someone was a bit upset about a dream they had and that appears to have sparked one of the biggest security operations the North Sea has ever seen .
The cost has been astronomical and there was never any need for it . "
He said he felt sorry for the woman who appeared to be at the centre of the alarm .
A spokesman for RAF Kinloss said the emergency services were following " precautionary measures " .
Squadron Leader Barry Neilson , from RAF Kinloss , said that although the incident had been " unusual " it had fallen within the " normal operating procedures . "
A Scottish executive spokeswoman said during the operation : " A Scottish government civil contingencies official is based in the Grampian police control room , and the justice secretary is being regularly kept appraised of developments .
" There are well established procedures for dealing with incidents in the North Sea , and these are operating efficiently and effectively . "
A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed their helicopters and planes had been stood down .
" The helicopters that were there have been sent home .
The two planes have been turned around and sent home as well . "
Oil rigs have long been considered a potentially vulnerable and important target for terrorists and enemy forces .
During the cold war Nato drew up contingency plans in the event of an attack in the North Sea by Soviet special forces .
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Nicol Stephen , who represents Aberdeen South , paid tribute to the professionalism of those involved in the evacuation and said it was too early to say what had caused the incident .
" After more than three decades of North Sea oil this is the first serious security incident of this kind that I can recall , " he said .
" It is a tribute to everyone involved in the evacuation that it was carried out with such professionalism and efficiency .
" It is now important that all investigations are completed as quickly as possible and that work on the platform returns to normal . "
Aberdeen coastguard said 161 of the 539 workers were airlifted from the rig before the alarm was called off .
The workers who were flown to neighbouring platforms returned to the Safe Scandinavia last night .

US trains Gulf air forces for possible Iran strike , while revisiting strategy at home John Byrne

Two days after the a British report that an Assistant Secretary of Defense declared , " I hate all Iranians , " a report from the Gulf reveals the US is training Arab militaries and regional leaders for a possible war with Iran .
A Washington - based air warfare conference last month , led by Air Force chief of staff Gen. Michael Mosley , was told how the US has helped coordinate intelligence sharing and organize group military exercises designed to make parallel warfare easier .
According to the Sunday Telegraph , Mosley " used the conference to seek closer links with allies whose support America might need if President George W. Bush chooses to bomb Iran . "
The report says the Pentagon has helped set up an air warfare center in the United Arab Emirates , modeled on a US base in Nevada .
Dubai and Amman are participating in the program .
The New Yorker 's Seymour Hersh said Sunday the Bush Administration will engage Iran on the basis that Iran is supplying the Iraqi insurgency .
In a piece Sunday , Hersh writes , " During a secure videoconference that took place early this summer , the President told Ryan Crocker , the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq , that he was thinking of hitting Iranian targets across the border and that the British ' were on board ' ...
Bush ended by instructing Crocker to tell Iran to stop interfering in Iraq or it would face American retribution . "
Another report last month asserted that the US Air Force has reestablished the elite fighting force which planned the 1991 Gulf War 's air campaign and tasked them with " fighting the next war " as US - Iran tensions bloom .
" Project Checkmate , " resurrected in June , reports directly to Mosley and " consists of 20 - 30 top air force officers and defence and cyberspace experts with ready access to the White House , the CIA and other intelligence agencies . "
Though Iran was n't the focus of the conference , it came up , the Telegraph says .
" We need friends and partners with the capabilities to take care of their own security and stability in their regions and , through the relationship , the inter- operability and the will to join us in coalitions when appropriate , " said Bruce Lemkin , the American air force deputy under - secretary for international affairs .
" On its most basic level , it 's about flying together , operating together and training together so , if we have to , we can fight together . "
It 's unlikely Gulf states would join any Western attack .
But the US might still need airspace access , and border nations might need to be prepared for counterstrikes .
A Jordanian military aide told the paper " concern at Iran 's attempt to establish itself as a regional superpower " had fostered cooperation , " not just at the inter - service level but also at the political level . "

27th January 2008 will see only the second election worldwide to include a Pirate Party on the ballot .
It will not , however , be in Sweden , but the German state of Hesse , in south - west Germany .
The Hesse state Pirate Party is fronted by Christof Leng , a 32 year old Ph.D. student at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt , where he does peer - to - peer research .
Mr Leng was co-founder of the German National Pirate Party and served as it ’s first chairman .
He has also just been selected for a position in the steering committee of the German GI .
He graciously made time in his busy campaigning schedule to talk to TorrentFreak about the upcoming election , and why people should ‘ Vote Pirate ’ .
TorrentFreak –
What topics are you focusing in on your campaign ?
Christof Leng – With national data retention starting on January 1st , this is certainly a major topic not only for us , but for the opposition in general .
Beyond that , the privacy infringements by government agencies are something to be discussed .
Another big topic for young people are the new tuition fees , which lead to a drop in student numbers .
We believe strongly in the knowledge society and stopping the concept of free education will hurt Germany ’s future .
TorrentFreak –
So more on the privacy than culture / copyright angles ?
Christof Leng – Unfortunately , copyright is something that is not decided in Hesse or even in Germany , but mostly on the European level .
Thus is plays a lesser role in this election .
But we try to raise awareness and get support for the next European election in 2009 .
TorrentFreak –
How many people have you put up as candidates ?
Christof Leng –
Ok , I guess I should explain a little bit about the German election system first .
We have ( party ) lists and direct candidates , and we do n’t run for direct seats , only a party list .
A direct win would be utopian , as it ’s majority vote .
Because we ’re sane and realistic , we focus on the list , which in our case has seven pirates on it .
TorrentFreak –
And the minimum requirement on the party list is 5 % ?
Christof Leng –
To get into the regional parliament of Hesse , yes , but to my best knowledge , no new party ever achieved this on this first election in an existing federal state .
TorrentFreak –
Are you , however , hopeful ?
Christof Leng –
There are other things to aim at .
If you get 1 % at a regional election , you get public funding .
TorrentFreak –
Is that an attainable goal ?
Christof Leng –
As we are a brand new party it ’s really hard to predict .
The Hessian division of the party was founded in February with only a few pirates .
Less than a year later we already have a efficient organization and were able to collect those 1000 signatures .
And the growth has not slowed down by any means .
It might be not as mind - blowing as in Sweden , but we are really happy with the development .
Now we want to show that we are in fact serious party and can do campaigns and participate in elections .
Furthermore , while we are already well - known in the interested public , we are still mostly unknown to the general public .
Everything we currently do helps us to get more and more attention .
TorrentFreak –
How has your party been viewed by the mainstream media ?
Christof Leng – I have no real overview of that , sorry .
I ’m aware that a lot of newspaper articles have mentioned us as an example of the smaller parties in the upcoming election ( I guess it ’s because of the catchy name ) , but we have been ignored mostly so far .
But the election campaigns just started to heat up , there ’s not much news about the election in general .
We have been covered by media interested in youth , Internet / computer , and / or civil rights .
We are regularly covered by Heise Online , the most important German computer / Internet news site .
A lot of journalists support us , because they feel the pressure of surveillance hits them hard and hits them first .
Freedom of press is endangered and they are aware of it .
There have been several scandals of government agencies investigating journalists and infringing privacy laws while doing that .
You also read more about the US election 11 months away in * German * press than about the Hessian one 2 months away …
TorrentFreak –
It must drive you mad .
Christof Leng –
On the contrary .
The heat of the election in Sweden really did hurt the Swedish pirates .
If it is close and it seems important , many people are afraid of trying something new .
We are new , we still need to build up our reputation .
That ’s much easier now than in an election where people will go for the safe bet anyway .
We ’d not be able to compete with the major parties mainstream media coverage .
With them not being covered by the media either it ’s not that much of an uphill battle , but it is still uphill , of course .
It ’s an optimal setting for us in Germany right now ( as a party , not as a citizen ) .
The two biggest parties form a national coalition .
That boosts smaller parties naturally .
Imagine the US president being a republican and the vice president a democrat …
TorrentFreak – Clearly you do n’t have the financial support that the major parties have , how has that altered your strategies from the traditional methods used in a political campaign ?
Christof Leng –
We claim that we are experts of knowledge society , online cooperation , and sharing .
That is also our strong point in the campaign .
We use the Internet a lot , not only to reach voters , but to coordinate our campaign .
Also , most of the population in Hesse is concentrated in the Rhein - Main area ( Frankfurt is the biggest city ) .
This makes it easy for us to reach a good part of the voters .
Especially the voters that are interested in our topics ( students , IT workers , journalists ) , and they use the internet .
TorrentFreak – with about 38 Million of Germany ’s roughly 82 M citizens as net users , that ’s clearly a core demographic .
Christof Leng – Exactly .
TorrentFreak –
Is there much negative campaigning in Germany ?
Christof Leng – yes , but only bashing the big parties .
We are mostly ignored as a party .
But … they start adopting our positions .
the SPD tries to look like a civil rights party in comparison with the CDU , even though they work together on data retention in the national government .
the Green party made a big fuss on their last convention about how bad data retention is .
The Left party tout the topic too .
Point is , none of the parties takes the topic seriously .
TorrentFreak –
Why is that ?
Christof Leng – the SPD and Green Party prepared much of what is going on now back when they were in government .
The SPD and Left party form a coalition in Berlin and just issued new laws for public surveillance .
each of the established parties plays the white knight for civil rights only as long as they are in opposition .
they are brainwashed as soon as they are in government .
That ’s why we need the Pirate Party .
Jan Huwald , Political secretary of the Piratenpartei Deutschland was similarly upbeat about the election .
“ Most motivating in the upcoming election campaign is it ’s constant relation to grassroot political movement .
Beside the visible activity the word is spreading about the pirates .
Citizens are aware of our new party much more than traditional media ’s coverage might suggest .
In fact while collecting signatures many people actively searched for our signing stand to help out ”
The question still remains , however , if the Hesse party will do any better than Rick Falkvinge , and the Swedes did in 2006 .
hahaha i dunno who is responsible for this .
i can't take the credit but i thought it was fucking hilarious !!!
i found it in my buddy jim mahfood 's myspace account ...

Scientists at the University of Rochester and the J. Craig Venter Institute have discovered a copy of the entire genome of a bacterial parasite residing inside the genome of its host species .
The finding , reported in Science August 30 , suggests that lateral gene transfer -- the movement of genes between unrelated species -- may happen much more frequently between bacteria and multicellular organisms than scientists previously believed , posing dramatic implications for evolution .
Such large - scale heritable gene transfers may allow species to acquire new genes and functions extremely quickly , says Jack Werren , a principle investigator of the study .
The results also have serious repercussions for genome - sequencing projects .
Bacterial DNA is routinely discarded when scientists are assembling invertebrate genomes , yet these genes may very well be part of the organism 's genome , and might even be responsible for functioning traits .
" This study establishes the widespread occurrence and high frequency of a process that we would have dismissed as science fiction until just a few years ago , " says W. Ford Doolittle , Canada Research Chair in Comparative Microbial Genomics at Dalhousie University , who is not connected to the study .
" This is stunning evidence for increased frequency of gene transfer . "
" It did n't seem possible at first , " says Werren , professor of biology at the University of Rochester and a world - leading authority on the parasite , called Wolbachia .
" This parasite has implanted itself inside the cells of 70 percent of the world 's invertebrates , coevolving with them .
And now , we 've found at least one species where the parasite 's entire or nearly entire genome has been absorbed and integrated into the host's .
The host 's genes actually hold the coding information for a completely separate species . "
Wolbachia may be the most prolific parasite in the world - - a " pandemic , " as Werren calls it .
The bacterium invades a member of a species , most often an insect , and eventually makes its way into the host 's eggs or sperm .
Once there , the Wolbachia is ensured passage to the next generation of its host , and any genetic exchanges between it and the host also are much more likely to be passed on .
advertisement
Since Wolbachia typically live within the reproductive organs of their hosts , Werren reasoned that gene exchanges between the two would frequently pass on to subsequent generations .
Based on this and an earlier discovery of a Wolbachia gene in a beetle by the Fukatsu team at the University of Tokyo , Japan , the researchers in Werren 's lab and collaborators at J. Craig Venter Institute ( JCVI ) decided to systematically screen invertebrates .
Julie Dunning - Hotopp at JCVI found evidence that some of the Wolbachia genes seemed to be fused to the genes of the fruitfly , Drosophila ananassae , as if they were part of the same genome .
Michael Clark , a research associate at Rochester then brought a colony of ananassae into Werren 's lab to look into the mystery .
To isolate the fly 's genome from the parasite 's , Clark fed the flies a simple antibiotic , killing the Wolbachia .
To confirm the ananassae flies were indeed cured of the wolbachia , Clark tested a few samples of DNA for the presence of several Wolbachia genes .
To his dismay , he found them .
" For several months , I thought I was just failing , " says Clark .
" I kept administering antibiotics , but every single Wolbachia gene I tested for was still there .
I started thinking maybe the strain had grown antibiotic resistance .
After months of this I finally went back and looked at the tissue again , and there was no Wolbachia there at all . "
Clark had cured the fly of the parasite , but a copy of the parasite 's genome was still present in the fly 's genome .
Clark was able to see that Wolbachia genes were present on the second chromosome of the insect .
Clark confirmed that the Wolbachia genes are inherited like " normal " insect genes in the chromosomes , and Dunning - Hotopp showed that some of the genes are " transcribed " in uninfected flies , meaning that copies of the gene sequence are made in cells that could be used to make Wolbachia proteins .

Werren does n't believe that the Wolbachia " intentionally " insert their genes into the hosts .
Rather , it is a consequence of cells routinely repairing their damaged DNA .
As cells go about their regular business , they can accidentally absorb bits of DNA into their nuclei , often sewing those foreign genes into their own DNA .
But integrating an entire genome was definitely an unexpected find .
Werren and Clark are now looking further into the huge insert found in the fruitfly , and whether it is providing a benefit .
" The chance that a chunk of DNA of this magnitude is totally neutral , I think , is pretty small , so the implication is that it has imparted of some selective advantage to the host , " says Werren .
" The question is , are these foreign genes providing new functions for the host ?
This is something we need to figure out . "
Evolutionary biologists will certainly take note of this discovery , but scientists conducting genome - sequencing projects around the world also may have to readjust their thinking .
Before this study , geneticists knew of examples where genes from a parasite had crossed into the host , but such an event was considered a rare anomaly except in very simple organisms .
Bacterial DNA is very conspicuous in its structure , so if scientists sequencing a nematode genome , for example , come across bacterial DNA , they would likely discard it , reasonably assuming that it was merely contamination -- perhaps a bit of bacteria in the gut of the animal , or on its skin .
But those genes may not be contamination .
They may very well be in the host 's own genome .
This is exactly what happened with the original sequencing of the genome of the anannassae fruitfly -- the huge Wolbachia insert was discarded from the final assembly , despite the fact that it is part of the fly 's genome .
In the early days of the Human Genome Project , some studies appeared to show bacterial DNA residing in our own genome , but those were shown indeed to be caused by contamination .
Wolbachia is not known to infect any vertebrates such as humans .
" Such transfers have happened before in the distant past " notes Werren .
" In our very own cells and those of nearly all plants and animals are mitochondria , special structures responsible for generating most of our cells ' supply of chemical energy .
These were once bacteria that lived inside cells , much like Wolbachia does today .
Mitochondria still retain their own , albeit tiny , DNA , and most of the genes moved into the nucleus in the very distant past .
Like wolbachia , they have passively exchanged DNA with their host cells .
It 's possible wolbachia may follow in the path of mitochondria , eventually becoming a necessary and useful part of a cell .
" In a way , wolbachia could be the next mitochondria , " says Werren .
" A hundred million years from now , everyone may have a wolbachia organelle . "
" Well , not us , " he laughs .
" We 'll be long gone , but wolbachia will still be around . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices jumped to a record $ 111 a barrel on Thursday , extending a rally that has added more than 25 percent to prices in just over a month , amid all - time weakness in the dollar .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
U.S. crude for April delivery settled up 41 cents at $ 110.33 a barrel , after striking the new high of $ 111.00 earlier .
London Brent crude for April , which expires Friday , rose $ 1.27 to $ 107.54 a barrel .
Fears of a U.S. recession have pummeled the value of the U.S. dollar , propelling the nominal price of virtually all commodities traded in the currency , despite the risk of a slowdown in underlying consumption .
“ The relation between the weak dollar and strong crude continues to dictate price direction at the moment , and people are not trading on economic fears , ” said oil analyst Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena , Illinois .
The dollar dropped to a 12 - year low against the yen and a record low versus the euro Thursday on uncertainty about the long - term effect of the Federal Reserve ’s efforts to ease strained credit and money markets .
“ Commodities are likely to have been the key beneficiary of the aggressive Fed rate - cutting cycle , ” Citigroup said in a research note .
Adding to oil ’s strength , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has shrugged off calls from consumer nations for more oil to pull prices back from their peaks .
“ There is no shortage in supplies ...
Actually , supplies are very comfortable , ” Qatar ’s oil minister , Abdullah al - Attiyah , told Al Jazeera television when asked about record prices .
“ Investors have felt extreme pressure , so they headed to oil and gold , after losing confidence in stock markets , property markets , bonds and others , ” he said .
A U.S. government report on Wednesday showed domestic crude stocks rose more than expected last week to the highest since November , while gasoline stocks rose to a 15 - year high .
Christer Aggett shields his face from the camera following his conviction
Christer Merrill Aggett , 32 , who grew up in Sweden , was also convicted of putting other young women at risk .
Aggett was ordered to pay compensation of about £ 213,000 ( 2.72 m kronor ) to 16 victims , including £ 67,000 each to the two girls infected with HIV .
He found his victims through internet chatrooms , the Swedish court heard .
Aggett , 32 , was arrested after his landlord found HIV medications and pictures of him performing sexual acts with young girls .
Aggett , who was born in Britain but is thought to have lived in Sweden since he was a child , had admitted one charge of serious assault and several of attempted serious assault .
Psychiatric tests
However , he denied having had sex with under - age girls , saying he had been unaware of their ages .
The legal age of consent in Sweden is 15 .
The assaults took place between 2003 and 2006 and police have urged all Aggett 's victims to have HIV tests .
The Solna District Court had found Aggett guilty of the charges in November , but ordered that he undergo psychiatric examination before sentencing .
Aggett 's lawyer , Jonas Granfelt , said his client was likely to appeal .
Police suspect Aggett was in contact with at least 130 young women via internet chatrooms and are trying to track them down .
Q : I work for a private - equity firm and was surprised to learn that they do not have any program of charitable giving as a company .
They also do n't match donations by their employees .
I 'd like to suggest a program to the partners .
Can you give me some information on the different options and what the benefits to the firm would be ?
Socially minded in S.F .
A : Many of us tend to think about charitable giving during the holiday season , but nonprofit groups need support year - round , both from individuals and from businesses .
So it 's great that you 're taking the initiative to raise this idea with your company .
Very small businesses typically do their giving in informal ways :
A local insurance agency buys uniforms for a youth soccer team , or a restaurant provides a gift certificate as a raffle prize for a nearby school .
Meanwhile , large corporations have more - structured programs - with an entire department or sometimes a company foundation focused on community giving .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Why do it ?
Frankly , the best reason for giving to charity is that it is simply a good thing to do from a moral perspective .
But there are also business arguments , which include :
-- Fostering a positive image of the company in the community .
-- Strategic marketing , or reaching potential customers by linking your brand to a cause that resonates with them .
( Think about Avon 's identification with breast cancer research through its sponsorship of walkathons . )
-- Employee recruitment and retention .
" Corporate philanthropy is an important aspect of creating a culture that can attract the best candidates , " said Mark Shamley , president of the Association of Corporate Contribution Professionals .
" It shows employees that you 're concerned about things other than the bottom line . "
-- Networking with current or potential clients who also may be involved in charitable causes .
-- Tax benefits - maybe .
For C corporations , charitable donations are treated like any other business expense , so there is no special tax benefit .
But owners of other business entities such as LLCs or partnerships may be able to take a deduction on their personal income taxes .
Check with an accountant for details .
The Association of Corporate Contribution Professionals recommends that businesses give 1 percent of their pretax net profit to charity .
( The current average is about eight - tenths of 1 percent , according to Shamley . )
There are a number of ways that businesses can do this .
Some write checks themselves .
Some match employee contributions .
Others provide pro bono services , lend their facilities or equipment to nonprofit groups , or give employees paid time off to volunteer .
One of the easiest and least - expensive ways to start a charitable giving program is to host a United Way drive , with the company providing a match or other positive incentive for employees to give .
And one trend in the corporate giving world is to get employees involved .
Twenty years ago , the CEO might have funneled company donations to his or her pet charity .
Today , more companies solicit input from their staff or customers .
Take PG&E Corp. , for instance :
For every employee who volunteers 40 hours per year with a nonprofit group , the company donates $ 250 to that group - and lets the employee present the check .
In your situation of a private - equity firm , the owners do n't need to cultivate goodwill among a huge consumer population in the way that an Avon or PG&E does .
But presumably they have a stake in retaining socially conscious employees like you .
And they may also have a stake in educating future generations about finance and investment - for instance , by supporting nonprofit groups that teach financial literacy to high school students .

Q: I have an insurance agency selling home and auto policies , and would like to expand .
For marketing , I do postcard mailings and belong to a networking group .
Can you suggest some other marketing strategies ?
Mystified by marketing
A : Selling insurance is a business built on trust .
Your products and prices are n't much different from the agent down the street , so you 've got to convince people that you provide the most expert advice and personalized , reliable support .
And for that , individual referrals are key .
" Referrals or word of mouth are the best sources of new business development , " said Julia Lehman , a marketing expert with Corsi Partners in San Francisco who has had a number of insurance agency clients .
It 's good that you 're in a networking group , but what kind of group is it ?
There are small , narrowly focused lead - generation groups like BNI .
There are also larger and less - focused business groups like Chambers of Commerce and Rotary Clubs .
Try both approaches .
Also , tap into your current client base for referrals .
" Go and visit them , or at least make a phone call to let them know you 're looking for referrals , " said Paul Terry , a small - business marketing expert with Paul Terry & Associates in San Francisco .
" My State Farm agent gives a $ 10 Starbucks gift card for any referrals .
Other companies may offer to make a gift to charity for each referral . "
Develop connections with related professionals such as real estate agents , who can refer clients to you .
" Find three or four Realtors who like what you do and visit them , " Terry said .
" It 's about building relationships - showing up , calling back , spending the time to build those relationships . "
Bolster your reputation by getting involved in the community through local schools , arts groups or churches .
The goal , Lehman said , is " to be known as someone who follows through and can be counted upon .
It does n't even have to be related to insurance . "

WONDER LAKE , Illinois ( CNN ) --
The girlfriend of the gunman who killed five people and then himself at Northern Illinois University last Thursday told CNN there was " no indication he was planning something . "
Jessica Baty said her boyfriend , Steven Kazmierczak , gave no warning of the shooting rampage at NIU .

" He was n't erratic .
He was n't delusional .
He was Steve ; he was normal , " Jessica Baty tearfully said in an exclusive interview Sunday .
Baty , 28 , said she dated Steven Kazmierczak off and on for two years and had most recently been living with him .
" He was a worrier , " she said .
He once told her he had " obsessive - compulsive tendencies " and that his parents committed him as a teen to a group home because he was " unruly " and used to cut himself , she said .
" He was worried about everything , he worried about me . "
But , she added , that he had never exhibited self - destructive behavior during their time together .
" Everybody has a past , and everybody goes through hard times , " Baty said .
Kazmierczak had been seeing a psychiatrist on a monthly basis , Baty said .
She said he was taking an anti-depressant , but he had stopped taking the medication three weeks ago because " it made him feel like a zombie . "
" He was n't acting erratic , " she said .
" He was just a little quicker to get annoyed . "
Watch as Baty explains why she still loves NIU gunman »
Police say Kazmierczak burst into an NIU geology class on February 14 and opened fire with at least a shotgun and two handguns , killing five students while dozens fled for their lives .
Authorities were on the scene within a few minutes , but by the time they reached the classroom , Kazmierczak , 27 , had shot himself to death .
Baty knew her boyfriend had purchased at least two guns .
He told her they were for home protection .
The day of the shooting , Baty was in class at the University of Illinois where she and Kazmierczak had transferred from NIU .
He was pursuing a master 's degree in sociology , and she is going for a master 's in social work .
He planned to study law and had signed up to take the LSAT test , she said .
She is hoping to get her doctorate in social work .
The students in her class began to talk about a mass shooting taking place at NIU in DeKalb , Illinois .

Oblivious that Kazmierczak could have anything to do with it , Baty said she had tried calling him several times Thursday , but her calls went directly into his voice mail .
" I was worried about him because he was supposed to come to class , " she said .
" He never missed a class . "
When Baty learned that Kazmierczak was the shooter , she said , " I could n't believe it . "
" I said , ' No , you have the wrong person .
He 's not in DeKalb . '
He was n't supposed to be there .
He was on his way home to see me .
It did n't make any sense at all . "
She had last seen him Monday morning , when he told her he was planning to drive north to visit his ill godfather who he had not seen in a long time .
Kazmierczak " told me that he loved me and that he would see me on Thursday and missed me , " she said .
" That whole week I talked to him ; he sounded fine . "
" The Steven I know and love was not the man that walked into that building , " she said .
" He was anything but a monster .
He was probably the nicest , most caring person ever . "
She said she was talking to the news media about Kazmierczak because , " He can not be defined by his last actions .
There was so much more than that . "
Since Thursday , Baty said authorities have intercepted several packages Kazmierczak sent her , including several items such as : the book " The Antichrist " by Friedrich Nietszche ; a textbook for her class about serial killers ; a package with a gun holster and bullets ; a new cell phone that she had told him she wanted and about $ 100 in cash .
She read the contents of a note he sent to her .
" You are the best Jessica ! " it read .
" You 've done so much for me , and I truly do love you .
You will make an excellent psychologist or social worker someday !
Do n't forget about me !
Love , Steven Kazmierczak . "
But there was no letter explaining the NIU slayings .
" I 'm praying that there 's another one somewhere that tells why and what he was thinking and what he was feeling and why he would n't want me to help him , " she said .
Though the two had chosen to transfer to the University of Illinois , " there was no hard feelings [ toward NIU ] , " she said .
" He said all the time how grateful he was that he went there . "
She said she had never known her boyfriend to lie : " He was always open and honest .
We did n't keep anything from each other . "
" I would have helped him , I would have done something for him , " Baty said .
Even last week , when the two talked every night until the killings , she was not alarmed .
It was during their last conversation , a few minutes past midnight Wednesday , that she got her first inkling that something was amiss , she said .
" He told me not to forget about him and he told me that he would see me tomorrow , and when we got off the phone he said ' Goodbye . '
He never said goodbye . "
Shaking and crying , her family at her side during the interview , Baty said she still loves the man she met in a hallway at NIU when they were both undergraduate students .
Baty said she feels sorry for the victims and their families and friends .
" I know what they 're going through , and I just can't tell them how sorry I am , " she said .
But , she added , " He was a victim , too , and I know they probably wo n't want to hear that , but he was . "
Like comments from teachers which have been widely reported , she said Kazmierczak was an achiever who always tried to get ahead in class and seemed committed to criminal justice issues .
Pictures of their relationship do n't betray anything odd .
They are scenes of the two of them smiling on Florida beaches , on golf courses and having fun at Disney World .
Teachers and others who knew Kazmierczak have said he was fascinated with prison culture .
In 2006 , when he was a student at NIU , police said , he worked on a graduate paper that described his interest in " corrections , political violence and peace and social justice . "
The paper said Kazmierczak was " co-authoring a manuscript on the role of religion in the formation of early prisons in the United States . "
" I did n't think he was crazy , " said Baty , sobbing .
" I still love him . "

update : apparently this is now in the first page of google results for “ binary reader ” , so i feel obligated to point out that i posted an update on this , with better versions thanks to commenters both here and on reddit .
i post this in the tradition of pointlessly showing how concisely one ’s favorite language can perform a given task .
also , i’m slightly proud of this version , as my previous was n’t nearly as to the point ( and was n’t point free ! ) .
so , here it is :
readBin = ( `div` 2 ) . foldl ( \x y -> ( x + y ) * 2 ) 0 . map ( \c -> case c of { ‘ 0 ’ -> 0 ; ‘ 1 ’ ->
1 ; _ -> error “ Input is not a binary string . ” } )
previous to this , i was using :
readBin xs = core ( map bin xs ) 0
where
core [ x ] n = n + x
core ( x :xs ) n = core xs ( ( x + n ) * 2 )
bin c = case c of { ‘ 0 ’ -> 0 ; ‘ 1 ’ ->
1 ; _ -> error ” Input is not a binary string . ” }
which , while absolutely equivalent , is overly verbose .
now i’ll explain the algorithm for those of you to whom it ’s not blindingly obvious ( i’m not doing anything tricky or special here , i swear .
i’m not that cool . ) .
so , first off , we ’re mapping over this string ( strings are lists of chars in haskell ) , and converting each ‘ 0 ’ or ‘ 1 ’ to the 0 or 1 , respectively .
also , if we come across something aside from a ‘ 0 ’ or ‘ 1 ’ , we raise an error .
once the string is converted to a list of ints , we consume the first value of the list , add it to an accumulator , and multiply that by two .
why ?
because by definition any binary integer has the decimal value of the sum of all the digits , going from right to left , to the nth power , where n is the index starting from zero of the right to left position in the binary representation .
so , wait , if we ’re summing and raising to the nth power each digit from right to left , then why are we using a left fold ( foldl ) ?
because , in this case , adding the digit to the accumulator ( x in the lambda passed to foldl ) and then multiplying that times two is exactly equivalent to the previous definition i gave of the decimal value of a binary integer .
i’ll leave figuring out exactly why that ’s the case to the reader .
also , in case you did n’t notice , the fold i’m using in the first definition does one more multiplication by two than the other version , which is why , to reap the benefit of a more elegant , pointfree version , we must divide by two at the end .
the point , on the whole , of this ?
well , as i already said , it ’s pointless .
but if there were to be one , it ’d be this : damn , haskell is cool .
i could n’t have ever done that in other languages i’ve used .
( but i’m sure someone else could .
i’m just not that cool . )
p.s. : if anyone finds any flaws with any of what i’ve said here , please take the time to comment — while this algorithm has passed a few test runs , and it seems right intuitively , i’m just not experienced enough to be sure it actually is .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Five months ago many economists said high oil prices would n't hurt the economy - now they 're choking on their words .
Back in October , when oil prices were near $ 90 a barrel and the economy was still humming along economists said high oil prices should n't cut into economic growth .
The economy used oil more efficiently than it did in the 1970s , and spending on gas was just a small percent of people 's budget , the experts said .
Fast forward to March and you 've got a sputtering economy , and economists saying $ 105 oil deserves a big part of the blame .
Even the White House is beginning to sound more pessimistic , predicting Friday that the the economy could contract .
" You have a very significant restraint on consumer spending , " said Chris Lafakis , an associate economist at Moody 's Economy.com , an economic consultancy .
" It acts as a tax would . "
Lafakis said consumers spend an extra $ 5 billion each year for each $ 1 increase in the price of crude .
When economists were predicting that oil would n't negatively impact the economy , they based their assertion on a price of about $ 80 a barrel .
But if oil stays at $ 100 a barrel for the next 12 months , consumers will have shelled out an extra $ 100 billion on oil by next year .
That 's an extra $ 100 billion not being spent at the mall , mega - mart or multiplex .
" The entire stimulus package could be drained by higher energy costs , " Lafakis said , referring to the $ 120 billion lawmakers will refund to taxpayers in an effort to keep the economy out of recession .
" That has the potential to turn a mild recession into something more dark . "
Worse to come
Of course , high oil prices are not the only thing weighing on consumer spending , which accounts for about two - thirds of all U.S. economic activity .
Declining home values mean people can't access cash through a home equity loan or profit from higher sale prices .
In addition , the economy is shedding jobs , and unemployed people tend to spend less money .
" On its own , $ 100 oil would n't pull the economy into recession , " said Beth Ann Bovino , a senior economist at Standard and Poor's .
" But given the other factors , it 's just another shoe to drop . "
Both Bovino and Lafakis have similar predictions for the economy - a mild recession lasting the first and second quarters of 2008 , then a modest recovery beginning in the second half of this year .
However , if oil goes to $ 115 or $ 120 a barrel - certainly not an outlandish thought given that crude prices have nearly doubled over the last 12 months - then those bets may be off .
Bovino said $ 115 oil , along with worsening conditions in the credit and foreign investment market , could be enough to keep the economy in recession through the first part of 2009 .
" It would sure give the pessimistic forecast more credibility , " she said .
A bookmark is the standard compliment for online writers .
We applaud singers , we laugh at comedians jokes , and we bookmark articles we find on the web .
Bookmarks and links fuel your blogs success .
What can we do to get more bookmarks ?
Why then do some get bookmarked while others get largely ignored ?
It ’s not just about writing great content .
You can create valuable , interesting , well - written articles that get zero bookmarks .
You can also build a fantastic blog that entertains or informs your loyal readers but hardly ever gets linked to .
Why would you want bookmarks ?
First of all a bookmark means an intention to return .
That in itself is a good sign .
Repeat visitors have always been very valuable to have .
It ’s the knock - on effects that bring greatest value , though .
Repeat - visitors can become loyal , longer term readers .
Loyal readers are more likely to refer others .
Then , of course , there are the shared bookmarks which help your content become viral , driving more traffic and helping to attract links .
The sorts of articles that get bookmarked get more links .
They are exactly the sorts of articles that will get maximum referrals from other bloggers because they know their readers will want to know about them too .
This builds links , search engine traffic and increased positive brand awareness .
I guess a better question might be “ why would you not want bookmarks ” !
If bookmarks are so great , for both readers and authors , why are we not bookmarking all the time ?
The difference happens when you take the next step and create something not just worthwhile but “ bookmarkable ” .
What makes something bookmarkable ?
Imagine yourself in the readers role for a moment …
What goes through your readers mind when they bookmark an article ?
“ No time to read this now but it looks interesting ” – This is the ultimate skimmer .
They give your article a quick look and if it passes the smell test then you get a bookmark .
It often turns out that they never do come back .
“ I will definitely come back and read again this later ” – Unlike the above , this person does intend to come back and probably even quickly read the article one time but wants to give it more concentration .
“ This will be a handy reference ” – Cooks bookmark recipes .
As a programmer I used to have lots of cheat sheets , pieces of code , etc bookmarked .
As a writer for a long while I had a swipe - file of useful headlines and such .
“ These instructions will be useful ” – From “ how to fix the plumbing ” to “ 10 things to do in case of earthquake ” , it is good to keep instructions around .
“ My friends will love this ” – Social bookmarkers do n’t just bookmark for their own use .
The more they share the more benefits to you !
“ LOL ! ” – Part of the reason for Dilbert ’s popularity I am sure is the amount of times strips were cut out and pinned to cubicle walls .
Perhaps bookmarking is the online version ?
“ I need to keep checking this ” – Your reference does n’t have to be a one - time thing .
Think of constantly updated articles with updates as the story progresses , event calendars , world - time planners , or tools like stock tickers .
“ While I do n’t need this right now it might come in handy later ” – Some readers are hoarders , they have bookmarked lots of articles Sometimes you bookmark just in case .
“ Nice content , I will reward you with a bookmark ! ” –
It ’s true , sometimes people will Digg , Stumble or Delicious out of gratitude or as a compliment .
“ Well you did ask nicely ” – If your good friend asks for a Digg , and you like their article , you give them a vote , right ?
If you think as a reader you can have a better idea of which of your articles are going to get more bookmarks .
In general a bookmarkable post will have the following qualities …
What are the properties of bookmarkable content ?
Bookmarkable content is going to have several or all of these factors :
It ’s got to have obvious value – At a glance the reader has to be able to see what is in it for them .
No benefit , no bookmark .
– At a glance the reader has to be able to see what is in it for them .
No benefit , no bookmark .
It ’s got to be remarkable – If what they are looking at seems old news then why bookmark ?
– If what they are looking at seems old news then why bookmark ?
It ’s got to be worth a second look – Sometimes you can get a lot out of an article but never return , is it still going to be valuable on a second or third look ?
– Sometimes you can get a lot out of an article but never return , is it still going to be valuable on a second or third look ?
It ’s got to need a second look – Some of the best resources ca n’t be consumed all in one go .
Is your article a snack or a banquet ?
– Some of the best resources ca n’t be consumed all in one go .
Is your article a snack or a banquet ?
It ’s got to be timeless or constantly updated – If your article is dated after only a few days then it will not gain maximum traction , on the other hand if it is timeless or always up to date then people will come back again and again .
– If your article is dated after only a few days then it will not gain maximum traction , on the other hand if it is timeless or always up to date then people will come back again and again .
It ’s got to be comprehensive – Do n’t just nibble away at the corner of a topic , give your reader your all .
– Do n’t just nibble away at the corner of a topic , give your reader your all .
It ’s got to be specific – While I said it has to be comprehensive , do n’t take that to mean you should try to cram everything imaginable into it .
Stay on the topic , deliver the promise you make in the headline .
Solve one problem .
Focus on one clear benefit .
So we know the kind of thing we are looking for , how exactly do we make sure we get more bookmarks ?
How do you get more bookmarks ?
If you have any barriers to bookmarking then you will get fewer bookmarks .
Common sense , right ?
You would think so but sometimes people seem to try to make it hard on their readers .
Follow this list to make sure you have the basics …
Give people the tools – Widgets and plugins exist to make it easy for people to bookmark .
Use them .
Make it easy as one click – Do n’t make people have to register with unusual services or hunt around for your links .
In general the first person to bookmark has the hard work so get someone to do the initial submission first .
Ask for bookmarks from the reader – Sometimes you need to prompt readers to take action , but be polite .
Tell your friends –
To start getting traction ask your friends for some help .
Inform “ sneezers ” – Politely inform people you know who like to spread links .
Point out the benefits simply , and do not demand .
Do n’t spam .
A good place to share your link is Twitter , while not as direct it is less annoying than unsolicited email .
So you have put together what you think is a great resource and told your friends .
Everything should be golden , right ?
Right ?
What should you not do ?
Anyone who spends time using Digg , StumbleUpon or Del.icio.us will see the same mistakes made over and over …
Do not steal – This is a case where copying is not flattery , it is theft .
Do n’t even try to get bookmarks to copied material .
Do not hype – Your headline makes a promise that your content has to deliver .
Over hyping will just set you up for a fail or come across as snake oil .
Do not rush – Spend time crafting your article .
The better the finished product the more benefit you will get .
Do not spam –
The temptation will be to try to cram every article into Digg , and tell everyone in the world about each submission – woah , do n’t get carried away , pick your battles .
Do not over monetize – Once you get some links and traffic you might want to grab some cash by putting ads all around your content .
In fact this will make you less likely to receive the bookmarks you so need as people will think they are being scammed for your financial benefit .
You have your original content , you have trimmed back the ads to the bare minimum , and you have told only selected people .
What now ?
How can we put this baby to bed ? …
How can you increase your chances of being bookmarked ?
Once you have the bones of a killer resource there are still some tweaks that you can apply to be in the best place to get tons of bookmarks .
While there are no guarantees , the following tips will help :
Optimize headlines –
The first thing your reader will see will normally be the headline .
Make it scream out to be clicked .
Optimize your introduction – Your headline sells the click but the intro sells the article .
Create a killer first sentence .
Then follow it up with another .
Bookmarks live or die based on a snap judgment so make sure the introduction , and therefore article , begs to be read .
Optimize URLs / Slug –
If your article is to be shared around via email , forums and IM , then you need a simple URL .
In most CMS you can specify a short and snappy URL , filename or in WordPress the “ slug ” .
Optimize appearance – Pictures are worth many words but they also break up the wall of text , plus help the reader make that snap “ yes ” decision .
Great pics can be found on Flickr .
Optimize phrasing and sentence structure – Is your article skimmable ?
Do you have lots of complicated jargon ?
Do you use long meandering sentences ?
Simplify to clarify !
If you have followed the advice so far you should be well placed , but there is one last important tip to share …
The final , and biggest tip
Make it a habit to think like a reader !
Get into the bookmarking mindset .
Take notice when and why you bookmark .
Notice which articles get popular on Del.icio.us and Digg .
I hope this article has given you some ideas for how you can get more bookmarks and links .
Please share your thoughts and advice in the comments , and of course , bookmarks would be most welcome 🙂
Union representatives for Royal Dutch Shell 's IT workers demanded talks with the firm's top management yesterday over the outsourcing of up to 3,000 jobs at the oil giant .
The call came as Shell reported full - year earnings of £ 13.9 bn – the biggest ever profit for a British company .
The numbers prompted outrage amongst workers who were told a month ago that the firm was in talks with EDS and other companies about outsourcing as many as 3,000 jobs .
Unite regional officer Graham Tran told The Register that the Shell IT workforce in Aberdeen were " absolutely disgusted " with the firm 's profits , as it left the future of thousands of IT workers in the balance .
Tran claimed that UK workers who expect to be affected by the job cull remained " in the dark " while their Dutch counterparts were in negotiation about their future with the oil giant .
" It 's the usual Shell process in which they refuse to be upfront and tell everyone the open and honest truth , " he said .
" But they 're not telling us anything and are instead busy lining the pockets of shareholders . "
The union has called for a meeting with the firm 's CEO Jeroen van der Veer about the " arrogant behaviour of certain execs in Aberdeen " , Tran said .
He added the union was still considering taking legal action against the firm .
Shell has told Unite that it hoped to make £ 250 m in savings via a number of outsourcing deals with contracts expected to be inked with EDS , AT&T and T - systems – a decision which has left 3,200 UK workers at the firm facing an uncertain future .
We asked Shell if it could tell us any more about its offshore plans , but a spokeswoman told us " we do n’t really have an update on that at the moment . " ®
Bolivians say coca leaf use is a long tradition in their country
The UN's International Narcotics Control Board has called on Bolivia to ban coca chewing , and the use of the plant in products such as tea .
Bolivia says such a ban would be an attack on its culture .
Analysts say much of Bolivia 's coca harvest goes into cocaine , making it the world 's third - largest producer .
Bolivian outrage
Bolivians call coca " the sacred leaf " .
They say it has been used by indigenous peoples for centuries to alleviate hunger and tiredness , for medicinal purposes and in religious rituals .
UN conventions list coca as a dangerous substance , along with cocaine and opium .
Last week , an annual report by the International Narcotics Control Board reminded Bolivia that coca leaves could legally be used for medical and scientific purposes only .
Bolivia , and neighbouring Peru , should " abolish or prohibit activities ... such as coca leaf chewing and the manufacture of coca tea " , the report said .
The report has sparked outrage in Bolivia .
" We wo n't accept it because coca is our culture , our tradition .
We will defend it because coca for us is also food , " said Geronimo Meneces , Bolivia 's Vice - Minister of Coca and Integral Development .
Bolivian President Evo Morales has agreed to reduce the number of coca plantations , limiting production for " traditional " uses such as leaf chewing and tea .
A fascinating bridge in Japan .
Many innovations seem only to appear where there is a really unusual need , warranting an unusual solution .
The Kawazu - Nanadaru Loop Bridge in Japan is one such example :
How do you build a bridge from one mountainside to another when the sides of the mountain are so steep that it is not possible to build a road at the same elevation on both sides ?
This double spiral brings cars up and down a full 45 meters ( 148 feet ) while being seemingly suspended in a valley between two mountainsides .
Some other stats :
– 1.1 km long
– 80 meters in diameter
– speed limit : 30 km /h
Coming upon this bridge in the middle of this mountain road is quite an experience .
The bridge was finished in 1982 and has become a popular landmark on route 414 heading south from Tokyo towards the hot spring resorts of the Izu peninsula .
The only way for traffic to get down the mountainside into the valley , too steep for any other usual road - building solutions .
The busy Route 414 serves the weekend crowd from Tokyo , intent to wind down at the hot springs resort of the Izu Peninsula .
The “ winding down ” bit obviously starts at this bridge .
The double - spiral structure demands careful driving – the speed limit on the bridge is only 30 km/h , which also helps to better enjoy .
I wonder how many people have accidentally driven of the edge due to dizziness .
As soon as they install a vertical loop iâ€™m there . 😉

The following rationales are valid for not wanting to eat meat from cloned animals : eating cloned meat makes you go “ ewwww ” ; you think cloning is “ playing God ” ; you find cloning for food an unethical use of the technology ; you think cloned meat should be labeled ; you think genetic engineering of food is wrong ; you ’re a vegetarian ; you consider the technology is unethical from an animal welfare standpoint .
The following is not : “ the meat is n’t safe . ”
When I first heard about the FDA ruling , I was not at all surprised .
After all , clones are nearly genetically identical to their “ parent , ” and so their tissues would naturally be identical to their parent ’s as well .
So long as the parent was edible , the clone would be too .
This is , after all , the very definition of a clone : “ an individual grown from a single somatic cell or cell nucleus and genetically identical to it ” .
And it takes no more than a middle school science background and a little logic to understand that if the genes for a cow produced edible meat in one animal , those exact same genes in a cloned cow would also produce edible meat .
If the FDA had found that cloned meat was n’t safe , I would have raised an eyebrow and wondered if they ’d be bought off by some animal rights outfit .
But in the few days since the FDA announcement , the vast majority of the criticism I ’ve seen leveled at the FDA is based on how the meat ca n’t possibly be safe for human consumption .
It ’s the same meat – so long as the genes are identical to the parent , there is no difference in the enzymes created by the genes , the proteins created by the genes , the cellular membranes and organelles created by the genes – none .
The only explanation that fits for this outcry is something that we ’ve bemoaned here at S&R before : the ignorance of the public and of journalists regarding science , partly as a result of rampantly anti-science movements in education and in our government .
I would understand the safety concerns of cloning critics if we were talking about a true genetically modified organism ( GMO ) here , but we ’re not .
The clone is simply a copy , with no more errors in than likely occurs in nature anyway .
It ’s not like making a cat that glows in the dark , beef that tastes like salmon , or inserting a trichinosis - resistant fungus gene to pig chromosomes – every one of those examples would give me pause about the safety of the meat ( OK – not the cat ) .
But not an actual clone , and it ’s safety of the actual clone that was verified by the FDA .
If you want to lobby Congress to change the rules and require labeling of cloned meat , go for it .
I for one will welcome your efforts , and might even join in .
But please , try to avoid using the scientifically invalid safety concern as your rationale .

All the reincarnations of living Buddhas of Tibetan Buddhism must get government approval , otherwise they are " illegal or invalid , " China 's State Administration for Religious Affairs ( SARA ) said in Beijing Friday .
The SARA has issued a set of regulations on reincarnation of Tibetan living Buddhas , which will take effect as of September 1 .
" It is an important move to institutionalize management on reincarnation of living Buddhas , " the SARA said in a statement issued Friday .
The regulations require that a temple which applies for reincarnation of a living Buddha must be " legally - registered venues for Tibetan Buddhism activities and are capable of fostering and offering proper means of support for the living Buddha . "
All the reincarnation applications must be submitted to the religious affairs department of the provincial - level government , the provincial - level government , SARA , and the State Council , respectively , for approval in accordance with the fame and influence of the living Buddhas in the religious circle , the regulations said .
" The selection of reincarnates must preserve national unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups and the selection process cannot be influenced by any group or individual from outside the country , " SARA said .
Tibet became an administrative district directly under the central authorities of the Yuan Dynasty ( 1279 - 1368 ) in the 13th century .
Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty conferred the title of living Buddha on Vphag - pa , a religious leader in Tibet at that time .
Since then , people began to call eminent monks in Tibet living Buddhas .
SARA said the regulations are favor of guaranteeing normal religious activities of Tibetan Buddhism and protecting the religious belief of Tibetan Buddhism followers according to law .
" The government only administrate religious affairs related to state and the public interests and will not interfere in the pure internal religious affairs , " SARA says .
The regulations are composed of 14 articles , including the principle , conditions , approval procedures , the duties and responsibilities of religious groups for reincarnation as well as punishment for those violating the regulations .

Is the big city life a little too noisy for you ?
Is all the honking and screaming really getting to you ?
Would a visual meter of the noise level and the ruckus assist in getting people to realize we are simply too loud ?
Volumen , designed by Sergio Avello , is a large meter presenting the urban noise level outside the Relegaleria in Buenos Aires .
It resembles the Art Lebedev design of the remote control with a button for every channel , but is actually built and standing .
The volume levels are visually indicated by the different cells and colors on the large art piece and shown in real time .
When I first read about this , I immediately thought of the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City .
As drivers are getting close to its entrance , there are signs mentioning a fine if they honk their horn .
This may be a tactic to prevent honking , but the sound of the city is still extremely strong , and fine or no fine , we still drown in it .
The Volumen concept may not be as practical ; to build a tall standing piece in main city parts , but it sure does present a positive concept .
The idea of illustrating passing individuals how loud the area truly is may help people to decrease the noise level a few notches .
Is your city of residence too loud ?
Would the Volumen meter help reduce the noise or just get drowned in it ?

But the Good News : Provisional Ballots , Newly Discovered as Uncounted , as Reported by The BRAD BLOG on Friday , Were Ultimately Counted ... by Hand !
Joint Legislative Hearing on ' Double Bubble ' and Other Super Tuesday Problems to be Held on Friday in Los Angeles ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/4/2008 , 1:37 pm PT
As we wait for the next round of thousands of disenfranchised voters to emerge from OH , TX , VT , RI , or beyond , Los Angeles County has finally finished counting its infamously disastrous " Double Bubble " ballots from the Feb.
5th Super Tuesday Primary in California .
The final numbers , in just in time to meet today 's local certification deadline , are supposed to hearten us because the county Registrar 's office chose to not count only some 12,000 valid , legally cast votes in the state 's open Democratic Primary .
What a victory !
It 's kinda like celebrating the great success of the troop " surge " in Iraq where " coalition " fatalities have plummeted from pre-surge levels of 2.39 dead troops per day all the way down to 2.37 dead troops per day .
As we predicted , many of the districts counted resulted in very lopsided results .
That was likely due to the horrible , unfair counting scheme the Registrar 's office decided to use .
The scheme disproportionately , and almost randomly , tossed out thousands of votes for some candidates , but tallied all of those for others --- even when they were all cast in the very same precinct , by the very exact same method .
According to the results of this " supplemental count , " as posted at the Registrar 's website [ PDF ] , it looks like our fears have come to pass in that department as well .
But there is a bit of actual good news in all of this , small comfort though it may be .
Our concerns about the newly discovered uncounted provisional " Double Bubble " ballots , that we reported on Friday , were heard , even if our other concerns --- as attributed to us by name in today 's Whittier Daily News coverage of the final tabulation --- were summarily dismissed by acting Registrar Dean Logan for unspecified " legal " reasons , according to that news report ...
In the Whittier Daily News , Alison Hewitt reports on the results of the final tally of some of the approximately 59,000 previously uncounted ballots which Logan deemed to count over the weekend .
He had originally said that all of those ballots were " impossible " to interpret , due to previous Registrar Conny McCormack 's irresponsible ballot design , which required Non-Partisan voters who wished to vote in the open Democratic or American Independent party primaries to fill in a second bubble on the ballot to specify which of those parties the ballot should be counted for .
Hewitt quotes
The BRAD BLOG in her report , and manages to get a non-response response from Logan --- something we were unable to get ourselves , since none of the multiple calls to him and his office over the last several weeks were ever returned --- about the counting plan we 'd proffered .
Our suggest plan would have counted nearly every one of those previously uncounted ballots , legally , 100 % accurately and as per the state Constitution which quaintly requires : " A voter who casts a vote in an election in accordance with the laws of this State shall have that vote counted . "
From today 's Daily News ...
[ V] oting rights blogger Brad Friedman criticized the final count by saying the thousands of voters were disenfranchised because their votes went uncounted .
He proposed all the double - bubble votes be counted as Democratic votes , " with the number of unaccounted - for ( nonpartisan American Independent ) votes in any precinct then being subtracted from each candidate 's total . "
Logan said that did not appear to be legal .
No more specifics were offered , by Hewitt , concerning Logan 's response .
But we suspect he did n't offer many more details about what did n't " appear to be legal " about our suggested method .
Had he gone into the legal basis for his claim , if there are any , we suspect he would have tripped up on the fact that the scheme he did use to count some of the previously uncounted Democratic Presidential Primary votes would likely have been laughed out of court , had anybody bothered to take it there .
Logan 's bad scheme counted thousands of votes for some candidates , while simply discarding thousands of votes for other candidates , in the very same precincts , simply because some of the candidates had the bad luck of being placed in a particular ballot position that was also used by American Independent Party candidates --- all by McCormack 's ridiculous design .
While Logan decided to randomly disenfranchise some 12,000 county voters , at least he seems to have paid attention to the concerns we expressed here on Friday , after it was discovered that a guesstimated 10 to 15,000 " Double Bubble " provisional ballots would have also gone uncounted by the woefully inequitable scheme he 'd devised .
Thankfully , Logan reportedly allowed those provisional ballots to be hand - counted , as local Election Integrity advocate Judy Alter of ProtectCaliforniaBallots.org , had originally suggested in our Friday article , after she had discovered the additional , uncounted ballots that Logan 's plan would n't have bothered to tally .
A lawsuit and / or recount could still be in the offing , if any of the candidates decides to pursue the matter .
Legal experts we 've consulted with have suggested there would certainly be fertile grounds here .
Though whether any of the candidates actually wishes to come up with the thousands of dollars such a suit would likely cost --- in hopes of forcing the county to do the job that it 's already been paid to do by taxpayers --- is another matter .
While the ballots that Logan bothered to ultimately add to the finally tally do n't appear to have changed the overall delegate counts for L.A. County , thousands and thousands of voters were needlessly --- and we 'd argue , illegally --- disenfranchised by the public officials who are paid to run their elections .
( Our elections , since we also happen to be an L.A. County voter . )
In American elections , however , it seems that final horse race results --- whatever officials decide they are allowed to be --- are far more important than ensuring that every voice in an allegedly democratic system , has actually been heard .
The final numbers from Dean 's " Supplemental Count " of the " Double Bubble " ballots have now been posted here [ PDF ] .
Unfortunately , unlike all the other results from L.A. County [ PDF ] , the " supplemental " tallies are posted only by Congressional District , not by precinct , so the specific numbers of ballots which were thrown away wholesale , are impossible to see .
Where the final " supplemental " totals ( Clinton 51 % , Obama 42 % ) are reportedly in line - ish with all of the previously reported results for the entire county ( Clinton 55 % , Obama 41 % ) , various Congressional District results from the " supplemental count " are way of proportion from that .
For example , while some of the CD results are in line with the overall totals , most are proportionally out of whack .
Here 's just a few to give you an idea ...
29th CD : Clinton 59 % , Obama 24 %
31th CD : Clinton 68 % , Obama 26 %
34th CD : Clinton 61 % , Obama 31 %
35th CD : Clinton 27 % , Obama 67 %
36th CD : Clinton 62 % , Obama 31 %
Of course , there could be perfectly legitimate reasons for such imbalanced numbers , in an otherwise close overall election .
The more likely reason , however , for the imbalance is that Logan chose to simply toss out votes for any candidate listed on the # 8 to # 10 bubbles in most precincts ( if there were any Non-Partisan voters who chose to vote in the American Independent Primary in that precinct , since that party was assigned the same bubbles for its own candidates ) , while choosing to count the votes for any Democratic candidate who happened to have the good luck of being assigned the # 11 to # 15 bubble on the ballot .
Ballot position was supposedly randomly rotated by Congressional District .
The Registrar 's web page , however , fails to report the rotation .
Nor does it report the raw , precinct - by - precinct numbers from the " supplement count , " where we might see a few hundred votes tallied for Obama , for example , with zero votes for Clinton recorded in the same precinct .
So we are left with the above , and whatever speculation may ensue .
Heckuva job , Logan .
Post - Script :
There will be a " joint informational hearing , " held by a number of committees from the State Legislature , on " Problems Faced by Voters , " this Friday in Los Angeles at 1 pm ( Ronald Reagan State Building Auditorium , 300 South Spring Street ) .
Testimony is to be taken from the public on the " Double Bubble " issue and other related matters .
Scheduled official witnesses include the " Double Bubble " ballot designer , former Registrar Conny McCormack , who quit her job just one month before the election , then claimed disingenuously after the election that this was all " an unfortunate , unanticipated result , " which " no one could have predicted , " even though she knew full well about the problem , as it had previously disenfranchised 40 % of Non-Partisan county voters in several past elections .
Acting Registrar Dean Logan and Secretary of State Debra Bowen are also scheduled to testify , as well as others .
The BRAD BLOG has not been asked to testify , though we will try to get to the hearing , if possible , while we 're still here in L.A .
We are scheduled to hit the road on or about the same date , so whether we can get there ourselves in person is still in question .
We shall see .
I may not agree with what is said here , but let it be said that
Squeak by Example , 2.0 ! 12 March , 2008
Stéphane Ducasse has just announced that the second edition of Squeak By Example has just been published .
It is available for download from the Squeak By Example website , or if you prefer paper to phosphors , you can order a hard copy from print - on - demand publishers lulu.com for only € 16.18/$ 20.10/£11.07 .
Licensed under the creative commons by - sa licence , the first edition was a great success , with over 20,000 downloads in less than six months .
For the second edition , the authors Oscar Nierstrasz , Stéphane Ducasse , Damien Pollet and Andrew P. Black , have reviewed and revised the contents based on feedback from readers .
At over 300 pages , the book is an excellent introduction to developing in Squeak , and the overall organization and choice of topics makes it a great reference work .
I 'm not saying gaming news should become as mature a genre of journalism as politics , business , and world news .
It 's still a new field and will always be as subjective as covering music or film , with the accompanying celebrity culture .
But now that women outnumber men in online gaming , party games like Rock Band appeal to both sexes , and casual games ( popular among women and adults ) are the fastest - growing segment of the gaming industry , gaming journalism should be an all - inclusive genre .
Why does it still pander to a core audience of straight young males with outdated misogynistic material , to the boredom and frustration of all of us who can get laid outside of World of Warcraft ?
I 'm not talking merely about tech and gaming journalists who write about sex and porn .
Wired is doing its job when it analyzes the business of porn ; Gizmodo is just playing when its staff leaves the CES tech conference for the AVN porn conference next door to poke fun at the dildos .
Gaming journalism does n't need to sanitize itself ; gaming gets dirty and so should the writing .
Plus , well , I wanna read about sex .
What needs to stop is the boy 's club , in which women are only featured as sex objects .
Forget being offended by it ; I 'm just sick of it — if I want titillation , I 'll go to porn or , you know , an actual woman .
Maybe I 'll read Esquire , where they at least pretend to respect an actress 's work before showing off her calves .
See , it 's not just that gaming journalism is obsessed with sexy women , it 's that the obsession takes such an awkward form .
The practice is found all over the industry .
Some examples :
Porn Stars Love Video Games !
Popular site GameDaily interviews porn stars about whether their boyfriends can play video games , and which game characters they 'd like to get with .
In the interest of service journalism , each micro-interview is smaller than the photo of the porn star above it .
( No male stars , natch , but then again who ever wanted to hear something from the mouth of a male porn actor ? )
GameDaily also wants you to read " Babe of the Week " and " The Most Outrageous Boobs in Gaming . "
Strip Halo 3 : Porn stars get naked on video while playing a shoot - em - up with ugly guys .
Shooting Range : Industry leader Electronic Gaming Monthly sent a team of girl gamers to a shooting range to test their real - life skills .
Am I picky for being annoyed that they were chosen for hotness ?
Industry leader Electronic Gaming Monthly sent a team of girl gamers to a shooting range to test their real - life skills .
Am I picky for being annoyed that they were chosen for hotness ?
Digital Lust : Now folded , Gamestar Magazine was an unapologetic tits - and - games mag .
These " behind the scenes " photos from a holiday gift guide shoot looked so much like the start of a soft porn gallery , I felt surprised when I scrolled to the bottom and saw the model still had some lingerie on .
Gaming 's kinkiest costumes : " Got a fantasy ?
Chances are there 's a game to match , " promises this gallery from Games Radar .
The copy is full of " then go talk to a real girl " asides , which only make it sadder that the site is so desperately reaching for the never - touched - a - girl audience .
The industry is addicted .
Like a GOP presidential candidate , they 're too afraid of losing the base to appeal to normal people with reasonable options .
No wonder they 're losing attention to mainstream coverage ( who says GQ can't review video games ? ) and sites like Penny Arcade , a biting comic and review site in which a pre-teen girl — the niece of one of the authors — is the maturest , most capable gamer .
Gawker Media 's gaming site Kotaku , says editor Brian Crecente , goes out of its way to stop boy 's - club coverage .
Both sites have enjoyed years of rising traffic .
Sure , it 's probably unhealthy to train men to treat women as sex objects .
Screw that , it 's unhealthy to the industry to alienate half its audience , and likely most of the other half too , particularly the part that 's not living in its Mom 's basement with little disposable income .
We 're not aching for a flash of tit from a girl made of polygons ; we 're not desperate to hear that our favorite girl from Bang Brothers wants to cuddle with Raiden from Mortal Kombat .
We have money , we consider ourselves normal and maybe even cool , and we want to buy video games that do n't suck .
Chuck Klosterman asked in 2006 why there was no Lester Bangs of video games .
Writer Clive Thompson answered the cultural critic in Wired News : A . No one would hire him ; B . He 's already here and he writes Penny Arcade ; C . The research takes too long ; and D .
The medium needs a new approach .
I say E : The 18 - year - old future Lester Bangs of video games is at some site being forced to compile " Twenty Hottest Asses of Xbox 360 . "
Oh sorry , we do n’t do bailouts for Wall Street .
Is n’t that what Paulson told us ?
Why are American taxpayers funding the stupidity and greed of Wall Street ?
JPMorgan Chase says that in conjunction with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York it will provide temporary funding for Bear Stearns .
The funding will be provided as necessary for up to 28 days .
During that time , JPMorgan Chase will also help Bear Stearns find permanent financing .
Bear Stearns says its liquidity significantly deteriorated over the past day and the temporary funding will help it continue operating normally .
The investment bank added there is no guarantee any permanent strategic alternatives will be successful .
The study replicated what city traffic wardens might expect to inhale
Scientists have known nanoparticles reach the brain when inhaled , but this is the first time they have been shown to affect how we process information .
Researchers sought to replicate the environment experienced by those who work in a garage or by the roadside .
Their findings were published in the journal Particle and Fibre Toxicology .
A team at Zuyd University in the Netherlands persuaded 10 volunteers to spend an hour in a room filled either with clean air or exhaust from a diesel engine .
They were wired up to an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) , a device that records the electrical signals of the brain .
They were monitored during the period of exposure and for an hour after they left the room .
Such physiological changes do warrant investigation because there could indeed be a long - term effect
Ken Donaldson
University of Edinburgh
After about 30 minutes , the brains of those in the exhaust rooms displayed a stress response on the EEG , which is indicative of a change in the way information is being processed in the brain cortex .
This effect continued after they were no longer in the room .
" We can only speculate what these effects may mean for the chronic exposure to air pollution encountered in busy cities where the levels of such soot particles can be very high , " said lead researcher Paul Borm .
" It is conceivable that the long - term effects of exposure to traffic nanoparticles may interfere with normal brain function and information processing .
Further studies are necessary to explore this effect . "
Dog 's life
The fact that the brain responds when confronted with a new smell is not entirely surprising , says Ken Donaldson , professor of respiratory toxicology at the University of Edinburgh .
" And it may not necessarily be negative , but such physiological changes do warrant investigation because there could indeed be a long - term effect .
It 's a very interesting , and potentially important , study . "
Controlled studies examining the impact of pollution on the brain are ethically problematic , while longer - term studies of the population in polluted areas can be practically difficult as brain diseases are not necessarily noted on the death certificate as the cause of death .
Alzheimer 's patients for instance often die of infection .
But a study of dogs in Mexico found those who lived in highly - polluted Mexico City had brain lesions similar to those seen in Alzheimer 's patients , while those who lived in much less - polluted rural areas showed a much lower rate of damage to the brain .
But we did “ likability ” and inexperience eight years ago with George W. Bush and look where that ’s gotten us .
It is frightening how easily some of us are persuaded by hype , especially when we are confronting such serious problems as a nation and in the world .
Hillary Rodham Clinton does have substance : knowledge , experience , intelligence , sensitivity , stamina .
She has withstood attacks from all sides and come out whole .
She is the only candidate in this race in whom I have complete faith and confidence to do the right thing .
With all that is at stake , I can only hope that the media will start doing their job and that the American people will see the light this time around .

To the Editor :
I believe this is the first time I ’ve ever disagreed with Paul Krugman .
The source of vitriol is not to be found in the putative “ cult of personality ” among supporters of Barack Obama .
The source is not to be found among supporters at all .
One needs to look at the leaderships of the campaigns .

Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign keeps careening between sweetness and scorched - earth policies .
Mrs. Clinton has created an impression that she will do anything and say anything to win , from sponsoring flag - preservation legislation to the bizarre racial innuendo by her campaign in South Carolina .
( Does South Carolina bring out the worst in every campaign ? )
The vitriol is not the result of a cult of personality in the Obama camp .
The vitriol is a reaction to very real deficiencies in Mrs. Clinton ’s personality .

To the Editor :
Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign reminds me of a series of revival meetings .
There ’s the charismatic speaker who uses emotional words to raise the audience to a fever pitch , followed by conversion to his ideas and the passing of the hat .
If casualties go below a certain point , he will decide that this " war " is now something else .
On a date certain it will " soon be over , " whatever that means .
But if McCain thinks that Western troops in the Muslim Arab heartland are not going to be shot at or fought or resented in ways we Westerners do not begin to understand for ever , or if he thinks that they will function as the kind of token symbolic force that exists in Germany or Japan or South Korea , he is - how to put this politely ?
- out of his mind .
If McCain is going to give us straight talk - one thing the Bush administration has been completely unable to do - and believes that Iraq should remain a permanently integrated part of a new , expanding American protectorate in the Middle East , then he needs to say so .
He needs to be honest about what his goal of turning Iraq into a stable , non-despotic , unified country , permanently occupied by US troops , requires .
It will require trillions of dollars , a bare minimum of another decade of occupation , over 100,000 troops ( probably more ) committed indefinitely , and no lee - way to tackle any major security threats anywhere else on the planet including Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iran , without a draft .
Oh , and then there 's a need to maintain US public support for the Sisyphean task of nation - building a place where there is no nation , in a place a long way away , where our reward for such an effort will be fathomless contempt and hatred .
McCain says we all want to leave Iraq .
But some obviously do n't .
It is increasingly clear that the point of the surge and the occupation is to stay in Iraq for ever .
Do we want that ?
Is it in the West 's interest ?
Maybe , after all these years , we can have some minimal honesty in this debate .
According to Cordesman , no progress is possible without maintaining the same level of troops of the past five years for the next five years .
And we have no guarantee that anything will be saner then .
That 's the decision Americans need to make clearly , candidly , honestly , for the first time in this war .
That 's what this election is about .
Let 's put the choice on the table and collectively decide now - for empire or retreat .
We wo n't get an opportunity like this again .
Everything else is either a pious hope or a serious lie .

The lives of 22,000 patients could have been saved if U.S. regulators had been quicker to remove a Bayer AG drug used to stem bleeding during open heart surgery , according to a medical researcher interviewed by CBS Television 's 60 Minutes program .
REUTERS / File
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The lives of 22,000 patients could have been saved if U.S. regulators had been quicker to remove a Bayer AG drug used to stem bleeding during open heart surgery , according to a medical researcher interviewed by CBS Television ’s 60 Minutes program .
The drug Trasylol was withdrawn in November at the request of the FDA after an observational study linked the medicine to kidney failure requiring dialysis and increased death of those patients .
It had been given to as many as a third of all heart bypass patients in the United States at the height of its use over a period of many years , according to the report .
Dr. Dennis Mangano , the study ’s researcher , said during the program that 22,000 lives could have been saved if Trasylol had been taken off the market when he first published his study in January 2006 , according to a CBS News report on its
Web site ahead of a broadcast slated for next Sunday .
He said in the broadcast that Bayer failed to disclose to the FDA during an FDA advisory panel meeting in September 2006 -- at which Mangano ’s negative findings were discussed -- that the German drugmaker had conducted its own research which confirmed the same dangers established by his study .
The chairman of the FDA advisory panel , Dr. William Hiatt , told 60 Minutes he would have voted to remove Trasylol from the market had he been informed about Bayer ’s study , according to the CBS report .
Bayer spokeswoman Meredith Fischer said she could not comment about the broadcast until it is aired , including allegations that the drugmaker had failed to protect patients .
She said Bayer is facing a number of product - liability lawsuits filed by patients who had taken the medicine or their families , but said she not know how many lawsuits were filed .
1. The Freemasons
This is the granddaddy of all not - so - secret secret societies .
Freemasonry , or " The Craft "  as its members call it , most likely has its roots in 17th - century stoneworkers ' guilds .
Mason lore , however , extends its origins back to biblical times , linking the society to the building of the Temple of Solomon .
Freemasonry is split into numerous subgroups and orders , all of which consider God the Grand Geometrician , or Grand Architect of the Universe .
At their hearts , these groups are all means of exploring ethical and philosophical issues , and their rituals and symbols are famous ( or infamous ) .
Take , for instance , the square - and - compass logo often seen on the backs of Cadillacs .
Or the use of secret handshakes , passwords , and greeting postures / gestures called " due guards , "  all collectively known as the Modes of Recognition .
The list of famous Masons is massive , a virtual Who 's Who of modern history , explaining the many conspiracy theories regarding the Masons ' influence and intentions .
Mozart , FDR , Harry S. Truman , George Washington , Mark Twain , Voltaire , Benjamin Franklin , John Wayne , W. C. Fields , and Douglas MacArthur were all Masons .
But perhaps the Masons ' greatest strides have been made in fast food : KFC 's Colonel Sanders and Wendy 's founder Dave Thomas knew how to secret - shake with the best of 'em .
2. The Illuminati
Over the centuries , lots of groups have called themselves the Illuminati ( " Enlightened Ones "  ) , but the one we 're talking about here began as the Bavarian Illuminati .
A radical product of the Enlightenment and offshoot of the religion - based Freemasons , the Illuminati espoused secular freethinking and intellectualism and proved a threat to Europe 's old order .
Although they were officially banned by the Bavarian government in 1784 , some claim that they live on to this day in other guises .
So , what 's the Illuminati 's goal ?
To establish a new world order of capitalism and authoritarianism , of course !
They 've been accused of manipulating currencies , world stock markets , elections , assassinations , and even of being aliens .
One common myth is that the eye - and - pyramid image on the dollar bill is a symbol of the Illuminati watching over us .
Nope .
It 's a symbol of strength and durability ( though unfinished , symbolizing growth and change ) , and the all - seeing eye represents the divine guidance of the American cause .
Or so the government says .
3. Opus Dei
This organization has a $ 42 million , 17 - story headquarters building on Lexington Avenue in New York City , claims 85,000 members in 60 countries , and was featured in Dan Brown 's bestseller The Da Vinci Code .
Now that its existence has been significantly unsecretized , this ultraorthodox Catholic sect has definitely raised its share of eyebrows .
Founded in 1928 by Saint JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡ ( a Spanish priest who bore an uncanny resemblance to Karl Malden ) , Opus Dei is the short name for the Prelature for the Holy Cross and the Work of God .
The sect ( some would say cult ) stresses a return to traditional Catholic orthodoxy and behavior , especially celibacy , with members falling into one of three levels .
Numeraries live in Opus Dei facilities , devote their time and money to the prelature , attend mass daily , and engage in mortification of the flesh ( wearing a spiked chain around the thigh called a cilice , taking cold showers , or flagellating themselves with a knotted rope called " the discipline "  ) .
Next come Associates ( kind of like Numeraries , but living " off campus "  ) , then Supernumeraries ( the rank - and - file members ) .
The group did gain the praise of Pope John Paul II , and has engaged in a lot of charity work .
Yet , critics accuse the group of being linked to fascist organizations like Franco 's government in Spain , and of anti-Semitism and intolerance , even of other Catholics .

4. Skull and Bones
Top dog among all the collegiate secret societies , Yale 's Skull and Bones dates to 1832 and goes by other spooky names like Chapter 322 and the Brotherhood of Death .
With a large number of Bonesmen who have attained positions of power , including the president and the head of the CIA , it 's no wonder that rumors abound that the society is hell - bent on obtaining power and influencing U.S. foreign policy .
The fact that they meet in an imposing templelike building on the Yale campus called ( what else ? ) the Tomb does n't really help .
Bonesmen are selected , or " tapped , "  during their junior year and can reveal their membership only after they 've graduated .
But they can never talk about it .
The Bones have been accused of all sorts of crazy rituals and conspiracies , including drug smuggling and the assassination of JFK ( a hated Hahvahd man , after all ) .
It 's even rumored that the skull of Geronimo resides in the Tomb , stolen from its resting place by Prescott Bush , Dubya 's granddad .
In one of the more commonly known rituals , the initiate spends all night naked in an open coffin , confessing all his sexual experiences to the group .
So , who 's lucky enough to have made such a confession ?
George H. W. Bush , George W. Bush , John Kerry , William Howard Taft , McGeorge Bundy , William F. Buckley , and Henry Luce are just a few .
5 . The Bohemian Club
This is a weird one .
In the majestic forests of Sonoma County north of San Francisco lies the Bohemian Grove , the 2,700 - acre wooded retreat of the Bohemian Club , the nation 's most exclusive men's club .
Every July since 1879 , the " Bohos "  have gathered at the Grove for a two - week encampment , where they 're divided into more than 100 residential camps with names like Owl 's Nest , Cave Man , and Lost Angels .
Membership has included , well , just about everybody important : Ronald Reagan , Dwight Eisenhower , Richard Nixon ( who once called it " faggy "  ) , Gerald Ford , Colin Powell , Dick Cheney , and many CEOs and wealthy business leaders like Malcolm Forbes .
Each encampment opens with a robed - and - hooded ceremony called the Cremation of Care , in which an effigy called " Dull Care "  ( symbolizing worldly concerns ) is burned before a 40 - foot concrete statue of an owl , symbol of wisdom and the club 's mascot .
Throughout the week , plays are staged ( called High Jinx and Low Jinx ) , there 's lots of eating and drinking ( and , reportedly , urinating on trees ) , and members are treated to speeches called Lakeside Talks .
Some opponents go so far as to accuse the group of Satanism , witchcraft , homosexuality , and prostitution , while more reasonable observers object to the Lakeside Talks as national policy discussions to which the public is not privy .
But above all , it 's seen as a way that some of the elite meet others of the elite , thereby ensuring that they 'll all stay elite .
All this makes the club 's seemingly anticonspiratorial slogan — " Weaving spiders , come not here " — that much more ironic .

6. The Trilateral Commission
While not , on its face , as juicily sinister as some of the other societies on this list , the Trilateral Commission has been accused of all sorts of underhanded shenanigans by its critics .
Formed in 1973 by David Rockefeller , the Commission includes over 300 prominent citizens from Europe , Asia , and North America in a forum for discussing the regions ' common interests .
But conspiracy theorists hold that the Trilateral Commission , along with the Council on Foreign Relations and others , is really just a front for a larger , more sinister order called the Round Table Groups , founded in London over 100 years ago and bent on the creation of a new world order , a global capitalist police state .
Yikes !
( For the record , some say the Round Table Groups are themselves just fronts for another society , the Illuminati , so who knows ? )
American members of the Trilateral Commission have included Bill Clinton , Henry Kissinger , Jimmy Carter , Dick Cheney , and Dianne Feinstein .

Happy Leap Day !
I have an instructive followup to yesterday 's article all ready to go , analyzing a technique for finding rational roots of polynomials that I found in the First Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica .
A typically Universe - of - Discourse kind of article .
But I 'm postponing it to next month so that I can bring you this timely update .
Everyone knows that our calendar periodically contains an extra day , known to calendar buffs as an " intercalary day " , to help make it line up with the seasons , and that this intercalary day is inserted at the end of February .
But , depending on how you interpret it , this is n't so .
The extra day is actually inserted between February 23 and February 24 , and the rest of February has to move down to make room .
I will explain .
In Rome , 23 February was a holiday called Terminalia , sacred to Terminus , the god of boundary markers .
Under the calendars of the Roman Republic , used up until 46 BCE , an intercalary month , Mercedonius , was inserted into the calendar from time to time .
In these years , February was cut down to 23 days ( and good riddance ; nobody likes February anyway ) and Mercedonius was inserted at the end .
When Julius Caesar reformed the calendar in 46 , he specified that there would be a single intercalary day every four years much as we have today .
As in the old calendar , the intercalary day was inserted after Terminalia , although February was no longer truncated .
So the extra day is actually 24 February , not 29 February .
Or not .
Depends on how you look at it .
Scheduling intercalary days is an interesting matter .
The essential problem is that the tropical year , which is the length of time from one vernal equinox to the next , is not an exact multiple of one day .
Rather , it is about 365¼ days .
So the vernal equinox moves relative to the calendar date unless you do something to fix it .
If the tropical year were exactly 365¼ days long , then four tropical years would be exactly 1461 days long , and it would suffice to make four calendar years 1461 days long , to match .
This can be accomplished by extending the 365 - day calendar year with one intercalary day every four years .
This is the Julian system .
Unfortunately , the tropical year is not exactly 365¼ days long .
It is closer to 365.24219 days long .
So how many intercalary days are needed ?
It suffices to make 100,000 calendar years total exactly 36,524,219 days , which can be accomplished by adding a day to 24,219 years out of every 100,000 .
But this requires a table with 100,000 entries , which is too complicated .
We would like to find a system that requires a simpler table , but which is still reasonably accurate .
The Julian system requires a table with 4 entries , but gives a calendar year that averages 365.25 days long , which is 0.00781 too many .
Since this is about 1/128 day , the Julian calendar " gains a day " every 128 years or so , which means that the vernal equinox slips a day earlier every 128 years , and eventually the daffodils and crocuses are blooming in January .
Not everyone considers this a problem .
The Islamic calendar is only 355 days long , and so " loses " 10 days per year , which means that after 18 years the Islamic new year has moved half a year relative to the seasons .
The annual Islamic holy month of Ramadan coincided with July - August in 1980 and with January - February in 1997 .
The Muslims do intercalate , but they do it to keep the months in line with the phases of the moon .
Still , supposing that we do consider this a problem , we would like to find an intercalation scheme that is simple and accurate .
This is exactly the problem of finding a simple rational approximation to 0.24219 .
If p/q is close to 0.24219 , then one can introduce p intercalary days every q years , and q is the size of the table required .
The Julian calendar takes p/q = 1/4 = 0.25 , for an error around 1/128 .
The Gregorian calendar takes p/q = 97/400 = 0.2425 , for an error of around 1/3226 .
Again , this means that the Gregorian calendar gains a day on the seasons every 3,226 years or so .
Can we do better ?
Any time the question is " find a simple rational approximation to a number " the answer is likely to involve continued fractions .
365.24219 is equal to : $ $ 365 + { 1 \over \displaystyle 4 + {\strut 1 \over \displaystyle 7 + {\strut 1 \over \displaystyle 1 + {\strut 1 \over \displaystyle 3 + {\strut 1 \over \displaystyle 24 + {\strut 1 \over \displaystyle 6 + \cdots }}}}}} $ $ which for obvious reasons , mathematicians abbreviate to [ 365 ; 4 , 7 , 1 , 3 , 24 , 6 , 2 , 2 ] .
This value is exact .
( I had to truncate the display above because of a bug in my TeX formula tool : the full fraction goes off the edge of the A0 - size page I use as a rendering area . )
As I have mentioned before , the reason this horrendous expression is interesting is that if you truncate it at various points , the values you get are the " continuants " , which are exactly the best possible rational approximations to the original number .
For example , if we truncate it to [ 365 ] , we get 365 , which is the best possible integer approximation to 365.24219 .
If we truncate it to [ 365 ; 4 ] , we get 365¼ , which is the Julian calendar 's approximation .
Truncating at the next place gives us [ 365 ; 4 , 7 ] , which is 365 + 1/( 4 + 1/7 ) = 356 + 1/( 29/7 ) = 365 + 7/29 .
In this calendar we would have 7 intercalary days out of 29 , for a calendar year of 365.241379 days on average .
This calendar loses one day every 1,234 years .
The next convergent is [ 365 ; 4 , 7 , 1 ] = 8/33 , which requires 8 intercalary days every 33 years for an average calendar year of 0.242424 days .
This schedule gains only one day in 4,269 years and so is actually more accurate than the Gregorian calendar currently in use , while requiring a table with only 33 entries instead of 400 .
The real question , however , is not whether the table can be made smaller but whether the rule can be made simpler .
The rule for the Gregorian calendar requires second - order corrections :
If the year is a multiple of 400 , it is a leap year ; otherwise
If the year is a multiple of 100 , it is not a leap year ; otherwise
If the year is a multiple of 4 , it is a leap year .
And one frequently sees computer programs that omit one or both of the exceptions in the rule .
The 8/33 calendar requires dividing by 33 , which is its most serious problem .
But it can be phrased like this : Divide the year by 33 .
If the result is 0 , it is not a leap year .
Otherwise ,
If the result is divisible by 4 , it is a leap year .
The rule is simpler , and the weird exceptions come every 33 years instead of every 100 .
This means that people are more likely to remember them .
If you are a computer programmer implementing calendar arithmetic , and you omit the 400 - year exception , it may well happen that nobody else will catch the error , because most of the time there is nobody alive who remembers one .
( Right now , many people remember one , because it happened , for the second time ever , only 8 years ago .
We live at an unusual moment of history . )
But if you are a computer programmer who omits the exception in the 8/33 calendar , someone reviewing your code is likely to speak up : " Hey , is n't there some exception when the result is 0 ?
I think I remember something like that happening in third grade . "
Furthermore , the rule as I gave it above has another benefit : it matches the Gregorian calendar this year and will continue to do so for several years .
This was more compelling when I first proposed this calendar back in 1998 , because it would have made the transition to the new calendar quite smooth .
It does n't matter which calendar you use until 2016 , which is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the 8/33 calendar as described above .
I may as well mention that I have modestly named this calendar the Dominus calendar .
But time is running out for the smooth transition .
If we want to get the benefits of the Dominus calendar we have to do it soon .
Help spread the word ! [ Pre-publication addendum : Wikipedia informs me that it is not correct to use the tropical year , since this is not in fact the time between vernal equinoxes , owing to the effects of precession and nutation .
Rather , one should use the so - called vernal equinox year , which is around 365.2422 days long .
The continued fraction for 365.2422 is slightly different from that of 356.24219 , but its first few convergents are the same , and all the rest of the analysis in the article holds the same for both years . ] [ Addendum 20080229 : The Persian calendar uses a hybrid 7/29 and 8/33 system .

A colleague of John Darwin's wife tipped off police that he may still have been alive after overhearing her having whispered telephone conversations at work , it emerged yesterday .
The employee at the doctors ' surgery where Anne Darwin worked as a receptionist apparently became suspicious after hearing snatches of calls made in the run-up to her sudden move to Panama .
The workmate , believed to be another woman , is thought to have already harboured doubts about whether Mr Darwin had really drowned while canoeing in the sea , as the inquest had concluded .
Scroll down for more ...
She deduced from Mrs Darwin 's manner that she was talking to her supposedly dead husband and informed police , who reopened the investigation into his death .
The revelation suggests the couple were secretly planning her decision to sell up and move to Central America .
The work colleague is expected to give a statement to detectives investigating the suspected fraud .
Mrs Darwin had been working as a receptionist at a doctors ' surgery in County Durham at the time of her husband 's disappearance .
This week she told the Daily Mail that her colleagues had been extremely supportive following his supposed drowning and that she returned to work about three months later .
But yesterday it emerged that it was hushed calls Mrs Darwin had made and received , apparently while working at Gilesgate Medical Centre over the summer , that put police on her husband 's trail again .
Scroll down for more ...
A source said : " The amount of calls Mrs Darwin was getting on her phone did n't raise any suspicions at first , but while the conversations she was having were always private , some of them were overheard .
" The tone of the conversations led the person that contacted the police to believe she was talking to the man who was supposedly dead , and the investigations basically started again from that point . "
Scroll down for more ...
The " careless whispers " suggestion was taken seriously by Cleveland Police , which had also looked into a reported sighting of Mr Darwin outside his former home two years earlier .
Mrs Darwin is understood to have told officers on that occasion that the man was a cousin who simply looked like her husband .
The doctors ' surgery tip - off coincided with information that her son Mark had wired the proceeds of the £ 160,000 sale of another of their properties in March to her bank account in Panama .
Detective Superintendent Tony Hutchinson said : " There was some information which was reported to us three months ago to suggest that perhaps there was something suspicious with regards to his disappearance . "
However he stressed that there had been no concrete evidence that Mr Darwin was indeed still alive until he reappeared in London at the weekend , saying he had been as surprised as everybody else .
The staff member who sparked the investigation could not be contacted yesterday .
Practice manager Dave Harris confirmed Mrs Darwin had worked there , adding : " She is a former member of staff but I do n't really want to comment on it , as it is a police matter . "
Suicide rates among men aged 15 - 29 fell by 42 %
The study , led by Dr Cameron Stark , also found there had been a reduction in hangings and poisoning by car exhaust fumes as suicide methods .
Use of carbon - cutting catalytic converters on vehicles was found to be one of the reasons .
Dr Stark said more research was needed to confirm a link between the fall and government anti-suicide initiatives .
These include Chooselife , which has launched a new website - believed to be the first of its kind in the world - in an effort to prevent suicides in the Highlands .
We need to do more work before a definite link between rates and initiatives can be drawn
Dr Cameron Stark
Dr Stark also said that though there was a reduction in death rates , this did not mean there was a decrease in suicidal behaviour .
The research team based its analysis on routinely collected information for the period 1980 - 2004 from the General Register Office for Scotland .
Data showed a 42 % reduction in suicide rates among 15 to 29 - year - old men , an age group considered particularly vulnerable .
The team said the fall in the suicide rate among young men may be the result of them changing their preferred method of suicide , hanging , to poisoning , which has a less immediate effect .
Younger women
Its report flagged up the launch of various government schemes such as the Scottish suicide prevention strategy , Chooselife , the See Me anti-stigma programme and Breathing Space confidential telephone helpline targeted at young men .
Dr Stark said : " It is tempting to associate the lower suicide rate in younger men , and to an extent in younger women , with these initiatives .
" For instance , Chooselife has requested the media not to report the method of suicide in their reports , but the reduction in cases of hanging seems to pre-date this appeal .
" We need to do more work before a definite link between rates and initiatives can be drawn . "
Thoughts on downloads
It occurred to me the other day , that the music industry and software developers are beginning to have a lot in common .
The proliferation of digital content , both legal and illegal , has radically changed the way people purchase music .
But to those of us who have been distributing our work via the Internet since day one , downloads are not a big deal .
Let ’s take a look at how software developers do business and see if it sheds any light on the music industry and their period of transition .
The thing that drives software sales is the notion of “ try before you buy . ”
Gone are the days where you walk into a computer store , scan the shelves for an application , purchase a disk to take home , and pray that it solves your particular problem .
Now , every customer has the expectation that the application prove its worth before they hand over their money .
Gone too are the days when you walk into a music store .
Unfortunately , the record industry has n’t realized that this is a good thing .
They ’re still clinging to the notion that your purchase should be based on nothing more than a 30 second sample .
Like software , you have to spend a little time with a song or album before you discover how much you like it .
Of course there ’s a need to protect your work so that a potential customer will eventually make the purchase .
People are lazy , so you need to find a way to create an incentive to buy .
Some software is distributed by leaving out features until a serial number is entered .
A similar technique can be used with music .
A great example is Team Love Records which made downloads available for the Rabbit Fur Coat album by Jenny Lewis with The Watson Twins .
Every track could be freely downloaded except for one : the track getting airplay ( “ Handle Me With Care ” . )
This approach worked very well for me — I knew the hit track from the radio and found out that I loved the other tracks just as much .
And , in the end , I was a happy customer .
A similar thing happened with Bob Dylan ’s Love and Theft album .
A friend of a friend of a friend got ahold of a leaked copy of the album .
I found it interesting that a couple of the tracks had really crappy sound : someone made a “ mistake ” and encoded the tracks at 32 Kbps .
You could follow along and get the gist of the song , but I was very happy to “ upgrade ” on the day of release .
Another approach we ’ve taken in releasing our software is to provide additional benefits after a purchase .
This can be access to support , a special website or even new features or content .
The record industry has done the same thing .
A couple of recent releases come to mind : Cat Power ’s Jukebox album and Neil Young ’s Live at Massey Hall .
The incentive with the Jukebox album was the inclusion of an extra CD with four additional songs .
Similarly , the Live at Massey Hall package came with a DVD containing footage from the concert .
Both were things I wanted , so the decision to buy was easy .
For artists that you love , getting a complete set of their works is important .
If I had been given a free copy of the “ basic ” CD , I still would have “ upgraded ” to get all the songs and / or video .
Now , let ’s look at one thing that works for software distribution , but is n’t going to work for music : the notion of a time limited demo .
We have a reliable clock , a local file system to record usage , and other mechanisms that make tracking relatively easy .
Of course , these things can be overridden or disabled by dishonest users , but the vast majority of honest people make up for it .
As developers , we have also learned to encourage users towards the purchase : making demands does not work .
Pissing people off will turn them into pirates , not encourage them to buy .
A MP3 file does n’t have mechanisms for tracking .
And we all know how the attempts to add them with Digital Rights Management has gone over with consumers .
That ’s because it ’s a system based on demands : you must be authorized .
Finally , the best thing for business is to make sure you have the best product available .
That ’s both the beauty and the challenge of any “ try before you buy ” system .
Good products win , bad products are quickly forgotten .
I suspect that the root of the music industry ’s problem is this : they have been able to produce sub - standard product for many years .
I know there are many albums in my collection that consist of few great tracks along with a bunch of crap that I ’d rather not listen to .
And the iPod , which makes single tracks viable because you do n’t spend all your time moving physical media around , allows people will buy only the product they find interesting .
If the music industry wants to make more money , they need to make something besides one big hit plus filler .
Can you imagine buying a software product that had one feature you really needed and 99 others that were worthless ?
The value is in the whole , not the individual parts .
If you make compelling albums , people will buy more music from the artists they love .
In the end , however , I suspect that the large music companies will end up in a similar position as the large software companies .
They will have the blockbuster product / artists with a lot of recurring revenue from each new release .
But the most interesting part of this ecosystem will be the independents .
The people who have a smaller , but much more loyal following .
The people who listen closely to these fans and realize how important they are to their creative works .
The people who feel the joy of a customer telling them they rock .
That ’s the beauty of this thing we call the Internet : it ’s a two way street .
And all it takes is a web page to start that conversation .
The families of 4,000 American troops are coping with the deaths of sons , fathers , daughters , brothers and wives .
Countless thousands of Iraqi families share a similiar fate .
But to Dick Cheney , " the president carries the biggest burden , obviously " during this war – not the people who actually fight it , or their kin .
" I want to start with the milestone today of 4,000 dead in Iraq .
Americans .
And just what effect do you think it has on the country ? "
asked ABC News '
White House correspondent , Martha Raddatz ...
" It obviously brings home I think for a lot of people the cost that 's involved in the global war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan , "
Cheney said in the interview , conducted in Turkey .
" It places a special burden obviously on the families , and we recognize , I think — it 's a reminder of the extent to which we are blessed with families who 've sacrificed as they have . "
" The president carries the biggest burden , obviously , " Cheney said .
" He 's the one who has to make the decision to commit young Americans , but we are fortunate to have a group of men and women , the all - volunteer force , who voluntarily put on the uniform and go in harm 's way for the rest of us . "
Under section 17 ( b ) iv , the socalled " Clinton Indestructibility Amendment to the Political Pundits ( Smart Arses , Know - Alls , and Assorted Puffed - Up Ponces )
Act 1991 , it is a statutory offence to begin this obituary without the pre-emptive disclaimer : " Barring a miracle ... "
The amendment briefly fell into disuse in January when , after her disastrous showing in the Iowa caucuses , Hillary was hubristically written off .
Nemesis struck three days later with The Miracle of the Coffee Shop Lachrymals , and after New Hampshire no one has dared ignore 17 ( b ) iv again .
So then ...
Barring a miracle , it ends for Hillary early next Wednesday ( our time ) with the release of the exit polls from Texas .
It could even end a few hours before that , should Barack Obama win Ohio .
But that 's an even money contest , whereas he is a red - hot 1 - 3 favourite in Texas .
This is the state Bill himself said she must win to stay in the race , and God have mercy on him if she does n't because Hillary will be needing a scapegoat , and there 's only one winning candidate for that post .
She might have to sew them back on first , but among the multiple personalities she 's unveiled of late there must be room for a seamstress .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
During the past 10 days , Hillary has been changing from role to role with bewildering speed .
She concluded one TV debate , in what was mistaken for a valedictory , by saying she was deeply honoured to share the stage with Obama .
While the audience rose to cheer her , the poll numbers rose to cheer him .
So the next day she did a total volte face , and scolded him harshly for dirty campaigning ( " she who smelt it , dealt it " coming to mind here ) .
You had to admire the chutzpah , but it did n't help , and nor did her next performance as victim of wicked media bias .
Then the campaign took a stroll down Karl Rove Avenue , raising the Muslim sleeper issue by releasing that snap of Obama in Somali tribesman gear , and that bombed too .
Currently she is veering between new but wildly unfocused attacks and repeating the trite bletherings ( Ready On Day One , and so on ) that have n't exactly enthused the electorate so far .
You 'd need a heart of diamond - coated tungsten not to laugh , because even now that the obese soprano is audibly gargling her scales backstage , Hillary still does n't comprehend how it 's gone so wrong .
The US media is less baffled , ascribing it primarily to electoral history 's worst campaign since Noah ran for the Ararat House of Representatives on the " I 'll keep the sun shining ! " ticket , and you can hear the sharpening of scalpels from 3,000 miles away as the pathologists of the East Coast commentariat prepare to dissect her mistakes in the autopsy .
Yet I suspect the real story might be simpler than an amalgam of complacency , financial recklessness , Bill 's unrelenting idiocy , arrogant sense of entitlement and all the rest .
Could it be that she was in fact an extremely strong , if charmless , candidate who had the wretched luck to meet a rival of such transcendent brilliance that the nomination , and very likely the Presidency , was decided the moment he entered the race a year ago ?
That no one alive could have beaten him ?
Before Iowa she had made only one fairly minor mistake ( equivocating weakly over illegal immigrants ' right to driving licences ) , and she campaigned flawlessly there and spent an untold fortune .
So when Obama crushed her , no wonder everyone assumed that 17 ( iv ) b had been repealed , and that she could be safely written off .
If the ensuing miracle in New Hampshire seemed her resurrection then , it looks with hindsight like the twitching of a corpse on the end of a hangman 's noose .
Unfazed by that shock , Obama did what Hillary has failed to do by refusing to panic and sticking remorselessly to his message .
It is this steadfastness , I think , more even than the elegiac oratory , that is the root of his extraordinary political talent .
The nascent backlash against him is the inevitable reward for becoming presumptive nominee , and more crowded by the hour is the bandwagon that wants to crush him by portraying him as Messianic faker , a hybrid of evangelical preacher and common grifter selling the snake oil of false hope to the needy , credulous and mildly deranged .
And it 's true that excitable youths sometimes faint at his rallies , while some showbiz folk talk use unnervingly religious language about him .
What is quite untrue is the implication that he is a Johnny - Come - Lately to the stirring idea that , in a democracy , lasting and significant political change must come from the bottom up .
" It 's time for politicians and other leaders to take the next step and to see voters , residents , or citizens as producers of this change , " he says .
" The thrust of our organising must be on how to make them productive ... how to create businesses , institutions , banks , safe public spaces – the whole agenda of creating productive communities .
That is where our future lies .
" The right wing talks about this , but they keep appealing to that old individualistic bootstrap myth : get a job , get rich , and get out ...
Our goal must be to help people get a sense of building something larger .
The political debate is now so skewed , so limited , so distorted .
People are hungry for community .
They miss it . "
These quotes are n't from a recent stump speech or conference call .
They come from an interview published in the Chicago Reader on 8 December 1995 , before he was first elected to the Illinois Senate .
For a dozen years and more , then , Obama has been astoundingly consistent .
If the language has become more lyrical , the belief has stayed the same , and electors instinctively sense that constancy and integrity .
On a gut instinctive level – and ultimately how else are races decided ?
– they know he means every word .
This is why Hillary 's attempts to denigrate him as a slick charlatan are so futile .
It could , of course , turn out that the Obama formula of using poetry to rouse the grass roots to do the prosaic things required to improve America will prove naive fantasy .
In almost five years from now , or preferably nine , history 's snap verdict may very well be " No we could n't . "
But on Wednesday he will at least be one huge step closer to putting that theory to the test , and the Lord be thanked on bended knee for that .
For Hillary , nothing remains but to pray that Obama loses to John McCain so she can try again in 2112 ( and with that in mind , expect an amazingly gracious withdrawal speech on Wednesday ) .
As far as the odds , the prediction markets , the polls and the demographic movement behind those polls , all she can do now is read 'em and weep .
And weep she surely will , probably late on Sunday in time for the networks bulletins on Monday morning , Doomsday Eve .
It worked for her once , but not again .
Not twice within a few weeks .
Barring a you - know - what .
Cheney has been trying to hide from this case for a while now :
The office of Vice President Dick Cheney is seeking to block the release of videotaped depositions given by two aides who witnessed a physical encounter between an Iraq war opponent and Cheney .
In a motion filed Saturday , Cheney 's office contended that the videotapes could be used to invade the privacy and embarrass two aides called to testify about the encounter in a civil lawsuit .
The motion for a protective order expressed particular concern that both aides ' faces could wind up on YouTube.com .
The plaintiff , Steven Howards of Golden , is suing Secret Service agents who arrested him after he approached Cheney at a Beaver Creek mall in 2006 and told the vice president his policies in Iraq were " disgusting . "
Eagle County prosecutors dismissed a criminal charge of harassment filed against Howards .
This case was a travesty against our civil liberties and the First Amendment .
Do you think the Secret Service would have reacted like this if Howards was a Cheney / Iraq war supporter ?
Molly Ivins dedicates a chapter to this case in her wonderful book called " Bill of Wrongs . "
You can read more about the case here .
FINAL UPDATE 3:20 p.m.
After a hiatus of 68 years , the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to rule on the meaning of the Second Amendment — the hotly contested part of the Constitution that guarantees “ a right to keep and bear arms . ”
Not since 1939 has the Court heard a case directly testing the Amendment ’s scope — and there is a debate about whether it actually decided anything in that earlier ruling .
In a sense , the Court may well be writing on a clean slate if , in the end , it decides the ultimate question : does the Second Amendment guarantee an individual right to have a gun for private use , or does it only guarantee a collective right to have guns in an organized military force such as a state National Guard unit ?
The city of Washington ’s appeal ( District of Columbia v. Heller , 07-290 ) seeking to revive its flat ban on private possession of handguns is expected to be heard in March — slightly more than a year after the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the Second Amendment right is a personal one , at least to have a gun for self - defense in one ’s own home .
( The Court took no action on Tuesday on a conditional cross-petition , Parker , et al. , v. District of Columbia , 07-335 , an appeal by five District residents seeking to join in the case .
The absence of any action may mean that the Court has decided not to hear that case .
If that is so , it will be indicated in an order next Monday .
The Court also may simply be holding the case until it decides the Heller case . )
The Justices chose to write out for themselves the constitutional question they will undertake to answer in Heller .
Both sides had urged the Court to hear the city ’s case , but they had disagreed over how to frame the Second Amendment issue .
Here is the way the Court phrased the granted issue :
“ Whether the following provisions — D.C. Code secs .
7-2502.02 ( a ) ( 4 ) , 22-4504 ( a ) , and 7-2507.02 — violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state - regulated militia , but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes ? ”
The first listed section bars registration of pistols if not registered before Sept. 24 , 1976 ; the second bars carrying an unlicensed pistol , and the third requires that any gun kept at home must be unloaded and disassembled or bound by a lock , such as one that prevents the trigger from operating .
The Court did not mention any other issues that it might address as questions of its jurisdiction to reach the ultimate question : did the one individual who was found to have a right to sue — Dick Anthony Heller , a D.C. resident — have a right to challenge all three of the sections of the local law cited in the Court ’s order , and , is the District of Columbia , as a federal enclave , even covered by the Second Amendment .
While neither of those issues is posed in the grant order , the Court may have to be satisfied that the answer to both is affirmative before it would move on to the substantive question about the scope of any right protected by the Amendment .
The D.C. Circuit ruled that the Amendment does apply to the District because of its federal status , subject to all provisions of the Constitution .
At this point , therefore , it appears that the Court ’s review may not reach a major question — does the Second Amendment also protect individual rights against state and local government gun control laws ?
But a ruling by the Court recognizing an individual right to have a gun almost surely would lead to new test cases on whether to extend the Amendment ’s guarantee so that it applied to state and local laws , too .
The Court last confronted that issue in Presser v. illinois , in 1886 , finding that the Amendment was not binding on the states .
Some observers who read the Court ’s order closely may suggest that the Court is already inclined toward an “ individual rights ” interpretation of the Second Amendment .
That is because the order asks whether the three provisions of the D.C. gun control law violate “ the Second Amendment rights of individuals . ”
But that phrasing may reveal very little about whether the Amendment embraces an individual right to have a gun for private use .
Only individuals , of course , would be serving in the militia , and there is no doubt that the Second Amendment provides those individuals a right to have a gun for that type of service .
The question the Court will be deciding is , if there are individuals who want to keep pistols for use at home , does the Second Amendment guarantee them that right .
Just because the Second Amendment protects some individual right does not settle the nature of that right .
One of the interesting subsets of the question the Court will be confronting is whether the 1939 case of U.S. v. Miller is a precedent for what the Second Amendment means — individual or collective right .
If that decision did find in favor of a collective right , the current Court would have to decide whether this was a binding precedent , or whether it should be overruled .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , has already taken a stand on that question .
At his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , he said that “ the Miller case sidestepped ” the issue of whether the Amendment protected a collective or an individual right .
He added : “ An argument was made back in 1939 that this provides only a collective right , and the Court did n’t address that ….
So people try to read into the tea leaves about Miller and what would come out on this issue , but that ’s still very much an open issue . ”
The local law at issue in Heller has been discussed widely as a sweeping ban on private possession or use of handguns .
But the Court order granting review took it a step further : the one section that will be at issue that goes beyond handguns is the provision that requires that any gun kept at home be unloaded and disassembled , or at least be locked .
Thus , that provision also applies to rifles and shotguns kept at home , in terms of whether those weapons would remain “ functional ” in time of emergency if that provision were upheld .
That part of the order appeared to widen the inquiry in a way that the local residents who challenged the law had wanted .
Additional grants on Tuesday :
The Court also granted review on Tuesday of the question of whether federal labor law bars a state from forbidding a company that receives state funds from using any of those funds to speak out on issues in bargaining with a labor union .
That case is U.S. Chamber of Commerce , et al. , v. Brown , et al. ( 06-939 ) .
The U.S. Solicitor General , asked by the government for its views on the case , urged that review be granted .
At least 16 states have laws or are considering laws like the one in California at issue in the case .
The Court also said on Tuesday that it will hear an appeal by Alabama ’s governor , Bob Riley , in a voting rights case — but will not necessarily decide the merits of the appeal .
The Court postponed the question of its jurisdiction until its hearing on the case of Riley v. Kennedy , et al. ( 07 - 77 ) .
That means the Justices will , indeed , hear oral argument , but will focus part of that argument on whether the case is properly before them .
The other side in the case contended in its response that the state officials waited too long to file their appeal , thus depriving the Court of jurisdiction .
The merits issue raised by the governor is whether rulings by state Supreme Courts on the meaning of state or local election law do bring about the kind of changes in voting rights that must first get federal clearance before going into effect — for those states and local jurisdictions that are covered by the pre-clearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act ’s Section 5 .
These other two cases , like Heller , are likely to be scheduled for argument in the March sitting that begins on Mar. 17 .
I recently wrote an article about the Bush administration and their attacks on our Constitutional Rights .
One of the things that I mentioned is that we are all Americans Left and Right , and that as Americans , we are all in danger of permanently losing the rights and freedoms that we won in the War of Independence .
For over 230 years , the Declaration of Independence has stood as a document that explained why we separated from Great Britain and what we were trying to accomplish .
In 1789 we ratified the U.S. Constitution , and that working document has served us well for 226 years .
The idea of removing safeguards that prevent a dictatorship of the executive branch or an7y other branch is abhorrent to most Americans .
Yet , since September 11 , 2001 , we have steadily weakened the very cornerstone of American liberty .
This is not a left or right issue .
On the MSM in the last few weeks , I have constantly heard the talking heads that find a need to explain everything that is happening to Americans , as if we cannot think for ourselves , that the Democrats are not going to â€œgive - inâ€ to the â€œleft - wingâ€ of their party .
That the Democratic win in 2006 was because the people wanted to â€œchange the course of the war and not to impeach the presidentâ€ .
That is a very subjective observation , and the people that made this observation on Wolf Blitzerâ€™s show on CNN last night , had no right to say what it was that the American people did or did not vote for .
For many years now , we have been told what Americans are thinking , and why we do the things we do .
The analysts have gone way overboard when they make these comments .
The woman that said these things should have began that statement with some kind of modifier .
She could have said that â€ œSome believe that the American people did not vote for the Democrats to impeach Bushâ€ .
Besides the gutting of the Constitution by the executive branch and the 109th Congress , the mainstream media acts as if it has a crystal ball and can read the minds of the American people .
Both of these assaults on our values have got to stop .
I donâ€™t believe that it is just â€ œThe Leftâ€ of the Democratic Party that wants this President impeached .
I also donâ€™t believe that the election was won by the Democrats because we just wanted to change the course of the war .
I believe that Americans may be just about sick and tired of our rights being taken away by the government under the guise of â€ œThe War on Terrorâ€ , and this executive throwing away the resources of the American people on this war that in reality was a huge error of judgment by the intelligence community and George W. Bush .
This is not opinion , this is fact .
Do I have to repeat the FACT that NO weapons of mass destruction were found ?
What I had set out to expound on before I found myself diverted , is that the is just not the left wing of the Democratic Party that wants this war to end and our rights restored .
There are people on the right and there are Republicans that also support this .
This idea that the MSM is trying to deliver to the American People that it is just the â€œfringeâ€ of the Democratic Party that is demanding that is a cover - up of the truth .
I saw the same tactics when the nation decided that it had enough of the Vietnam War .
At first , the media claimed that people who wanted out of Vietnam were â€œradicalsâ€ .
This went on until the government and the media could no longer deny that the majority of the people in this country thought that the Vietnam War should be terminated .
It is not only the â€œleftâ€ that want this war over .
I served 21 years in the Army .
I am no Democrat .
Am I part of â€ œThe Leftâ€ ?
I am tired of people being marginalized by the far right by applying â€˜labelsâ€ to people .
Regardless of peoples political affiliation , they can see what we have done to the Iraqi People .
We at first told them that we were going to free them from a terrible dictator .
We then invaded them , and instead of leaving , we disbanded their Army and Police , occupied the country , and put people that we chose to be their leaders .
Now , instead of having a free and stable Iraq , these people are dying by the hundreds each day , with no military , and no police to stop different warlords from trying to seize power .
You donâ€™t need to be â€ œof the leftâ€ to understand that the average Iraqi is worse off than before we invaded their country .
Any sane and responsible human can understand that the people of Iraq have become victims here .
Victims of this administrations need for oil , for power , and for God knows what else .
This is no longer a â€œradical leftistâ€ movement .
I believe that the majority of ALL Americans want this President out of office , and this war to end .
I believe that if voted on today , that Americans would vote to be free of Bush and Cheney and to be out of Iraq .
It is unfortunate that the Mainstream Media must use labels to describe people that are sick and tired of the status quo .
It is a sad situation to hear them minimize this nations discontent , in fact it is almost criminal .
I believe that a large majority that donâ€™t consider themselves â€œleftistsâ€ would agree with me .
I might agree with the left , sometimes I can agree with the right .
Labels simplify complicated matters do everyone determent .
The sad fact , is that the Iraqi and the American people are worse off than they were before this war .
I think most can agree on that .

9/11 Commissioner : ' We had to go through Karl Rove ' Nick Langewis and David Edwards

Two recent segments delve into a new book that accuses the head of the ostensibly independent 9/11 Commission , Philip Zelikow , of being beholden to the Bush Administration during his tenure .
The Commission : The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation , by New York Times reporter Philip Shenon , indicts Zelikow on his ties with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , and his frequent contact with senior political adviser Karl Rove , during what was touted as an independent investigation into the events surrounding the 2001 World Trade Center attack .
This seeming conflict of interest , the book says , led Commission staffers not to trust Zelikow .
" We found him to be very fair - minded , " counters co-chair Lee Hamilton , " quite impartial , very rigorous in his searching out of the facts ; and he certainly did not try to protect the Bush Administration , or to protect anybody else . "
9/11 Commission member John Lehman goes on to tell MSNBC that it was impossible not to go through Karl Rove when documents such as presidential daily briefings were needed .
Many Commission members , he says , pressed the White House to provide more information and lift restrictions on a regular basis .
" We had to go through Karl Rove , and through [ Attorney General Alberto ]
Gonzales and the other most senior members , " says Lehman .
He indeed hoped that Zelikow was talking to Karl Rove , although he expressed disappointment that contact with the White House was n't more frequent towards the beginning of the investigations .
On charges that a mass of NSA records on al - Qaeda went unreviewed by the Commission , Lehman says that nothing new would have come about as a result of obtaining that data besides more text to put into the final Commission report .
The Commission is due to be published on February 5 .
The following video is from NBC's Nightly News and MSNBC's News Live , broadcast February 2 and 3 , 2008 .

It 's true : wolverine is thriving near Tahoe 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Two more photographs of a wolverine lurking in the Tahoe National Forest were released Monday , extinguishing all doubt that the elusive predator exists in the wilds of California .
The wolverine pictures , taken from remote digital cameras by U.S. Forest Service researchers , mean the muscular carnivore with the almond - colored stripe has either avoided detection for three - quarters of a century or returned to the state after an epic journey .
An earlier image of what may be the same wolverine was captured inadvertently on Feb. 28 by a graduate student doing research on the wolverine 's weasel family relative , the marten , and set off a near frenzy among giddy scientists and wildlife experts .
The dark photograph captured the animal from behind , showing off its distinctive stripe .
The latest pictures , taken March 13 , show the front of a wolverine that researchers believe is the same animal .
" We feel extremely lucky that this animal chose to visit another camera station , " said William Zielinski , a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service 's Pacific Southwest Research Station , who was working with Oregon State University graduate student Katie Moriarty when they captured the first wolverine image .
" It 's nice to have a head shot rather than just a rear shot . "
Researchers , biologists and volunteers have fanned out over 155 square miles from the spot where the photo was taken in the forest north of Truckee , hunting for genetic material .
Cameras and " hair snares , " which capture animal hair , were rigged and all suspicious - looking animal deposits were scooped up .
Dogs trained to detect wolverine scat were unleashed in the forest by the Center of Conservation Biology in Washington .
Airplanes even flew overhead in an attempt to pick up signals from wolverines surgically fitted with radio transmitters during studies in Montana .
Several wolverines with the internal transmitters have disappeared from study areas , but no signal was detected in the Tahoe area , Zielinski said .
About 50 scat and hair samples were sent away for DNA analysis at the forest service 's laboratory at the Rocky Mountain Research Station .
The wolverine , which had not been documented in the Sierra since 1922 , was believed by many to have vanished from California .
There have been reported sightings through the years , but most were discounted as mistaken identity , Zielisnki said .
Skins of California wolverines at UC Berkeley and in several museums have been analyzed in the laboratory , a fact that has injected a note of urgency into the search for genetic material .
" Fortunately , enough previous work has been done on the genetics of wolverines that , if we can get a good enough sample , our colleagues think they can help us identify the population of origin for this individual , " Zielinski said .
" The historical population of wolverines that once existed in the Sierra Nevada had a very unique and distinct genetic signature .
So it should be pretty clear if it's a remnant from that population . "
It 's important to researchers because the nearest population of wolverines is 900 miles away in Central Washington .
That means the animal either migrated across an enormous distance or it's part of a small group of native wolverines that somehow evaded detection for the better part of a century .
The third possibility is that it is a fugitive from some captive population of wolverines .
All three possibilities on the face of it seem unlikely , Zielinski said .
Although their habitat can stretch 500 square miles , the longest a single wolverine has been documented traveling was 83 miles in Norway , according to researchers .
The North American wolverine is the largest member of the weasel family , with adults weighing as much as 45 pounds .
Stocky and muscular , it has a bushy tail and broad head that reminds people of a small bear .
Remarkably strong , with powerful jaws , wolverines have been known to kill much larger prey , but in North America they are mostly scavengers .
Wolverines were once fairly common throughout the northern regions of the United States , but they are now found mainly in the Northern Cascades in Washington , the Northern Rockies in Montana and Idaho , and in Alaska .
Happy holidays everyone !
Hope everyone is enjoying the end of the year festivities .
There ’s a feeling in the air that everyone is maxed out .
I was out in the Inland Empire this past weekend and saw very nice brand new homes going for $ 200,000 .
Prices are starting to take major downturns here in California .
I ’ve been getting a lot more e-mails from readers showing me Real Homes of Genius throughout the state .
In fact , I would venture to say that this housing fiasco has enveloped the entire state of California into a Real State of Genius .
We featured 10 Southern California homes back in May and people still had doubts about a housing bubble .
In today ’s very special holiday report , we are going to show 10 homes throughout the state from Palo Alto , to Fresno , to Chula Vista that bring home this housing crisis .
This should also show that this housing bubble is more than a subprime problem but a much larger and pervasive credit issue that will impact the entire economy .
Listening to the radio this weekend , they had a realtor from Las Vegas pleading his case that the government needs to bring back “ alternative financing ” to prime the pump .
Yes !
What a splendid idea .
Instead of admitting the glaring problem , let us pump this bubble to the next dimension .
This is tantamount to giving a meth addict more meth when they are in the middle of rehab because they cannot bare the withdrawal pains .
Oh yes , our society is addicted to credit and even the rhetoric of “ injecting ” more liquidity should make you think about the psychological ramifications of comparing the Fed to some sort of doctor .
Maybe they are comparing their valiant effort to that of Dr. Kevorkian .
If you have any doubts that we are in a bubble here in California , after seeing these 10 homes maybe your opinion will change .
We ’ll profile homes in posh areas , to not so prime areas to demonstrate that this manic housing bubble infected rich and poor alike .
Greed crosses all socio-economic barriers .
California is the golden state and land of Hollywood .
Perfect weather and tan bodies are everywhere ; that is if you are within a 10 mile radius of the coastline .
Yet homes that are nowhere near the coast and have bad weather went up in price just like prime properties .
It would seem that being in California was justification enough for sky - high prices .
Today we salute you California with our Real State of Genius Award .
# 10 – San Francisco ( Bayview )
Price : $ 445,000
Square Feet : 932
Details : 2 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,750
It is hard to believe that there is a place more expensive than Southern California but there is .
San Francisco and Marin County boast some of the most overpriced real estate known to humankind .
We wo n’t turn this into a Tupac and Biggie thing , a who is more overpriced , the north or the south since we are both in another universe .
After all , trying to distinguish between really crazy and really really crazy is an exercise in futility .
As you can see from this enormous 932 square foot home , you ’ll get more than you can handle at a stunning price of $ 445,000 .
Area rents for a similar place like this one will go for about $ 1,750 a month .
You do n’t need to be a rocket scientist to know what makes sense here .
Let us move on to another Northern California overpriced area , Palo Alto .
# 9 Palo Alto
Price : $ 799,000
Square Feet : 692
Details : 2 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 2,500
Palo Alto is home to Stanford University and anti-university logic housing prices .
You would think that people here would refrain from bubblemania instead , they have taken it to another level .
We wo n’t even talk about East Palo Alto but suffice it to say that people were paying for name , like paying for Nike over your Wal - Mart priced shoes .
The only difference here is we are talking hundreds of thousands of dollars .
If you thought the previous home was small and expensive , here we have a 692 square foot home for $ 799,000 !
This home is for those wanting to relive the glory days of living in your dorm except as an adult .
The only difference here is you wo n’t graduate away from your mortgage .
# 8 Fresno
Price : $ 167,000
Square Feet : 1,170
Details : 4 bedroom / 2 baths
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,295
Our next city takes us to Fresno California .
The birthplace of acclaimed rapper and procreator Kevin Federline , this city is exploding .
The central plains of California are taking a major hit with the current housing market .
Prices have adjusted and foreclosures are exploding .
This home ’s price is starting to have a more accurate reflection of local area rents .
You would think that landscaping is necessary in the current market but not for these people .
Here we have a 3D home since it seems to go on forever to the back .
The harder hit areas need to adjust quickly because inventory is piling up like a plate of pancakes from Denny ’s and people can’t hold out too long since this is subprime country .
For example with San Francisco and Palo Alto , we still have delusional sellers with reserves thinking 2008 will somehow be a different year while folks in these cities have no reserves thus foreclosures are spiking much faster .
# 7 Stockton
Price : $ 109,000
Square Feet : 976
Details : 2 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 800
The next city boasts the infamous award of foreclosure capital USA .
Stockton California and near areas have been a hub for subprime shenanigans including a young 24 year old poster child of housing greed and speculation .
Stockton is being hit particularly hard since a lot of its local economy was based either directly or indirectly to real estate .
This home has a fabulous pink with red trim and is a must for any value investor .
Heck , for $ 109,000 you may not find a cheaper priced home in California .
Given that a similar unit could be found for $ 800 a month , I ’m not sure if a would - be Donald Trump investor will be buying this hot pink place .
# 6 Paramount
Price : $ 374,900
Square Feet : 840
Details : 2 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,500
Next we go South to Los Angeles County .
The next city is home to the Zamboni and also a ice cold real estate market .
In fact , we ’ve profiled Paramount before the New York Times did an article on the bubblicious nature of the city .
Suffice it to say that Paramount is another subprime city that is being hit very hard by the housing decline .
Unlike Stockton or Fresno that are pricing homes according to the current market , we still have folks thinking the years of going down to your local mortgage broker and getting a no - doc exotic banana republic loan will come again .
Little by little we are seeing this confidence being chipped away .
This 840 square foot foreclosure demonstrates how absurd the bubble has gotten .
A similar place would rent for $ 1,500 while the home is on the market for $ 374,900 .
What do you think the price would need to fall to before this home makes economic sense ?
That ’s right , not the current price .
# 5 Riverside
Price : $ 205,000
Square Feet : 1,070
Details : 3 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,495
Next we move the Inland Empire , ground zero of the housing bubble bust .
If you needed to look at a region that epitomizes the housing excess , you need n’t look any further than the Inland Empire of Southern California .
Overbuilding , speculation , and fraud are no recipe for building a sustainable region .
Simply put , speculators assumed that anything remotely close to L.A. , Orange , and San Diego County would command high prices because people said so .
Now that the bubble has burst this region has the highest foreclosures and inventory in the entire Southern California region .
This bank owned property was initially listed at $ 250,000 but had no bites .
After 3 months on the market you would think that interest would be high but again , even looking at local area rents could be misleading for a real estate investor since a large part of the local economy was based on housing , construction , and real estate financing .
Since California is already in a recession aside from what the numbers tell us , what do you think is going to happen to rents when the employment market contracts ?
# 4 Santa Ana
Price : $ 420,000
Square Feet : 680
Details : 2 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,480
Next we go to the Real OC , Santa Ana .
You would think a place with 12.4 percent of Orange County ’s residence would garner more fanfare but all you hear about is Newport Beach and Laguna Hills , which hold a very small part of Orange County ’s 2.8 million inhabitants .
Why look at facts and data when we can speculate into infinity !?
This short sale is subject to bank approval but what are they going to do with so much inventory in the area ?
This home sold for $ 488,000 in March of 2006 which makes no sense given that local area rents for a similar place go for $ 1,480 .
Wow , that rental price is similar to the Riverside home except the delusion of being in the OC is keeping many of these places sky high in price .
A $ 68,000 discount ?
Try a couple more hundred thousand .
As you dig deeper you start to realize how incredible this housing bubble is .
# 3 Santa Monica
Price : $ 749,000
Square Feet : 635
Details : 2 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 2,500
For those of you not from Southern California , Santa Monica is prime .
Great location and one of the best cities in Los Angeles County .
That does n’t mean that we do n’t have any Real Homes of Genius in the area .
With this magnificent 635 square foot mansion , you will be the envy of all the people flocking to the thirty - mile zone .
For this extraordinary privilege you will pay $ 1,179 per square foot !
Bwahaha !
Even in the current housing market we still have people thinking housing is going to rebound even when a similar rental would go for $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 .
Who would buy this place ?
A buy and hold investor will not buy this place .
A flipper may buy this place but they would need to knock it down and build on the land .
But by the time the new home is ready to flip the market will be even deeper in the dark with less buyers and more inventory .
# 2 Chula Vista
Price : $ 344,500
Square Feet : 1,284
Details : 3 bedroom / 2 baths
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,700
Next we head to the Southern part of the state to Chula Vista , which in Spanish means “ beautiful view . ”
Another prime location of bubble speculation and halo effect bubble pricing .
That is , since Chula Vista is in San Diego County therefore it should be massively overpriced .
Plus , you are paying a premium for an exotic name .
This place is the perfect example of buying at a peak in any bubble .
This home sold for $ 460,000 in March and now , only a few short months after is discounted by a stunning $ 115,500 .
In other words this home is down 25 percent from it peak in nine months .
Yet looking at local area rents it still has further to go .
From border to the north , California is one overpriced state .
And you wonder how Washington Mutual and Countrywide are going to do next year since they both hold a large percentage of their mortgages in California real estate .
# 1 Compton
Price : $ 290,000
Square Feet : 1,234
Details : 3 bedroom / 1 bath
Median Rent for Similar Unit : $ 1,500
Finally we come back to Los Angeles County with a property in Compton .
Compton which is adjacent to another city on the list , Paramount witnessed the same bubble phenomenon .
Prices sky rocketed with a glut of subprime loans .
Now , homes are coming back down to Earth in a dramatic fashion .
This 1,234 square foot home is going to have a hard time finding a buyer without a resurrection of subprime financing .
Now after looking at the data and homes , do you think the pundits have it right that we should open up the financing gates once again ?
Even areas with poor schools and locations were commanding amazing prices just because they were in California .
Conclusion
The ranking on this list does n’t signify which area is in a larger bubble because all areas in California are in a bubble .
That is a pretty bold statement given the sheer size of the state but without a doubt , California boomed with the credit bubble and will burst in equal proportion to it .
There is no stopping a state so dependent and obsessed with housing ; now with tighter financing , less demand , booming inventories , and economic malaise the housing correction has only started in the state .
In a culture fixated with quick riches and instant gratification , how will we grabble with a housing bust that has the potential of lasting 3 , 4 , or even 5 years ?
Today we salute you California with our Real State of Genius Award .

An analysis from Christian Lambert , a former French ambassador , writing at Les 4 Vérités , predicts a terrible fate for Europe .
He titles his essay , " The Inexorable Suicide of Europe . "
The Brussels administration admits officially that each year some 550,000 immigrants from Africa , the Middle East and China , plus South America , enter the European Union .
In reality the figure is twice that , in other words , more than a million .
We will briefly take it country by country .
Italy wins the prize right now .
For this to become known , a young Italian girl had to be raped and murdered by a Gypsy .
Then Rome was forced to reveal that Italy , a country even more poorly governed than France , which is saying a lot , now has 3.7 million immigrants ( the official figure ) , that 700,000 new arrivals were recorded in 2006 , and that 560,000 Gypsies have settled there .
More than 100,000 of them arrived in the ten - month period after January 1 , 2007 .
More than 50 % of the crime in Italy is due to these " Rumanians " .
In addition , every year some 60,000 immigrants from Tunisia and Libya ( where even Colonel Qadhafi admits that his country is invaded by Sub- Saharians waiting to get into Europe and certain to succeed in their goal ) arrive in Italy via the island of Lampedusa .
In general , it is easy to enter Europe through Italy where the administration is " lax " ...
In Greece , it 's worse and Cyprus is one of the great doors of entry into Europe .
In France , nothing has changed .
It can be assumed that 350,000 new arrivals enter our country each year , 70 % of them from Africa .
The number of visas granted has not lessened .
It is still more than 2 million – 2,038,000 in 2006 – which proves that the fight against massive immigration is , like all the rest , purely verbal .
While I 'm on the topic , I should note in passing that the town of Aulnay - sous - Bois , in Seine - Saint - Denis , has just experienced 4 days and nights of street fighting between gangs of " Afro- Maghrebins " and the police , according to the press itself .
At Villiers - le - Bel , Val d'Oise , it is even more serious .
The police , attacked with rifles , proved to be impotent .
In order to quell these riots military units specializing in street fighting are now necessary , especially since stockpiles of war weapons from the Balkans are being stashed in the suburbs .
In Germany there are 4 million Turks , and new arrivals every day .
One German told me that Islamist Turks feel more at ease practicing their religious activities in Germany than in Muslim Turkey .
In Great Britain , 50 powerful Muslim associations control millions of faithful followers , mostly Pakistanis .
In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , beneath the smile of her gracious very Christian Majesty , there are now koranic schools where children can learn to become kamikazes and blow up automobiles .
In the Netherlands where there are many North African , Caribbean and Indonesian Muslims serious trouble is on the increase .
The press writes that the situation is becoming " à la française " , in other words : pillaged shops , torched cars , violent confrontations with the police .
Scandinavia is not to be left out where , in order to be in tune with the times , Norway discovered and recruited , as a government minister , a black woman from Martinique .
I might add that there is no common European policy on immigration .
Spain and Italy amnestied millions of illegals – a tremendous message for others – without even informing their neighbors .
On the other hand , in the countries of Eastern Europe , there are no immigrants .
Why ?
Because these countries were subjected to communism and are therefore underdeveloped , with no welfare state or free hand - outs , housing , health care or schools .
Some say that one must not exaggerate .
The great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries eventually worked themselves out , did n't they ?
Great ignorance .
We have to realize that these invasions had only a limited effect on the population of nascent France .
As a matter of fact , in general , gangs of invaders and vandals , totaling only a few thousand individuals did not settle down in France , except for the Franks to the East .
Furthermore , these barbarians quite rapidly converted to Christianity , more precisely to arianism .
It is true that at the time the merovingian monarchy did not distribute to these barbarians welfare of all kinds , declaring : " You are a great opportunity for France .
Come , all of you , and join us with your large and beautiful families . "
No .
Back then , people still had common sense .
And now , what will happen ?
In the short term , immigration will continue to flood in .
Problems which have never been this serious will continue to spread and worsen .
In the very long term , Europe , which created the most beautiful civilization that humanity has ever produced , will disappear .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The wobbly economy is overtaking Iraq as the issue weighing most heavily on the minds of America 's voters .
And Washington has noticed .
The White House and Congress are almost certain to enact some kind of stimulus package .
But like all such temporary , feel - good measures , it will generate a quick blip in growth that will quickly evaporate .
In reality only one player has the power to do anything swift and decisive : the Federal Reserve .
And its chairman , Ben Bernanke , has already made his intentions abundantly clear .
Unfortunately , the cure he 's prescribing may be worse than the disease .
Just how low will the economy go ?
There are conflicting signals .
It 's clear that the economy is losing steam .
The plummeting value of America 's houses is chilling consumer spending , layoffs are mounting , and banks and other creditors burned by the subprime crisis are far more reluctant to lend to everyone from small - business owners to private equity firms .
But GDP increased by 4.9 % in the third quarter , and economists estimate that GDP was still growing in the fourth quarter .
Exports are strong , thanks to the weak dollar .
The Fed did a brilliant job last summer by flooding the banks with money to prevent a full - scale credit crunch .
Credit is far more expensive today , but it's also becoming more plentiful , as demonstrated by the falling rates on everything from LIBOR - the rate at which international banks lend to each other - to junk bonds .
So while a recession is a real possibility , it 's not inevitable - even the Fed is not forecasting one this year .
And if we do get one , it may be brief and shallow , like the one we had in 2001 - with economic growth falling by perhaps half a percentage point for a couple of quarters , and unemployment rising from its current 5 % to 5.5 % or 6 % .
By cutting rates early and often , Bernanke is acting as though a recession - even a mild one - would be a calamity that must be avoided at all costs .
He has already reduced the Fed funds rate ( which banks pay when they borrow from each other ) by one point , to 4.25 % , and promises to " take substantive additional action as needed to support growth , " a pledge that Wall Street interprets as meaning at least another half - point cut at the Fed 's meeting on Jan. 29 , if not sooner .
Many on Wall Street back Bernanke .
" I 'll defend the Fed , " says Bear Stearns chief economist David Malpass .
" Part of the slowdown is the result of banks ' tightening credit , and you help that by lowering the Fed funds rate . "
Mickey Levy of Bank of America agrees : " You need to lower rates to offset the drag on housing . "
But Bernanke is setting the stage for an even bigger recession down the road .
Just as the ultra - low rates of the early 2000s created many of the problems we 're experiencing today , pumping money into the system would probably stoke inflation , forcing the Fed to hike rates sharply in the near future .
" It 's better to take a small recession and kill inflation immediately instead of facing high inflation and a really big recession later , " says Carnegie Mellon economist Allan Meltzer .
Meltzer , who is finishing the second volume of his history of the Federal Reserve , warns that Bernanke is risking a disastrous replay of the 1970s , when high oil prices fueled double - digit inflation .
Every time the Fed started to tighten and unemployment jumped , chairmen G. William Miller and Arthur Burns lost their nerve .
They lowered rates to boost job growth , and inflation inevitably revived , causing a vicious price spiral .
The Fed let the disease rage for so long that it took draconian action by chairman Paul Volcker in the early 1980s to finally defeat inflation .
The price was a deep recession , with unemployment hitting 11 % in 1982 .
" The mentality is the same as in the 1970s , " says Meltzer .
" ' As soon as we get rid of the risk of recession , we 'll do something about inflation . '
But that comes too late . "
Indeed , while the economy is sending mixed messages about growth , the signs of increasing inflation are flashing bright red .
For 2007 the consumer price index rose 4.1 % , the biggest annual increase in 17 years .
Gold , historically a reliable harbinger of inflation , set an all - time high of more than $ 900 an ounce .
The dollar is languishing at a record low against the euro and a weighted basket of international currencies .
" Flooding the market with liquidity is a disaster for the purchasing power of the dollar , " says David Gitlitz , chief economist for Trend Macrolytics .
The Fed 's supporters tend to downplay those dangers .
They contend that the inflation surge is being driven largely by energy costs .
Since oil is n't likely to rise from its near - $ 100 level , inflation is likely to tail off in 2008 .
" That argument is wrong , " says Brian Wesbury , chief economist with First Trust Portfolios , an asset - management firm .
" As people spend less to drive to the golf course , they will spend the extra money on golf clubs or other products .
The Fed wants to reflate the economy , so the money that went into higher oil prices will drive up the prices of other goods . "
Fed supporters also point out that the yield on ten - year Treasury bonds stands at just 3.8 % , a figure that implies that investors expect inflation to be around 2 % in future years .
So if inflation is really expected to rage , why are n't interest rates far higher ?
The explanation is twofold .
First , government bonds are hardly a foolproof forecaster .
For example , five years ago Treasury yields were predicting 2 % inflation over the next five years , and the actual figure was 3 % , or 50 % higher .
Second , investors are so skittish about most stocks and corporate bonds that they 're paying a huge premium for safe investments , chiefly U.S. Treasuries .
" It 's all about a flight to safety , " says Meltzer .
Stand by for a major rise in yields as the reality of looming inflation sinks in .
So what is the right course for the Fed ?
Bernanke should hold the Fed funds rate exactly where it is now , at 4.25 % .
Standing pat might well push the economy into a recession .
But the Fed 's newfound vigilance on inflation would boost the dollar , effectively lowering the prices of oil and other imports .
America would suffer a short downturn and restore price stability , paving the way to a strong recovery in 2010 or 2011 .
Sadly , the Fed has already chosen sides .
It 's likely to lower rates every time growth slows or joblessness rises .
As a result , it will never tame inflation until it becomes a clawing , bellowing threat .
Then we 'll have to suffer a real recession , the kind we suffered in the aftermath of a time we should study and should n't forget - the 1970s .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Police in the United States and Italy arrested 77 suspected members of the Mafia on Thursday , including some of its most wanted leaders , for an array of crimes going back more than 30 years .
The three - year joint investigation sought to prevent organized crime in New York and Sicily from reuniting their drug - trafficking and money - laundering operations , officials in both countries said .
U.S. authorities rounded up 58 suspects with the help of an informant deep inside the Gambino crime family .
Police said the source helped nail the three top Gambino members not already in jail .
A U.S. grand jury indicted 62 suspects with charges including murder , extortion , loan - sharking , gambling , cocaine and marijuana distribution , money laundering , bribing labor officials and embezzling union funds , U.S. and New York state officials said .
“ Organized crime still exists , ” New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo told a news conference .
“ We like to think it ’s a vestige of the past .
It ’s not .
It is as unrelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks in society . ”
The U.S. investigation focused on the Gambino family once run by the late John Gotti .
The indictment charges one Gambino family soldier , Charles Carneglia , with at least five murders dating to 1976 .
Associates of the Genovese and Bonanno families were also arrested .

More than 300 Italian police were mobilized , mostly in Sicily , in an operation code - named “ Old Bridge , ” arresting 19 suspects and filing new allegations against four others already detained for separate crimes .
Italian prosecutors said the operation sought to block the re-establishment of the New York - Palermo axis , which ran drug trafficking in the 1980s .
“ There was an attempt to rekindle ties between Cosa Nostra in Palermo and New York because the Sicilian Mafia wanted to get back into drug trafficking in a big way , ” top anti-Mafia prosecutor Francesco Messineo told reporters in Rome .
The joint probe focused on the Inzerillo family , which was forced to leave Sicily in the 1980s after a Mafia turf war and rebased in the United States .
They became known as “ the runaways ” and there was a split in the Sicilian Mafia over whether they should be allowed to return .
Among those arrested were suspects linked to Salvatore Lo Piccolo , who was arrested on November 5 in Sicily .
He had become the new “ boss of bosses ” after the arrest in 2006 of Bernardo Provenzano , who had been on the run for 43 years .
Caretaker Prime Minister Romano Prodi praised what he called a “ brilliant operation against organized crime . ”
In what appeared to be a separate operation in Naples , police arrested a suspected leading figure of that southern city ’s criminal underworld on Thursday .
Vincenzo Licciardi , 42 , purportedly a boss of the Camorra crime group , was arrested in a Naples suburb .
He had been on the run since 2004 and was one of Italy ’s 30 most wanted criminals , police said .
Mr. Pandit now confronts growing doubt about his leadership and management team at a time of uncertainty in the financial markets and the economy .
“ There are a lot of balls in the air for Vikram Pandit , ” said David Hendler , a financial services analyst at CreditSights in New York .
“ Pretty soon , that 100 - day honeymoon is going to be over .
In the meantime , they may have to act . ”
Citigroup ’s capital levels came under scrutiny in October when Meredith A. Whitney , now a banking analyst at Oppenheimer , issued a scathing report saying the company ’s weakening finances would force it to cut its dividend , sell assets and issue new stock .
At the time , Citigroup executives brushed off those ideas .
By the end of 2007 , they were heeding Ms. Whitney ’s advice .
On Tuesday , the person close to Citigroup said the company was strong enough to maintain its dividend , which costs the company about $ 6 billion annually .
Still , that leaves open the possibility that the board may elect to cut the dividend .
Citigroup says it has more than enough capital to meet regulatory guidelines and its own internal benchmarks .
The bank is in the process of raising several billion dollars by selling assets from several smaller fringe businesses and has pulled back from some domestic and international markets .
It will also free up several billion dollars as the number of loans on its books shrink .
Citigroup executives have said the bank is strong enough to withstand more shocks , including a further decline in the value of subprime mortgage investments and buyout loans , potential downgradings of bond insurance companies and big consumer - loan losses .
“ The exposures to these areas were stress - tested against an economic downturn with a variety of severity levels , ” Gary L. Crittenden , the chief financial officer , said in a conference call with investors in January .
Taking all the factors together , he said , the company had addressed a potential capital shortfall .
Still , many analysts question whether Citigroup has the earnings power to withstand the heavy losses that might come with a severe economic slump .
“ They might as well fess up and admit they need to raise a big chunk of money , ” said Christopher Whalen , managing partner of Institutional Risk Analytics .
“ The issue with Citi is all the coming consumer credit losses . ”

Increased tendency to mutate is handed down to next generation .
A parent plant can pass the tendency to mutate on to its offspring .

Plants under stress not only activate their own defences , but also manage to pass on a possible protective strategy to their descendants .
That 's the surprising conclusion of a study published online today by Nature1 .
Stresses such as pathogen infection or ultraviolet radiation can trigger increased rates of genetic mutation in some plant cells , occasionally even scrambling regions of their DNA .
Some scientists hypothesize that by augmenting their genomic flexibility , plants boost their ability to produce genetic changes that could allow them to adapt to stressful environments .
Now it seems that plants can also pass this genetic pliability on to their offspring .
Researchers in Barbara Hohn 's lab at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel , Switzerland , study a process in which one piece of DNA within the genome replaces another fragment of similar sequence .
This process , called ' homologous recombination ' , occurs more frequently in stressed plants .
Plants grown near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear - reactor accident , for example , were found to have rates of homologous recombination that increased with the dose of radiation they received .
By chance , a student in Hohn 's lab found that the rate of homologous recombination was curiously high in a particular batch of cress plant or Arabidopsis seeds .
When he traced back the origin of the seeds , he discovered that the parent had been irradiated .
" Nobody set out to do this , " says Hohn .
" It was pure serendipity . "
Stressful memories
“ Nobody set out to do this .
It was pure serendipity . ”
Barbara Hohn
Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research .
After the accidental discovery , Hohn 's group set out to examine what was going on .
The team found that , as expected , giving a parental plant a burst of ultraviolet radiation or a simulated pathogen attack boosted the rate of homologous recombination in some of its cells .
And when the change occurred in cells that are used to form the plants ' offspring , all progeny carried the genetic change .
But , surprisingly , even if the cells used to create the progeny did n't carry the genetic change , the offspring of the stressed plants were still more likely to undergo homologous recombination in their own cells .
They had inherited a tendency to mutate .
The memory of the initial stress lasted a long time ; at least four generations had an increased level of homologous recombination .
Exactly how plants pass down this information is unknown .
Hohn believes that the mechanism is ' epigenetic ' — inheritance of a trait without a corresponding change in DNA sequence .
Chemical modification of a plant 's DNA that happens during its lifetime , for example , can be copied into the progeny 's DNA .
Or RNA , an intermediate that helps to convert DNA information into proteins , may be ferried from a parent 's cells into its offspring's .
Hohn is quick to point out that her lab has not shown that the progeny of stressed parents are themselves more stress - tolerant , so it is unclear what advantage , if any , this inheritance gives the subsequent generations .
" If the plants become UV - resistant or pathogen - resistant , " she says , " that would be adaptive evolution . "
Hohn 's lab has n't yet tested whether this is so .
Staying put

It makes sense that plants would have elaborate strategies for coping with stress , says Christopher Cullis , a biologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio .
" Plants ca n't get up and find somewhere nicer , " says Cullis .
" So they 've got to find a way of coping with that stress . "
But he finds it surprising that a single burst of stress seems sufficient to trigger such a long - lasting response .
Eric Richards , a biology professor at Washington University in St Louis , says that results from Hohn 's lab are intriguing .
One interesting follow - up , he adds , is to check whether recombination has increased throughout the plant 's entire genome .
Hohn 's lab is set up to look at just one specific gene , so they have n't yet taken this broader approach .
" I think there 's probably a lot more of these inherited epigenetic phenomena out there than people think , " says Richards , who himself studies plant epigenetics .
" I guess it 's now come to the point at which people are starting to take these things seriously . "

Michael Weiner has a radio show .
For obvious reasons , he has chosen to do the show under the name Michael Savage instead , and " The Savage Nation " attracts a few million listeners per week .
They listen , in part , to hear Savage rant on conservative topics .
On October 29 , 2007 , listeners were rewarded with this bit of enlightened monologue on the topic of Muslims :
What kind of world are you living in that you let them in here with that throwback document in their hand , which is a book of hate .
Do n't tell me I need reeducation .
They need deportation .
I do n't need reeducation .
Deportation not reeducation .
You can take CAIR and throw them out of my country .
I 'd raise the American flag , and I 'd get out my trumpet if you did it .
Without due process .
You can take your due process and shove it ...
Wherever you look on the Earth there 's a bomb going off or a car going up in flames , and it 's Muslims screaming for the blood of Christians or Jews or anyone they hate .
There 's more ... much more ( Savage believes that " 90 percent of them are on welfare , " for instance ) , and it's not surprising that the Council for American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) might have a different view .
CAIR posted a four - minute excerpt of this show on its website along with a rebuttal , and Savage then filed a lawsuit against the group , alleging copyright infringement .
Savage 's legal filing stands in a class by itself .
Little of the filing talks about copyright at all ; the vast majority is an extended rant about " CAIR and it's [ sic ] terror connections " and how the group was " tied to terror from the day it was formed . "
Savage is n't just upset about copyright ; in fact , he complains at one point that his remarks were taken out of context and that many other selections ( i.e. , more copying ) from his show would indicate his regard for Muslims .
Savage is upset that CAIR used the clip to convince some advertisers to pull their support for his show , a practice he seems to think is illegal .
He also makes a racketeering claim against the group and says that " the role of CAIR and CAIR - Canada is to wage PSYOPS ( psychological warfare ) and disinformation activities on behalf of Whabbi - based [ sic ]
Islamic terrorists throughout North America .
They are the intellectual ' shock troops ' of Islamic terrorism . "
The EFF has now stepped into the debate ( Savage refers to them as " liberal attorneys " ) , helping to prepare CAIR 's response .
The response , filed on January 30 , takes issue with Savage 's " 172 - paragraph legal broadside laced with falsities and xenophobic fantasies to punish and intimidate the Council for American - Islamic Relations . "
Their point is a simple one : as a matter of law , the US allows anyone to use copyrighted material for the purposes of criticism or commentary .
" Fair use " law in the US is based on four general tests that give fair use its elastic character .
But copyright law also contains several specific exemptions , including the one for criticism .
The EFF runs through the four factors : purpose and nature of the use , the nature of the copyrighted work , the amount used , and the effect of that use on the value of the copyrighted material .
The EFF believes the lawsuit was a brazen attempt to " use copyright law to punish a vocal critic , " and the group points out that using copyright law to stifle dissent has become a common practice against critics on either side of the political spectrum .
Michelle Malkin was treated to a DMCA takedown notice last year , for instance , after using clips of the performer Akon in a critical video post .
It seems like an unusually nasty cold is going around , but I have no way to prove my point .
Four of my friends , each in a different large city , have skipped work because of a nasty infection .
All of them are suffering from the same symptoms : lots of green phlegm , exhaustion , sore throat , no fever .
Unaffected , I feel a bit like the protagonist in 28 Days Later – wondering what the heck is going on .
How many people are infected ?
Is there a cure ?
Should I crawl under a rock and hide ?
Assuming that the bug is a virus , what kind is it ?
I have no idea where to find any answers .
None of my friends have seen a doctor , but even if they did , they would not get a fancy lab test that can identify the pathogen .
Thus , I am stuck making assumptions and hiding under my bed with a flashlight and a cricket bat .
When there is an earthquake , people flock to the U.S. geological survey website .
But during flu season , where can we get reliable information ?
Sure , the Centers for Disease Control regularly post flu reports and maps , but I would not be surprised if the bug which sickened my friends is not an influenza virus .
In a perfect world , we could all stockpile an easy - to - use home disease tests and our local pharmacy would carry an arsenal of antiviral drugs .
Responsible individuals could report their illnesses to a fancy Web 2.0 site with maps and lots of useful statistics .
Unfortunately , effective antiviral medications are in the realm of science fiction and developing new ones is n't cheap .
They cost about $ 800 million each – if researchers are successful .
Since drugs that treat chronic maladies are more lucrative , big pharma has little incentive to develop countermeasures against infectious diseases .
But hey , at least some people are safe , the government is spending over $ 6.1 billion on the presidential helicopter program .
Am I alone in thinking that a particularly nasty cold is going around ?

" The Ice Cream Man " I bought this tin ice cream truck last year and have been gathering other objects and developing the story behind the painting .
Nothing was more exciting during the summer months of vacation than to hear the music of the ice cream man in the distance .
Our ice cream man was named Herbie , and if you timed it just right when you were buying your ice cream from him , he would take the empty cardboard box that held the ice cream bars and pop it on top or your head .
The frost from the box would go down your neck and make that 90 degree day feel real cool .
Not to mention that you were the ' chosen one ' that day , and that carried a lot of weight in my neighborhood .
This tin truck was the spark for the inspiration that will soon become a painting .
Here is a photo I took a few years ago in Long Beach , in the Belmont Heights area .
Looks like my grandma's house in Los Angeles that we lived in for a short time when I was 4 years old .
I am envisioning the ice cream truck parked in front of the house with the ice cream man handing a Popsicle and a Fudgsicle to two small girls .
The girls had just been playing hopscotch and jumprope .
Here 's the box of chalk that I will use in the painting .
I found an unused Popsicle and Fudgsicle wrapper and had to make a couple of frozen treats out of foamcore board to go in the wrappers .
Here they are , ready to go into the still life set up .
I am waiting for a vintage jumprope that I purchased .
It may be a week before it arrives ...
Although I 've found my three models for this painting , Spring Break has sent my two youngest models on vacation , delaying their photoshoot .
I 've decided to begin the design of the image , placing the house in the upper part of the canvas .
I 've been contacted by a couple of high schools that use my step - by - step pages in their art curriculum .
They would like to have a little more information for their students as to how I draw the image on the canvas .
So here goes .
With the house , I placed a sheet of clear mylar over the photograph and made my own gridlines .
Here 's what it looks like finished .
After I decided how large I wanted the house to be on the canvas , I drew corresponding gridlines on a sheet of white chipboard .
This is an old mural artist 's technique for scaling up a drawing onto a wall or larger surface .
By observing just where certain parts of the house appear in each box formed by the gridlines , I copy those areas into the corresponding box on the chipboard .
Here you can see the chipboard with the grid lines and the drawing of the house on it .
I worked it all out with pencil and then drew over it with a black thin marker .
Here 's a close - up of the roof section .
I drew this on chipboard instead of directly on the canvas so that I would still have the option of moving it up and down , left and right on the canvas .
In order to get the drawing onto the canvas , I will lay a large piece of tracing paper over the drawing and trace the outline of the house onto the tracing paper with the black marker .
Here I am tracing the outline drawing with the tracing paper and the marker .
I 'm using a # 2 pencil now , rubbing it on the backside of the tracing paper .
With the graphite on the back of the tracing paper , it becomes carbon paper .
I tape it to the canvas and ...
With a 6H pencil , I retrace the outline , pressing the graphite from the # 2 pencil onto the canvas .
Here 's what the canvas looks like after transferring the drawing onto it .
I 've had my props out in the sunshine today , moving them around , trying to find a grouping that works for the space I have allotted at the bottom of the painting .
My models are coming over to pose on Thursday .
Hope there is some sunshine ...
Well , the sun was shining and so were the faces on the models .
Looks like I 'll have plenty to work on this week , positioning them into the painting ...
By the way , Aria and Makenzie , ( now a bit older ) made the U.S. Olympic women 's water polo team and will compete in Rio in 2016 .
I 've drawn in all the other objects onto the canvas and started blocking in the sky and background trees .
I 'll move into the house now ... ... defining the detail in the siding and choosing hues of gray to make up my shadow areas .
I 've made the shadows on the front facades of the house vary from cool ( area of house set back ) to warm as in the front porch projection .
This part of the house reflects more light off of the cement walkway and sidwalk area , making the value ( darkness ) lighter and warmer .
Here 's the house and background all blocked in with its thin wash of oil and turpentine .
This is a close - up of Aria in the foreground , sitting on one of the jumprope handles .
Her older sister , Makenzie , is paying for both ice cream treats but she can't wait and has started on her popsicle .
Here is Makenzie paying the ice cream man .
Notice that the man 's right hand is making change on his ' belt changer ' .
This is my changer , one that I bought when I was thirteen for collecting monthly subscriptions on my paper route .
The next objects that I will paint will be those things that have a generic color that defines those objects .
Things like clothing ( except for the ice cream man who has a uniform ) that can be adjusted will be last to be painted , giving me the option to help balance or contrast the focal areas of the painting .
Here you see the box of chalk , which I have given a preliminary pass of oil .
The jumprope handles had to be red ( although they came in many colors ) because they are most identifiable in that color .
I 've painted the Popsicle and the Fudgsicle their ' generic ' colors .
I 've begun to paint the ice cream truck .
In order for it to look more like a toy , I 've added a wind - up key on the lower rear of the truck .
Here 's where the painting stands at this point .
The ice cream truck is roughed in .
I 've begun to paint in the detail of the fruit clusters in the design of the tablecloth .
Once I am finished I will pick a color to go into the box design on the tablecloth .
The actual color is pink and I do n't think I want that color dominating the bottom of the painting .
I 've completed painting the fruit clusters and have begun laying in the ' box design ' on the tablecloth .
I 've decided to replace the pink color inside the squares with a warm tan and have painted the lines that separate the squares on off white .
You can see that I 've also started putting in the cast shadows .
Here 's another close - up showing the cast shadows of the ice creams .
I 've yet to start painting in the darker value of the tablecloth that hangs over the front of the street .
I 've blocked in the front of the tablecloth and ... ... put the detail into the braided rope .
Two of my models are in place .
And that makes three !
The only thing left is the jumprope diagram on the driveway .
It will go in as part of my second and final paint application .
I 've begun the final paint application .
I do n't use any additives ( media ) , just the thickness of the pigment right out of the tube .
The sky and the trees are finished .
The trees in the upper right of the painting .
I drew in with off white paint the hopscotch pattern .
The roof has final paint as well as the left side of the house ( which I substantially darkened ) .
I decided to paint the steps and the porch a reddish color to give the house a little more ' pop ' and to provide a better backdrop for the ice cream truck .
I 've decided to add some interest to the cast shadows coming from the house to the right of the driveway .
I chose Italian Cypress tree shadows so that I could get a linear pattern that stops the viewers eye from going up the driveway too quickly .
I do n't mind someone enjoying the ' mother - in - law quarters ' at the end of the driveway , but I would like their initial focus to be on the ice cream transaction and activities in the foreground .
Here 's a close - up of the right side of the house .
Except for the brickwork on the front porch , the house is done .
The driveway and planter area is next .
This is the left side of the house .
The play of light through the picket fence and the narrow ' peek ' into the neighbor 's backyard adds interest to this part of the painting .
Chalk up one more item painted ...
Sorry for the pun , but the box of chalk is done ...( now I 'm rhyming ! )
The ice cream truck is completed .
It 's funny how a tin toy looks fairly real when enlarged to human scale ...
And the jumprope is fully painted .
Now on to the Popsicle and Fudgsicle .
Here I am putting the finishing touches on the two frozen treats and ... ... now they are done !
Two of my figures are finished .
Notice that although I have used a small sable brush to do the details of the figures ( faces , hands and legs ) , I used a larger bristle brush to do the clothing .
It makes a nice contrast and simplifies the clothing so that it does n't distract from the simplicity of the pose .
And that makes three done !
Now all I have left is the tablecloth , which includes the cast shadow from all the objects and the tablecloth itself .
Compare this photo with the one above .
Notice the heavy paint on the tablecloth in this photo .
I love showing the brushstrokes of the heavy ' looser ' areas that surround a smoother ' detailed ' area .
Here 's another detail of the tablecloth as it curves over the edge of the table ( or street ? )
See how I darkened the shadow under the Fudgsicle , helping the wrapper ' pop ' off the edge of the tablecloth .
I also made the cast shadow and darker vertical areas of the tablecloth with a slightly greenish brown cast to show that there is a warm reflective light bouncing into it .
It was a long haul , but " Ice Cream Man " is finished .
Hope you enjoyed the journey !

In order to tell the waitress that there was indeed a reason she was n’t getting a tip , Chris left this little note where the tip would ordinarily go . ”
Though I can certainly empathize , as a former food service industry worker I just ca n’t condone not leaving a tip .

Avalanche on Mars Share
Advertisement
You might have noticed that for all researchers ' fascination with the Martian landscape , it does n't exactly do much in most photos .
NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken care of that .
A single image taken in mid-February has captured no less than four avalanches in progress near the Red Planet 's north pole .
In the example shown here ( in false color ) , a mass of fine dust and ice , possibly with bigger rocks mixed in , has broken off from a steep cliff over 2,300 feet ( 700 meters ) high and sloping up to 60 degrees or more .
The avalanche is traced by a cloud of fine material 590 feet ( 180 meters ) across and extending 630 feet ( 190 meters ) from the base of the cliff ; a shadow beside the dust confirms that it extends into the volume above .
NASA says the likely source of the spilled material is the uppermost , broken rock face ( reddish ) lying just below the mass of carbon dioxide frost ( white ) lining the scarp , which may have triggered the collapse as it melted .
The agency notes that detailed measurements of the avalanches may reveal how quickly ice is eroding from the cliff and the exact proportion of ice and dust in the cloud .

There ’s no reason why you should n’t be able to get at least 12 years and 150,000 trouble - free miles out of a new car today — and that can make your initial “ investment ” ( on average , $ 24,000 today ) a lot easier to swallow .
But the key element is proper care — and proper driving .
Cars are a lot like our bodies ; live like Elvis — and do n’t expect to live very long .
But treat your body ( and your car ) with care and respect — and both should last a very long time .
To enjoy the benefits of a long - live car , keep in mind — and try to live by — the following rules :
1 ) Regular maintenance per the factory recommendations
Not just oil changes , but general maintenance , including periodic service of the brake system , cooling system , transmission — and so on .
Most automakers provide a service schedule with their new cars , listing what should be done ( and when ) according to mileage accrued or time passed .
These are not “ suggestions ” — they are there for a reason .
Ignore them at your peril .
As an example : Failure to have an ABS brake system periodically flushed can lead to the premature failure of major ( and expensive ) parts like the ABS pump .
2 ) Understand the difference between “ Normal ” and “ Severe ” use
Unless you read the fine print , you may be under the impression you only need to have oil and filter changes and so on done once every six months or 6,000 miles , when in fact the driving you do qualifies as “ severe use ” — and the intervals are actually much shorter .
The automakers tout their “ normal ” service intervals — which are typically pretty generous these days — making it seem like the need for routine service has almost gone away ( implicitly saving you time and money ) .
But if you live in a city / suburban area and your driving includes a lot of stop - and - go duty , then you usually qualify for the “ severe ” ( or “ heavy duty ” ) intervals , which tend to be much shorter .
It ’s important to follow the right schedule , in either case .
Even if you do end up spending an extra $ 40 or $ 50 per year on oil and filter changes , that ’s a lot less expensive than a prematurely tired engine — and the bill for a new car to replace your old one .
3 ) Competent service by trained technicians
Today ’s cars are more complex than ever and “ do - it - yourself ” work can result in botched repairs or ( or worse , improperly done service that accelerates wear and tear ) .
Make sure the person under the hood knows what they ’re doing — and avoid the temptation to fiddle with things yourself unless you understand what you ’re doing and have the right tools to d the job .
4 ) Driving style
This last one ’s often the deal breaker .
Frequent full - throttle starts , late ( and hard ) braking , throwing the car around corners — it ’s all lots of fun , but in addition to killing your gas mileage and prematurely wearing out your tires , it also means a shorter life for your engine , transmission , brakes , suspension parts and so on .
Smooth , steady driving will extend the life of all these components — and the car as a whole .
You ’ll also save on gas and tires .
A few parting suggestions :
If you have a manual transmission , engage the clutch smoothly — without “ riding ” it ( which will wear it out faster . )
Do not hold the clutch in while idling at a light ; this places excess strain on it — which can lead to early failure .
Instead , depress the clutch , put the transmission in neutral and wait for the light to change .
Then engage the clutch , put the vehicle in gear and drive on .
If you have an automatic transmission use the parking brake when leaving the vehicle .
Throwing it into “ Park ” without first applying the paring brake can put excess strain on the transmission , lock it in gear , and can even cause expensive damage that will require a tow .
If you have a a truck or SUV with part - time four - wheel - drive , avoid engaging the 4WD on dry , smooth pavement .
Never , ever engage the 4WD Low setting ( or differential lock ) on dry , paved roads .
( If you have a vehicle with AWD , the system will adjust itself automatically for given conditions . )
Use the proper grade of fuel specified by the manufacturer .
Even though modern cars can self - adjust for lower - octane fuel ( preventing damage from “ knocking ” that might otherwise occur ) you ’ll still suffer decreased mileage and lower performance as a consequence .
Also , off - brand fuels may not have the same amount of detergents and fuel system additives of name - brand gas .
Avoid filing up at out - of - the - way stations , where old ( or water - laced ) fuel may be a problem .

Infinia is a company with a modular product : a mirrored solar dish that looks like a home satellite receiver , and produces 3.5 kilowatts of energy .
Infinia announced Monday that it had received $ 50 million in investment .
The dish focuses the sun ’s rays on to a Stirling engine ( a 17th century invention ) , this heats a gas inside that drives pistons to generate electricity ( see the engine in action here ) .
The free - moving piston requires no lubricants , and thus no maintenance .
It is also designed to be assembled with common mass - produced parts that an auto - parts supplier could manufacture .
Getting the cost down is the key to creating a technology that is competitive with other forms of energy .
“ What makes this unique is the no-maintenance profile , ” says chief financial officer , Gregg Clevenger , “ the ability to deploy a Stirling engine out in the desert and it is engineered to run for 20 years without you having to do anything . ”
Infinia are working towards building 50 to 100 of these giant solar dishes which would produce the same amount of energy as a small power plant .
Each dish costs $ 20,000 .
Using its Stirling engine technology , Inifnia thinks it can eventually produce electricity 20 to 30 percent cheaper than today ’s existing solar panels .
And in times of peak energy demand — on a hot summer day , for instance — it could even be competitive with electricity from gas - powered or coal - fired plants .

WASHINGTON -- Congress and the White House hammered out an economic stimulus package that would put $ 150 billion into the hands of consumers and businesses while seeking to revive the market for large mortgages .
It was a rare display of compromise and speed in a city known recently for partisan gridlock .
Both parties were responding to middle - class economic fears , as election - year nerves are frayed by a seesawing stock market , a wave of home foreclosures and a credit crunch .
" I can't say that I 'm totally pleased with the package , but I do know that it will help stimulate the economy , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Economists said the measures , coming as the risk of a downturn rises , could boost growth this year by between three - quarters of a percentage point and a full point .
One important provision temporarily raises the dollar limit on mortgages that can be bought or guaranteed by government - sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The current limit of $ 417,000 would rise above $ 600,000 and perhaps as high as $ 730,000 in the most expensive areas , congressional leaders said .
( See related article . )
The centerpiece of the package is $ 100 billion in tax credits for an estimated 117 million families this spring .
Most individuals who pay income taxes would get $ 600 ; working couples would receive $ 1,200 .
Workers who make at least $ 3,000 but do n't pay income taxes would get checks of $ 300 to $ 600 .
People in both groups would get $ 300 credits for each of their children .

My AAAS experience began early this morning at a session entitled " 50 years of the space age : looking back , looking forward . "
It was a discussion panel that included Roald Sagdeev , a professor of physics and space science at the University of Maryland , Kathy Sullivan , a retired astronaut who was the first US woman to go on a spacewalk , and Andrew King , a VP of Boeing 's Civil Space Program .
It began with a discussion on the start of the space race , which dawned just over 50 years ago with the launch of Sputnik 1 .
Occurring during the height of the cold war , this singular event made headlines across the United States and catalyzed the formation of NASA the following year .
However , in the Soviet Union , the event was not front page news .
According to Prof. Sagdeev , who played a key role in the Russian space program , the launch of Sputnik was downplayed to Soviet leaders , as it was done in response to a call from international scientists looking to celebrate the International Geophysical Year .
Sputnik was viewed by the Soviet Union as more of a byproduct of an ICBM test than as a satellite launch .
The moderator then asked the panel what purpose they felt was served by putting humans in space .
Andrew King stated that this was clear cut during the cold war : it was done for national interest .
He also stated that in the future — how far in the future is up for discussion — he believed we would have large scale space structures that would have clearly defined purposes and therefore human involvement would again be clear .
However , now we are in what he referred to as a stage of " ugly adolescence , " where we have no clear purpose but are laying the ground work for humanity 's future .
Discussing the future of humanity in space , Dr. Sullivan recalled how , back in the 1960's , there were often linked discussions about both space exploration and deep sea ocean exploration ; clearly one still captures our imagination , yet the other has dropped off the list of public concerns .
She suggested that we need to understand what caused one to stay in the public eye even though both remain grand challenges involving exploring the unknown .
At this point , the moderator asked people in the audience who would like to go into space .
Nearly everyone raised their hand , but one person asked the poignant question : " How much would it cost ? "
If it were free , the non-scientific study ( survey of 30 or so people in the room ) says that everyone was in , if it cost $ 10,000 , then only a few were still willing , and if it cost $ 100,000 , then almost nobody was willing .
This turned the discussion to the topic of consumer space tourism .
It was clear that the entire panel was skeptical of the concept of space tourism , and that they all clearly felt that there should be a delineation between orbital and sub-orbital space tourism .
According to Dr. Sullivan , SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo will bring people no closer to true space tourism , as they merely represent a sub-orbital ' pole - vault ' that lets passengers experience a touch of microgravity .
In my opinion , there is nothing wrong with this , as people are still technically crossing the boundary of space ( 100 km ) , but they are indeed not getting anywhere near orbit .
Dr. Sagdeev pointed out that the suborbital travel requires between 30 and 40 times less fuel than it takes to get a craft into orbit .
All panelists agreed that for actual space tourism to become a reality , it would take a large - scale concerted national ( or international ) effort into propulsion research to bring the economics and capabilities into line .
According to data from Dr. King , the market for space tourism is on the order of 800 million dollars a year , and this is only enough to support about five spacecraft around the world .
When put in terms of hard numbers , Dr. King said that , in order for space tourism to be a widespread reality , the overall cost of dry materials would need to be on the order of a few hundred dollars a pound , similar to what we see in commercial airliners today .
For reference , the space shuttle costs around $ 21,000 / lb of dry material .
An audience member then asked a question about what would happen to the economics of the system if point - to - point suborbital flights that carried packages were taken into account — think UPS Space .
The panelists ' reply was that there would be little added benefit over a standard overnight transport , yet it would incur a significantly higher cost , so none felt that this would appreciably change the financial proposition .
The final major topic of discussion was sparked by the moderator 's question : " What would you tell the new President of the U.S. about spaceflight ? "
Dr. Sullivan responded by saying that what has been a small fraction of the US 's total budget has given back a large amount of both tangible and intangible things .
She said that the next president needs to stay the course on the grand challenge of planetary and space exploration .
Dr. King said that we need a lasting infrastructure and balance in the space program .
if we undertake a new grand challenge — going back to the moon , or going to Mars and beyond — with out leaving behind an infrastructure for further use , then we are just going to be doomed to start from scratch each time .
He also said that it must be stressed that our science and technology portfolio must contain a balance of all fields of science and engineering .
Finally , Prof.
Sagdeev stressed the need to ban weapons in space — made all the more important by the recent announcement of the US 's intention to shoot down its failed spy satellite .
He also suggested creating large - scale international groups to specialize in the exploration of space .

Perhaps it is because Danielle Heaney and Nick Cameron do n't look in the least alike that they pass so easily for a pair of young lovers no different from any other .
She is a petite , delicate , blue - eyed blonde , while he is a strapping young man with auburn hair and soft brown eyes which never stray for long from her face .
Scroll down for more ...
Forbidden love : Nick Cameron and his half - sister Danielle Heaney are hopelessly in love .
A judge says if they have sex , they 'll be jailed
They hold hands , they kiss , they stroke each other 's arms , they listen attentively to each other .
They are totally besotted .
What makes this scene so disturbing , however , is the fact that Danielle and Nick are half brother and sister .
Incest remains one of society 's last taboos , as this troubled young couple know only too well .
Prison is the ever present threat to this forbidden union .
" I know that loving my brother in this way is wrong morally and legally , but it just feels right , " says 22 - year - old Danielle .
" The only way to explain it is to say that the day I met Nick , I felt I had finally met my soulmate .
Everything clicked .
I would marry him if I could . "
Nick first met Danielle when she was 20 and immediately thought : ' Wow , she 's attractive '
Nick , 28 , adds : " My feelings are very confused .
We are very deeply in love with each other , but sometimes I think ' she's my little sister .
I should n't be feeling this way . '
" All I know is that for the first time in my life I feel I belong .
I should feel ashamed of it , but I do n't . "
Danielle and Nick have different fathers but the same mother .
They grew up apart after Nick was placed in foster care as a child , and only met as adults in August 2006 .
At the meeting in their mother Susan 's home in Glenrothes , Fife , they were both struck with an unexpected thunderbolt of recognition , physical attraction and almost instant longing .
Within three weeks they were lovers and Danielle 's marriage to her 28 - year - old husband was over .
He moved out of the marital home with their child and it is he who now looks after their four - year - old daughter .
As for their mother Susan , 48 , she rues the day she invited her lost - long son back into the family hoping to make up for all the years she missed with him .
It was Susan who reported them to police after walking in on them making love in the autumn of 2006 , and shouted in horror : " What you are doing is morally wrong . "
She is barely on speaking terms with them now .
Earlier this month the pair were put on a year 's probation by Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court after admitting incest , at an earlier court hearing .
Danielle says she and Nick ' clicked straight away '
They were warned that if they had sexual intercourse again they could face a jail sentence of up to two years .
After nine months enforced separation , which was part of their bail conditions , the pair celebrated their reunion with champagne and Nick was this week planning to move back into Danielle 's flat in Glenrothes .
Surely they are playing with fire ?
Both insist they will not have sex again , but admit they are still infatuated with each other .
Both still act like lovers rather than siblings .
They 've even discussed moving to another country , such as France , where incest is not illegal so they can live together as partners - although they would not be allowed to marry .
They accept that , even if they were to remain lovers , they can never have children together because of the genetic risks to the child of inbreeding .
" Those nine months on bail when I could n't see or speak to Danielle were sheer torture , " says Nick , a croupier , who moved to Glasgow to live with an uncle after their arrest , " I went through a profound depression .
" It felt to me as if we'd only just found each other and here we were being separated again .
We just want that closeness back .
We do n't want to be apart .
" We have an unbreakable bond .
Of course , it will be hard living together and there will always be temptation , but we have decided that we can still love each other without having sex .
" I love Danielle and because of that I do n't want to do anything which might put her in prison , and she feels the same way about me .
The sexual expression of our feelings is only one part of the relationship . "
Danielle , a former hairdresser , adds : " What we can't live without is the closeness and intimacy .
We can still talk , we can still go for walks , we can still love each other .
" Legally we can still kiss , still hold hands , still carry on together , we just can't have intercourse . "
Short of installing a CCTV camera in their home to ensure no law is broken again , we shall just have to take their word for it .
The pair say they plan to go to joint counselling to try to understand their intense and confusing feelings .
" Obviously there have to be boundaries , because incest is illegal in this country , " says Nick , " but maybe , with counselling , we can move our relationship on to a more normal brother - sister one .
" That may not be what we want at the moment because we are in love , but perhaps those feelings will fizzle out and we will be able to keep the bond that we have within the proper boundaries . "
While Danielle and Nick 's story is undoubtedly shocking , it is not as uncommon as many of us might wish to think .
Genetic sexual attraction is a recognised psychological phenomenon , which sometimes affects siblings or blood relatives separated at birth , who then meet later as adults .
The term is believed to have first been coined in America in the 1980s by a woman called Barbara Gonyo , who wrote about the unexpected lust she felt for the adult son she 'd given up for adoption 26 years earlier .
The relationship was never consummated because those feelings were never reciprocated and they eventually faded when her son married .
According to research , first published in the British Medical Journal in 1995 , by Dr Maurice Greenberg and Professor Roland Littlewood , 50 per cent of people seeking post - adoption counselling " experienced strong sexual feelings in reunions " with their real family .
This can happen between siblings , mother / son and father / daughter and is believed to be the adult response to the absence of " bonding " in childhood .
The natural repulsion brothers and sisters often feel for each other as children is a safeguard against incest and those who miss out on that bonding , according to psychologists , can develop obsessive feelings for their sibling as an adult .
Those feelings may or may not become sexual , but those that do take that course challenge our notion of incest because there is no coercion or abuse between consenting adults .
Danielle and Nick believe that they too are victims of genetic sexual attraction and are only speaking now because they want to highlight an issue few people are prepared to talk publicly about .
Either that , or they are trying to find psychological excuses for behaviour that many would consider reprehensible .
They may not have been able to control their feelings but it was their choice to act on them , ignoring their responsibilities not only to each other , but their family .
" Our mother and my foster family would much prefer we kept quiet , " says Nick , " but this is n't just about us .
There are plenty of other people going through exactly the same emotions .
There needs to be more understanding . "
Nick was just a one - year - old when his parents ' relationship broke up , and he has never had any contact with his biological father .
He was placed in foster care when his mother Susan found it impossible to cope on her own .
He had sporadic contact with his mother over the years , but only met Danielle - the product of Susan 's next shortlived relationship - once when she was five years old and he was 11 .
Nick says he was happy growing up with his foster family in Glasgow , and eventually went on to take a degree in music and drama .
" When my mother sent a message through my foster mum two years ago to say she wanted to meet me , I initially thought : ' What does she want ? ' , " says Nick .
" I was curious more than anything , and agreed to go and stay with her for a couple of weeks .
I think she had regrets about putting me in foster care and wanted to make amends .
" I remember it feeling very strange when she collected me from the bus station and gave me a cuddle , but when she took me home I had a real feeling of belonging .
" Danielle was waiting back at home - she was 20 then - and the first time I saw her I thought : ' Wow , she 's attractive , ' but then I pulled myself together telling myself ' That 's your sister you are talking about ' . "
Danielle adds : " I was nervous about meeting Nick because although he was my brother , he was also a stranger , but when he walked in I gave him a cuddle because my mum had , too .
" We just clicked straight away .
It 's impossible to explain .
I just felt drawn to him , as if he was the person I 'd been waiting for all my life . "
During those first two weeks , Danielle and Nick spent every spare second together and initially there was something childlike in their touchy - feely horseplay - except that they were n't children any more .
" I think Mum could see what was happening because we were flirting quite a lot , " says Danielle .
" We just felt this need to keep hugging each other and mum would say : ' Will you put him down . '
" But at that stage nothing had happened between us and I really did n't think anything would - but then one thing led to another . "
This despite Danielle being married and having a young child .
In fact , many people will feel her betrayal of her husband as equally as unpalatable as their incestuous relationship .
Danielle , whose own father split up from Susan when she was a baby , married at 16 in her quest to create her own more stable family unit .
She was 18 when her daughter was born , but suffered post-natal depression and found it difficult to bond with her child .
Her marriage - her partner is a house husband - was under severe strain by the time her long - lost brother turned up .
Nick says : " I felt more guilty about the fact I was sleeping with a married woman than I was about sleeping with my half - sister .
" I kept saying to Danielle 'are you sure about this ?
Are we doing the right thing ? ' because she had a husband and a child .
" She told me her marriage was already in trouble when I came along , but that is the one thing I do regret .
I did n't want to hurt anyone else , but it felt as if we just could n't stop ourselves falling in love . "
With relations with his mother increasingly fraught , because she was deeply suspicious of the blossoming closeness between her children , Danielle invited Nick to move in with her and her husband and child .
Still , she insists she has no regrets or real feelings of guilt .
" No I do n't feel bad about it , " says Danielle defiantly .
" Nick did not break up my marriage .
It was already in trouble .
" Nick and my mum were n't getting on too well , so I thought the best thing would be if he moved in with us .
He was my brother . "
Then one day , while her husband was out with their daughter , Danielle and Nick found themselves kissing , and before they knew it they were making love on the sofa .
" My mum came round to give me some mail which had been delivered to her house , " says Nick .
" She knocked on the door but when there was no answer she walked in .
We 'd forgotten to lock the front door .
" When she saw us she shouted at us and then stormed out .
Then she came back and kept saying : ' It 's wrong , you should n't be doing this . '
Danielle adds : " When my husband came back , I knew I had to tell him before my mum did .
I said ' I do n't want to hurt you , I never wanted to hurt you , but I 'm in love with someone else . '
" I did n't have to tell him who .
He had already guessed .
He was almost eerily calm about it .
He did n't shout or make a scene .
He just told me eventually that if it never happened again , perhaps he could forgive me and take me back for the sake of our child . "
But Danielle did n't want him back .
Ignoring her marriage vows , the needs of her child , the disapproval of her family and the law , she decided she wanted her half - brother instead .
Today , she says she sees her daughter whenever she wants and that relations with her husband , whom she is divorcing , are amicable .
" When my daughter was born , I suffered so badly with post-natal depression that I found it difficult to bond with her , " she says .
" I still do n't feel we 've bonded properly .
When my husband moved out , he wanted to take her and I did n't object - perhaps I was in no position to do so .
I see her every day .
" She 's too young to understand what 's happened , and I do n't know how I 'll explain it to her when she grows up . "
Her feelings for Nick appear to be so all - consuming that they have obliterated every other consideration .
Nick says : " Our mother feels very strongly that what we are doing is wrong both morally and legally .
" My view is that we are trying to deal with a new and unnatural situation .
I do n't see things in terms of right and wrong , I see the circumstances surrounding it .
" We both know that had we grown up together we would have had a normal brother - sister relationship , but we did n't .
" People can say ' that should n't happen ' all they like , but it did and we want to understand the reasons why , because I do feel very confused .
" Sometimes I feel as if Danielle is my partner , other times that she 's my sister , other times almost as if she is a mother to me .
" So many times I have thought ' Surely , this can't be happening .
What 's going on here ? '
Until I met Danielle , I never knew what it was like to be so swept out of control by my emotions .
" She is my closest family and my natural family so it feels right being with her .
Then sometimes I feel divided in myself because she is my sister . "
Danielle adds : " Mum is always saying that she wishes she 'd never invited Nick back into our lives .
She thinks it was a huge mistake , but I do n't .
" I 'm really pleased she did .
If he'd been in our lives sooner perhaps this would n't have happened .
We knew what we were doing was against the law , though we never lied about it , and we were terrified of going to prison .
" But now that we have been banned from sleeping together , we are having to acknowledge that the sexual side of the relationship is over and that we can still live together without breaking the bond we have .
" People may be disgusted by what we have done .
People may say we are morally wrong and should have stayed away from each other , but we do n't want to .
I can't imagine life without Nick now . "
Long ago in Japan , human illness was commonly believed to be the work of tiny malevolent creatures inside the body .
Harikikigaki , a book of medical knowledge written in 1568 by a now - unknown resident of Osaka , introduces 63 of these creepy - crawlies and describes how to fight them with acupuncture and herbal remedies .
The Kyushu National Museum , which owns the original copy of Harikikgaki , claims the book played an important role in spreading traditional Chinese medicine in Japan .
Here are a few of the beasties found in the book .
Kanshaku
Kanshaku , an angry - faced bug found in the liver , aggravates its host by violently thrusting itself upward toward the chest cavity .
Infected people tend to shout with rage or engage in activities to blow off steam , and they crave acidic food and avoid eating oily food .
Acupuncture can stop Kanshaku .
Hizo - no - kesshaku , Kanmushi
Hizo - no - kesshaku causes problems with the spleen , but it can be cured by ingesting shazenji ( plantago seed ) .
Kanmushi is a harmful parasite that embeds itself in the spine , causing it to curve backward .
Infected people also develop an appetite for spicy food .
The herbs mokko ( Saussureae radix ) and byakujutsu ( Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz ) are effective in fighting off Kanmushi .
Gyochu , Haimushi
Gyochu , a deadly critter responsible for leprosy , acts as a messenger to the underworld .
On the night of Koshin - no - hi ( an important date occurring every 60 days on the Chinese calendar ) , Gyochu leaves the body to visit Enma - daio ( Lord of the Underworld ) and tell him of your misdeeds .
Enma -daio is known to punish people for bad behavior by reducing their remaining time on earth .
Haimushi , a creature with an appetite for rice , causes problems with the lungs .
If the Haimushi exits the lungs and cannot find its way back , it turns into a fiery will - o' - wisp ( hitodama ) and the person dies .
The herb byakujutsu is effective in warding off Haimushi .
Kagemushi
Male and female versions of the Kagemushi appear during sexual intercourse .
When the two bugs come together , their wiry legs get tangled up , the female bug spits up red fluid , and the male spits up white .
Hizo - no - kasamushi , Akuchu
Hizo - no - kasamushi , a worm found in the spleen , causes its host to gain or lose weight based on the amount of food it eats .
The herbs agi ( giant fennel ) and gajutsu ( purple turmeric ) are effective in controlling Hizo - no - kasamushi .
Akuchu , also found in the spleen , consumes rice eaten by the host .
Drinking mokko is an effective antidote .
Haishaku , Kakuran - no - mushi
Haishaku , a critter found in the upper lungs , has a nose that opens directly into its chest .
People infected with Haishaku hate pleasant smells and foul smells , but are fond of strong , fishy smells .
Other symptoms include extreme sadness and a craving for spicy food .
Gentle , shallow acupuncture is an effective treatment .
Kakuran - no - mushi , a worm with a black head and red body , invades the stomach and causes vomiting and diarrhea .
It is known to come up into the host 's mouth and poke its head out .
Try to grab it , and you choke for air , but let go and it returns peacefully to the stomach .
The herbs goshuyu ( Euodia rutaecarpa ) , shazenshi and mokko are useful in fighting Kakuran - no - mushi .
Umakan
Umakan , a beastie that causes heart problems , infects people outdoors in the scorching sun or in the vicinity of fire .
Acupuncture is an effective treatment .
Koseu
Koseu ( Kosho ) , a snake - like critter with a scruffy white beard , wears a hat that protects it from medicine .
It likes to drink sweet sake and it can speak .
Kameshaku
Kameshaku eats rice and wears an umbrella - like hat that blocks medicine .
It can be destroyed by eating wild beans .
Koshi - no - mushi
Koshi - no - mushi flies into a host 's body and makes its way to the lower back area , where it causes diarrhea , sweating and chest pains .
The herbs mokko and kanzo ( licorice root ) are an effective treatment .
Chishaku , Hizo - no - mushi
Chishaku ( Taibyo - no - kesshaku ) appears in the stomach after a severe illness .
It can be controlled by applying shukusha ( wild siamese cardamom ) .
Hizo - no - mushi is found in the spleen .
It causes dizziness and hot flashes when it grabs the host 's muscles with its long arms and claws .
It can be stopped by ingesting mokko and daio ( rhubarb ) .
Kiukan and Kishaku
Kiukan ( Gyukan ) lives in the chest and acts up at meal time .
This critter is difficult to get rid of , but acupuncture is an effective treatment .
Kishaku is a dark red beastie that causes its host to develop an unhealthy appetite for oily food .
It can be stopped by eating tiger stomach .
Jinshaku
Jinshaku ( Honton ) resembles a tiny boar that runs wild through the body .
Those infected with Jinshaku develop a weak pulse , a dark complexion , a craving for salty food , and bad breath .
Acupuncture is an effective treatment .
Hishaku , Hinosha
Hishaku is found in the spleen , most often in females .
Symptoms include an overpowering appetite for sweets , a yellowish complexion , and a tendency to hum .
It can be stopped with acupuncture around the navel .
Hinoshu , also found in the spleen , looks like a rock and remains dormant inside the body until the host visits a crowded sightseeing area , at which time Hinoshu causes dizziness by thrashing about and creating the sensation of rocks crashing against each other .
Acupuncture is an effective treatment .

The spirit of globalization fuels the gusto with which this Hindu - Muslim city celebrates Christmas — another British legacy — with colored lights festooning the streets , decorations on sale everywhere , and life - size Santa Clauses sculpted of mud and straw in the same workshops that produce the myriad Hindu gods .
On Christmas Eve , thousands of Calcuttans of different religions converge on St. Paul ’s , the British - built 19th - century Gothic cathedral , infusing the holiday with a cosmopolitan ambience .
The pace of change in Calcutta still is n’t on a par with that of China , but the city is headed in the same direction .
Shikha Mukerjee , who directs a nongovernmental organization and has spent her whole life in Calcutta , notes that the world of the leisurely wealthy , with their live - in servants , is disappearing , as the upper classes live a less secure , more frantic existence .
But Calcutta ’s middle class , which has always been here , has taken on greater visibility , thanks in part to its consumerist buying sprees .
According to a recent study by McKinsey & Company , discretionary spending by Indian consumers accounted for 52 percent of average household consumption in 2005 ( up from 39 percent in 1995 ) ; by 2025 , it will rise to 70 percent .
“ It ’s not the fancy malls , ” Mukerjee said , “ but the low - end centers that are the heart of the change — the people who have created jobs for themselves by altering clothes , fixing appliances , and so on .
I have a tailor who travels from an outlying slum area each day to occupy a particular place on the sidewalk with his sewing machine , where his clients come to him .
He ’s saving money , he told me .
That ’s what Calcutta is really about these days . ”
The pavement soup kitchens selling noodles and curry dishes testify to the rise of a lower middle class , up from abject poverty , that requires cheap meals during the workday .
The increase in family cars has led to the most - persistent traffic jams I have experienced in the developing world , worse even than Tehran ’s , Bangkok ’s , or Cairo’s .
URBAN MAKEOVER : Street barbers in the Kalighat neighborhood of Kolkata
Sealdah was my own private , childhood nightmare , ” Professor Sukanta Chaudhuri told me , referring to the railway station that in the late 1940s , after the partition of India , housed thousands of Hindu refugees from Muslim East Bengal , who had arrived in Calcutta destitute , with nowhere to go .
Even today , because it ’s the terminus for trains arriving from India ’s under - developed northeast , Sealdah remains unnerving , with its armies of people disgorged onto the platforms , fanning out amidst the other armies squatting with their suitcases on the station floor .
“ But you know what ? ” the gray - haired English professor said .
“ Most of those people , with little or no help from the government , settled themselves somewhere .
They did n’t just die or go begging . ”
The process continues today .
The Calcutta street , Chaudhuri and others explained , is less a dead end than a way station , just as shantytowns are in Turkey .
But since India is so much poorer than Turkey , the way station is that much harsher .
“ If you come back each decade , ” notes Chaudhuri , “ the poverty looks the same , so you think nothing has changed .
But the individuals on the street are different .
They come from Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Orissa , and Bangladesh , with no place to live , because on the streets you can earn something , save something , and move on . ”
Opportunity , as much as poverty , creates slums .
Indeed , if there is a trend in Calcutta ’s slums , it is the fitful transition — gentrification , in its own way — from kutcha ( mud ) and jhupri ( burlap and cardboard ) temporary housing to the more - permanent pucca housing , made of cement and corrugated iron .
Whole areas are changing their appearance , as Calcutta begins to look less like some subcontinental Dickensian nightmare and more like any other dynamic city with great disparities of wealth .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton apologized to a gathering of black newspaper publishers Wednesday for a top fundraiser 's controversial comments that Sen.
Barack Obama 's race has helped his candidacy .
The New York senator found herself in the hot seat after the remarks by Geraldine Ferraro -- a former New York congresswoman , Democratic vice presidential candidate and Clinton supporter .
" I rejected what she said and I certainly do repudiate it , " Clinton said at the National Newspaper Publishers Association meeting in Washington .
Ferraro resigned from the campaign Wednesday after widespread criticism over her comments about Obama 's race , originally published late last week in the Torrance , California , Daily Breeze .
" If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman , he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in the concept , " she said .
Watch analysts weigh in over Ferraro 's comments »
Clinton was asked about remarks her husband , former President Bill Clinton , made while on the trail for his wife in South Carolina last month in which he seemed to imply that Obama 's success in South Carolina would largely be based on his race .
" I 'm sorry if anyone was offended .
It certainly was not meant in anyway to be offensive , " she said .
She even apologized for President Bush 's lackluster response regarding Hurricane Katrina .
" I apologize and I am embarrassed that our federal government so mistreated our citizens . "
Her aides say this is not a mea culpa tour , but rather a clear message that she has not given up on the black vote .
" So the numbers are skewed and it appears that we are losing ground in the African American community .
She is not conceding that vote whatsoever , " a Clinton spokesperson said .
But looking ahead , she certainly has her work cut out for her .
While Obama has steadily seen his African American support grow -- 78 percent in South Carolina , 90 percent in Virginia and 92 percent in Mississippi -- Clinton has lost ground .
" They 're open to her , but at this point they 're kind of lukewarm because of the disparaging comments of some of her people , not necessarily hers , " said John Smith , chairman of the NNPA .
While Clinton tries to minimize the damage , she is leaning on loyalists like Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter .
High profile supporters will help , but Clinton needs votes to win and she will almost certainly campaign relentlessly to get them .

All About Hillary Clinton • African - American Issues • Elections and Voting
I came across this odd point in a blog post - Why I'm for Hillary and not Obama - yesterday : " On the issue of Iraq , again there are only a few variations on the same stance .
Let us dispense with the fact that Hillary voted to give authorization for the war . "
I do n't see why we should dispense with that fact .
Hillary , and everyone in my immediate family including me , was wrong about this .
The only opposition I heard back then was from a wise brother - in - law in Boston .
Obama was right .

Some years ago , I was looking for an apartment in Delhi .
I had just moved to India , and everything about it was frenzied and raw .
Every place I saw was either too pricey or noisy or prone to attack by flying cockroaches the size of small birds .
Finally I found a flat with heavy wooden doors and a terrace that overlooked a pleasant street .
The landlord , an imperious man with tufts of wiry black hair sprouting from his left ear , proudly pointed out the apartment ’s features , including Western - style toilets , air - conditioning ( a real luxury ) and , he added matter - of - factly , a “ servant . ”
I was n’t entirely comfortable with the way that sounded , but I ca n’t say I was shocked either .
I had been told that a great many people in India had servants ( or what Americans would call household help ) , and I figured this was the sort of cultural difference I had better get used to .
A few days later , the servant loped upstairs and reported for duty .
He was skinny , alarmingly so , with mahogany skin and sharp features .
His name was Kailash , and he was 11 years old .
This was a cultural difference that I was not prepared to accept .
I started downstairs to confront the landlord , but then hesitated .
I rationalized that if this boy , an orphan from a neighboring state , did n’t work for me , he would work for someone else , and who knows how that person would treat him ?
Washing my hands of Kailash seemed like a cop-out , or so I told myself .
And so every afternoon Kailash climbed the stairs and knocked meekly on my door .
He was , truth be told , not much of a cleaner : he did n’t remove the dirt ; he just rearranged it .
But he was naturally kind , honest beyond reproach and , it turned out , a wizard with temperamental fax machines and printers .
What is it about Michigan that seems to encourage assisted suicide ?
That is all I can think watching Michigan congressmen and senators , led by Representative John Dingell , doing their best imitations of Jack Kevorkian and once again trying to water down efforts by Congress to legislate improved mileage standards for Detroit in the latest draft energy bill .
Look , I get pork - barrel politics .
I understand senators from oil states protecting the windfall profits of oil companies .
Ditto for farm subsidies .
It ’s an old story : Protect my winnings , and I ’ll reward you with campaign contributions .
I get it .
I get it .
What I do n’t get is empty - barrel politics — Michigan lawmakers year after year shielding Detroit from pressure to innovate on higher mileage standards , even though Detroit ’s failure to sell more energy - efficient vehicles has clearly contributed to its brush with bankruptcy , its loss of market share to Toyota and Honda — whose fleets beat all U.S. automakers in fuel economy in 2007 — and its loss of jobs .
G.M. today has 73,000 working U.A.W. members , compared with 225,000 a decade ago .
Last year , Toyota overtook G.M. as the world ’s biggest automaker .
Thank you , Michigan delegation !
The people of Japan thank you as well .
But assisting Detroit ’s suicide seems to be contagious .
Everyone wants to get in on it , including Toyota .
Toyota , which pioneered the industry - leading , 50 - miles - per - gallon Prius hybrid , has joined with the Big Three U.S. automakers in lobbying against the tougher mileage standards in the Senate version of the draft energy bill .

( Fortune ) -- Hillary Clinton is no dummy .
Even her detractors know that .
And yet in last night 's Democratic presidential debate in Nevada , Clinton floated what is perhaps the dumbest solution to the current mortgage mess I 've heard from a top presidential contender .
" I have a plan - a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days [ and ] freezing interest rates for five years , which I think we should do immediately , " Clinton announced at what was the last Democratic debate before the Nevada Caucus on Jan. 19 .
A 90 - day moratorium on foreclosures would throw a lifeline to some deserving homeowners , though I suspect it would only delay the inevitable for most .
That 's not my beef .
Where Clinton goes awry is her proposal to freeze mortgage rates for five years , which is essentially a much broader version of a deal President Bush recently hammered out with lenders to assist some subprime borrowers .
If Clinton 's only goal were to bail out homeowners facing steep rate resets on adjustable mortgages , her plan would work just fine .
For everyone else though , such a freeze would be disastrous .
Interest rates on new mortgages would skyrocket - perhaps past 8 percent , as the mutual funds , pension funds and other investors who typically provide capital to the mortgage market shift their money into other investments where the government is n't impairing returns .
With higher mortgage rates eroding buying power , the downward pressure on home prices would only increase .
Lower home prices would lead to even more defaults , as more folks who'd lost the equity in their homes choose to walk away from their mortgages .
" It certainly would not speed the recovery of the housing market , " says Doug Duncan , chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association .
" The problem now is that investors are already worried about what the risks are , and ( a rate freeze ) would only widen risk premiums more . "
Then there 's the long - term impact such a bailout would have on behavior .
While Clinton 's plan would no doubt save some legitimate victims who were duped into taking out bad loans , she 'd also be saving the flippers and speculators who knew the risks of low teaser rate mortgages but figured ( wrongly ) that they could always sell their house for a profit if the reset mortgage rate proved unaffordable .
Bailing out these folks now would only encourage them to take even bigger risks down the line .
To be fair , John Edwards , has endorsed an even broader rate freeze - one lasting seven years - and he also wants to give homeowners the right to halt foreclosures if lenders have n't made a " good faith " effort ( whatever that means ) to rework the loan .
Edwards , however , seems a longshot to win the White House .
Barack Obama , meanwhile , wants to require better disclosure by lenders ( of low teaser rates , for example ) and , like Clinton and Edwards , proposes a government fund to help borrowers transition from unaffordable adjustable mortgages to lower - rate fixed ones .
When it comes to a rate freeze , Duncan and the Mortgage Bankers Association are n't exactly disinterested parties , of course .
A freeze would directly impact the bottom line of MBA members .
However , when I discussed Clinton 's plan with a more sympathetic economist - one who'd worked for Bill Clinton - his reaction was much like mine and Duncan's .
" This is an ugly correction , but it 's a necessary one , " says Jared Bernstein , senior economist with the liberal - leaning Economic Policy Institute .
" This kind of an idea is a little bit of untying your shoes with a buzz - saw . "
This release is available in French .
Imagine a gigantic , inflatable , sausage - like bag capable of storing 160 million tonnes of CO 2 - the equivalent of 2.2 days of current global emissions .
Now try to picture that container , measuring up to 100 metres in radius and several kilometres long , resting benignly on the seabed more than 3 kilometres below the ocean 's surface .
At first blush , this might appear like science fiction , but it's an idea that gets serious attention from Dr. David Keith , one of Canada 's foremost experts on carbon capture and sequestration .
Keith will talk on the subject at the 2008 Annual Conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston at a session entitled Ocean Iron Fertilization and Carbon Sequestration : Can the Oceans Save the Planet ?
" There are a lot of gee - whiz ideas for dealing with global warming that are really silly , " remarks Keith , an NSERC grantee and director of the Energy and Environmental Systems Group at University of Calgary - based Institute for Sustainable Energy , Environment and Economy .
" At first glance this idea looks nutty , but as one looks closer it seems that it might technically feasible with current - day technology . "
But , adds Keith , who holds the Canada Research Chair in Energy and the Environment , " it 's early days and there is not yet any serious design study for the concept . "
The original idea of ocean storage was conceived several years ago by Dr. Michael Pilson , a chemical oceanographer at the University of Rhode Island , but it really took off last year when Keith confirmed its feasibility with Dr. Andrew Palmer , a world - renowned ocean engineer at Cambridge University .
Keith , Palmer and another scientist at Argonne National Laboratory later advanced the concept through a technical paper prepared for the 26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering in June 2007 .
Keith sees this solution as a potentially useful complement to CO 2 storage in geological formations , particularly for CO 2 emanating from sources near deep oceans .
He believes it may offer a viable solution because vast flat plains cover huge areas of the deep oceans .
These abyssal plains have little life and are benign environments .
" If you stay away from the steep slopes from the continental shelves , they are a very quiet environment . "
For CO 2 to be stored there , the gas must be captured from power and industrial point sources , compressed to liquid , and transported via pipelines that extend well beyond the ocean 's continental shelves .
When the liquid CO 2 is pumped into the deep ocean , the intense pressure and cold temperatures make it negatively buoyant .
" This negative buoyancy is the key , " explains Keith .
" It means the CO 2 wants to leak downwards rather than moving up to the biosphere . "
The use of containment is necessary because CO 2 will tend to dissolve in the ocean , which could adversely impact marine ecosystems .
Fortunately , says Keith , the cost of containment is quite minimal with this solution .
He and his colleagues calculate that the bags can be constructed of existing polymers for less than four cents per tonne of carbon .
The real costs lie in the capture of CO 2 and its transport to the deep ocean .
" If we can drive those down , " he notes , " then ocean storage might be an important option for reducing CO 2 emissions . "

How the Fear of Losing My Job Helped Me to Grow
Note : This is a guest post by Karl Staib of Work Happy Now !
Working for a company that might be cutting jobs can force the energy right out of you if you do n't take some steps to set your perspective on the positive .
There are usually three perspectives that dictate our emotional outlook .
Relaxing in the now .
Imagining that things will get better .
The problem itself .
Out of the three options , which one do you think will only make problems worse ?
Maybe the question is a little too easy , but why do so many people keep doing it ?
Worrying is bad for your happiness
Worrying is a common habit that makes us feel like we are accomplishing something , when in reality we are only creating more fear .
Most of us have been in situations where we feel like we might lose our jobs because we do n't connect with the person that holds our fate in his / her hands .
There are three main ways people handle this situation .
Just keep going .
The select few just keep going about their day , trying their best and not feeling bothered by the day to day drama , knowing that any mistake that they have made is in the past and there is nothing they can do about it now .
Imagine how it will get better .
Another group of emotionally smart people see the problem and imagine how it will get better .
Their optimistic outlook helps them get through difficult situations .
They arenâ€™t any different than you and me , but they know that worrying only makes the situation worse .
Fret .
Then there is the majority of the people that fret until the situation passes .
I used to be in that fretting group .
I had a job that kept me on the fringes of being fired for a couple of weeks .
Every little mistake left this lingering feeling that today would be the day the HR manager would walk up to my cubicle and tell me , â€ œIâ€™m sorry to tell you that we are going to have to let you go .
Please gather your personal belongings so I can walk you out.â€ 
My stomach churned every time I walked through the entrance .
My sleep was sporadic throughout the night and all I wanted to do was quit .
I stayed on because I needed the money and that need outweighed any uncomfortable feelings .
There I was , caught in thoughts of worry .
I tried not caring , but that didnâ€™t work .
I tried the technique of imagining my work life getting better , even if it was only a five minute conversation at the copier with a co-worker .
That helped , but only to a certain level .
I was still feeling uneasy until I applied a little creative action .
As the days passed and I still had a job , I tried things to help keep my job .
I showed up a little earlier than usual .
I offered to do other peopleâ€™s work .
I came up with a youth outreach program at our closest high school .
The managers loved it .
I was back in the good graces of my manager , my co-workers and the other managers .
I always kept my resume updated and I sent it out every weekend .
The economy was n't doing well , so I had to stay with what I had , but it was an emotionally tough time .
By getting into the thick of my fear I learned two valuable lessons :
Help Others Achieve Their Goals
Use that fear , which is usually focused on what will happen to you , and allow that focus to help someone else .
When you are worried about making a mistake , you may be afraid to make good decisions .
Ask co-workers if you can help them with a project that they are working on .
By giving them your time , you are making yourself more useful and taking your focus off the fear .
You 'll be surprised at how people will react toward your kindness and your boss will want to keep someone that makes a difference in other people 's lives .
Create Action
By creating action out of your fear instead of waiting for the hammer to drop , you will be able to steer yourself out of trouble .
You may be on the cusp of being downsized , but do n't let that stop you from being active in your work .
When you keep yourself moving , you 'll be creating an environment that helps you stay focused on the moment instead of letting the fear take over .
Who knowsâ€¦ you may be able to inject some new life into your job and encourage management to keep you .
When you use your energy to focus on the fear , youâ€ ™re only increasing your awareness of the problem , which by default increases your worry .
By moving your energy toward something constructive you can reduce your worry and accomplish something important .

During the summer of 2002 , The Oprah Winfrey Show was graced by a visit from Ricky Williams , the Heisman Trophy holder and running back extraordinaire of the Miami Dolphins .
Williams was there to confess that he suffered from painful and chronic shyness .
Oprah and her audience were , of course , sympathetic .
If Williams , who had been anything but shy on the football field , was in private a wilting violet , how many anonymous citizens would say the same if they could only overcome their inhibition long enough to do so ?
To expose one ’s shyness to what Thoreau once called the broad , flapping American ear would itself count , one might think , as disproof of its actual sway over oneself .
But football fans knew that Ricky Williams was no voluble Joe Namath .
Nevertheless , there he was before the cameras , evidently risking an anxiety attack for the greater good — namely , the cause of encouraging fellow sufferers from shyness to come out of the closet , seek one another ’s support , and muster hope that a cure for their disability might soon be found .
Little of what we see on television , however , is quite what it seems .
Williams had an incentive — the usual one in our republic , money — for overmastering his bashfulness on that occasion .
The pharmaceutical corporation GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , through its public relations firm , Cohn & Wolfe , was paying him a still undisclosed sum , not to tout its antidepressant Paxil but simply to declare , to both Oprah and the press , “ I ’ve always been a shy person . ”
To understand why this was considered a worthwhile outlay , we need to know that the drug makers earn their enormous profits from a very few market - leading products for which new applications are continually sought .
If those uses do n’t turn up through experimentation or serendipity , they can be conjured by means of “ condition branding ” — that is , coaching the masses to believe that one of their usual if stressful states actually partakes of a disorder requiring medication .
A closely related term is more poetical : “ astroturfing , ” or the priming of a faux - grassroots movement from which a spontaneous - looking demand for the company ’s miracle cure will emanate .
In this instance Cohn & Wolfe , whose other clients have included Coca - Cola , Chevron Texaco , and Taco Bell , was using an athlete to help create a belief that shyness , a common trait that some societies associate with good manners and virtue , constitutes a deplorably neglected illness .
Given the altruistic aura of the occasion , it would have been tasteless to have Ricky Williams display a vial of Paxil on the spot .
But later ( before he was suspended from the football league for ingesting quite different drugs ) , a GSK press release placed his name beneath this boilerplate declaration :
As someone who has suffered from social anxiety disorder , I am so happy that new treatment options , like Paxil CR , are available today to help people with this condition .
There is nothing out of the ordinary in this episode , but that is just why it bears mentioning .
Most of us naively regard mental disturbances , …
今日のビジネス環境におけるソーシャルネットワーキングの重要性は、ここで言及するまでもないだろう。上手く使いこなせれば、自分の人脈の形成に活用したり、仕事に関する情報を事前にキャッチすることができるはずである。私同様にコンサルタント業で生計を立てている者であれば、この業種における収入の75から100％がネットワーキング活動に関係していることに得心してもらえるだろう。逆に言うとネットワーキング世界での立ち居振る舞いを誤ることは、業務上の手痛いしっぺ返しないしは致命的なダメージとして跳ね返ってくることを覚悟しておかなければならない。
ネットワーキング世界で自分がしでかした不始末のもたらす危険性に最も高く曝されているのは、いわゆるIT労働者である。コンピュータの相手をすることがメインの業務である人間は得てして対人関係が苦手であり、内気であるが故に自分の殻にこもったり、あるいはそうした自分を誤魔化すために他人に対しては威圧的な態度で接するといったケースがよく見られる。また、LinkedInやFacebookなどのソーシャルネットワーキングサイトでは、こうしたサイトが簡単に利用できて雰囲気も和やかであるため、いつもの職場であれば口外すべきでない発言をしてしまうIT労働者が散見されるが、ネットワーキングの初心者の場合は特にそうした罠に陥りやすい。
私の場合コンサルタントとして12年の活動経験があり、その間にネットワーキングにまつわる様々なトラブルを体験してきた。一口にIT労働者と言ってもその活動するフィールドは多岐にわたっているが、ここでは各分野で共通して見られる11種類の失敗を再確認することにする。これが教訓となって、読者諸兄がこうしたトラブルを回避することに役立てば幸いである。
1.他の企業や個人の中傷に走る
同じ業界で仕事をしている同業者だが毎日顔を合わす訳でもないという人間に出会った時くらい、日頃は我慢している上司（現在だけでなく過去の上役も含める）や取引先の企業に対する愚痴をこぼしたくなるのは人情というものかもしれない。だがそうした感情を公の場で発言するのは賢明な行為ではなく、特に採用面接に相当する場では控えるべきである。ネットワーキングの世界とはいえ、特定の人物や企業に対する痛烈な批判を聞かされた側の人間は、それが本当であるかを確かめたくなるものだからだ。またそうした批判をする自分は後ろ向きの見方しかできないネガティブな人間だという印象を与えることにもなる。
仮にそうした愚痴をこぼす相手が、過去に問題の企業や上司を相手にしたことのある被害者仲間であるならば、このような心配をする必要もないだろう。ただし最初に批判の口火を切ったのが相手側であったとしても、考えなしに迎合することは歓迎できない。そうした場合は、自分がネットワーキング活動に求めているのはフラストレーションのはけ口なのか、それとも人生を豊かにする社交活動なのかを自問してみればいいだろう。
2.許可なく第三者の名前を持ち出す
ソーシャルネットワーキングの楽しみの1つは、自分の人脈の広さを大っぴらに自慢できることにあるとも言えるだろう。だとしても第三者を知人や紹介人として持ち出すのは、当事者の許可を得てからにすべきである。
そもそも、そうした場合は当事者の承諾を求めるのが礼儀というものだろう。また外部からはうかがい知れない職場での人間関係的な理由があって、自分の名前を出すのは不都合だという場合もあるかもしれない。
ま たIT業界にしろその他の職種にしろ、世間は存外に狭いものであるため、自分が誰それと友人なり知人であるという発言は比較的簡単にチェックされてしまうものである。よってそれが虚偽の発言であった場合、実際この場合は自業自得とはいえ、周囲の人間からは嘘つき呼ばわりされることになるだろう。
3.自分の人脈を誇張して語る
自分の持つ人脈を過度に誇張することは、許可なく第三者の名前を持ち出した場合と同様の結果を招く危険性がある。確かにLinus Torvalds 氏 やAndrew Morton氏といった業界の著名人と個人的な付き合いがあることを臭わせれば、希望する職場への就職面接にこぎつけるチャンスは高くなるだろうが、その付き合いの実態が2年も昔に電子メールを1度交換しただけの関係でしかなかった場合、その事実が露見した暁には、嘘つきないしは誇大妄想患者との烙印が自分に押されることになるだろう。
4.露骨な求職活動を展開する
転職情報を目的としてネットワーキング活動をする場合であっても、あからさまに仕事を求めるような発言をしないというのは暗黙のルールである。そんなものは現実を無視した建て前であると感じられるかもしれないが、少し考えてみれば、この暗黙のルールにもそれなりの意味があることが分かるだろう。そもそもネットワーキングの世界は、個人的な接触のできる非公式な場として成立しているのだが、それはビジネスの現場が個人的な接触を遠慮すべき公式な場であることの裏返しだからでもある。そうしたことを踏まえずに仕事を求めるあからさまな発言をするのは、場の雰囲気を乱す行為でもあり、周囲から空気の読めない鈍感者と見なされても仕方がないのだ。
また他人の目からすると、そうした行為に走る者は、自分が欲しいものだけを求めてネットワーキング活動をしている人間だと映りかねない。職探しをしている自分にとっては効率性を追及した上での発言であったかもしれないが、周囲の人々にとっては、個人的な交友を結ぶ意欲のないメンバの1人だと受け止められるはずである。そうした反応はごく自然のことであり、例えばあなた自身、身勝手な目的で自分に接触を求めてきた人間には愛想良く応対しようとは思わないだろう。
5.相手からの返答をスパムメールのごとく求める
マーケッティングの世界では質より量的なテクニックが功を奏するかもしれないが、ネットワーキングはその対極に位置する世界である。こうしたコミュニケーションの質が問われる環境にて助言を求める場合、人海戦術的な攻勢に出ることは逆効果にしかならない。人間どうしの信頼関係を育成しようともせず、知り合いに片っ端から質問をぶつけるという態度を取ることは、ネットワーキングの世界を匿名で生きようとする行為に他ならず、そうした人物について大多数の人間は、自分に用のない連中はどれも群衆の1人に過ぎないとしか見ていない奴だという不快な気持ちを抱くはずだ。
また広告業界での経験に長けた人間からの善意の助言として、要件を絞り込んだメッセージを送ることは網にかかるまでの時間が長いかもしれないが、スパムメール的な乱れ撃ちをするより最終的にはいい結果が得られるものだという見解を耳にしたことはないだろうか。ネットワーキングの世界でも、その本来のあり方を尊重すれば、それは自分自身のメリットとして跳ね返ってくるはずである。
6.ネットワーキング活動を消極的なものでお茶を濁す
中年世代によるソーシャルネットワーキングの利用が広まるに従い、Facebookなどのサイトも仕事関係の人脈形成の場としての色合いを強めている。また一方でRyze.comのように、設立当初からビジネス活動を目的としたネットワーキングが存在しているのも事実だ。
だがどのようなサイトにしろ、ユーザ登録から何年経っていても、その間に行ったコミュニケーションは数えられるほどでしかないという人間が多数存在しているはずだ。ネットワーキングサイトへの登録作業そのものは数分で済む作業だが、この種のユーザはそれだけの時間を無駄に費やしたことになる。私も、こうしたサイトは役立たないと繰り返し不満をぶつけてくるユーザを知っているが、そもそもが自分で使用しなければ有効に活用できないのは物事の道理ではないだろうか？
ネットワーキングにも様々な活動形態があるが、いずれにせよ自分から積極的に参加しなければ実りある成果を得ることはできない。ネットワーキング世界でもある程度広い人脈を形成した後でないと、見知らぬ人間どうしが友人としての相談を持ちかけられるようにはなれないものである。実生活を破綻させるほどネットワーキング活動に身を入れる必要はないが、お茶を濁す程度の参加しかしない人間は、見返りもそれだけのものしか得られないということを心得ておくべきだろう。
7.ネットワーキング世界で求められた要請に考えなしで応じる
ソーシャルネットワーキングサイトに登録すると、見知らぬ人間へのコンタクトや、一緒に働いた経験もない人間への助言を求められる場面に遭遇するものである。こうした求めに応じることを契機に人脈を広げようというのは誰でも感じる誘惑であろうが、無節操に応じることで相応の見返りを得られると期待してはいけない。
ネットワーキング世界の住人は、自分に適さない役割を引き受けてしゃしゃり出る人間のことを実に敏感に嗅ぎ分けるものである。そもそも相手の人物像を知らなければ、お互いに有益な関係を築けそうなものか、あるいは自分が付き合っていけるタイプの人間であるかを考える術がないはずだ。また往々にして、見知らぬ相手への助言を求められるという事態は、自分の人間関係を誇張した結果に自業自得的に訪れるものである（前述の項目を参照）。
8.交友関係の維持に心を尽くさない
交友関係の成立はネットワーキング活動における単なる最初の一歩に過ぎないのであるが、その辺を誤解している人間が多数存在している。ネットワーキング活動を長く継続していけば行くほど、相互に役立つ意見を交換する機会が増えることで信頼関係が育成され、双方にとってより有益な関係にと成長するものである。逆に交友関係が成立しただけの時点で立ち止まってしまうことは、必要があれば相手側からコンタクトを求めてくるだろうという態度を決め込む場合と五十歩百歩程度の違いしかないとも言えよう。結局のところネットワーキングを有効に活用するには、自分から積極的に行動するのが不可欠なのである。
9.他人の時間を無駄にさせても何ら気に病まない
ネットワーキング活動をしていると、自分とのやり取りをしている相手は他にもやるべき仕事を抱えているのだということが、当たり前の前提として考えられるようになるものだ。そしてこれは今から職探しに使用しようとする場合に特に当てはまることであるが、他人の手を煩わす行為をこちらから持ちかけることは可能な限り慎むべきであり、また本来の関係から逸脱した要件を求めるのも避けるべきである。例えば知り合ったばかりの相手でも、間近に迫ったコンファレンスの案内を転送してもらうよう頼むくらいは問題ないはずだが、自分専用にRubyの個人レッスンをしてくれと頼むのは無理があるはずだ。
私の経験においても同業者の1人から、彼女の会社の空ポストを埋める適当な人材の紹介を頼まれたことがある。それに応じて私は何人かの適任者を探して、その中から1名を推薦した。ところがその数日後、彼女からその求人案件は人材企業に依頼することに決めたとの連絡が告げられたのだ。つまり私および推薦した人物は、数時間分の作業を無為に費やしたことになる。貧乏くじを引かされた私たち2人は、この同業者からの相談事は今後慎重に検討する必要があるという点でお互いに納得し、失礼な扱いを受けたものだとの思いを共有することになった。
10.交友関係を壊しかねない行為に走る
これはまた別の企業での求人に関係して昨年の夏に経験した出来事だが、知人の1人に対して、そこでのポストの空き状況について仲介すると約束したことがあった。そして1週間も経つとこの知人は私に向けて、毎日の電子メールと1日おきの電話とで連絡を求めてくるようになったのである。その求人案件に関して私は何らの影響力を行使できる立場にはなく、単なる仲介者の1人に過ぎなかったため、この知人には最終的な決定が遅れているようだと告げることしかできなかった。1度彼の代わりに進捗状況を問い合わせたこともあったが、最終的にこの知人に対しては頻繁なアクセスを控えてくれるよう頼んだところ、気分を損なった同氏は、その後二度と連絡を入れてくることもなくなってしまった。共通の知人からその後知らされたところでは、私が彼の信頼に応えられなかったと、本人自身は思っていたそうだ。
この件で失望していたとしても、それはこの人物自身の責任というものであろう。自分にとって役立つ可能性のあった人的チャンネルの1つを、過剰な行為に走ることによって、彼は自分で失ったのである。
この事例を他山の石として自分の身に降りかからないようにするには、自分から出した請求についてのフォローアップは必要最小限に留めておくことだ。明確なデッドラインの設定されていない案件であれば、1週間に1度程度の問い合わせ頻度で充分であろう。そして数週間経っても最終的な返信がもらえなければ、今回は縁がなかったものと覚悟を決めることも肝心である。
11.一方通行的なネットワーキングの使用法をする
ネットワーキング活動を有効に活用するには、お互いに有益なものを提供し合うことである。よって、自分に役立つものを提供してもらいたければ、自分から進んで相手の助けになるよう努めなくてはならない。例えば自分に求められた助言や紹介を無視したり、私の同業者の1人がそうであったように何かと理由を付けて断り続けることは、自分の役に立ってくれるかもしれない周囲の人間を徐々に失っていくことになる。同様に、自分からは手間のかかる多数の要請を出しておいて、数の上では同数とはいえ、質的にはごく些細な返礼しかしなかった場合も、結果は同じことである。
ネットワーキング世界の場合、好意に対する返礼は必ずしもその場で目に見える形で示す必要はない。むしろそうした形式ではやり取りしない方が普通だと言えるだろう。この世界の住人は、自分が誰かの役に立つ行為をした分だけ、いつか何処かで同じ分量の支援を相手に求められるだけの権利を獲得したと考えるものなのである。そうした考えを尊重することこそが、ネットワーキング世界での正しい生き方だとも言えよう。
まとめ
本稿で解説した数々の失敗を自分が犯さないようにする最善の方法は、己の行為は周囲の人々にどう映るべきかというイメージを常に意識し続けることかもしれない。自分の言葉遣いや行動を仲間達がどう受け止めるかを自問するように心がけることは、こうした失敗を回避できるだけでなく、ネットワーキング活動を実り豊かなものとする第一歩となるはずだ。
ITManagersJournal.com 原文
For “ Harry Potter ” and Hollywood , eight is the magic number .
Warner Bros .
Pictures and the producers behind the $ 4.5 - billion film franchise featuring the beloved boy wizard will split the seventh and final novel in the J.K.
Rowling series into two films .
“ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part I ” will hit theaters in November 2010 , followed by “ Part II ” in May 2011 , a decision that is being met around the world with fans ’ cheers but also plenty of cynical smirks .
The publishing industry is learning to live without new “ Potter ” releases , but Hollywood just pulled off a trick that will keep its profitable hero on his broom into the next decade .
Any twist in the “ Potter ” universe is the stuff of global news bulletins .
The books were a publishing sensation .
And to an entire generation , the film saga has become a heartfelt touchstone on the level of “ The Wizard of Oz ” and as culturally and commercially ubiquitous as the “ Star Wars ” series .
For all those reasons , everyone involved in the franchise is jumping forward to say an eighth film would be to serve the story , not the bottom line .
Daniel Radcliffe , the star of the franchise , said it was the dense action of the final novel that made the decision , not any executive or ledger .
“ I think it ’s the only way you can do it , without cutting out a huge portion of the book , ” Radcliffe said .
“ There have been compartmentalized subplots in the other books that have made them easier to cut -- although those cuts were still to the horror of some fans -- but the seventh book does n’t really have any subplots .
It ’s one driving , pounding story from the word go . ”
The same could be said about the relentless “ Potter ” franchise , which hit screens for the first time in 2001 .
The five “ Potter ” films to date have averaged $ 282 million in U.S. grosses , but the overall receipts go well beyond that .
The faces of the stars stare out from DVDs , video games , tie - in books , toys , clothing , candy wrappers and a staggering array of other items .
By some estimates , the brand represents a $ 20 - billion enterprise , and that ’s without the planned “ Potter " - themed complex opening next year at the Universal Orlando Resort in Florida .
Extending the “ Potter ” franchise is a boon to the studio and to its parent , media giant Time Warner , where recently named Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes is reining in costs with moves such as the recent gutting of New Line Cinema .
Time Warner ’s stock price has stagnated since its merger with America Online eight years ago .
Right now , Radcliffe and his costars are filming the sixth installment in the franchise , “ Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , ” at an old aircraft factory outside London .
“ It ’s been brilliant , ” Radcliffe said of the production .
“ It ’s also , I think , the funniest of the films so far . ”
Radcliffe is now 18 and , by the final film , will have spent half of his life in the role of the scarred orphan who finds friendship and danger within the stone corridors of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .
Each film ( following the construct of the novels ) has been framed by a school year .
Producer David Heyman , a key figure in the films from Day One , was reluctant to depart from that and make the last book into two movies .
“ Unlike every other book , you cannot remove elements of this book , ” Heyman said .
“ You can remove scenes of Ron playing Quidditch from the fifth book , and you can remove Hermione and S.P.E.W. [ Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare ] and those subplots . . . but with the seventh , that ca n’t be done . ”
Rowling , who signed off on the idea of a two - part finale , has been a more frequent visitor to the sixth movie ’s set than with previous installments .
One big reason is that she is no longer busy trying to finish the “ next ” “ Potter ” book ; she walked away from her signature character in July , when the climactic “ Deathly Hallows ” hit stores and sold a record 11 million copies in its first 24 hours on shelves .
Alan Horn , president and chief operating officer of Warner Bros .
Entertainment , will be in Las Vegas today to talk up the “ Potter ” plans at ShoWest , a key annual conference of movie exhibitors .
Horn said Wednesday that “ it would have been a disservice ” to downsize “ Deathly Hallows ” into one film .
“ This way , we have an extra hour and a half , at least , to celebrate what this franchise has been and do justice to all the words and ideas that Jo has put in the amazing story , ” Horn said .
“ This is the end of the story too .
We want to celebrate it .
We want to give a full meal . ”
David Yates , director of the fifth and sixth films , will return and make the final two films concurrently .
Screenwriter Steve Kloves also returns , and , by the completion of the franchise , he will have written seven of the eight films .
They will be adapting a seventh book with 759 pages packed with action and twists and turns in the race toward the final conflict between Potter and the dark lord who murdered his parents , the serpentine Lord Voldemort .
Reviewing last summer for The Times , Mary McNamara wrote : “ What Rowling has achieved in this book and the series can be described only as astonishing .
Just as her characters have matured , the language and tone of the books have grown in sophistication and lyricism .
But she has never lost the sense of wonder that has propelled her into literary legend . ”
After the dust settles , the book ends with an epilogue that finds the main characters -- Harry , Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley -- grown up , married and 19 years removed from Hogwarts .
Horn said that particular denouement has the filmmakers fretting about how to keep the young familiar stars on the screen just before it goes dark .
“ That , ” Horn said , “ is something we will need to deal with .
People have watched these kids grow up , and it ’s been very special to do so .
That ’s important to us . ”
Heyman said splitting “ Deathly Hallows ” is the right narrative formula , but the next problem is figuring out the division .
As he put it : “ The question will be , where do you break it ?
And how do you make them one but two separate and distinct stories ?
Do you break it with a moment of suspense or one of resolution ? ”
Horn said that screenwriter Kloves has already latched on to an approach that might work .
Rowling could not be reached for comment , but the most recent entry on her website journal declared that “ Hallows ” stands as her favorite among the novels -- and that saying goodbye to Harry is never easy .
“ It was the ending I had planned for 17 years , and there was more satisfaction than you can probably imagine in finally sharing it with my readers , ” Rowling wrote .
“ As for mourning Harry -- and I doubt I will be believed when I say this -- nobody can have felt the end as deeply as I did . ”

LONDON , Feb 25 ( Reuters ) - Global investment banking fees hit a record $ 84.3 billion in 2007 , helping offset the losses many banks suffered on business related to high - risk U.S. home loans , a London financial services body said on Monday .
Half of the fees , which were up 21 percent on 2006 , came from merger and acquisition advisory , with the rest earned through equity and fixed income underwriting , said International Financial Services London ( IFSL ) .
More than half of total investment banking fees were generated in the U.S. market and just over a third in Europe , Middle East and Africa .
Investment banks reported losses of $ 130 billion on their exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages up to the end of January , IFSL said .
“ Many investment banks are likely to experience further losses in 2008 on their investments in assets backed by subprime mortgages , ” the industry body said in its banking report .

Social factors may be key
The age of the mother has been linked to birth problems , but the Canadian researchers do not know why a younger dad might have an impact .
Specialists from the UK said that teenage fathers were generally less affluent , and might offer less emotional support to their partner .
The study , of 2.6 million mothers , features in Human Reproduction .
The magnitude of the risks to society could be huge , given the number of births worldwide , if the increases we found are truly attributable to paternal age
Professor Shi Wu Wen
University of Ottawa
All the women were aged between 20 and 29 when they gave birth , and the fathers divided into age groups , so that the babies of teenage dads could be compared with those fathered by older men .
Men aged 20 and upwards did not show any abnormal risk of fathering a child with birth problems .
However , the teenagers had a 13 % increased chance of a low birthweight baby , a 17 % chance of a small baby and a 15 % increased chance of having a baby born prematurely .
The chances of a baby dying within the first year also increased by 41 % .
Biological debate
Professor Shi Wu Wen , from the University of Ottawa who led the study , said the findings " warranted further investigation " .
" The magnitude of the risks to society could be huge , given the number of births worldwide , if the increases we found are truly attributable to paternal age . "
He could not rule out a biological difference in younger men which might be contributing , but said there were more obvious societal reasons .
A far more convincing explanation for the finding in this study is that older men are simply better able to provide for their pregnant partners than younger fathers
Dr Allan Pacey
British Fertility Society
" Young fathers are more likely to come from economically disadvantages families and to have lower educational attainment , " he said .
" People from less affluent backgrounds are less likely to utilise prenatal care services . "
Dr Susan Bewley , a consultant obstetrician and researcher at Kings College London , said social factors were more likely to be the reason .
" The question is how good a father can you be when you are a very young person ?
It 's far harder to be a good provider when you are that age .
" It 's also possible that a younger father will not offer the same kind of emotional support to a mother . "
Dr Allan Pacey , Senior Lecturer in Andrology at the University of Sheffield and Secretary of the British Fertility Society , said that anything suggesting that younger men's sperm was causing the problem " bucked the trend " of many other studies .
" A far more convincing explanation for the finding in this study is that older men are simply better able to provide for their pregnant partners than younger fathers .
" It makes sense that babies born to older fathers probably have a better start to life . "
ANN : Mac installer pkg for GHC - 6.8.2.20080211 trial release ( Leopard , Intel )
Ladies and Gentlemen , Finally , you can have the glorious GHC in a format satisfying the discerning Mac user : http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/GHC-6.8.2.20080211-i386.pkg
Installation instructions : nil
This is * not* the same compiler as in the official 6.8.2 release .
It is the state of the 6.8 branch at the 11th of February - hence , the funny version number .
Once , 6.8.3 is being released , there 'll be a clean release package .
The package includes all extra libraries and full documentation .
It installs GHC systemwide and requires an admin password .
Happy Installing !
Manuel -=- Extra details for the curious -=- GHC is being packaged as a framework bundle - GHC .
framework - that is installed in / Library / Frameworks / .
As far as I can tell this is the most appropriate way of bundling a compiler environment on the Mac .
Frameworks are versioned and we use GHC 's integer version number to assign framework versions - ie , the present package installs version 608 .
This is in line with Apple 's recommendation to use version numbers that signify API changes for frameworks .
The package installs appropriate links in /usr / bin , /usr / man / man1 , and /usr / share / doc to make the binaries , ghc manpage , and html documentation easily accessible .
Furthermore , it comes with a shell script that removes the GHC .
framework and all symbolic links into the framework .
The framework is currently not relocatable and an admin password is needed to install it .
Contributions improving this situation would be most welcome .
The GHC binary in the package links statically against GNU readline ( to provide editing capabilities at the GHCi prompt ) .
This is fine as GHC 's BSD3 licence is compatible with readline 's GPL , and it does * not* affect programs compiled with GHC at all .
The above package is for Intel Leopard .
I expect that a separate PPC version is easy to build ( but cross- compilation and fat binaries are not supported by GHC ) .
I am less sure about building packages on Tiger as I do n't know whether the underlying Xcode project requires Xcode 3.0 - Tiger only has 2.5 .
However , it should be possible to build packages on Leopard that run on both Tiger and Leopard .
( I could give that a try if anybody with a Tiger box is willing to play guinea pig . )
Further information on GHC installer packages as well as instructions on how to build your own are at http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/MacOSX/Installer
In a previous
CD post ,
I wrote about the relative affordability of today 's $ 3 gasoline , measured as share of disposable income .
After the Federal Reserve released data today on third quarter household net worth ( $ 528,000 per household ) , I thought it would be interesting to look at the cost of gasoline as share of per- capita household net worth .
Using data on
household net worth
from the Federal Reserve , historical
gasoline price data
from the EIA , and population data from
Economagic
, the graph above show the historical series of 1,000 gallons of gasoline purchased at the average retail price in a given year , as a share of per- capita " household new worth " in that year .
In 1949 , the retail price of gas was only 27 cents , but it took 4.2 % of per- capita new worth to purchase 1,000 gallons of gas , making gasoline almost three times as expensive then compared to today , when it only takes 1.44 % of per- capita net worth to buy 1,000 gallons of gas at $ 3 .
To be as expensive as gas in 1981 , measured as the cost per 1,000 gallons as a share of per- capita net worth , gasoline today would have to sell for about $ 6.50 per gallon .
It 's once again time for New Year 's resolutions — the time of year when we solemnly vow to eat right , exercise , save more than we spend , and be nicer to the people around us ( at least for a few days ) .
Fortunately , the editors at the Journal of the American Medical Association were nice enough to provide us with a New Year 's resolution holiday gift : a newstudy that says it 's not so bad to be a bit overweight , as long you 're in goodshape .
This study , led by Xuemei Sui of the University of South Carolina , followed 2,600 people over the age of 60 for an average of 12 years .
The authors looked at overall fitness ( measured by treadmill testing ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , and other measurements such as waist circumference and body - fat percentage .
They then investigated which of these was most important in predicting survival .
What they found struck a blow for common sense — and for the occasional holiday cookie .
It was a person 's level of fitness , not his or her BMI , that was associated with the lowest mortality over the 12 - year study .
In fact , people in the lowest 20 percent of physical fitness had more than twice the risk of dying , compared with people who were walking as little as 30 minutes a day , five days a week .
BMI also predicted mortality , but only for people who were severely overweight .
And in more good news for the occasionally overindulgent , mortality was about the same for people in the thin and overweight ( but not obese ) categories .
One of my favorite pieces of advice for patients is to try to be as fit as they can .
Studies like this show that even modest steps in this direction can have big payoffs .
McCain mulled party switch as recently as ’01
Josh Marshall noted this morning , ” I was wondering when this would come up .
As a lot of us remember , John McCain was very close to leaving the Republican party in 2001 and becoming either a Democrat or , much more likely , an independent a la Jim Jeffords who would caucus with the Democrats .
The Hill gives the story another shake and talks to folks like Daschle and others who were in on the negotiations . ”
The funny thing is , The Hill has n’t really given the story another shake ; it ’s just that the story from last March has suddenly been re-discovered by political observers .
Mitt Romney began emphasizing this over the last week , and slowly but surely , it ’s apparently gaining traction .
To be sure , it seems like the kind of story that could undermine McCain ’s bid quite a bit .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) was close to leaving the Republican Party in 2001 , weeks before then - Sen .
Jim Jeffords ( Vt. ) famously announced his decision to become an Independent , according to former Democratic lawmakers who say they were involved in the discussions .
In interviews with The Hill this month , former Sen. Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) and ex-Rep .
Tom Downey ( D - N.Y. ) said there were nearly two months of talks with the maverick lawmaker following an approach by John Weaver , McCain ’s chief political strategist .
Democrats had contacted Jeffords and then - Sen. Lincoln Chafee ( R - R.I. ) in the early months of 2001 about switching parties , but in McCain ’s case , they said , it was McCain ’s top strategist who came to them .
( emphasis added )
According to the story in The Hill , Weaver asked Daschle and Downey in March 2001 why Democrats had n’t reached out to McCain to switch parties .
“ Well , if the right people asked him , ” Weaver said , according to Downey , adding that he responded , “ The calls will be made .
Who do you want ? ”
After the lunch , Downey immediately contacted Daschle , who initiated a series of conversations with McCain about how to execute a party switch , including issues such as committee assignments and seniority .
Other Dem senators involved with the discussions confirmed these events .
So , what happened ?
Vermont ’s Jim Jeffords , one of three Republican senators Dems urged to switch , left the GOP and gave control of the chamber to Dems .
At that point , Chafee and McCain then broke off their discussions .
Is the story true ?
McCain denies ever having considered caucusing with Dems , but the story is hard to dismiss out of hand .
Indeed , Downey and Daschle had little reason to make up the story 10 months ago , when it initially ran .
Indeed , Downey denied any political motivation , saying he is still friends with Weaver and “ deeply respects ” McCain .
“ I would have been happy to come forward last year or the year before if someone had asked …
There were meetings in offices .
You ca n’t deny [ these meetings took place ] .
They occurred . ”
Downey added , “ It ’s my hope that John McCain is the Republican nominee because from my perspective , although I think Democrats are going to win , if they do n’t , McCain is the sort of man I would feel comfortable [ with ] as the president of the United States .
I ’m not trying to hurt him . ”
What ’s more , if the point of this story was to undermine McCain ’s campaign , it would n’t leak in March 2007 ; it would leak much later , during the heat of the campaign .
Such as , you know , now .
Nevertheless , conservatives , many of whom forgot about this story months ago , are starting to pick up on it again .
Will McCain finally face questions about what transpired ?
Will Republican voters care ?
Will the media ?
I guess we ’ll find out soon .

GCC 4.3.0 Released
From : Jakub Jelinek < jakub at redhat dot com >
To : gcc-announce at gcc dot gnu dot org
Date : Mon , 10 Mar 2008 06:21:34 -0400
Subject : GCC 4.3.0 Released
Reply - to : Jakub Jelinek < jakub at redhat dot com >
GCC 4.3.0 has been released .
GCC 4.3.0 is a major release , containing substantial new functionality not available in GCC 4.2.x or previous GCC releases .
See : http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html for more information about changes in GCC 4.3.0 .
This release is available from the FTP servers listed here : http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html
The release is in gcc / gcc - 4.3.0 / subdirectory .
There is one important caveat .
It was discovered after the final release has been made that some OS kernels on i?86 and x86_64 architectures violate the processor specific ABI with regards to the DF flag , if a process is interrupted with a signal while doing overlapping memmove or running some other code with DF flag set , the signal handler might be started with DF flag set on entry to the signal handler .
GCC 4.3.0 no longer emits cld instructions unnecessarily , so GCC 4.3.0 compiled async signal handlers or functions the signal handlers call that rely on DF flag being cleared might misbehave .
This will be hopefully fixed in the kernels soon and future GCC releases might provide an optional workaround for this bug .
Fixes for some systems : Linux http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=e40cd10ccff3d9fbffd57b93780bee4b7b9bff51
FreeBSD http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=121422
Hurd http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2008-03/msg00020.html
If you encounter difficulties using GCC 4.3 , please do not contact me directly .
Instead , please visit http://gcc.gnu.org for information about getting help .
As always , a vast number of people contributed to this GCC releases -- far too many to thank individually !

We keep hearing certain words � " democracy " is one , " terrorism " is another -- that are seldom defined .
The pretense is that we all know what these words mean .
Yet that �s hardly the case .
Here�s how the U.S. State Department defines terrorism : the use of violence or the threat of violence to harm or intimidate civilians for political purposes .
Given all the commentary out there about terrorism , you�d think this pithy definition might often be invoked .
It seldom is .
Why ?
Because applying that definition evenhandedly � to assess each violent episode or campaign , regardless of who perpetrates it -- would boomerang .
It would expose terrorists who usually aren�t thought of as terrorists .
Retail terrorism � like abduction or suicide bombing � is a tactic of the hardware have - nots .
It gets all the attention .
Wholesale terrorism � invasion and aerial warfare , for example � is the strategy of the haves .
It has a bigger budget and cuts a huger swathe .
By some magic consensus wholesale terrorism never , never gets called terrorism .
Now , the State Department definition is pretty good .
But it needs to make clear that terrorists use all levels of technology .
A box cutter can perpetrate terrorism ; so can a " smart " bomb .
Just because it�s high tech doesn�t mean it is n�t terrorism .
Terrorism need not target civilians directly .
Often it targets the infrastructure that sustains human life � hospitals , electrical grids , water purification and sewage systems , etc .
In the U.S. we assume only the other guys use terrorism � never our side .
Judging by our media and our politicians , terrorists are only those who oppose powerful military machines .
Even if those terrorists are defending their land .
With the fall of the Soviet Union , our military industrial complex no longer has its bogeyman .
These days instead of the Red Menace , Swarthy Terrorists are the enemy .
For U.S. people 9/11 was the watershed , the iconic , terrorist event .
This serves the neo-conservative world - dominating agenda .
9/11 was the neo-cons� answered prayer , their Pearl Harbor and Gulf of Tonkin .
A frightened public is so much easier to mobilize for a bellicose , expansionistic foreign policy .
Such policy � and the lies promoting it -- led the U.S. into the Iraq quagmire and back into the civilian massacring business .
In a further victory for the neo -con agenda , the so - called war on terror erodes civil liberties here at home .
Further , it erodes our quality of life .
The war on terror diverts resources from health , education and other human needs to the military .
Military adventurism makes us less safe .
It generates even more fear .
In a self - perpetuating cycle , war spawns further terrorism : reactive terrorism .
So does military occupation , whether in Afghanistan , Iraq or Palestine .
In the past century most war dead were civilians .
They were victims of terrorism � not in the mainstream media sense , but in the U.S. State Department sense .
Tens of millions of civilians have been killed by bullets , shells , missiles , cluster bombs and , in Iraq , many are also being killed by toxic and radioactive depleted uranium .
Depleted uranium is just one of kind of nuclear weapon .
As the world learned at Hiroshima , Nukes don�t distinguish civilian from military .
Nuclear blackmail has been with us for over 60 years .
Some nations stockpile nuclear weapons .
( Remember , the threat of violence is also terrorism . )
These devices are delivered by artillery or aircraft which few " terrorists " have access to .
One might say aerial warfare by its very nature is terrorist .
Militarism , of course , yields enormous corporate profits .
These days war profiteering is rife .
Some of these profits finance the purchase of TV networks and other corporate sources of news .
For example , the war and nuclear contractor , General Electric , owns NBC .
Might that ( little publicized ) fact affect how NBC News reports on terror ?
In our democracy another slice of the profits goes to finance the election campaigns of the candidates who favor warlike rather than diplomatic solutions to international issues .
Although NBC
News et al. are too discrete to mention it , a leading presidential candidate , a former Viet Nam bomber pilot , was a wholesale terrorist .
What does that say about our rulers ?
What does that say about us ?

Your Big Fat Election Brain Dump , 1/11/08
Because I have n’t pissed you guys off enough recently , that ’s why .
* I was asked just before the New Hampshire primary who I was voting for , which confused me , because I do n’t live in New Hampshire ; Ohio ’s primary is n’t until March 4 .
Even then , I ’m not going to be voting for a presidential candidate in Ohio ’s primary , because it ’s a closed primary and I ’ve been registered as an independent for as long as I ’ve been voting .
No soup for me .
But this does n’t particularly worry me .
In a matchup , I ’ll take any of the top Democratic contenders over any of the top Republican contenders , because aside from the fact that there are no Republican candidates who I have any interest in voting for ( I find McCain the most congenial to me philosophically and the only one who , should he win , wo n’t have me looking somewhat wistfully at the New Zealand immigration site to see if I have enough points to qualify ) , there ’s also the simple fact that no Republican administration is going to be as motivated as a Democratic one to stop doing all the fucktarded things the Bush Administration has done over the course of the last seven years .
Sorry , guys , the dude has trashed your brand .
I ’m not going to go so far as to say that if the Democrats nominated a circus bear I ’d vote for it over any GOP candidate , although I probably would vote for a circus bear over , say , Huckabee , because the bear would almost certainly know more about foreign affairs .
But Clinton or Obama ( or even Edwards , although I suspect he ’s already toast and just hanging about to be kingmaker ) ?
Really , not a problem .
* Well , if I were going to vote for one of the Democratic candidates , which would I vote for ?
Honestly , I have no clue , partly because since I do n’t get to vote for either , and would be happy with either , I have n’t given it that much thought .
But also , I ’m happy to have the two of them debate each other and give everyone a good look at their positions and such .
Emotionally , Obama appeals to me ; he ’s good with them there word thingies , and also to be blunt about it , having a President Obama would make it feel like the American people were doing a Ctrl + Alt +
Delete on the previous eight years , and there ’s a lot of appeal to that .
But Clinton ’s selling point — she ’s already got the presidential apparatus ready to go — is not insignificant either .
And also , you know , I do n’t really have that foamy “ Clintons are made of pure , baby - pureeing evil ” thing going on , either .
So I have no idea which I would go for .
Since I do n’t have to worry about it , I wo n’t .
* People who loathe the Clintons , singly and severally , like to cling to the shibboleth that her negatives are so high that when it comes right down to it people just wo n’t be able to will themselves to vote for her , and thus : President McCain ( in a best - case scenario ) .
I think these people are kind of high .
Hello , McFly : This is a Clinton we ’re talking about .
You ca n’t kill them , they just keep coming , and you do n’t need to look any further than New Hampshire for proof of that .
What GOPers really fear about the Clintons is that at heart they have that same amoral “ fuck you , I ’m going to win this thing ” vibe going that the GOP have made a bedrock of their recent character , and they do it better than Karl Rove and an entire flying squadron of College Republican automatons could ever do it .
Ask yourself , Clinton loathers : if in some alternate universe 2000 had been between Dubya and Clinton ( either Clinton , they come as a package deal ) , do you think the Clintonistas would have tolerated the Florida vote count shenanigans ?
Does anyone really believe that Bush would have walked out of that the winner ?
One of the things I ’ve always said about the 2000 election is that ultimately Bush won it because the Republicans were willing to snorkle through pig shit to get it , while the Democrats , and specifically Al Gore and his people , did n’t want to get their precious widdle hands mussed .
When it came down to it , Gore did n’t want it enough .
“ Not wanting it enough ” is not going to be a problem for Clinton .
For all the people who seem to believe that Clintons are universally loathed simply for being Clintons , it ’s worth remembering that for the entirety of Bill Clinton ’s second term ( you know , the one he was impeached in ) , his approval rating never dropped below 54 % ( according to Gallup ) ; as a contrast , the last time Bush saw an approval rating higher than that was the first couple of weeks of his second term ; he has n’t been at 50 % since May , 2005 ( alternately , his disapproval rating has been greater than 50 % since August ’ 05 ) .
Al Gore ’s cardinal sin of the 2000 campaign ( aside from not fighting for it at the end ) was running away from Clinton ’s popularity ; all he had then was himself .
Hilary Clinton is n’t Bill Clinton , of course , for better and worse , but I think nevertheless the expiration date on the “ Everyone hates the Clintons ” meme is coming up a lot sooner than the Clinton haters suspect .
These are reasons that I can’t help but think the GOP would rather face Obama than Clinton in the general election : because I doubt she ’s as unpopular as some folks want to believe , and also , when it comes right down to wallowing in the pig shit and going after your opponent with a splintery baseball bat , no one does it better than the Clintons , and the GOP is out of practice dealing with an opponent who not only hits back but is out to break your fucking skull .
Obama ’s already been marked as someone who wants to take the high road , which is to say , he ’s a sitting duck for a smearing , and we all know how the GOP loves a soft target .
The Clinton ’s are n’t going to put up with that crap .
The first 527 to try to Swift Boat Clinton is likely to get its collective ass handed to it .
* That said , I think it ’s entirely possible we ’ll end up with Obama as the Democratic candidate , in which case the GOP had better hope smearing still works , because that ’s all they ’re going to have on the dude .
There ’s no one out there who thinks Obama has experience ; that ’s not why you buy the Obama package .
You buy it because the guy is smart and inspirational and makes people feel like a better day is coming ; indeed , one of the more astute ( and positively heretical ) ideas I ’ve read is the one that suggests that Obama is the true heir to Reagan , not for his policies but for how he makes people feel about where it ’s possible for the country to go .
If that ’s anything close to the truth , then I hope the conservatives enjoyed their time at the top , because it ’ll be going bye bye .
* Also , the GOP field ?
Monkeys .
Or more accurately : Jesus Monkey , 9/11 Monkey , flip - flop Monkey with perfect hair , Monkey who wins teh Internets and fails everything else , and John McCain , who is not a monkey , but who is two years shy of how old Ronald Reagan was at the end of his second term , which is worrying .
I want John McCain to tell us right now who his VP choice is going to be , because I have a sneaking suspicion that knowledge is going to be relevant in his case , and if he picks a monkey of the same quality as the rest of the GOP field , it ’s back to perusing the New Zealand immigration Web site again .
But aside from McCain , seriously , y’all , what the hell ?
Is this field really the best you can do ?
Do n’t get me wrong , Huckabee ’s Chuck Norris ad gave me a giggle , and I think it ’s nice that Ron Paul gives the “ I read Atlas Shrugged every year and it gets better every time ” crowd something to do through the chilly winter nights .
But this is no way to run a railroad .
I sincerely do hope McCain takes the nomination , because although I disagree with him substantively on a number of policy points , at least saying “ President McCain ” does n’t make me want to vomit in my mouth a little , the way “ President Romney ” or “ President Guliani ” does ( saying “ President Huckabee ” does n’t make me want to vomit , but does make me want to sigh heavily and shake my head sadly ) .
I can live with a President McCain .
But I ’m sorry for you Republicans you do n’t have a better set of candidates to choose from .
* Bloomberg ?
If he does jump in , he ’s a Perot , not a Nader .
Another thing for you GOP folks to worry about in an already worrying year for you .
Some Russian girls had a bear as a pet , but this one has a real seal as her home animal .
She feeds it , goes for a walk with it and gives it to swim in her bath to feel like home .
In the old days , if you were an ambitious young Englishman looking for adventure and glory , your career path was obvious :
You became a servant of the British Empire .
The memoirs of George Orwell and Leonard Woolf , like the fiction of Rudyard Kipling , give a vivid sense of how exciting a young proconsul 's life could be .
Back home , he was just another 22 - year - old , on the bottom rung of the career ladder ; in India or Burma or Malaya , he was a combination of king , judge , and general , ruling a village or even a whole province with no one to supervise him .
Orwell , who wrote in " Shooting an Elephant " that his experience as a policeman in Burma " oppressed me with an intolerable sense of guilt , " recognized that even the hatred of the native population was a tribute to his power : " I was hated by large numbers of people  the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me . "

Even today , from time to time , a young Englishman falls under the spell of the British Empire ; and since he can no longer govern it , he usually decides to write about it instead .
James Barr , the author of " Setting the Desert on Fire " ( Norton , 382 pages , $ 27.95 ) is a fine example of the type .
There is no real reason why , in order to write this book about Lawrence of Arabia , Mr. Barr had to visit the sites of Lawrence 's exploits .
Yet every few chapters , Mr. Barr interrupts his narrative to tell us that , 90 years after Lawrence crossed this desert or attacked that railroad station , he was there as well .
" From the police station , three hundred yards away to the west , I could see a dark hill that rises steeply out of a dusty plain , " he writes in one typical aside .
" It must have been from there that , on the night of 17 September 1917 , Lawrence ... looked down on the station behind me , which was blazing with yellow light from within . "
This is not just history writing , but channeling , or even an elevated kind of play - acting  the author imagining himself as the soldier that , a hundred years ago , he might have been .
As Mr. Barr proves , this is just the right spirit in which to approach T.E. Lawrence .
For if generations of readers ( and moviegoers ) have imagined themselves playing Lawrence  riding on camelback through a blazing waste , leading proud tribesmen on lightning raids 
Mr. Barr shows that the first person to revel in playing Lawrence of Arabia was Lawrence himself .
Reporting to a friend about an attack on a Turkish troop train , he wrote , " I hope this sounds the fun it is ...
It 's the most amateurishly Buffalo - Billy sort of performance . "
At times , he was even oppressed by the sense that he was a kind of vaudeville cowboy , and Arabia a " foreign stage on which one plays day and night , in fancy dress , in a strange language ....
The whole thing is such a play , and one cannot put conviction into one 's daydreams . "
Lawrence 's desert war was " such a play , " such " fun , " because it was , to a really amazing extent , like a boy 's idea of war , all exploits and highjinks .
" There are n't any returns , or orders , or superiors , or inferiors , " he exulted .
All that was back in Cairo , where the British had their headquarters , and where Lawrence worked on the intelligence staff until 1916 .
He had never been happy there , or popular :
One of his superiors described him as " a bumptious young ass who spoils his undoubted knowledge of Syrian Arabs etc by making himself out to be the only authority on war , engineering , running HM 's ships and everything else .
He put every single person 's back up I 've met . "
In fact , the 28 - year - old captain was so sure of himself that he had already developed his own strategy for winning the war in the Middle East : " I want to pull [ the Arabs ] all together , & to roll up Syria by way of the Hijaz in the name of the Sharif . "
The Sharif in question was Husein , the ruler of Mecca , who in 1916 placed himself at the head of what was meant to be a pan-Arab rebellion against the Ottoman Empire .
The British were eager to help  not just because it would be a way of striking at the Turks after the British defeat at Gallipoli , but still more because Husein represented a challenge to the Sultan 's authority as caliph , or leader of the Muslim faithful .
As the rulers of tens of millions of Muslims in India , the British were worried , to what now seems a paranoid degree , by the prospect of a worldwide jihad on behalf of the Turks .
( As Mr. Barr remarks , this scenario forms the plot of the classic spy novel " Greenmantle , " by John Buchan , which was published in 1916 . )
But by the fall , the Arab Revolt was stalled outside the gates of Medina , and the British were beginning to realize that in Husein they had an unstable ally with delusions of grandeur .
It was in this fraught moment that Lawrence seized his chance .
Largely on his own initiative , he set out for Jeddah , and before long he had made himself the key liaison between the British in Cairo and Feisal , one of Husein 's sons and the commander of his northern army .
Roaming the desert with Feisal 's Bedouin fighters , out of contact with his nominal superiors for weeks or months at a time , Lawrence was able to conduct a freelance war .
His primary mission was to sabotage the Hijaz Railway , the only means for the Turks to supply their garrison in Medina .
This meant that most of Lawrence 's actual exploits were on a very small scale  an affair of a few dozen men planting explosives under a bridge , ripping up a hundred yards of railroad track , or machine - gunning a lonely train station .
Indeed , reading Mr. Barr 's tightly focused , fast - paced account of these episodes , it is striking how minuscule Lawrence 's war remained , compared with the industrial slaughter that was going on in France .
As Mr. Barr writes , the money the British spent in Arabia in a year would have paid for just seven hours of fighting on the Western Front .
The human scale , too , was different .
Because the Bedouin tribesmen were volunteers unused to army discipline , Lawrence had to be very sparing with his human material .
The casualty rate taken for granted in France was unthinkable in Arabia , where " an individual death was like a pebble dropped in water ... rings of sorrow widened out from them . "
This contrast is exactly why Lawrence became such a mythic figure , one of the few real heroes to emerge from World War I .
For the vast majority of soldiers , that war was a matter of stasis , constant bombardment , futile frontal attacks , and random slaughter .
Lawrence 's campaigns , on the other hand , were full of heroism and movement and mischief .
In fact , there was something essentially boyish about the kind of sabotage he practiced , as another British officer readily admitted : " We could indulge in a love of destruction which had lain latent in us since we were small boys . "
And the Arab Revolt was full of larger - than - life characters , some of whom would not have been out of place in the Trojan War .
Auda abu Tayi , the Huwaytat chieftain who boasted of having killed 75 Arabs ( he did n't keep track of Turks ) , and ate the hearts of his slain enemies , was a man such as Achilles must have been .
If Mr. Barr conveys the romance of Lawrence 's war , however , he also allows us occasional glimpses of its barbarism .
Because the Bedouin fought at such close range , the violence they dealt out was more personal , and at times more sadistic , than the anonymous slaughter of the trenches .
Some of the locomotives Lawrence so gleefully blew up , Mr. Barr points out , were carrying women and children refugees from Medina , or sick and wounded Turkish soldiers .
In one especially horrible episode , after the Arabs came across the village of Tafas , where the Turks had committed atrocities , they proceeded to massacre hundreds of Turkish prisoners .
" In a madness born of the horror of Tafas , " Lawrence wrote , " we killed and killed , even blowing in the heads of the fallen and of the animals ; as though their death and running blood could slake our agony . "
This elevated style is typical of " Seven Pillars of Wisdom , " Lawrence 's classic memoir , and makes that book rather cloying over the long run .
It is not surprising to learn from Mr. Barr that , even during the fighting , Lawrence was already planning how he would write about it :
His whole career was conceived in aesthetic terms .
Mr. Barr 's achievement is to tell Lawrence 's story more clearly and objectively , helping to make sense of a complex war fought in an unfamiliar land and language .
" Setting the Desert on Fire " only glances , however , at the most important ramifications of the Arab Revolt , which continues to shape Middle Eastern politics to this day .
For while the British encouraged Sharif Husein in the idea that he would be made king of all Arabia , they had no intention of ever keeping this promise .
They counted on Husein 's revolt being confined to the Hijaz  the coastal area where Mecca and Medina lie .
In fact , under the terms of the secret Sykes - Picot Treaty between Britain and France , the whole Arab Middle East had already been divided up between the two empires , with Syria going to the French and Iraq to the British .
Lawrence , whose idealized passion for the Arabs and their way of life led him to yearn for a free , independent Arab Empire , did all he could to undermine this cynical division of the spoils .
It was largely thanks to Lawrence that the Arab forces ended up pressing as far north as Damascus , which they entered just before the British army of General Allenby , late in 1918 .
The result was that Husein 's dynasty , the Hashemites , ended the war claiming the right to rule all of Arabia .
In a short epilogue , Mr. Barr shows the reckless and shortsighted way the British met these claims .
Two of Husein 's sons were made kings of the puppet states the British created in the Arab lands : Abdullah was given Jordan , where his dynasty still reigns , and Feisal was placed on the throne of Iraq , where the monarchy was overthrown in 1958 .
Both these dynasties , like the states they ruled , were entirely arbitrary creations , imposed by the British in defiance of cultural and political logic .
Even Feisal acknowledged that " there is still  and I say this with a heart of sorrow  no Iraqi people , but unimaginable masses of human beings , devoid of any patriotic idea ... prone to anarchy and perpetually ready to rise against any government whatever . "
As these words show , not much has changed in Iraq .
Today , when America tries to pacify a country divided between Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds , it is reaping what the British sowed .
A similar story could be told of Palestine , where Britain 's failure to reconcile its promises to the Arabs with the commitment it made to the Jews , in the Balfour Declaration , helped to create the unending Arab - Israeli conflict .
Even Osama bin Laden , Mr. Barr shows , lists the Sykes - Picot agreement as one of his major historical grievances .
Seen from today 's perspective , then , Lawrence 's story looks less like a chivalric romance than like a case of imperial arrogance run amok .
Only by taking advantage of the incredible carelessness and cynicism of the men who ran the British Empire was a junior officer able to remake the Middle East according to his own whims .
It is enough to make one glad that there is no more British Empire , even if it means that there will never be another Lawrence of Arabia .
Light Emitting Diodes ( LEDs ) , already used in electrical equipment such as computers and mobile phones , are several times more energy efficient than standard light - bulbs .
However , because of their structure and material , much of the light in standard LEDs becomes trapped , reducing the brightness of the light and making them unsuitable as the main lighting source in the home .
Now researchers believe they have found a way of introducing a new generation of LEDs into households that are brighter and use even less power than standard energy efficient light - bulbs .
Dr Faiz Rahman , the researcher leading the project at the University of Glasgow , said : â€ œBy making microscopic holes on the surface of the LEDs it is possible to extract more light , thus increasing the brightness of the lights without increasing the energy consumption .
As yet , LEDs have not been introduced as the standard lighting in homes because the process of making the holes is very time consuming and expensive .
However , by using world - class facilities at the University of Glasgow we believe we have found a way of imprinting the holes into billions of LEDs at a far greater speed , but at a much lower cost .
â€ œLEDs not only use less power than current energy efficient light - bulbs but they are much smaller and can last years without needing to be replaced .
This means the days of the humble light - bulb could soon be over.â€ 

The team of researchers use a technique called nano - imprint lithography to directly imprint the holes , imperceptible to the human eye , onto the LEDs allowing more of the light to escape .
The project is being developed in conjunction with the Institute of Photonics , University of Strathclyde , Mesophotonics Ltd and Sharp Laboratories of Europe , as part of the BERR Technology Programme .
Why It Feels Good to Scratch Researchers use a brain scan to unlock the mystery of why we scratch .
Jan. 31 , 2008  --
Skin might seem like a simple messenger , telling the brain if it's hot , if it 's cold , or whether that rock underfoot is sharp .
But scientists are now finding that the nerve - based conversation between the skin and the brain is far more complex than most people realize .
Take , for example , the seemingly simple act of scratching an itch .
A child will scratch and scratch a rash to the point of drawing blood and feel relieved .
But he 'll cry if he scrapes his knee on the ground .
What 's the difference ?
New research published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology may answer this question , as it reveals part of what 's going on in our heads when we can't stop scratching — and may even add to our understanding of how the skin helps define pain for the brain .
Scratching
" They can't be divorced , itch and scratch , " says Dr. Gil Yosipovitch , lead author of the study and a dermatologist at Wake Forest University in Winston Salem , N.C. " Almost all two - and four - legged animals scratch and itch — supposedly , even fish scratch themselves . "
Scratching seems like such a natural reaction that it took a while before scientists figured out something more was going on between the skin and the brain .
The first hint for Yosipovitch was long - distance scratching .
In a previous study , he showed scratching brings relief even if you miss the itch and scratch far away from the bite or rash .
" It 's not just a local reaction , " says Yosipovitch .
" It 's so important to understand there is an interaction between the skin and the brain . "
To see this interaction in the brain , researchers hooked up 13 healthy people to MRI scan machines .
Then they began to scratch the volunteers on their legs in 30 - second intervals .
Simply scratching the skin — even without an induced itch — had a compulsive effect on the brain .
Yosipovitch found scratching activated areas of the brain associated with memory and pleasure , while at the same time it suppressed areas associated with the sensation of pain and emotions .
" It puts in that message to continue it .
That 's why it 's so repetitive , " says Yosipovitch .
" It 's associated with a reward , so the more you do it , the more it feels better . "
But that 's not license to scratch , says Yosipovitch .
He sees many patients with chronic itch from conditions like eczema , who scratch themselves until they bleed .
" Like any vicious cycle , it 's not recommended , " says Yosipovitch .
But our instincts are n't all bad news .
Though scratching can put our brains into a painful cycle , science has found that the instinct to rub an injury can stop pain messages from reaching the brain .
Rubbing
" If you stub your toe , you rub it for a reason , " says Dr. Carol Warfield , a professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School in Boston , Mass .
She says that " Gate Theory , " an idea that dates back to the 1960s , explains why .
Imagine there is a little gate within the spinal cord that allows pain messages to travel up to the brain , says Warfield .
Usually , smaller nerves send pain signals , the gate opens and the messages of " Ow , I hit my elbow ! " make it to the brain .
Larger nerves — which pick up on pressure , touch and position of the limb — will send messages to block the gate , crowding out some of the competing pain messages .
Moreover , these larger nerves will trigger the body to release endorphins , the same hormones responsible for the natural high after exercise or sex .
So while rubbing your skin wo n't undo any damage of a bonked head , to a certain degree it will close off pain information to the brain and make you feel better .
" Anything you did to increase input into these pressure nerve fibers would allow input of endorphins in the spinal cord , " says Warfield .
And " anything " may even include electric catfish .
Electric Shock
It turns out that millennia before a Canadian and British physician explained Gate Theory , the ancient Egyptians stumbled upon an application of it .
" Ancient Egyptians used to pull these electric catfish out of the Nile and put them on the painful area , " says Warfield .
Just as rubbing a stubbed toe shuts a gate within the spinal cord , so can electric stimulation fire up the pressure nerves .
Healthcare providers today use electrical signals in a less fishy , decidedly less sloppy application called a TENS device — short for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation .
" The disadvantage of the conventional mode TENS is that it is temporary , " says Brian Murray , a physical therapist and rehab team coordinator at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Md. " People can build a tolerance . "
However , stimulating the skin with a TENS unit can help many different types of pain — a weekend warrior who 's injured himself , a person recovering from surgery , or a person in chronic pain who 's trying to function — all relatively easily .
" It 's not something where we strap them down to the table and wait until their hair stands up , " says Murray .
" You end up with a tingling feeling as if your foot falls asleep . "

It remains unclear exactly what Gen Lute 's remit might be
Lt Gen Douglas Lute , currently serving as director of operations at the Pentagon , will co-ordinate the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He will report directly to Mr Bush as deputy national security adviser .
Gen Lute was appointed after a lengthy search in which several candidates apparently turned down the position .
He must be confirmed by the US Senate .
President Bush is expected to make an official announcement about Mr Lute 's appointment on Wednesday .
Turf wars
If confirmed , Gen Lute , 55 , would take his post as the US battles militants in Iraq and Taleban rebels in Afghanistan .
LT GEN DOUGLAS LUTE Graduated from West Point academy 1975 Active in 1991 Gulf War Commander , Kosovo , 2002 US Central Command , 2004 - 06 Pentagon 2006 - 07
Correspondents say it is unclear exactly what General Lute will do , and whether the job will involve settling turf wars between the Pentagon and the state department .
He will serve as an adviser to the president but will also keep his military position and three - star ranking , reports said .
The Associated Press news agency reported that the new appointee would speak for the president concerning developments in the conflict areas and smooth over differences between rival departments .
Several White House security officials have left the administration in recent months .

The problem with languages like Ruby and Java is that everything is an object and every action is a message , except when it is n’t .
The Reasoned Schemer takes us into the world of logic programming , a world where we take fairly ordinary logical functions and reason with them , building higher - order control structures like backtracking out of simple functions .
Wait a second .
Building higher - order control structures out of simple functions ?
This sounds suspiciously like working with Monads …
The Reasoned Schemer contains a concise and remarkably easy introduction to decoupling control flow issues like backtracking and error handling from program logic issues .

Now this essay is about turtles , so I am probably insane for starting with an anecdote that has every potential of blowing up into a debate about the right way to interview people .
So I ’ll just say a couple of things about that : First , it ’s a screening question .
If you ask it and then argue over the phone with the candidate about whether adding the const keyword to Java is a good idea , you are missing the point .
The point in a screening question is to weed out people who are flat out lying about their experience , not to decide if they happen to be your intellectual and cultural clone .
The moment they demonstrate that they actually have some non-trivial experience with the two languages , you are done .
Second , language nuänce questions have limited value .
This is because while there is a correlation between tools knowledge and experience , the argument for causality is tenuous at best .
Meaning , people with non-trivial experience usually know a lot more about their tools than people without experience .
However , it is possible to learn a lot about a tool without actually having real - world experience .
And maybe somebody knows a lot about a tool but does n’t know the answer to the specific trivial question you want to ask .
So … a question like this has some utility as a filter , and perhaps it is useful in a longer interview if you use it as an excuse get the candidate to talk about how their proposed changes would have helped them with their actual projects , which leads them into talking about their experience .

Here ’s one such argument : Perl , the first postmodern computer language .
[ back ]
Someone was once phone - screening me for a job in a start up , and they asked me to name my two strongest languages .
At the time , the answer was Java and C++ , partly because I had just finished writing Java development tools in C++ , and partly because while I loved Scheme and Smalltalk , I knew that anyone using them in day to day production would quickly expose me as a dilettante if I were to answer with my heart instead of my head .
After I said “ Java and C++ , ” the follow - up was interesting .
The interviewer asked me :
If you could change both languages , name one feature from Java that you would add to C++ , and why .
And name one feature from C++ you would add to Java , and why .
Today I would answer that question differently , of course , but I bring it up because there is a feature of Common Lisp , Arc , and C++ that I miss whenever I use a conventional object - oriented language like Smalltalk or Ruby : lvalues and references .
In short , what I miss is the ability to redefine the assignment operator .
Or do I ?
Let ’s have a look at what that means and why I miss it .
In Ruby , you have a limited ability to define the assignment operator .
Specifically , you can define methods that look like fields or instance variables :
Of course , that means something entirely different than writing : Which binds : fizzbuzz to the local variable something_else .
But that ’s really it .
All uses of “ = ” in Ruby are one of these cases : binding a variable , calling “ [ ] = , ” or calling a named method on an object and passing one parameter .
So ?
Well , there ’s something I would like to do in Ruby that simply cannot be done .
If I have an array I make from a range , say ( 1..100 ) . to_a , how do I double the odd numbers in that array ?
Obviously , I can write things likeBut imperative loops are yucky .
I could write it a little functionally :
But that creates a new array and overwrites my variable .
Besides the fact that it seems wasteful , this is absolutely the wrong solution if the original array is shared elsewhere in my code : I am not changing the original array , I am merely binding a local variable to a different array .
Try writing a function called “ double_the_even_values ! ( arr ) ” ( that doubles the values of arr ) , and you ’ll see what I mean .
Really , I want to write : But I can ’t .
Ifgives me a value andsets a value , and ifgives me another value andsets another value , then : Whengives me some values , why does n ’ tset some values ?
There ’s a reason it does n’t work that way .
Never mind whether Matz was copying some of Smalltalk ’s assignment semantics when he designed this piece of Ruby , let ’s talk about if statements and cases .
Once upon a time , people wrote programs with lots of explicit branches in their code .
If this is the case , do this .
If that is the case , do that .
One of the big ideas in OOP was polymorphism .
When you program with interfaces , a lot of the logic of what do do for each case goes into your class hierarchy : that ’s what method dispatching is all about .
This is great , because when you want to do something new , the whole idea is that you create new classes with interfaces just like your existing classes and they just work .
Okay , we can stop smoking the good stuff , nothing just works and OOP is not a silver bullet .
But the key idea is that by moving some of our logic into our objects , we can write more generalized code elsewhere , code that does not need to know what an object is doing inside itself .
Let ’s look at a different paradigm : Higher - order functional programming .
In this paradigm , functions are first - class values : you can write functions that take functions as arguments and / or return functions .
Again , there is a de-coupling : if you write a compose function that creates a new function out of two or more other functions , it does not need to know what those other functions do , just how to wire them together .
Monads are based on this premise as well , on the premise of writing generalized functions that do not need to know the intimate details of the things they consume and produce .
The problem with languages like Ruby and Java is that everything is an object and every action is a message , except when it is n’t .
The things that are objects and messages are remarkably flexible and work well .
The things that are n’t objects and messages are like case statements in older programs : places where you cannot extend the language without dealing with thousands of these case statements that are all coupled to each other in unexpected ways .
In Ruby ’s case , the rules for what it means when you write expression1 = expression2 are hard - coded into the parser like a case statement .
You cannot create a select= method that modifies its receiver .
( Actually , you can define the method .
Good luck calling it without resorting to send . )
Of course , you can write a method to do what we want :
But now we have a serious inelegance : why do three kinds of getting and setting values use one syntax , but the fourth uses a different syntax ?
Common Lisp has something called a Generalized Variable ( also called a generalized reference ) .
In OO terms , it ’s an object that has a setter and a getter method , although you can call them the access and update operations if you prefer .
Common lisp has a macro , setf that performs an update .
In short , if you call : Common Lisp does something analogous to : Let ’s pretend that Ruby did this .
This would be very interesting !
For starters , instead of writing an accessor this way :
You would define a single method that returns a generalized variable :
Now whenever you write some_bar .
something you would get a generalized variable and Ruby would figure out when you need its value and when you need to assign something to it .
Of course , that looks like a lot of boilerplate , but you could rewrite the existing attribute class methods to do this for you .
( Actually , this exact code would n’t even come close to working because @something would belong to the new object , but squint at it sideways and pretend we can do that . )
You could then write your select method to return either a single generalized variable or a collection of them , depending on how you want your semantics to read .
For example , you could choose which of the following ought to work :
The reason why this is interesting is that the original language designer does not need to worry about whether people want to write select methods that can update their host collections .
The language designer merely needs to write things in a sufficiently general way , and people will work out the implications for themselves .
Returning to Ruby ( and a lot of other languages ) , now we see why everything being an object and everything that happens being a method invocation “ except when they are n’t ” is a problem : Assignment is one of those things that is n’t , and because of that , there are places where our programs are n’t going to be consistent with the language ’s philosophy .
If assignment was always a method invocation , I suggest that there would be a way to write a select that modifies its receiver .
Of course , there would also be things like this :
Which would now pass blithely though the parser only to raise a NoMethodError at run time because numbers do not implement an update method ( At least , not in Ruby .
Legend has it that this was legal in early versions of FORTRAN .
But those systems were built by Real Programmers who eschewed type safety , quiche , and semiconductor memory ) .
I think it ’s a good thing when languages are highly consistent , in the vein of Scheme , Smalltalk , and Forth .
Although you cannot redefine “ := ” in Smalltalk for select methods , you ca n’t redefine it for anything else either , so at least we ’re clear that you can never do it , not do it some of the time .
Such languages are remarkably consistent , they are quite stable , and although they may be unfamiliar to someone approaching them from a different paradigm , they are highly discoverable .
Like any program , languages evolve over time as people realize they need new features .
A lot of the difference between languages boils down to a basic decision every implementor has to make when deciding how to add a new feature :
Should I add this feature ?
Or should I make this feature possible ?
Adding a feature is like adding a new case to an if statement .
You want List Comprehensions ?
You ’ve got it .
Syntactic sugar for closures ?
Done .
Making a new feature possible is the deeper , more challenging option .
It involves rewiring the way the language works such that the new feature becomes a special case of a more general language capability .
So instead of modifying Ruby to support , you add generalized variables , which makepossible .
Some people will argue with this , but I think languages where “ It ’s turtles all the way down ” are better than languages that are exceeding well thought - out and painstakingly chosen collections of features that amount to a heap of if statements and special cases for everything .
Turtles all the way down is a philosophy where you try to define a ridiculously minimal set of orthogonal axioms and build the language by combining those axioms .
At the lowest level it feels like pure math : Combinatory Logic can be built out of three , two , or even one combinator if you are careful .
Scheme has five special forms .
But with the right abstractions and syntactic sugar on top , you can produce a language with an amazingly diverse feeling to it .
But the advantage of having everything in the language built on top of a small set of axioms is that when you want to make a new feature possible , it ’s often just a case of burrowing down a level of abstraction and combining the existing things in new ways .
For example , it could be as simple as rewriting select to return generalized variables instead of values … if Ruby really treated “ = ” as a method instead of treating it as a special case that is sometimes a method and sometimes something else and sometimes a third thing .
Of course , you can make new things possible in languages that are n’t turtles all the way down .
But your new things never feel like they fit with the things already in the language , just as pairinganddoes n’t fit naturally alongside , andin Ruby .
And that means that the thing you build are n’t as discoverable or as readable as they could be .
I started by saying that I like the way you can define lvalues in C++ , exactly because you can define methods like select that return generalized variables .
But following that thread , I ended up with the conclusion that what I really like is a language with as few special cases as possible , a language which feels like everything is built out of a small set of well - chosen primitives or axioms that I can combine and recombine to create new things that work just like the old things .
A language where it ’s turtles all the way down .
DAMASCUS – More than a million Iraqis in Syria cannot find work .
For their idleness , they have come to be called the " pillow drivers . "
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) says there are at least 1.5 million Iraqi refugees in Syria .
If they seek work , they will lose their status as refugees .
And so Iraqi refugees who were once doctors , engineers , athletes , artists , and businessmen sit it out in Syria with nothing to do .
" They call us the pillow drivers here , " said Dr. Jassim Alwan , who fled Baghdad after he was arrested by U.S. forces in 2003 .
" I was humiliated like an animal by those who call themselves soldiers of liberty , so I decided to flee to Syria . "
He has no work now , he said .
" All I do is stay up late at night thinking of myself and my family ’s dark future , and sleep all day like a drugged man .
Most Iraqis do the same . "
Many Iraqi refugees gather at night at Damascus teahouses .
They spend much of the night talking over strong Iraqi tea , some smoking the water pipe .
" Not all of us can afford the water pipe , " Salim Khattab , earlier an engineer from Mosul , told IPS .
" Most of us have run out of money after the long years of spending while there has been no income .
I accepted a job of salesman for $ 100 a month for a while , but I quit when I was asked to clean the shop and the doorsteps .
A hundred dollars would not be enough for more than a few days anyway .
Now I spend the days in bed waiting for night so I can meet my new friends . "
Many Iraqis have turned to reciting poems about their condition , or trying to joke about it .
Audiences do not always laugh ; more often they have tears in their eyes .
Some poets and writers frequent particular teahouses , and their fans follow them there .
" Iraq has become the wasteland we ’ve been reading about by [ T.S. ]
Eliot , and worse , " said an Iraqi poet , who wanted his name withheld .
" Those thieves who took over the country with the help of the bigger thieves , the occupiers , are the reason for our agony . "
From the outside , such thoughts and observations are seen as idleness .
Many Iraqi refugees ponder these days over their new status as " pillow drivers . "
" Better to be a pillow driver than worm feed , my friend , " Mohammad Adnan , who was a trader in Baghdad , told IPS .
" I think Americans invaded our country to turn us into good - for - nothing people .
They want us to stay outside Iraq so that it stays retarded until they bring more capitalist corporations to loot what is left . "
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) said in a report March 19 that there are 2.7 million Iraqis displaced within their own country , and another 2.4 million who have fled , mostly to Jordan and Syria .
The IOM , an independent body that cooperates with the UN and its agencies , said the situation for Iraqis who are outside their country is deteriorating .
" There is very little light at the end of the tunnel in Iraq ’s humanitarian crisis , " IOM spokeswoman Jemini Pandya told reporters .
" Conditions for the displaced , and refugees , have been getting steadily worse . "
Yet , bad as it is for the refugees outside , the situation for Iraqis within Iraq continues to be far worse .
" Many IDPs [ internally displaced persons ] live in substandard or overcrowded shelters as they are largely without an income to afford escalating rent prices , " the IOM report said .
More than 75 percent of them have no access to government food rations , and nearly 20 percent lack a clean water supply , the report said .
Some 33 percent cannot get the medicines they need .
Only 20 percent have had any help from humanitarian agencies .
Hours after a federal court judge ordered Oklahoma State University to show cause why it should n't be held in contempt for failing to respond to an RIAA subpoena , attorneys for the school e-mailed a list of students ' names to the RIAA 's attorneys .
But now that the RIAA has what it wanted , the group is unsure about how to go about sending out its prelitigation settlement letters .
Some of the students are represented by an attorney , meaning that the RIAA is barred from contacting them directly .
The case in question involves 11 OSU students accused of using P2P networks to infringe on the Big Four labels ' copyrights .
The students have fought hard to keep their identities secret , filing motions to quash the subpoenas and later attacking the credibility of the RIAA 's expert witness .
The judge denied the motion to quash the RIAA 's subpoenas in November , ordering OSU to provide the identities of the students it believed were behind the IP addresses flagged by MediaSentry .
That 's where things got a little bit sticky .
In a filing on Monday , the RIAA noted that OSU said it would provide the info in late November .
Further requests by the plaintiffs ' attorneys in December , January , and " several times " already this month went unanswered , with one exception .
On February 1 , the university sent the RIAA 's attorneys an e-mail that referenced an attachment containing the data sought by the labels , but the attachment was n't actually attached .
The RIAA 's normal course of action upon getting a school to cough up data on its students is to send them prelitigation settlement letters offering them the chance to avoid a lawsuit by means of a four - figure payment .
Some of the OSU Does have hired an attorney , however , which makes sending out settlement letters difficult .
" [ A ] t this time , Plaintiffs are simply unable to determine which of the Doe defendants are represented by an attorney without breaking the prohibition [ against contacting represented defendants directly ] , " notes the RIAA in a filing .
The attorney in question , Marilyn Barringer - Thompson , has so far refused to identify her clients either by name or IP address .
If that name sounds familiar , it may be because she represented Debbie Foster , one of the first defendants to triumph over the RIAA and win attorneys ' fees .
Barringer - Thompson has a history of aggressively litigating file - sharing cases brought by the music industry , and the RIAA looks like it 's facing an another protracted and potentially costly fight here as well .
If nothing else , the OSU case serves as a reminder of the obstacles the RIAA has faced in its nearly - one - year - old legal campaign against college students .
The labels have seen the Oregon Attorney General criticize their conduct in a case involving 17 University of Oregon students .
In another case involving seven students at the College of William & Mary , a federal judge barred the RIAA from doing its usual end run around the legal system ; seven months later the RIAA still does n't know the identities of the students .

No Matter the Approach , Sex Ed Works
New research finds that educating kids about sex can delay sexual behavior .
Dec. 19 , 2007  --
Teenagers who receive any kind of sex education -- whether it's comprehensive or abstinence - only -- are more likely to delay sexual intercourse until after they turn 15 , according to a new report .
But some sexual health experts worry that the study 's failure to distinguish between comprehensive and abstinence - only approaches could give the public the wrong idea about the efficacy of simply telling kids not to have sex .
In the study , released Wednesday in the Journal of Adolescent Health , researchers from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed responses from more than 2,000 teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 to the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth .
They found that boys in this age bracket who received formal sex education -- either in schools , churches or community organizations -- were 71 percent less likely to have sex before age 15 .
Girls aged 15 to 19 who received formal sex education were 59 percent less likely to have sex before age 15 .
Formal sex education also seems to lead to safer sex , the study found .
Males attending school who had received sex education were almost three times more likely to use birth control the first time they had sex -- though no such associations were found among females .
" Formal sex education was particularly beneficial for youth who are traditionally considered to be at high risk for adverse sexual health outcomes , such as sexually transmitted diseases or unplanned pregnancies , " says lead study author Trisha Mueller , an epidemiologist at the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health .
" Sex education should be continued to be supported in formal settings , such as schools , and to be the most effective , should occur before youth engage in sexual intercourse for the first time . "
Sexual health experts not affiliated with the study say it is an important addition to continuing evidence that sex education works to promote healthier behaviors .
" This study expands on studies that have shown that sexuality education can delay the onset of sexual intercourse -- once again dispelling the myth that early sexuality education might increase sexual activity , " explains Eli Coleman , director of the program in human sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School .
" This study shows that sexuality education leads to more responsible sexual behavior . "
Pepper Schwartz , professor of sociology at the University of Washington in Seattle , agrees .
" I am thrilled to have this study because it confirms , in some ways , the bottom - line fact : talking about sex , and giving information about sex , makes kids more thoughtful about it and more likely to be able to form a moral code and plan of action -- rather than unconscious reaction . "
Abstinence Only vs. Comprehensive
But the fact that the study does not differentiate between comprehensive and abstinence - only programs gives some experts pause .
" It is unfortunate that this study did not look carefully at the potential differences in efficacy between comprehensive and abstinence - only sexuality education , " Coleman says .
Mueller says that since the analysis was based on the 2002 survey data -- which asked participants whether they had " ever received any formal instruction on how to say ' no ' to sex " and whether they had ever received formal education on birth control methods -- the researchers ' ability to distinguish between types of sex education was limited .
" We agree that it would be extremely useful to compare the effect of abstinence - only education to comprehensive sex education , " she says .
" However , we decided not to do so in this analysis because we felt that the question related to ' how to say no to sex ' was a poor proxy measure for abstinence - only education .
...
For this reason , we have chosen to look at any sex education versus no sex education for the purposes of this manuscript . "
Coleman adds that past research still points to comprehensive sex education as the healthiest approach .
" From other research , the findings are clear , " he says .
" Comprehensive sexuality education approaches are effective in delaying the onset of sexual activity and have the advantage of increasing the likelihood of individuals acting responsibly by protecting themselves and their partners by using condoms and other forms of contraceptives to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies . "
Sex Ed Gaining Steam
Although the content of sex education -- whether abstinence - only or comprehensive -- is still debated , a 2004 study indicated that 93 percent of Americans support some form of sex education in schools .
Other recent studies on sex ed have shown that providing youths with the skills and knowledge to make responsible decisions about sex may help to reduce the more than 750,000 teen pregnancies and the more than 9 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases that occur yearly among Americans aged 15 - 24 .
Earlier studies conducted in the 1970s through 1990s , however , seemed to suggest that sex education had little or no effect on the likelihood of young people engaging in sexual intercourse .
Until this report , there had been no recent national studies conducted to assess the effect of sex education on the sexual behaviors of youth -- a situation that health experts say begs for further research to evaluate the most effective content and implementation of sex education .
" Before the authors [ of this study ] make a pitch for mandatory sex education in schools , " says Dr. Andre Guay , director of the Center for Sexual Function / Endocrinology at the Lahey Clinic , " they have to compare data from homes where sex education is talked about and taught , perhaps as an adjunct to the school program , but also to compare to those children who only receive home schooling in sexual education . "
Judy Kuriansky , author of " The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Dating " and " Generation Sex , " says the gender differences seen in the responses for boys and for girls in this study are also intriguing .
" It is interesting that [ sex education ] is more effective for boys than girls , " she says .
" I think this is because girls still are pressured into having sex to please a boyfriend and to keep the boyfriend . "
As for the overall findings of the study , Kuriansky says the research shows that " love can wait if [ teens ] learn about sex . "
Yesterday was an exercise in patience and perseverance .
It all started with an airline ticket that never made it to my house .
I got the ticket using points I ’d accumulated on my VISA card and the travel agency associated with the card insisted on sending me a paper ticket .
I ca n’t even recall the last time I used a paper ticket .
They were supposed to send it to me in the mail , but it never arrived .
I tried calling the agency , but got stuck on hold each time .
Not knowing the difference between a paper ticket and an e-ticket , I went to the airport anyway .
I ’d paid for the ticket , so I assumed it would be on the airline ’s computer .
Apparently not .
The folks at the ticket counter explained to me that while an e-ticket represented an actual booking of an airline seat , a paper ticket was simply a cash equivalent that could be redeemed for a booked seat .
No paper ticket , no seat .
I spent the next hour navigating the voice mail system of my credit card ’s travel agency .
About eight levels deep , I found an option that might help .
“ To contact the emergency travel arrangements desk , ” the voice said , “ press five . ”
I pressed five and twelve rings later , got connected with an agent .
He suggested that I buy a ticket to San Jose and fill out a lost ticket indemnity form that would allow me to get the money back once my ticket had been confirmed as lost .
The round trip ticket was a little more than I could afford — even with the guaranteed refund — so the people at the airline counter suggested that I buy a one - way ticket to San Jose and have the travel agency courier me a one - way ticket back home .
I followed their advice and proceeded to customs .
I handed customs my passport and boarding passes .
They took one look at my ticket and decided I fit the profile :
A one way ticket ,
bought at the last minute at the counter
( which they mistakenly thought was bought with cash )
by a solo - travelling non-caucasian male
born in a country with active Al - Qaeda - funded groups ( the Philippines has to contend with Osama - funded jerkoffs Abu Sayyaf ) .
I was escorted into a customs interview room , a small place with a desk equipped with a microphone , a chair on either side of the desk and a surveillance camera pointed at the interviewee ’s chair .
As I waited for my interviewer , I imagined someone in one of the adjoining offices snapping on a pair of latex gloves and slathering them with lube .
After about fifteen minutes , a man in a U.S. customs uniform approached the room , but was interrupted by a coworker .
“ Hey , Phil just brought in four boxes of Krispy Kremes ! ”
Both of them made a beeline in some other direction , and I waited another ten minutes for my interviewer to return .
By then , I ’d missed my flight .
The customs guy was pretty nice , asking me the same questions I ’d been asked earlier — where was I headed , how long was I staying , whom I was visiting — as well as some out - of - the - ordinary questions :
“ Have you been to the middle east lately ? ”
“ Have you been to the Philippines recently ? ”
“ Are any of your clients from the currently ‘ hot ’ countries ? ”
He then asked if he could search my luggage ; I said “ yes , ” partly because I had nothing to hide and partly because I did n’t want to face the consequences of saying “ no ” .
When he opened my accordion bag , he asked me to play it in order to prove it was a real musical instrument .
It was then that I decided that there is only one song you play when trying to establish your bona fides with a U.S. customs official : The Star Spangled Banner .
About four bars in , he declared me free to go .
He explained that my circumstances looked a little suspicious , hence the interrogation and search .
I told him that I understood he was just doing his job and hustled out of there .
I was thankful that the searching was restricted to my luggage .
I ’m pretty sure that playing the U.S. national anthem played a part in convincing him that I was not a terrorist and that he should recognize my right to anal sovereignty .
Why did lawyers for a bank in the Cayman Islands ask a judge in essence to turn off the domain name of the Wikileaks site ?
Perhaps because they could not get the site shut down by more traditional means .
Companies that believe they have some reason to have something taken off the Web routinely have their lawyers fire off letters to the Web hosting company of the site in question .
In this case , Julius Baer Bank was interested in removing some of its internal documents that had ended up on Wikileaks , a site that exists to publish documents that someone would rather not see published .
But Wikileaks had clearly planned ahead for this sort of thing .
The records for the site ’s I.P. address indicate that it is hosted by PRQ , based in Stockholm .
PRQ ’s home page offers clues that it ’s not just another hosting company .
It paraphrases a quote from Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation : “ I worry about my children all the time .
I worry that 10 years from now , they will come to me and say , ‘ Daddy , where were you when they took freedom of speech away from the Internet ? ' ”
As it turns out , PRQ is owned by two founders of the Pirate Bay , the BitTorrent tracker site that is Hollywood ’s least favorite online destination .
The Pirate Bay guys have made a sport out of taunting all forms of authority , including the Swedish police , and PRQ has gone out of its way to host sites that other companies would n’t touch .
It is perhaps the world ’s least lawyer - friendly hosting company and thus a perfect home for Wikileaks , which says it is “ developing an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking and public analysis . ”
The bank ’s lawyers may have asked PRQ to remove the documents and been laughed at , or they may have learned a little bit about the company and decided not to waste their time .
( The lawyers are not responding to requests for comment , and PRQ has not replied to an e-mail query . )
The weak link for Wikileaks turned out to be Dynadot , the registrar for its domain name , based in San Mateo , Calif .
In an innovative move , the bank got a judge to have Dynadot change the records for wikileaks.org so it would no longer direct Web surfers to the server in Sweden .
This is a little like getting someone taken out of the phone book .
But this being the Internet , people found other ways to get the number out there .
2/28 UPDATE : Gottfrid Svartholm of PRQ says in the comments : “ We have n’t received anything from BJB .
I ca n’t comment on more than that regarding individual customers though – we have very strict confidentiality policies in place . ”
This seems to contradict a line in an article in The Register on the case last week .
Privacy and civil rights groups filed a motion in the case this week , and there will be a hearing on Friday in San Francisco .
Would you rather earn $ 50,000 a year while other people make $ 25,000 , or would you rather earn $ 100,000 a year while other people get $ 250,000 ?
Assume for the moment that prices of goods and services will stay the same .
Surprisingly — stunningly , in fact — research shows that the majority of people select the first option ; they would rather make twice as much as others even if that meant earning half as much as they could otherwise have .
How irrational is that ?
This result is one among thousands of experiments in behavioral economics , neuroeconomics and evolutionary economics conclusively demonstrating that we are every bit as irrational when it comes to money as we are in most other aspects of our lives .
In this case , relative social ranking trumps absolute financial status .
Here ’s a related thought experiment .
Would you rather be A or B ?
A is waiting in line at a movie theater .
When he gets to the ticket window , he is told that as he is the 100,000th customer of the theater , he has just won $ 100 .
B is waiting in line at a different theater .
The man in front of him wins $ 1,000 for being the 1 - millionth customer of the theater .
Mr. B wins $ 150 .
Amazingly , most people said that they would prefer to be A .
In other words , they would rather forgo $ 50 in order to alleviate the feeling of regret that comes with not winning the thousand bucks .
Essentially , they were willing to pay $ 50 for regret therapy .
Regret falls under a psychological effect known as loss aversion .
Research shows that before we risk an investment , we need to feel assured that the potential gain is twice what the possible loss might be because a loss feels twice as bad as a gain feels good .
That ’s weird and irrational , but it ’s the way it is .
Human as it sounds , loss aversion appears to be a trait we ’ve inherited genetically because it is found in other primates , such as capuchin monkeys .
In a 2006 experiment , these small primates were given 12 tokens that they were allowed to trade with the experimenters for either apple slices or grapes .
In a preliminary trial , the monkeys were given the opportunity to trade tokens with one experimenter for a grape and with another experimenter for apple slices .
One capuchin monkey in the experiment , for example , traded seven tokens for grapes and five tokens for apple slices .
A baseline like this was established for each monkey so that the scientists knew each monkey ’s preferences .
The experimenters then changed the conditions .
In a second trial , the monkeys were given additional tokens to trade for food , only to discover that the price of one of the food items had doubled .
According to the law of supply and demand , the monkeys should now purchase more of the relatively cheap food and less of the relatively expensive food , and that is precisely what they did .
So far , so rational .
But in another trial in which the experimental conditions were manipulated in such a way that the monkeys had a choice of a 50 % chance of a bonus or a 50 % chance of a loss , the monkeys were twice as averse to the loss as they were motivated by the gain .
Remarkable !
Monkeys show the same sensitivity to changes in supply and demand and prices as people do , as well as displaying one of the most powerful effects in all of human behavior : loss aversion .
It is extremely unlikely that this common trait would have evolved independently and in parallel between multiple primate species at different times and different places around the world .
Instead , there is an early evolutionary origin for such preferences and biases , and these traits evolved in a common ancestor to monkeys , apes and humans and was then passed down through the generations .
If there are behavioral analogies between humans and other primates , the underlying brain mechanism driving the choice preferences most certainly dates back to a common ancestor more than 10 million years ago .
Think about that : Millions of years ago , the psychology of relative social ranking , supply and demand and economic loss aversion evolved in the earliest primate traders .
This research goes a long way toward debunking one of the biggest myths in all of psychology and economics , known as “ Homo economicus . ”
This is the theory that “ economic man ” is rational , self - maximizing and efficient in making choices .
But why should this be so ?
Given what we now know about how irrational and emotional people are in all other aspects of life , why would we suddenly become rational and logical when shopping or investing ?
Consider one more experimental example to prove the point : the ultimatum game .
You are given $ 100 to split between yourself and your game partner .
Whatever division of the money you propose , if your partner accepts it , you each get to keep your share .
If , however , your partner rejects it , neither of you gets any money .
How much should you offer ?
Why not suggest a $ 90 - $ 10 split ?
If your game partner is a rational , self - interested money - maximizer — the very embodiment of Homo economicus — he is n’t going to turn down a free 10 bucks , is he ?
He is .
Research shows that proposals that offer much less than a $ 70 - $ 30 split are usually rejected .
Why ?
Because they are n’t fair .
Says who ?
Says the moral emotion of “ reciprocal altruism , ” which evolved over the Paleolithic eons to demand fairness on the part of our potential exchange partners .
“ I ’ll scratch your back if you ’ll scratch mine ” only works if I know you will respond with something approaching parity .
The moral sense of fairness is hard - wired into our brains and is an emotion shared by most people and primates tested for it , including people from non-Western cultures and those living close to how our Paleolithic ancestors lived .
When it comes to money , as in most other aspects of life , reason and rationality are trumped by emotions and feelings .
Cheney on Iraq : ' It 's Important to Win ' Vice President Dick Cheney sat down for an exclusive interview with ABC News .
March 24 , 2008  --
In an exclusive interview with ABC News , Vice President Dick Cheney was asked what effect the grim milestone of at least 4,000 U.S. deaths in the five - year Iraq war might have on the nation .
Noting the burden placed on military families , the vice president said the biggest burden is carried by President George W. Bush , who made the decision to commit US troops to war , and reminded the public that U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan volunteered for duty .
" I want to start with the milestone today of 4,000 dead in Iraq .
Americans .
And just what effect do you think it has on the country ? " asked ABC News '
White House correspondent , Martha Raddatz , who traveled with the vice president on a nine - day overseas trip to Iraq and other countries in the Middle East .
" It obviously brings home I think for a lot of people the cost that 's involved in the global war on terror in Iraq and Afghanistan , " Cheney said in the interview , conducted in Turkey .
" It places a special burden obviously on the families , and we recognize , I think — it 's a reminder of the extent to which we are blessed with families who 've sacrificed as they have . "
Cheney : ' The All - Volunteer Force '
" The president carries the biggest burden , obviously , " Cheney said .
" He 's the one who has to make the decision to commit young Americans , but we are fortunate to have a group of men and women , the all - volunteer force , who voluntarily put on the uniform and go in harm 's way for the rest of us . "
Raddatz noted that some soldiers , Air Force members , and Marines have been on multiple deployments and have been sent back to Iraq because of the stop - loss policy — an involuntary extension of a service member 's enlistment contract .
The Army alone says 58,000 US soldiers have been redeployed to war because of the stop - loss policy .
" When you talk about an all - volunteer force , some of these soldiers , airmen , Marines have been on two , three , four , some of them more than that , deployments , " Raddatz said .
" Do you think when they volunteered they had any idea that there would be so many deployments or stop - loss ?
Some of those who want to get out can't because of stop - loss ? "
" A lot of men and women sign up because sometimes they will see developments , " Cheney said .
" For example , 9/11 stimulated a lot of folks to volunteer for the military because they wanted to be involved in defending the country . "
Referring to his talks with US service members in Iraq , the vice president said the men and women he speaks to are committed to the war .
" The thing that comes through loud and clear is how much they are committed to the cause , to doing what needs to be done to defend the nation , " Cheney said .
When asked about the toll multiple deployments have taken on U.S. military members , Cheney fired back with a question .
" Of course it is , Martha , " Cheney said .
" So what would be the solution to that ?
I mean how would you deal with that ? "
Possible Troop Drawdown
Today the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , recommended to Bush a " pause " in the drawdown of U.S. forces after the last surge combat brigade leaves in July .
The pause is expected to be four to eight weeks , after which another decision will made on resuming the drawdown .
There are currently more U.S. military members in Iraq than when the United States led the invasion of the country in March 2003 .
Petraeus has spoken on the record about his desire for a pause , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates has publicly endorsed the idea .
If the security situation is stable , Petraeus will likely signal that the drawdown can continue in the fall .
When asked about the possibility of resuming a U.S. military drawdown from Iraq in the fall , Cheney said what 's important is that the U.S. succeeds in Iraq .
" That is n't the way I think about it , " Cheney said , referring to the possibility of a drawdown .
" It 's important to achieve victory in Iraq .
It 's important to win , to succeed in the objective that we 've established . "
" It may be that we can make judgements about reductions down the road and the President will make those when the time arrives , but I do n't think he 's likely to try and say now what the force ought to be at the end of the year , " Cheney said .
" Conditions on the ground will determine that . "
Cheney Slams Democratic Candidates
Cheney dismissed the suggestion that a drawdown would be an important message to the Iraqi government that the United States was n't staying indefinitely in the country .
" The idea that we can walk away from Iraq is , I think , terribly damaging on its face , and to say that , ' well that 's the only way we can get the Iraqis to take on responsibility , ' I do n't believe that 's the case , " he said .
Without addressing the Democratic candidates specifically , the vice president said those who want to pull out of Iraq are " seriously misguided . "
He said the presidential candidates would be risking an attack on the homeland if US forces withdrew , arguing that terrorists would find safe havens in other countries .
Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both have said they 'd withdraw US forces from Iraq if elected president .
Sen . John McCain has advocated a continued U.S. presence in Iraq until security and political situations improve .
When asked if he was talking about any candidate in particular , Cheney said , " I am talking about any candidate for high office who believes the solution for our problem in that part of the world is to walk away from the commitments that we 've made in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere . "
Today the Democratic presidential candidates commented on the milestone of 4,000 US military dead in the war .
Tens of thousands of our brave men and women have also suffered serious wounds , both visible and invisible to their bodies their minds and their hearts , " Clinton said Monday in Philadelphia .
" As president , I intend to honor their extraordinary service and the sacrifice of them and their families by ending this war and bringing them home as quickly and responsibly as possible . "
In a released statement , Obama said : " It is past time to end this war that should never have been waged by bringing our troops home , and finally pushing Iraq 's leaders to take responsibility for their future . "
The 4,000 U.S. killed in Iraq figure includes seven civilians who worked for the military services while serving in Iraq .
Last week Cheney made headlines when asked about recent polls that show about two - thirds of Americans say the fight in Iraq is not worth it .
" So ? " Cheney replied during that interview .
" You do n't care what the American people think ? "
Raddatz asked the vice president at the time .
" You can't be blown off course by polls , " Cheney said during that interview .
Today , Cheney defended that answer .
" Look , there are alot of people out there , Martha , that do n't agree with me about a lot of things , but if I wanted to be loved , I 'd ought to be a TV correspondent , not a politician , " he said .

As a young child ( or perhaps even an adult ) who has n’t dreamed of living tree houses ?
Some structures are built on trees or hung from trees , but some unusual tree house building designs are even grown from trees or built right into a tree .
Some people live in trees as a luxury , some to help save the environment and others out of tradition or necessity .
Here are ten incredible tree house building designs and ideas that range from functional to fanciful , sustainable to strange and affordable to incredibly expensive .
Baumraum treehouses blends classic notions of a simple wood structure in a tree with modernist angles , clean lines and other design elements .
These both blend with and stand out from their natural environs and are customized to client wishes before being installed .
The Baumraum group is both experimental and experienced , wish expertise in tree types , capabilities and environmental impact .
The mobile , durable and somehow fanciful Free Spirit Spheres can be hung from anything from trees to buildings and rock faces .
Webbing and ropes literally and metaphorically anchor these spheres to their locations .
Just four anchor points are needed to carry the entire weight of the spheres .
Each sphere is waterproof and impact - resistant , composed of an internal laminated wood frame and clear fiberglass exterior .
The 4 Treehouse by Lukasz Kos floats like a “ Japanese lantern on stilts ” and is situated to accommodate four existing trees on the site .
As with the best tree house designs , this project successfully worked around the existing natural site conditions .
The three - story house itself rents suspended from these four primary site trees .
The TreeHouse Workshop is a Seattle - based company that takes the art of constructing tree houses extremely seriously .
They build an average of one tree house per month and hire extremely able builders and carpenters to construct their projects .
Their finished works vary in luxury but some even include ( counterintuitive ! ) fireplaces .
The 02 Sustainability Tree House defies many of the conventions one associates with a typical tree house .
The paradigm of a square shack - like wooden structure is replaced with a light and spacious geodesic dome structure that requires very little ( and eco- friendly ) material and has minimal impact on trees in which it is placed ( hanging from cables rather than bolted to trees ) .
It is designed for residential , meditation and meeting functions .
Of course , not all tree houses are avante garde examples of design and sustainability – some people live in far more traditional tree houses such as the tree dwellers shown in the photographs above .
In the jungles of the Brazza River Basin in the Indonesian province of Papua the local tribes have slowly built their way up into the trees to escape pests and one another .
Their residences now reach dizzying heights of over 100 feet .
This amazing Vietnamese tree house structure is a “ tree house ” in an entirely unconventional sense of the phrase and draws tourists and guests from around the world .
Of course not just anyone can get permission to build a house like this : it helps to be the daughter of the ex-president of the country .
Tourists are even able to stay in the rooms overnight .
It ’s one thing to chain oneself to a tree in order to save it , but quite another to live in one !
In order to save 400 + year old trees , a group of activists has been doing just that on impromptu suspended platforms that currently constitute the tallest “ tree house ” in the world ( top images above ) .
One clever designer has developed a series of conceptual strategies shown in the above images to take this approach to the next level .
With just 13 % of these old - growth trees left , these new structures would link from tree to tree providing habitats but also protecting the natural environment .
What if instead of building a tree house , you could grow it yourself ?
A combination of scaffolding and other systems could be used to direct the growth of these fascinating and creative concept tree houses over a period of years .
Vines , roots and trees become organic architectural materials to create a flexible framework for these curious creations .
Windows would be made of flexible soy membranes that would shift as the building grew .
The Syberite tree house project blends modular design with low - impact living .
Layouts are allowed to conform to the natural landscapes around them to take maximum advantage of views and natural light without disturbing the local environment .
The thin foundational supports are designed to minimize impact on root systems and the ground surface .
Rainwater collection , solar panels , wind collection and other sustainable systems are also integrated making the house mostly energy independent .
To wind down from the more wacky designs , the above video shows a simple traditional tree house being built – but sped up and using stop-motion techniques to illustrate the process .
For more sustainable designs be sure to see these collections of strange recycled architecture , unusual green vehicles , bizarre green art and incredible green roofs .
There are also some great books with more tree houses around the world , interesting tree houses in the United States and tree houses you can actually build .

yes this could grow into hundreds of sheets ( which would be awesome )
I would also suggest PHP be added to the list of potential candidates .
Are there going to be more advanced pages for any or all of these languages once the basic 's are all finished ?
PHP was begun here :
And yes , there will be more advanced functionality added to the second side of the beginner sheets - already begun for C++ and java , I believe .
I have not seen this technique before , but it sure worked with me .
I logged into a brand new web service today and this was my default profile picture .

食事に加えて、葉酸サプリを飲むことにすれば、不妊治療との協働効果を望むことができますので、葉酸を摂る習慣をつけて、和んだ暮らしをしてみてもいいのではないですか？
不妊症を治すことは、そんなに生易しいものじゃないと考えていた方が賢明です。ですが、諦めずに頑張れば、それを現実にすることはできるはずです。夫婦で協力し合いながら、不妊症から脱出しましょう。
「 赤ちゃんを宿す」、尚且つ「母子の両方ともに難なく出産にこぎ着けた」というのは、まさに人が想定している以上の奇跡の積み重ねだと言うことができると、過去の出産経験を通じて感じています。
筋肉は身体全体をコントロールするのは当然の事、血液を全身に行き渡らせる役目をしています。このため、筋肉を強くしますと子宮への血液循環も滑らかになることになり、冷え性改善につながることがあるわけです。
目下妊娠している女性も、葉酸サプリを摂ることにより、手間要らずで栄養を摂食することができますし、女性に摂取いただきたいと思って売りに出されている葉酸サプリなので、安心して大丈夫でしょう。
女性の方の妊娠に、役に立つ栄養が何種類か存在していることは、もうご存知かと思います。そういった妊活サプリの中で、どれが体にも影響なく、効果が期待できるのでしょうか。
We 'll Return , After This Message a science fiction story
by John Walker
December 1st , 1989
When the foundations of everything you think you know shift beneath you , you can feel it .
The night Art Crane and I found the Message , it felt like that moment at the onset of an earthquake when you realize the floor is really moving .
Even after twenty years , I can't recall that night without seeing reality shimmer slightly , like the distant mountains on a hot day .
What we found that January night expunged a century 's accumulated smugness about our place in the universe .
And the funny thing is , we were n't even looking in the right place .
In December of 1997 it seemed as if humanity was well on its way to figuring out the universe .
The discovery of the Proteus particle by de Vany , Trang , and Zweig handed the astronomers an all - in - one answer to the riddles of the missing mass and the solar neutrino deficit .
The human genome project was winding down having yielded , if little understanding , plenty of data .
The Soviet outer planet robots were flying in formation toward their Jupiter gravity kick , thence to Voyager 's ports of call and onward to Pluto and Charon .
The Shuttle was expected to return to flight any month .
That glorious daylight supernova of 1996 was just beginning to fade from the nighttime sky .
I figured Crane might call .
When I answered the phone on that rainy day after Christmas , I was n't surprised to hear his usual request , " Cliff - - I 'm down here at the office .
Could you come in and help me with something ? "
Art Crane 's a programmer , and a damned good one .
But mostly , he is the Bach of the wild - ass conjecture .
You can't spend ten minutes with him without hearing him suggest a new mechanism for speciation in biology , opining that the roots of monetary inflation lie in the domestication of animals , or wondering how we'd know if just a few electrons had different masses .
He writes every idea down in a little notebook he always carries , then he types them all in to his machine every night .
I have n't asked him how big the file is .
He reads everything , seems to know all , has opinions on any topic you can name but will gladly argue either side .
He brooks no inaccurate facts or sloppy reasoning .
He 's the kind of person who'd be intimidating and unapproachable , if only he ever finished anything .
He is n't a flake .
At least not all the time .
When he gets a Big Idea , he 's like a terrier .
He grabs it and shakes it till it falls apart .
Then he sniffs at the pieces .
For some reason , whenever he has a Big Idea , I always seem to get involved .
Not that I mind .
Except for the stock market idea .
That one I minded .
Christmas day , Crane and I had been invited to Hack Watkins ' for turkey dinner .
Later , as we watched Watkins ' kids reduce their holiday bounty to pieces siftable through chicken wire , Art was holding forth on his latest idea -- second - hand SETI .
He was fascinated by pre-discovery observations .
Galileo spotted Neptune and even charted it next to Jupiter in one of his notebooks .
If the next night had n't been cloudy , he 'd probably have discovered it more than 200 years before Adams and Le Verrier .
The year before , more than a hundred amateur astronomers took pictures showing the Orion supernova brightening before it burst into naked - eye visibility , but not one noticed it till after the fact .
Crane said this was inherent in modern science ; building big new machines and using them for bold searches was sexy and easy to fund , but rarely did anybody rummage through the dusty archives until something interesting had turned up in new data .
He figured that if we ever received a signal from another civilization , we 'd probably find dozens of others buried in the archives , easily located once we knew what to look for .
" The facts , dear Clifford , are not in our stars , but on our shelves . " he said , " Why do n't we look there ? "
When I headed home around midnight , he and Hack were kicking ideas back and forth about how image processing tools might be used to identify intelligent signals .
I showed up at the office around sunset .
Not a soul was there , and only a few programmers .
Crane , who never rose before the crack of noon , rarely undertook serious work before six .
I was surprised to discover him already in his office , surrounded by a midden of books , pieces of paper , and partially consumed processed food - like substances suggesting , by its height , that he'd been there for several hours .
He turned from the screen as I walked in , " Cliff , glad to see 'ya .
Look , we gotta get more crunch power on this job . "
This was the week for it .
The company always closed between Christmas and New Year's .
It was a tradition they called the " Annual Week Of Rest , " which was a fine joke because there was another tradition that the programmers would use a week devoid of managers , marketeers , meetings , and memoranda to try to out - do one another in huge bursts of concentrated effort to impress each other and just incidentally enrich their employer when they staggered back , bleary eyed , to another year of " regular work . "
Not that it was expected , of course -- but all the computers were left running that week anyway .
The Exalted Founder had started it 15 years ago and still kept at it , at least in theory .
Nobody could tell , actually ; he 'd gone through some kind of comprehensional singularity and nobody understood anything he'd done in the last five years .
Back in '97 Xanadu still was n't finished , but if you knew where to look and how to access it on the Net , you could get most of the machine - readable raw science data since 1970 .
The Net was installing a new software release over the holidays and had declared connect time and data transfers free between Christmas and January 5th to encourage users to test it .
Art proposed to make the most of this .
He planned to search all kinds of astronomical data , from the earliest radiotelescope sweeps to the downlink from the gamma ray imaging telescope in that converted shuttle tank with an algorithm he called the " annoyance filter . "
" Whatever the message is , and however they encode it , it 's going to be obvious , at least in retrospect .
Besides , " he said , " we have all the inarticulate bozos we need on Earth .
There 's no need to scour the galaxy for more . "
He figured the message would be a picture , and that it would be deliberately made easy to distinguish from a noisy background .
This was right down Crane 's alley .
A couple of years before he'd been obsessed with the idea of developing a program to discriminate television programs from commercials .
He wanted to start a company to make boxes that paused VCRs when commercials came on .
He considered it an artificial intelligence challenge , " If any idiot can fast forward past a commercial , why can't we design a program to zap 'em ? "
He spent the better part of a year 's spare time tweaking and tuning his algorithm before abandoning it ; toward the end it worked pretty well , but not good enough to sell -- it recorded moody commercials and edited out climactic scenes of cop shows .
It did zap all the car dealer ads .
He likened the problem to protective coloration .
" If television is a medium that delivers entertainment at the price of advertising , then advertising and entertainment will co-evolve to become indistinguishable in time . "
But in SETI , he believed , the incentives were different .
" Signal to noise !
Look , are you going to go before the Congress of Galactic Elders Subcommittee on Unessential Projects and try to justify spewing terawatts of soft - sell to the stars ?
Whatever they 're sending , it 's going to be obtrusive , blatant , shrill , noisy , coarse , and puffing .
It will be calibrated to attract , to rouse , and to entice .
Count on it ... it's advertising . "
He started by taking the commercial zapper and optimizing it for single still frames by training it on magazine advertisements .
Then he wrote a front end that scanned bit streams and applied a Fourier transform to recognize scan - line encoded images .
These he planned to link into a tool that could process several hundred megabytes of raw data per hour per machine , generating very few false positives for intelligent messages .
When I showed up , he said it was " coming along . "
There are several distinct phases in an Art Crane project .
The first is " inspiration ; " he 'll be consumed , usually without warning , by a Big Idea .
He 'll corner everybody in sight , talking a hundred words a minute , filling white boards with diagrams , shoving a sheaf of yellow paper in people 's faces , and otherwise explaining why what he just thought of is not only the most important project on the planet at that particular moment , but painfully obvious to any vertebrate .
Art has a talent for seeing how tools can fit together to do things they were n't designed for .
His ability to estimate the difficulty of all the tasks involved in his plans is more modest ; Hack Watkins once said " The only constraint on Crane 's armwaving about holes in his designs is that his fingertips can't exceed the speed of light . "
" Coming along " means he 's making steady progress , but does n't have much to show for it .
Eventually , he 'll get an initial , crude version to work , achieving a characteristically grandiose milestone he calls " initial operating capability . "
Thereupon he invariably " goes ballistic " as he begins to realize all the things he can add to the initial version .
" Ballistic " is evocative not only of Crane 's disregard of external guidance , but also of the frenzy and round - the - clock concentration that characterizes his efforts , rendering him in this mode more a force of nature than a colleague .
This ends at a point of exhaustion when he 's run out of things to add to the product or can't sustain the kind of effort he 's been putting in , whereupon he enters the " gory details " period as he attempts to clean up all the loose ends and render the result usable to people other than himself .
Finally , he deliberately " throttles back , " catches up on his reading , and comes within a standard deviation or so of a normal human being as he awaits the next Big Idea .
The progression of phases is as predictable as the Moon's , but their timing has none of the regularity of the cosmos , much to the exasperation of all who work with him .
Still , when he is good , he is very good indeed .
Three times in the last decade he had singlehandedly come up with the concept and initial prototype of products that now collectively accounted for half the company 's sales - - each one stemming from a Big Idea unrelated to his regular work .
This track record made management more than willing to endure his eccentricities and propensity to indulge in what Watkins called " art for Art 's sake . "
He picked up the pizza box to the left of his keyboard and carefully stacked it atop a pile of books to clear a workspace .
Grabbing a yellow pad and pen , he explained what he needed from me .
" We can do this , but we 've only got nine days till the Net starts charging again .
Remember that cycle sucker animal you built for the inlet problem ?
That 's what we need to drive the filter . "
For once , what he wanted was n't that hard .
Last year when we 'd worked on a hypersonic fluid flow problem for the Japanese spaceplane , I 'd partitioned the job to throw all the idle time on all of our workstations at it .
This was easier .
All I had to do was take the data stream from the Net and apportion it out to all the compute resources I could lay my mitts on with an eenie - meeine - miney - moe distributor .
With 500 workstations rated at a gigaflop or better sitting idle until the new year , we'd be able to cull a lot of data in a few days .
I went down the hall to my office , turned on the monitor , and set to work .
The linear flow of real time changed into programming hours , measured more by the accumulation of pop cans , pizza and chinese take - out boxes , and crumpled sheets of yellow paper than numbers on the wall clock .
Art continued to tune the annoyance filter while I developed tools to obtain raw data from the Net , translate them into a uniform format his program could read , and partition the compute job among the machines in the building .
Hours passed , then days .
I went home and slept when I was too tired to go on , and I presume he did too .
We 'd both finished by Monday the 29th .
When I arrived , Art had queued me mail saying " Ready when you are . "
I walked down the hall thinking how odd it was that I 'd been collaborating on a project with him , working in the same building , but had n't seen him for four days .
When I reached his office , I realized this was a good thing ; the remains bespoke a major ballistic episode .
Crane 's office resembled a centerfold from Toxic Waste Monthly .
I suppose an archaeologist could date the slices of pizza by the quantity of mold .
I focused on the task at hand .
It took a couple of hours to integrate Crane 's filter with my dispatcher .
When we were done , we ran some tests to measure the total compute power we were getting , then some known data checks to make sure we had n't messed anything up .
Around midnight we were ready to start on live data .
For the last several days I 'd been keeping our Net link busy transferring files we wanted to search to our local server since we could process on - site data much faster than remote files across the Net .
Also , I wanted to copy as much data as I could while Net access was free .
I did n't have the time to be very discriminating in my acquisitions ; if a Net site had some files of interest and did n't publish a huge amount of data , I just figured , " Grab it all .
Let Crane sort it out . "
I entered the command to start the root task .
It cloned itself onto every active workstation in the building , then each copy started pulling files to be searched from the master task queue and commenced scanning them with Crane 's annoyance filter .
The search was singularly unexciting .
My task monitor showed the volume of data we 'd scanned so far , the percent done , and the instantaneous compute power we were using .
There 's a feeling of power that comes from knowing you 're doing more calculations every minute than all of mankind did from Pithecanthropus Erectus to 1950 , but the novelty of even so remarkable a fact quickly pales into something akin to watching paint dry .
Every time Crane 's annoyance filter triggered , my control program popped up a window with the image on both our workstations and filed the picture for later examination in a directory called WOW .
The filter seemed to be working quite well .
We got an image about every hour -- mostly scanned illustrations from journal articles erroneously filed in raw data directories .
Art figured we could ditch them by looking for captions , but they were appearing so infrequently he decided not to delay the search to modify the program .
Around three A.M. Tuesday we were both taken aback when we found our first genuine interstellar message : a spacecraft , two beings , and some coded gibberish .
Art looked at the source information in the title bar and confirmed that we 'd discovered the Pioneer plaque in a NASA Goddard planetary image archive .
" Right message , wrong way , " he muttered .
We decided to call it a night .
With the search on autopilot , we could dial in from our home machines and scan the images in the WOW directory whenever we wanted .
I , for one , had no desire to spend any more time in Crane 's office until the janitors came in next week and cleaned it with a fire hose .
Tuesday , I slept late , gave the plants their biennial sip of water , unloaded the dishwasher , and did n't get around to dialing in to see if anything had been found until close to midnight .
I looked over the 20 - odd pictures in WOW and found the usual selection of false alarms .
I checked the login history and saw that Art was dialing in every couple of hours to scan the pictures .
The company was closed until Monday the 5th , so we'd have the better part of a week to continue the search .
I figured we could get through about a quarter of the obvious candidate data on the Net in that time .
The audacity of two programmers employed by a medium - sized software company searching three decades ' accumulated scientific knowledge for interstellar messages did n't occur to me .
I doubt Crane was capable of entertaining such a thought .
With the search for intelligent life in the universe toiling away , needing only sporadic attention , I turned my attention to serious work .
The company had bought one of the just - developed superconductive long range NMR scanners , and I was working on a prototype for a product I called " Fantastic Voyager " that let you fly around in a 3D image of your own body using the cyberspace gear we made .
The job was challenging both from the standpoint of identifying the different tissue types from the NMR samples , and in developing navigation models to let you trace the paths of blood vessels and nerves through the body .
Since my home machine had all the power and storage I needed , I worked there , as usual disappearing into the project and surfacing only sporadically to eat , sleep , or dial in to scan the WOW directory .
Wednesday night I stopped by Bart Lazslo's New Year 's
Eve party for a couple of hours and was amused to hear Crane grandiloquently describing our little holiday hack as the " Crane / Slatkin Quest For Galactic Intelligence . "
He related our discovery of the Pioneer plaque much more dramatically than I could have , or , for that matter , than the facts justified .
He 'd brought a portable computer and hooked it up to show pictures from the WOW directory on Bart 's projection TV .
He 'd even programmed a scrolling subtitle , " LIVE from the accumulated wisdom of mankind . "
Much to the amusement of those irritated by Crane 's antics , that night the fount of wisdom yielded up a scatter plot of globular cluster velocities , what appeared to be a calibration signal for an interferometry run , and , at the stroke of midnight , an order form for the " Proceedings of the 1993 IAU Vienna Workshop On Relativistic Jets " .
Sue Hardiman went to the piano and composed a song on the spot .
All I remember is ,
Crane pursued the aliens ,
Through the archives on the Net .
But the aliens came and kidnapped Crane ,
In their Relativistic Jets .
When I left , they were still adding verses of monotonically decreasing quality .
Crane was singing along lustily .
I spent the rest of the week in a happy blur , working on Fantastic Voyager .
Every now and then Crane or I would notice something amusing in the WOW directory and send mail pointing it out , but otherwise I did n't pay much attention to the search .
By Sunday night , Fantastic Voyager was working pretty well .
After tiring of flying lazy orbits around my pancreas , I finished up the documentation describing Fantastic Voyager .
Another part of the Week of Rest tradition was that the day the company reopened , papers describing the programmers ' projects would appear in everybody 's mailbox and the software would be on display in the Demo Lab .
After I queued the paper to the mail system , I drove down to the office around midnight to install Fantastic Voyager on the lab machine and make sure it worked there .
Also , I wanted to double check that the Quest was set to shut down before 5 A.M. when the Net started charging again .
At normal prime time rates , our data transfers for the Quest would 've gone through my monthly salary every day , and I was n't about to get docked a couple of weeks ' pay due to a typo .
Crane was in his office , writing up his Week of Rest project , a redesign of an obscure internal algorithm that would speed up one of our products about 30 % .
He 'd actually cleaned the place up , to the extent of even returning most of the books to the bookshelves that covered the walls .
We chatted for a couple minutes , then I went down to the Demo Lab and he returned to his documentation .
As usual , my demo did n't work the first time -- I had to dial into my home machine and copy some files and rebuild .
Anyway , it was almost three before I was satisfied it would work that afternoon .
I went back to my office and locked up , then stopped by Crane 's on the way out .
He 'd finished and queued his document , and was idly flipping through the 150 or so pictures in WOW .
He said we 'd accomplished something worthwhile and suggested we should write a paper about the Quest .
Every message we 'd found , after all , was the product of intelligence .
If we 'd broadcast the Net feed to the stars , any civilization with our program would have found ample evidence of intelligence .
He thought we might be able to persuade the investigators on the various radiotelescope projects to routinely run our filter over their data , forwarding all the images it found to us for examination .
We talked about how we should phrase such a paper and what journal might publish it , and so on , in the kind of lazy - days bull session exhausted programmers are prone to as they sit on a virtual veranda on the banks of the Mighty Megaflop and watch time and data flow by .
" Peep . "
Another image popped up on the screen : a NASA logo .
Crane hit the key to file it away .
It was already four , so we decided to sit around and make sure the Quest terminated on schedule at 4:50 .
Nobody'd be expecting any programmers to show up much before two P.M. , so there was n't any reason not to see it through .
Our conversation was describing a chaotic orbit around the usual attractors of evolution , anarchy , programming languages , quantum electronics , and office politics , when we got another " Peep . "
It was 4:32:19.217 PST .
I can vouch for the time ; it 's in the execution log .
My memory of what happened after the image popped up on Crane 's screen is less precise .
We glanced at the screen , then we stared at it .
The image filled about a quarter of the screen ; it was 2039 by 2053 pixels .
Four bold black diagonal stripes set off each corner and continued as thin alternating black and white pinstripes along the edges of the image .
Had the upper left stripe proclaimed " New ! , " the layout would 've blended indistinguishably into Time or Scientific Enquirer .
What was within the border was another matter entirely .
The figures on the right were humanoid , but not human .
They were simply the best aliens I 'd ever seen : there was n't a single missing or disproportionate characteristic about them , but they were all wrong to be humans .
There were two adults , male and female -- the female was holding a little one .
On the left was what was clearly a conversion table between binary numbers represented by " - " and " | " and eight digit symbols .
The middle of the picture was divided into four boxes , three with a large central dot , curved lines , and nomenclature using the eight digits .
The fourth contained what could only be an orrery presentation of a planetary system .
At the bottom were four rows of 64 of the digits given at the left of the picture .
Crane was n't a practical joker and neither was I , but after Lazslo 's party all the usual suspects knew what we were up to , and half a dozen of them would enjoy nothing more than sending us on a merry chase .
Art rolled his chair over to the screen to check the source .
I looked over his shoulder .
We looked at each other .
Suddenly I knew how Penzias and Wilson must have felt when they concluded that they 'd either discovered pigeonshit in their antenna or the birth cry of the Universe .
What we were looking at was either the most brilliantly executed gotcha I had ever encountered , or , well ... precisely what it appeared to be .
Art copied the source identifier , " HGIDB11 - 23@NIH.GOV " into his notebook , tore out the page , and said " I think you 'd better verify this across the Net , and do n't use any software we 've developed this week ; it may have been tricked . "
Just to be extra careful , I dialed into one of the commercial compute services the company subscribed to and used standard retrieval and image processing tools in that system 's library to extract the image from the location Crane 's filter had spotted it , accessing the read - only master published copy of the database across the Net .
It took me two hours to be sure .
When I returned to Crane 's office , the eastern sky was brightening with dawn .
It was going to be one of those windy January days when the air is so clear even the distant mountains seem close enough to touch .
Yet on this morning , only the weather seemed clear .
Crane had also been checking out the Message .
If I 'd been more selective in choosing data to scan , we 'd never have found it .
There could be no doubt ; the Message was real , and it was right smack in the middle of where it most definitely did n't belong .
We had found it in the NIH Human Genome database .
Every human who 'd turned his eyes skyward wondering , " Are we alone ? " had been carrying the answer , all along , in every cell of his body .
Since then the same Message has been found in every mammalian genome that 's been dumped , yet nowhere else in the animal kingdom .
That checks with the age of the Message .
Three of the boxes in the middle of the Message are orthogonal views of the Local Group galaxies , centered on the nucleus of the Milky Way .
Running their motion forward from the positions in the chart to the present day dates the Message at about 250 million years before the present : just about the age of mammals .
The orrery indicates they came from the fifth planet of a star with six terrestrial planets and three gas giants .
Which star ?
Nobody has a clue , and what with differential motion over an entire circuit of the Galaxy , any position in the Message would be worthless anyway .
Whoever wove that Message into our DNA meant it to last until we figured out how to read it -- it 's built inextricably into the protein expression mechanism so any organism with a corrupted copy wo n't be viable .
It 's obvious in retrospect .
If a visitor wants to leave a message , why not make it a self - reproducing , error - correcting message that any sentient race would stumble upon as soon as they undertook to reverse engineer their own design ?
Crane immediately suggested what 's become the consensus hypothesis about the number at the bottom of the Message .
He thinks it 's the product of very large prime numbers and that when we manage to factor it , they 'll be the key to decode the second Message .
Two problems : first , we either need to learn a whole lot more about factoring , build computers a million times faster than the latest quantum electronic models , or else wait the tens of millions of years it looks like factoring that number will take .
Second , we have yet to find the other Message .
Nothing more has been found in the genome , although Crane and many others suspect the factors of the key number may direct us to additional information there .
The intensive radio SETI program sparked by the Message has proved barren .
So have the planetary explorations of the past 15 years , spawned by the possibility that those who placed the Message may have left a calling card somewhere in the Solar System .
More recently , the limitations of robots in seeking the unexpected has triggered the rapid expansion of the human presence into space .
If we 've found nothing , we 've learned much , and perhaps we 've taken our first steps in the footprints of those who left the Message in our genes .
Crane believes that when we find the second Message and are able to read it , we 'll have proved ourselves ready for the instructions it contains .
He thinks it will tell us how to find those who left it , and how to go there .
We 'll return , after this Message , and I think they 'll be proud of us .
They were already proud when they put the Message there a Galactic year ago .
Proud enough to have signed their work .

Overthinking , the curse of the rank beginner
Most Top 10 lists are gratuitous examples of loose and woolly thinking .
Still , you sometimes come across a gem .
Some of the most hard - boiled advice for creative work comes in the form of the Top 10 Things They Never Taught me in Design School courtesy of architect Michael McDonough .
( I count science as a semi-creative endeavor . )
The point that struck me most was number 4 : " Do n't over - think a problem . "
McDonough 's point was that all too often , we over - elaborate an idea into a needlessly baroque version of itself .
" Every other critic I ever had always tried to complicate and prolong a problem when , in fact , it had already been solved .
Designers are obsessive by nature .
This was a revelation .
Sometimes you just hit it .
The thing is done .
Move on . "
But something about this piece of advice gnawed at me — there 's more going on .
In McDonough 's complaint about overthinking , I think he 's hinting at a much deeper phenomenon , namely that there are really two very different modes of thinking , and we often default to one mode when we should be operating in the other .
For the purposes here , I 'll call them overthinking , and bodythinking .
I remember when I was little , when I 'd blurt out some kind of childish idiocy , my mother would , after a quick rap on the knuckles , remind me to think before I speak up .
I remember thinking how that did n't make any sense : when we speak , we do n't think about what we say before saying it .
Thinking occurred in the very act of speaking .
If I were to eliminate saying stupid things , it can only be out of habit , not through some kind of higher order cognitive process cutting off stupidity at the tongue .
For most of our education , we 're encouraged to manipulate abstract rules , and sterile logical thinking .
this is the essence of overthinking – the manipulation of totally abstract , and abstruse rules of logic .
This is the domain where the IQ measure rules .
IQ questions focus on spotting symbolic patterns , and making spatial relations .
IQ tests test abstract thinking , or overthinking .
And certainly useful as an educational heuristic , it has very little place in the real world .
Although I have friends who value their IQ quotient , I have never taken the test .
Low or high , an IQ score tells us little about useful thinking .
Real useful thinking is always contextual , bounded by a real world situation .
Even in mathematics , arguably the most abstract of the academic disciplines , a high IQ does not necessarily qualify one to become a great mathematician .
There is more to doing deep mathematics than being a member of MENSA .
In pretty much every introductory philosophy class , the case of the famous Wason four - card problem is always trotted out .
This is a perfect example of overthinking .
In the Wason problem , the students are first given a logical relation between numbers printed on one side of a card , and letters on the other side .
Then , four cards are presented , such that only one card needs to be flipped over to check the consistency of the logical inference .
The students are asked to reason about the logical inference and choose the card to flip .
Of course , most students get it wrong .
But a later study found that the Wason problem misses how we really we think .
The later study phrased the same logical relationship of the Wason problem , not in terms of an abstract relation between numbers and letters , but as an ordinary relationship between the age of a punter and underage drinking .
Then , four punters are shown .
Pretty much everyone works out which punter needs to be checked for illegal drinking .
This shows that we can all reason logically , but we need a context to do it in .
It is the abstraction – the overthinking – that trips us up .
Overthinking is the great divider between the pro and the neophyte , or in the case of science , the grad student and the postdoc .
A student immersing herself into a field for the first time has no context – no knowledge of the principles , the jargon , the rules of the game .
To come to any conclusion about a difficult scientific question , they run through the freshly crammed rules as if they were a set of abstract rules , just like an IQ test .
The expert works very differently .
In his vastly entertaining study of snap judgements " Blink " , Malcolm Gladwell shows that , for instance , art historians make complex decisions about the authenticity of a work in but a fraction of a second .
They do not so much as think through a maze of inferences but feel the answer as a perception , even a pain in the gut .
In his memoir , G. H. Hardy likens the arduous process of solving a serious mathematical process to working on a loose tooth with the tongue .
It is no accident that Hardy uses such a body metaphor to describe the process of thinking mathematically .
Expert thinking is bodythinking .
Bodythinking implies that the process of thinking is lived through , and felt , not reasoned through the conscious mind .
Perhaps a better example is the one that Hubert Dreyfus gives to explicate the Heidegerrian notion of " Being - In - The - World " , which is a much more complete concept of bodythinking .
Dreyfus too , tackles the difference between the beginner and the expert behavior , in two very different disciplines – chess and tennis .
In chess , Dreyfus summarizes the bountiful research on reaction times and playing behavior of chess players .
The surprising thing is that during a game , both beginners and experts consider a similar number of moves .
The expert does not grind through more calculations the beginner .
Instead , the expert can see more in a board than a beginner .
When shown a random snapshot of a game , the expert will typically be able to remember and recall it later with ease , like recognizing a face .
Not so , for the beginner .
The rules of chess have been embodied in the perception of the chess playing expert .
However there are limits .
When shown a randomly generated board of chess pieces , including positions that cannot possibly be generated in a real game , the expert will be unable to remember the position easily .
Dreyfus also studied the phenomenon of choking in tennis – how great tennis players sometimes break down inexplicably in a big game .
Dreyfus argues that the transition from beginner to expert is to embody a complicated set of body movements – the tennis serve – from a set of disjointed analytical movements , into a unthinking action .
The server embodies the motion .
It is subconscious .
Only if an action is embodied , can a athlete perform at high capacity .
But in the heat of a big game , the athlete starts to worry about his skill , and in that moment , loses confidence in the embodied action .
The athlete then starts thinking about the serve , and consequently tries to consciously adjust the action , thus bypassing the embodied action .
He will then serve like a beginner again .
Choke .
I find that now , after working over 10 years as a scientist , that reading a scientific paper is a much different activity than it was I when I started .
Whereas before , I would struggle with opaque paragraphs , ill - defined terms , and incomprehensible manipulations , now , when I read a paper , I read by first putting my mind on automatic , then I mechanically read the prose of the paper , trying to keep as much of the text in my head at once , and wait for something interesting to jump out at me .
I scan the lines in a text like a hunter trying to find the tail of the stag in a dense leafy forest .
The difficulty is in the process of continually pushing through the text , not in identifying interesting , and important points .
The difference between expert and beginner , is embodiment .
What , for the beginner , is a set of arbitrary but logical rules , becomes for the expert , a series of gut reaction .
Working through a problem , is a slow body process , like digesting a full rich meal .
Indigestion occurs when you overthink too much .
A cichlid swims in a tank at Palma aquarium in Palma de Mallorca on the Spanish island of Mallorca July 16 , 2007 .
Scientists plan to launch 60 baby cichlid fish on a zero gravity rocket ride from above the Arctic Circle on Monday to try to plumb the secrets of motion sickness .
REUTERS / Dani Cardona
STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - Scientists plan to launch 60 tiny fish on a zero gravity rocket ride from above the Arctic Circle on Monday to try to plumb the secrets of motion sickness .
Tomas Hedqvist , project manager for Sweden ’s Esrange Space Centre , said the baby cichlid fish will head 260 km ( 160 miles ) into the air on an 11 - metre ( 36 - foot ) two - stage rocket , where they will experience six minutes of weightlessness .
Experimenters Reinhard Hilbig and Ralf Anken of the University of Stuttgart - Hohenheim in Germany will train six video cameras on the fish , each of which will be housed in its own aquarium , to see how they react .
“ Fish , when they get motion sick , begin tumbling around , swimming in circles and miss their balance , ” he said , adding that some fish do not suffer from motion sickness and seem to adapt quickly to a changed environment .
Some of the fish , which were flown from Germany to Sweden ’s far north in special aquariums , will be housed in a slowly turning centrifuge which will offer some gravity while others will be in a pure zero G state , Hedqvist said .
After the flight , the scientists will examine the video camera recordings as well as small balance organs -- called otoliths -- which exist naturally in the heads of each fish to work out what makes some sick and others not .
“ People when they are aboard the space shuttle they have this space motion sickness also .
Human beings have blood pressure up in the head when they are weightless and also bones get weak and muscles get small , ” Hedqvist said .
“ They use fish since it ’s much easier to investigate on fish ( than ) human beings . ”
Earlier related experiments sent cichlid fish on parabolic plane rides -- which involve a steep ascent followed by a plunge -- but Hedqvist said these only offered 20 - 30 seconds of weightlessness and were too short for clear conclusions .
1. 1914 : A Prehistoric Dinosaur Leads the Wave of the Future
In the early 20th century , theaters were already showing animated films on the big screen , but the characters were usually no more than spokesdrawings for various advertisers .
That is , until Winsor McCay drew his way onto the scene in 1914 .
The legendary cartoonist , who 'd earlier become famous with his classic comic strip , " Little Nemo , "  believed that animated characters could hold an audience 's attention without the help of a sales pitch .
With that in mind , McCay created the groundbreaking film Gertie the Dinosaur .
The most innovative part about the movie 's animation was the way McCay interacted with it .
Gertie actually started out as part of McCay 's " chalk talk "  vaudeville act , and rather than having Gertie attempt talking via speech balloons , McCay spoke for both of them .
Standing on stage next to a projected image of the dinosaur and holding a whip , he would bark out commands like , " Dance , Gertie ! " 
Then , suddenly , the image would change and she would obey .
In another sequence , McCay would toss an apple behind the screen and the impish dinosaur would appear to catch it in her mouth .
Eventually , McCay was ready to let Gertie loose on the big screen by herself .
Using cell animation and drawing thousands of illustrations of his beloved dinosaur , he turned Gertie into one of the first successful character - based animated cartoons .
With such ingenuity and style , it 's clear why McCay was often called " The Father of American Cartoons . " 
2. 1920s : Charles Lindbergh and the Queen Fall for the Same Cat
Because live - action films were such a big hit with moviegoers , early cartoon characters were often modeled on popular actors of the day .
One such cartoon character was Master Tom — a black feline with enormous eyes and an inviting ear - to - ear grin .
His creator , legendary animator Otto Messmer , based the cat 's personality on silent - film star Charlie Chaplin .
Fitting because , within a year , a slightly boxier version of the cat , now named Felix , started appearing regularly in animated shorts before Chaplin 's feature films .
The fact that cartoon characters were still speaking in speech balloons hardly affected Felix 's popularity .
By 1923 , the cat 's star power at the box office rivaled not only Chaplin's , but Buster Keaton 's and Fatty Arbuckle 's , as well .
From Germany to China , people were fascinated by the technology that enabled Felix to take his tail off and turn it into a pencil or a question mark or a shovel , and they could n't wait to see what gags Messmer would dream up next .
In fact , the wily feline became such a celebrity in Great Britain that Queen Mary named her own cat after him .
Back in America , Felix 's popularity continued to soar , literally , as a picture of him accompanied Charles Lindbergh on his historic flight across the Atlantic .
The character 's adventures did n't stop there , though ; Felix was also the first image ever successfully transmitted by RCA during its early TV experiments .
3. 1920s : Doing
It for the Kids
Although Walt Disney 's impact on the world of animation can't be downplayed , much of the credit for the studio's trademark style belongs to animator Ub Iwerks .
A boyhood pal of Walt's , Iwerks served as Disney 's righthand man .
And where Disney had the business sense , Iwerks had the technical know - how to create characters that moved with fresh elasticity .
Mickey Mouse 's predecessor , Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , was Iwerks ' creation .
Oswald had big floppy ears that appeared almost rubbery when he walked .
So while characters like Felix the Cat might have squeezed themselves through telephone lines , Disney characters had a softer profile .
Ultimately , it upped the hugability factor , and that paid off with a whole new audience — children .
4. 1928 : When the Mouse Speaks , People Listen
While Disney 's animation house floated by for a while , it was n't until Walt made his first " talkie "  that America truly started buzzing about him .
1928 's Steamboat Willie signaled the end of the silent - film era .
Disney had followed engineers ' experiments with sound and film throughout the 1920s , and he was convinced talkies were the future .
Even though Mortimer Mouse ( who Disney 's wife wisely re-christened Mickey ) never actually speaks a complete sentence during Steamboat Willie , he more than makes up for it with his whistling — not to mention his energetic xylophone performance on the teeth of an open - mouthed bovine .
The combination of dazzling , synchronized music and pictures of a kid- friendly , large - eared mouse made Mickey and Walt Disney household names .
In fact , the success of Steamboat Willie spawned a stream of new films , including 1929 's The Opry House — the movie in which Mickey dons his trademark white gloves for the first time .
5. 1930s : Marketing Kills the Animation Star
Although cartoons continued to be made for adults first , children second , one thing in the industry did change .
From about 1930 onwards , many of Disney 's merchandising efforts were geared toward kids .
In addition to Mickey Mouse dolls , there were combs , watches , pencils , T - shirts , coins , and even bedsheets — all of them exported the world over .
It was n't long before Mickey became one of the most recognizable symbols of America .
In 1935 , The League of Nations proclaimed Mickey Mouse a " symbol of universal goodwill . " 
All that attention came with plenty of responsibility , though .
The economic pressure of the marketing strategy forced Disney to erase Mickey 's mischievous side and turn him into an all - around Mr. Nice Guy .
And while the move succeeded in boosting merchandising sales , it did the opposite for Mickey 's on - screen popularity .
The mouse 's star power was soon usurped by the naughtier , hot - tempered Donald Duck , who made it cool to be bad .
Disney attempted a comeback for the mouse by giving Mickey a more bad - boy role in 1940 's Fantasia , but the film was a box office flop .
It was n't until The Mickey Mouse Club premiered in 1955 that Mickey began to regain his star status .
6. 1930 : Betty Boop Gets Sexed Up ( and Shot Down )
During the early days of animation , Disney 's studio was n't the only one having trouble defining its characters ' personalities .
Max Fleischer ( creator of Popeye ) also had a giant hit on his hands with the seductive , garter - wearing flapper Betty Boop .
However , some theater managers began reporting that their conservative audiences found the pint - size coquette too risquÃ© , and in 1935 , Betty became the first cartoon character to be censored by the Hays Office .
Forced to make a change , Fleischer responded by transforming her into a more wholesome and domesticated lady .
Sadly , the makeover proved fatal .
By the end of the decade , Betty had fallen into her own Great Depression , never to be heard boop - boopy - dooping again .
7. 1933 : Toons Get Looney
Four of the most original and creative artists ever to come along —
Tex Avery , Chuck Jones , Friz Freling , and Robert McKimson — had a different philosophy when it came to their animated creations : the zanier , the better .
As the minds behind such classic characters as Daffy Duck , the Tasmanian Devil , Elmer Fudd , and Bugs Bunny , the animators made sure their stars ran wild , shouted at the top of their lungs , and killed , maimed , blew up , slugged , shot , and destroyed their foes .
They even dressed 'em up in drag when the occasion called for it .
As the Warner Brothers slogan promised at the beginning of each film , these were , indeed , Looney Tunes .
But it was n't just their wackiness that made the Looney Tunes the largest collection of animated stars any studio had ever created .
It was their animators ' inventiveness .
Bugs and Daffy were two of the first characters aware of their own cartoon - ness , which meant they were not only characters , but actors , as well .
And while Felix the Cat may have been able to turn his tail into a baseball bat , Bugs Bunny could play pitcher , catcher , umpire , and himself all at the same time .
8. 1941 : Animators Strike Back
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs might have had a happy ending , but for the animators working behind the scenes , things were less than fairytale .
Cramming to meet the film 's deadline , many artists worked well into the night with the understanding that they'd get bonuses once the film earned back its money .
The film grossed oodles , but instead of doling out bonuses , Disney earmarked his handsome profits for a new studio he wanted built in Burbank .
Fighting back , the Screen Cartoonists Guild went up against the Disney powerhouse in 1941 .
The ensuing strike lasted more than two months , and it took a White House intervention to halt it .
The dispute was only settled when F.D.R. sent in mediators and forced Walt to cave .
Although the strike served as a disappointing reality check in the animation world , it ultimately sparked a series of positive changes in the industry .
Artists were finally given on - screen credit for their work , and wages for 40 - hour weeks doubled .
9. 1942 : X Marks the Rating
At times , the Warner Brothers ' lunacy knew no bounds .
During World War II , they created racy cartoons solely for American soldiers stationed in Europe .
Full of expletives , X - rated images , and the occasional scatological humor , these animated shorts featured an inept trainee named Private Snafu .
Amazingly , one of Snafu 's writers was Ted Geisel , better known as Dr. Seuss .
Other wartime WB cartoons created for regular civilian consumption featured edgy characterizations of Hitler and Mussolini that would never pass military muster today .
For instance , in " Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips , "  Bugs sells ice cream bars stuffed with hand grenades to Japanese soldiers he affectionately calls " Slant Eyes . " 
Not exactly politically correct by modern standards .
10 . 1956 : Cartoons Go Prime Time
Following the disillusionment of the Disney strike in 1941 , hundreds of animators were motivated to set out on their own .
Zachary Schwartz , David Hilberman , and Stephen Bosustow were three of the most notable Disney artists to take the opportunity to head in a new direction .
The result was United Productions of America , better known as UPA .
Whereas every year Disney pushed its cartooning style further toward realism and literalism , UPA pushed its style toward contemporary art .
Disney 's characters were soft and cuddly , while UPA 's were angular and almost cold .
And while Disney was mainly interested in animating animals , UPA made humans the stars of its films — and it paid off .
One of its first big hits was Gerald McBoing - Boing ( the brainchild of Dr. Seuss , who collaborated with UPA on the series ) , which beat out both Tom & Jerry and Mr. Magoo for the 1951 Oscar .
In 1956 , CBS turned the film short into a Sunday afternoon TV series .
And although the show did n't last nearly as long as later animated series such as The Flintstones , McBoing - Boing — and the UPA animators — have had a huge impact on the world of animation .
From the minimalist backgrounds of Spongebob Squarepants to the flat , cutout look of South Park , the studio has influenced more than a half - century of cartoons by showing animators that it 's OK to avoid realism altogether .
