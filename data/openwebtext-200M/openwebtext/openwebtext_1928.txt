BAGHDAD ( CNN ) --
As a way to draw attention from American shortcomings in Iraq , the U.S. is accusing Iran of trying to destabilize the war - torn country , the Iranian ambassador to Iraq told CNN .
U.S. Army troops guard a checkpoint in the Mansour district in Baghdad , Iraq .
" U.S. security plans for Iraq have not succeeded , " Hassan Kazemi - Qomi said earlier this week .
" The administration is pointing fingers at others , and by accusing others try to cover up their own failed plans , " he said .
" If you look at the Iraqi scene , just in the past several months , you will see clearly that terrorist and sabotaging forces , as also agreed by U.S. officials , are from those who have come from outside Iraq , and , U.S. authorities too have said , are mostly from countries whose governments are , on the surface of things , U.S. allies .
The U.S. government does not confess this reality . "
And while it is true the U.S. and Iran have no diplomatic relations and " we have differences , " Kazemi - Qomi said , " thus far , not one Iranian youth , not a single Iranian citizen has engaged in suicide and terrorist attacks against American troops in Iraq . "
On Wednesday , the top U.S. general in Iraq repeated to reporters what U.S. officials have previously said : That Iranian operatives in Iraq pose a danger to the country .
Gen . David Petraeus cited training , arming and funding of insurgents in Iraq " and in some cases directing of elements through the use of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Quds force . "
There is " a sophistication of attacks that would by no means be possible without Iranian support , " he said .
Petraeus ' comments came after he and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker testified during two days of congressional hearings on the state of affairs in Iraq .
Their report " resembles a theatrical scenario more than anything , " Kazemi - Qomi said .
" Under the current circumstances , the Americans are making two strategic mistakes , " he said .
" The first mistake is their effort to return , to bring back to power people accused of murders from the previous regime . "
He appeared to be referring to a July report in which the White House said the Iraqi government was not making satisfactory progress in " de - Baathification " and some members of Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party were being allowed back into government .
" The second mistake , " Kazemi - Qomi said , " is arming some groups and some terrorist groups in Iraq that worked against the Iraq people until yesterday and continue their terrorist activities against the government of Iraq .
The U.S. is arming these groups in the name of supporting tribes without coordination with the Iraqi government . "
This action is " building a crisis on the sidelines of the main events that are going on in Iraq , which is creating a schism among different tribes , " Kazemi - Qomi said .
Iran recommends that the U.S. end these policies if it wants to solve the problems and serve Iraq , he said .
" Instead of arming forces that act outside the law and government , the U.S. should arm and help the government , army and the police , " Kazemi - Qomi said .
Earlier this week , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country could help secure Iraq -- if coalition forces leave .
If the U.S. is concerned about the situation in Iraq , it must " support the Iraq government to establish its own army and allow other neighboring countries who want to help in this respect to step in , " Kazemi - Qomi said .
He also declared that Tehran was not concerned about the prospect of the United States expanding the war in Iraq to Iran .
" We have no fear of the outbreak of war .
In the past several months , under different pretexts , the Americans tried to create a U.S. - Arab alliance against Iran .
But it did n't work , and we do n't have any problems with the Arab countries . "

My recent column that references OSHA ’s silly grouping of firearm ammunition with true explosives , equating to a potential ban on ammunition sales , elicited quite a few comments ( apologies for misrepresenting the possibly apocryphal story about Bush 41 ’s encounter with a supermarket scanner ) .
One strain within this motivates me to clarify my own views of the role guns play in the current and future battle for liberty .
Folks , at the risk of offending a lot of LRC readers , I have to admit that I think guns will play no direct role in this battle whatsoever .
In the age of overwhelming government power where no habitable place on the globe is free from domination by one nation - state or another , it is simply impossible that armed men are going to secede and then win an ensuing firefight with government minions .
In every case where old forms of government are cast off , sometimes to the accompaniment of gunfire , there is always an undercurrent of ideas that creates the necessary commitment of residents to the new paradigm .
These ideas may be good or evil , but it is the ideas , not the bullets , that are the necessary ingredient for change .
In today ’s America we are on the fast track toward the Total State where no element of human existence is free from the suffocating influence of government employees .
In some respects we ’re already there , since who among us would give our child a swat on the rump in public without immediately worrying about someone calling the local u201CChild Protection Agency , u201D and as we know today ’s government employees even dictate how much water a flush toilet can use .
This fast track exists because our friends , neighbors , and co-workers accept the premises on which the Total State is built .
They accept the notion , without thought , that by aggregating tax money and the power to direct human choice in the hands of a few elected and ( far more commonly ) appointed persons the whole product of government will be greater than the sum of its parts .
They believe that the United States government and all its vassals at the state and local levels are institutions that produce more than they consume ; they see the government as the sole exception in the universe to the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
People almost universally see things this way despite the daily litany and lifetime experience of waste , corruption , and sleaze that accompany every level of government .
Even government employees whose daily work immerses them in waste and resource misallocation hold faith that there ’s no alternative to this massive institution that early in the twenty - first century has crowded out or co-opted nearly all other lawful forms of human organization .
Against this backdrop we still are occasionally treated to exhortations to stock up on battle rifles and case quantities of ammo in preparation for the Second American Revolution .
To me this creates a dangerous notion and understandably makes our neighbors ( the ones that read such things without understanding the underlying philosophy ) nervous .
Acquiring skill with a rifle or pistol is great sport .
Unlike golf ( also a game of concentration and self - control more than physical strength or stamina ) , shooting has a side - benefit of having a practical application in self - defense .
Sometimes , however , people get carried away with this .
First , since the state is our neighbors ’ only real source of acceptable violence , any effort to employ violence against the state ’s employees will always be interpreted badly by the neighbors .
Nobody fights the law without the law winning because the neighbors identify with the law .
Violence against the state in any form simply becomes a rationalization for repression .
As long as the state is seen by a plurality of our neighbors as Mother , Father , Protector , and Provider , all violence simply strengthens those who rule .
What could set the cause of liberty back further than the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing or the events of 9/11 ?
People who employ violence against government facilities or employees are the identical twins of totalitarians everywhere .
Second , since the state monopoly on violence rests on popular belief , even violence employed in self - defense against freelance criminals will always be viewed in the most negative light possible .
This makes employment of even u201 Cjustified u201D violence quite risky from a legal standpoint .
Violence employed in self - defense is thus a very last resort and nothing to be joked about or taken lightly .
Guns do matter .
They matter philosophically because free men and women do not depend on the state ’s minions for their own personal safety .
They are thus an indicator of citizen power versus government power at the moral level .
I carry a spare tire and a jack in my car , but I still try to avoid conditions that might cause a flat , and even if I get a flat there ’s a decent chance I ’ll call AAA to get a professional to change the tire .
The jack and the spare simply give me the option to change the tire should circumstances warrant and avoid my being wholly dependent upon tow - truck businesses .
Given that in this case the government analogy to the tow truck industry is a tax - supported police monopoly , it ’s no stretch of imagination to suspect that complete and total citizen dependence on the police for crime suppression would be the Gift that Keeps on Giving to police unions engaged in collective bargaining .
Only a cynic would suggest the cops might become scarce in middle class residential areas during negotiations … right ?
Guns also matter practically by providing deterrence to freelance criminals .
America has always been a relatively violent place and we know from other western countries that removing the threat of potential violence from the hands of average citizens creates nothing more than a free - fire range where Joe Citizen is trapped between the ( armed ) cops and the ( armed ) robbers .
In this sense privately owned guns deter by their potential employment , not by the body count of criminals shot by victims .
Guns in private citizens ’ hands increase the cost of victimizing people ; elementary economics tells us to expect that reducing or eliminating this cost should make the quantity of violent crime u201 Cprovided u201D increase .
This appears to be consistent with experience in the UK , Jamaica , and other places enforcing a legal monopoly of government gun ownership .
In sum , gun ownership is very important but the real war is one of ideas .
You are on the front lines with General Lew , parrying the lies , myths , and obfuscations of the enemy with rhetorical jabs and penetrating questions .
We win some battles and we lose others as the pendulum of dominant ideas swings between power and liberty in a never - ending war .
The level of liberty our children and we enjoy depends on our persuasiveness and on the tenor of the public ’s openness to truth and reality ( which changes over time ) .
We who live relatively free of the dogma surrounding the institution called u201Cgovernmentu201D have little choice .
We cannot through reason , and especially not through violence , force an idea whose time has not yet come .
We can only be persistent , good - humoredly repeating the truth while patiently awaiting the time when conditions evolve to provide a more fertile soil for liberty ’s growth .
In the meantime we gain enough defectors from the other side to keep things interesting .

Mexico — which Americans often think of as our friendly , tequila - providing neighbor to the south — placed second , after Iraq , on the 2006 Reporters without Borders list of countries most hostile to journalists .
Mexican journalist Lydia Cacho knows just how far Mexican authorities will go to shut journalists up .
After her 2005 book , Demons of Eden , implicated powerful people in a Cancun child pornography ring , she became a target .
Cacho had reported that a Cancun hotel owner named Jean Succar Kuri was orchestrating a child pornography and prostitution ring .
She also alleged that a well - placed entrepreneur was protecting Succar Kuri .
Eight months after the book appeared , Cacho was arrested in Cancun by police from the state of Puebla .
She was driven to a beachfront pier and told to jump .
Fortunately , Cacho is savvy and well connected , and a flurry of urgent faxes to the government and human - rights groups was sent just in time to save her .
The police backed down , and after being held in jail for half a day , Cacho was released unharmed .
A few months later , audio tapes of Puebla ’s governor plotting with the entrepreneur to imprison and intimidate Cacho were anonymously provided to a national paper .
Cacho is now suing the government of Puebla for failing to protect her civil liberties .
Her landmark case has already caused a significant change in Mexican law , which has seen defamation and slander downgraded from criminal to civil offenses .
She is the first woman to have her case heard by the Mexican Supreme Court and one of the first individuals to win the right to argue a civil rights case before the court .
Cacho explains , “ I truly , honestly , do not believe that what I ’m doing is outstanding .
I just think I have my rights — not because I think I ’m a heroine or anything else , just because I ’m a citizen . ”
Cacho also founded and directs the Refuge Center for Abused Women of Cancun and is the president of the Center for Women ’s Assistance , which aids victims of domestic violence and gender discrimination .
Cacho recently came to San Francisco to accept Amnesty International ’s Ginetta Sagan Award for Women and Children ’s Rights .
She took a moment out of her whirlwind schedule to talk to Mother Jones at a North Beach coffee shop .
Mother Jones : Could you tell me how you got started writing about sex crimes and prostitution ?
Lydia Cacho : I started working as a journalist 20 years ago in Cancun .
I ’ve been a feminist since I was a little girl and my mom was a feminist , so I saw everything through that lens , which you can never take off .
Every time I interviewed Mayan women or men in the city , I saw that what was going on had a lot to do with discrimination .
It ’s not the main issue that I cover ; it ’s just that it keeps coming out in almost every aspect of society .
I started by covering the case of a young woman , 21 years old , who went to the police and told them that she had been part of a network of young women — that hotel owner Succar Kuri had a pornography ring working there , with sex tourism .
I started covering the story in the newspaper .
I wrote the whole story as a book after I knew that all the things they tried to do through the police were failing because these men are so powerful .
MJ : Do ever find yourself trying to figure out how to balance helping people and trying to write about them ?
LC : It ’s always an issue , of course .
First of all , you never , ever pay for evidence , no matter what .
Everything we did for all the victims in this case , we did as an institution .
I never did anything personal , like taking them to my house .
It was through a psychologist , the crisis center , and the shelter .
MJ : How hard is it as a female journalist in Mexico ?
LC : It is still a challenge .
There ’s a glass ceiling .
With the years , I ’ve started becoming known in the journalistic world as a feminist journalist , or the one who writes about “ those things . ”
Newspaper editors call me and ask me to write pieces on certain issues .
Then you ’re marked , and some part of this male - dominated journalistic world does n’t take you very seriously because you write about women ’s issues .
But I do n’t really care .
I just keep going .
MJ : You were arrested for defamation , and in Mexico journalists can be charged regardless of whether or not what they say is true .
Do you think that law has something to do with how much corruption there is in Mexico and how politicians manage to get away with it ?
LC : Absolutely , that law was created by politicians that belonged to the PRI [ Institutional Revolutionary Party , which held power from 1929 to 2000 ] .
The law was created to protect the corruption of the powerful .
It ’s a gag system for the media , and it ’s worked for a long time .
Once we changed to democracy with President Fox — whatever that means , the media was in a frenzy that we had freedom of speech ; we could write about anything .
And that really , really scared the politicians , and those who have money .
They started buying newspapers themselves , to find new ways of controlling the media .
Now with my case , the good part of my case is that we were able to change the law .
They have decriminalized defamation .
MJ : But you still can be charged even if what you say is true ?
LC : Yes , absolutely .
That ’s what the law says .
It ’s amazing : “ A fact whether true or untrue , ” that ’s how it reads .
MJ : That is pretty crazy .
LC : Yeah , that ’s what I was telling the judge .
I said if some guy is a bank robber and I have a video of him robbing a bank , then I write about him robbing a bank — can I go to jail for that ?
And he said , “ Yes , if the bank robber sues you because his wife did n’t know he was a bank robber . ”
MJ : What do you think about how Mexico is covered in the U.S. media ?
LC : I believe that it is hard if you are non-Mexican — or have n’t lived in Mexico long enough — to grasp what corruption and impunity mean , not only in politics , but in Mexican culture .
When we talk about “ femicides ” — the way women are being killed , and how these killings are not being investigated — as you go deeper and deeper into that , not only in Juarez , but all over the country , you always hit the same rock , which is a misogynist , sexist society that does n’t really care about women .
Corruption is very hard to explain , because it is a cultural issue — it ’s not an isolated fact .
In my case , you have tapes of the governor of Puebla saying that he ’s going to put a journalist in jail , and the other guy is saying he ’s buying girls from Florida and girls from El Salvador .
You listen to the tapes and you are overwhelmed — you say this is a complete fantasy !
And are they still in office ?
Yeah .
How can you explain that ?
I do n’t even know if it can be explained .
MJ : You do seem pretty unwilling to be scared off .
What do you think it is about your experiences that makes you that way ?
LC : It ’s the way I was educated in my family .
I ’m the daughter of a feminist .
My mom was French ; she was born in France , but she grew up in Mexico .
And she has always told us that she was shocked by how willing Mexicans were to negotiate their dignity in exchange for apparent freedom .
When I was a teenager , I asked her what she meant by “ apparent freedom ” and she said , “ You are always under somebody if you sell your dignity to them . ”
When all this happened I realized what she meant .
I wo n’t negotiate my dignity because it has to do with my real freedom — my freedom of speech , my freedom of being a woman , protecting others .
I have met hundreds of people that are really amazed at what I ’ve done , and they keep telling me — mainly men , which is pretty strange —
” Are n’t you afraid of getting killed ? ”
People are so , so afraid .
I keep thinking of my fellow citizens — men and women , but more men — as battered women .
When a woman is in a cycle of violence , she always thinks that [ her abuser ] is almighty and all - powerful .
It does n’t matter where she goes :
He will find her and make her life miserable .
We ’re like a battered woman , and the husband is the government .
MJ : That ’s an interesting twist on Octavio Paz ’s Labyrinth of Solitude .
LC : [ Laughs . ]
In learned helplessness , you learn that it does n’t matter what you do , you wo n’t get out of the situation you ’re in .
We ’re in that situation too .
The government kills people — nothing happens .
They disappear students — nothing happens .
They take you to jail — and nothing happens .
That teaches you a lesson .
MJ : How likely do you think it is that the government might come after you or try to assassinate you ?
Is that realistic or is it paranoid ?
LC : Well , it ’s not paranoid , but it would n’t be the government .
It would be somebody like the governor of Puebla who could hire a private citizen to come after me , or me having an accident like many other journalists have , without anybody knowing what happened .
What the state does is allow others to kill you or disappear you .
That ’s what the state does :
They do n’t investigate .
Eighty - five percent of violent crimes in Mexico are not investigated .
MJ : Do other journalists go through similar things , where they ’re wrongfully imprisoned ?
And , if so , why did your case get more attention ?
LC : Yeah , and some of them are still in jail .
One day three years ago , I sat down with all my team and said , “ Let ’s make a safety plan .
In case I get murdered , this is what you will do . ”
Because that ’s what you have to do — we are in a high risk job , and if you do n’t accept that , you could be killed and nothing would be done .
I got some death threats for publishing the book .
I know I ’m messing with organized crime ; I ’m not a kid anymore .
On December 16 , as I was arrested outside my office — we have video cameras because we ’ve had so many people with guns threaten us , like any other crisis center — and the team was inside viewing the camera .
Everything was taped .
And my team immediately took action .
They called Amnesty International .
They started calling NGOs around the world .
My boyfriend is a journalist in Mexico City — they called him , and he called the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York .
The network worked really fast .
I was arrested on the 16th at 12 o’clock .
Probably two o’clock in the morning , the police stopped by a beach and told me I was going to jump in the ocean and die there , that they were going to rape me — and all these things , all these psychological forms of torture .
But then they received a phone call .
The caller told them to stop it and take me to Puebla .
I did n’t know [ what had happened ] ; I ’m telling you now , but I did n’t know then , I just knew that the officer received a phone call in front of me and said , “ Change of plans ” and took me back to the car .
It was months after that that we learned what happened .
But [ at the time ] the governor of Puebla and others got calls from everyone you can imagine .
An urgent action from Amnesty International arrived at the governor ’s office by fax and to the press and to the whole country .
Then people cannot just play dumb .
MJ : So this person , whom you accuse in your book — he ’s a convicted pedophile at this point in Arizona , Jean Succar Kuri — how connected is he , and why are so many people , including the governor of Puebla , willing to protect him ?
LC : Well , he was actually extradited to Mexico , and he ’s now in a high - security jail in Mexico .
The authorities say [ Succar Kuri ] was money laundering for some politicians .
Not necessarily all politicians were involved in the pedophile ring , but he was useful to them , so they had to protect him because otherwise he would talk .
MJ : In general , what ’s your view of Mexico ’s progress toward democracy ?
LC : I think we ’re looking for democracy .
It ’s hiding somewhere in Mexico , and we will find it eventually .
MJ : It might take a while , though ?
LC : Yes , I think so .
Richard Charkin is an unrepentant thief .
Charkin , a UK executive with publisher Macmillan , attended last week 's Book Expo America in New York and decided to make his feelings about Google Book Search clear by teaching Google a lesson : he stole two of the company 's laptops .
His point was that Google Book Search is " stealing " the work of authors and publishers without permission , and Charkin wanted to see if Google 's boffins enjoyed having the same thing done to them .
He recounts the incident on his personal blog .
" A colleague and I simply picked up two computers from the Google stand and waited in close proximity until someone noticed , " he says .
" This took more than an hour .
Our justification for this appalling piece of criminal behaviour ?
The owner of the computer had not specifically told us not to steal it .
If s/he had , we would not have done so .
When s/he asked for its return , we did so .
It is exactly what Google expects publishers to expect and accept in respect to intellectual property . "
The object lesson is unlikely to change Google 's opinion of its project , and Charkin 's charade elides the differences between what Google is doing for books and what a thief does when he snatches a laptop from the backseat of a car .
Such was Lawrence Lessig 's view , at least , and Lessig pointed out that Google Book Search does not indiscriminately post books under copyright .
If the book is under copyright and still in print , Google Book Search will only show selections from it that are authorized by the publisher .
The book Middlesex , for example , published by Picador , displays a limited preview of certain chapters authorized by the publisher .
( Microsoft has made much of its rival project , with a stronger opt - in system for rightsholders , as being a better choice for publishers . )
Books that remain under copyright but are out of print can be extremely difficult to clear the rights for , and for these works , Google does show " snippets " of the pages containing search terms .
These snippets are quite limited ( a couple of sentences ) , and only a fixed amount will be shown per book , per user .
Google explains that if books are still under copyright , " we only show basic information about the book , similar to a card catalog , and , in some cases , a few snippets — sentences of your search terms in context .
The aim of Google Book Search is to help you discover books and learn where to buy or borrow them , not read them online from start to finish . "
Google believes that these snippets constitute fair use , and that if they are outlawed , Google 's entire ability to index the web is in jeopardy .
Lessig also points out that making a copy of a digital work is essentially different from stealing someone 's laptop ; when the laptop disappears , the user no longer has access to it and has lost something important and costly .
The same is not true when Google scans a book .
Charkin has certainly been hearing this point repeatedly from critics .
In a more recent blog entry , he said that he has been characterized " variously as a fool , a child , a luddite , a crook , or a counter - revolutionary .
Hey ho .
At least it has generated debate , not least as to whether physical property has greater rights to protection than intellectual property . "
A complex debate
Charkin certainly does n't represent all the views of the industry .
The book business is convulsed with debate over the topic of how best to go digital .
A Random House VP that I spoke with several weeks ago said that there is no single corporate perspective on the issue of working with Google or similar services , and he encouraged the tech world not to give into the myth of believing that publishers are " old - school and lazy . "
Publishers want to embrace the digital future , and they 're all doing it in different ways , but there 's a real worry that Google and Amazon book search services encourage people to believe that digital book content is worth little .
If publishers are n't careful , they might devalue future digital sales , just as P2P has encouraged plenty of consumers to believe that music ought to be free .
Yes , Google will certainly help to drive paper sales in the short term , but people are quickly growing used to getting digital content for free .
As these companies plan to offer more digital products down the road , they worry that consumers are being primed to expect an ultra- low price that could decimate their profits and even put them out of business .
The issue is made even more complicated because the debate is not just among publishers .
Authors too have opinions , and they can be utterly polarized .
Large companies have to deal with thousands of authors , each of whom has a different view on how content should be marketed and made available , and that 's not even mentioning the entire issue of backlist authors , whose contracts made no reference at all to Internet or electronic distribution .
It may actually be the courts that have the final word here .
Google is currently defending itself against major lawsuits from publishers and the Authors Guild over the uses it makes of copyrighted works .
Google has been trying to dispel some of the bad will created among publishers by the Book Search program and to educate people about how the service actually works — thus , their appearance at Book Expo America .
The fact that a publishing executive would steal the company 's laptops , then wait around for more than an hour just so the theft would be noticed , suggests that Google has plenty of work left to do .

The bees are trained to associate explosives with food
" We started this because our citizens are exposed to serious risks with mines , " explains Professor Nikola Kezic , as honey bees buzz around his head .
" Luckily we also have a long tradition of keeping bees and making honey .
Our solution makes use of what we have . "
Croatia , like Bosnia - Hercegovina and the other countries of the former Yugoslavia , has a big landmine problem , inherited from the wars of the 1990s .
More than 1,000 sq km ( 380 sq miles ) of Croatian countryside are thought to be contaminated by the mines .
About 250,000 mines are still buried , and more than 100 people have been killed by them in Croatia since 1998 .
Lure of food
Removing mines is slow and very expensive .
And even after the de-miners have done their work , some may remain in the soil .
Field testing is the next step after trials in the tent
Training the bees to find mines takes place in a large net tent pitched on a lawn at the university 's Faculty of Agriculture .
A hive of bees sits at one end , with several feeding points for the bees set up around the tent .
But only a few of the feeding points contain food , and the soil immediately around them has been impregnated with explosive chemicals .
The idea is that the bees ' keen sense of smell soon associates the smell of explosives with food .
So far this has proved successful .
Prof Kezic says bees can quickly be trained to detect explosives
The first day or so is spent in the large net tent , getting the bees used to associating the smell of TNT with food .
After that several bees are taken out of the colony and tested to see if they react correctly when presented with extracts of explosives .
" This year our work is to increase the bees ' sensitivity to the smell of TNT , " says Prof Kezic .
He warns that it will take time before they are sure the system is reliable enough to use properly .
Painstaking method
Once the technique has been shown to be reliable , the idea is to use the bees on areas that have already been de-mined .
Parts of Croatia are still littered with mines laid in the 1990s
The bees will be expected to settle on areas of ground that smell of explosives .
If they land on an area where no landmine was discovered earlier , the de-mining team will investigate to make sure they have not missed one .
If the technique proves a success it might provide a cheap and easily available resource for de-mining teams all over the Balkans .
Other animals have been used before to detect explosives .
Gambian giant pouched rats are used in several African countries , including Mozambique , to find mines .
Like the bees in Croatia , they are trained to associate the smell of TNT with food .
Dogs are also used to find landmines and to sniff out hidden explosives , for instance in airports .
But unlike rats and bees , the weight of sniffer dogs means that they can be at risk of setting off the mines they are trying to detect .
Dogs have also been used for offensive operations in wartime .
In World War II the Soviet Red Army trained dogs to run underneath enemy tanks .
The dogs had petrol bombs strapped to their backs which ignited when they knocked against the enemy vehicles .
In the Croatian countryside bee - keeping has been popular for centuries .
Delicious pots of honey and other produce can be bought directly from the bee - keepers at roadside stalls all over the region .
Despite many years of working with bees , Prof Kezic has not lost his enthusiasm for them .
His office , full of charts , diagrams and models of bees , is testament to his interest in these social insects .
And in his fridge there is further evidence of what makes bees so special : pots of honey and some delicious honey - flavoured raki , the local strong alcohol .

Three of the four leading Republican presidential candidates turned down invitations to a PBS debate this month at a historically black college in Baltimore , leading moderator Tavis Smiley on Thursday to accuse them of ignoring minority voters .
Smiley told USA TODAY the rejections are part of a pattern , noting most GOP candidates declined invitations to address several black and Hispanic groups , including a Univision debate for a Latino audience .
USA TODAY ON POLITICS : Smiley warns GOP contenders of political consequences " No one should be elected president of this country in 2008 if they think that along the way they can ignore people of color , " said Smiley , host of radio and TV talk shows .
" If you want to be president of all America , you need to speak to all Americans . "
Arizona Sen. John McCain , former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney have declined to participate in the Sept. 27 debate at Morgan State University .
" I feel good , " Smiley said , about the odds of getting former Tennessee senator Fred Thompson .
Five candidates trailing in national and state polls will be there .
The Univision debate , co-sponsored by the University of Miami , was scheduled for Sept. 16 , but canceled after only one candidate — McCain — accepted .
" We 're looking for a new date , " said Univision spokeswoman Rosemary Mercedes .
However , Romney and Giuliani already have declined .
Republican campaigns blamed scheduling conflicts for their candidate 's absence from the Baltimore debate , citing , for example , a McCain speech on Iraq and a flurry of fundraising events before the third - quarter deadline on Sept. 30 .
All eight Democrats participated in their PBS debate at Howard University — and that was on June 28 , a similarly frenetic fundraising period .
Kevin Madden , a Romney spokesman , said his candidate has " a very heavy travel schedule " that has led him to decline invitations to several debates .
Florida Sen .
Mel Martinez , chairman of the national party , has said GOP candidates are not snubbing Hispanics ; they are just busy with other campaign events .
Smiley said he intends to press his case tonight on NBC's Tonight Show with Jay Leno .
" We 're talking about one 90 - minute conversation , " he said .
" It gives these Republicans a wonderful opportunity .
They complain all the time that black and brown voters wo n't give them a chance .
We offer a platform on PBS . "
Republican presidential candidates typically receive less than 15 % of the black vote in general elections and tend to oppose policies important to some minority voters , such as affirmative action .
Right now they are competing for conservative primary voters .
" I understand why they would n't want to go , " said Michael Fauntroy , a public policy expert at George Mason University and author of a new book called Republicans and the Black Vote .
But he said skipping the forum will turn off moderate suburban voters and squander the chance to speak unfiltered to an integrated national TV audience .
There would be plenty to talk about , Fauntroy said .
Black voters may have special concerns about the Katrina recovery or the justice system , for example , he said , but " they have the same concerns as everyone else in terms of national security and the economy . "
GOP candidates who will be in Baltimore are Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , California Rep. Duncan Hunter , Texas Rep. Ron Paul and Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo .
Republicans had been making headway with Hispanic voters , in large part due to outreach by President Bush .
But this year , with the notable exceptions of Bush and McCain , the GOP is identified with pushes to crack down on border enforcement and illegal immigrants already in this country .
Polls show Hispanics turning back to Democrats .
Simon Rosenberg , whose New Democrat Network has studied how Democrats can appeal to Hispanics , said Bush and his brother , Jeb , pursued minority outreach when they were governors of Texas and Florida , respectively , as well as in Bush 's presidential campaigns .
But " the Republican Party right now has become an anti-immigrant party , " he said .

Mind Of Peace
Last updated at 21:09 15 September 2007
It sounds too good to be true - not to mention the fact that it violates almost every known law of physics .
But British scientists claim they have invented a revolutionary device that seems to ' create ' energy from virtually nothing .
Their so - called thermal energy cell could soon be fitted into ordinary homes , halving domestic heating bills and making a major contribution towards cutting carbon emissions .
Scroll down for more ...
Even the makers of the device are at a loss to explain exactly how it works - but sceptical independent scientists carried out their own tests and discovered that the 12in x 2in tube really does produce far more heat energy than the electrical energy put in .
The device seems to break the fundamental physical law that energy cannot be created from nothing - but researchers believe it taps into a previously unrecognised source of energy , stored at a sub-atomic level within the hydrogen atoms in water .
Scroll down for more ...
The system - developed by scientists at a firm called Ecowatts in a nondescript laboratory on an industrial estate at Lancing , West Sussex - involves passing an electrical current through a mixture of water , potassium carbonate ( otherwise known as potash ) and a secret liquid catalyst , based on chrome .
This creates a reaction that releases an incredible amount of energy compared to that put in .
If the reaction takes place in a unit surrounded by water , the liquid heats up , which could form the basis for a household heating system .
If the technology can be developed on a domestic scale , it means consumers will need much less energy for heating and hot water - creating smaller bills and fewer greenhouse gases .
Jim Lyons , of the University of York , independently evaluated the system .
He said : ' Let 's be honest , people are generally pretty sceptical about this kind of thing .
Our team was happy to take on the evaluation , even if to prove it did n't work .
' But this is a very efficient replacement for the traditional immersion heater .
We have examined this interesting technology and when we got the rig operating , we were getting 150 to 200 per cent more energy out than we put in , without trying too hard .
People are sceptical - but somehow it works
' We are still not clear about the science involved here , because the physics and chemistry are very different - to everything that has gone before .
Our challenge now is to study the science and how it works . '
The device has taken ten years of painstaking work by a small team at Ecowatts ' tiny red - brick laboratory , and bosses predict a household version of their device will be ready to go on sale within the next 18 months .
The project , which has cost the company £ 1.4 million , has the backing of the Department of Trade and Industry , which is keen to help poorer families without traditional central heating or who cannot afford rocketing fuel bills .
Ecowatts says the device will cost between £ 1,500 and £ 2,000 , in line with the price of traditional systems .
The development of the groundbreaking technology results from a chance meeting between Ecowatts chairman Chris Davies , his wife Jane and an Irish inventor , Christopher Eccles , while the couple were on holiday near Shannon in 1998 .
After the inventor showed the couple his laboratory experiments , Mrs Davies , immediately signed a £ 20,000 cheque on the bonnet of her car and handed it over to Mr Eccles .
He later became chief scientist of Ecowatts ' parent company Gardner Watts , but has since left after ' falling out ' with the company , according to insiders .
Sadly , Mrs Davies died three years ago , so she will be unable to share in the success of her husband 's development of the idea .
Mr Davies , now 75 , of Dedham , Essex , was unavailable for comment last night .
But Ecowatts chief executive Paul Calver said : ' When Jane Davies whipped out her cheque book , it turned out to be a very good investment indeed .
' She and Chris were always interested in ecology and now it looks as if our heat exchanger system is ready to go on sale soon .
We 're producing a device in the next nine months to heat radiators .
' Most British homes rely on gas , and the Government has admitted there is a problem getting a substitute .
Our device will help solve that .'
Sustainable energy expert Professor Saffa Riffat , of Nottingham University , has also led a team investigating the system .
He said : ' The concept is very interesting and it could be a major breakthrough , but more tests are required .
We will be doing further checks . '
Mechanisms of Aging
Please take the short Life Extension Values Clarification Survey
Note :
This monograph does NOT have a terminal copyright date — development is ongoing
Aging is a syndrome of changes that are deleterious , progressive , universal and thus far irreversible .
Aging damage occurs to molecules ( DNA , proteins , lipids ) , to cells and to organs .
Diseases of old age ( diseases which increase in frequency with age , such as arthritis , osteoporosis , heart disease , cancer , Alzheimer 's Disease , etc. ) are often distinguished from aging per se .
But even if the aging process is distinct from the diseases of aging , it is nonetheless true that the damage associated with the aging process increases the probability that diseases of old age will occur .
Some gerontologists prefer to use the word senescence because " aging " implies that the passage of time necessarily results in deterioration ( biological entropy ) — which is certainly not true during the early , developmental , time of life ( before the age of 10 or 12 in humans ) .
I will retain the word " aging " because I believe the association between aging & deterioration is universal as adult years progress and because the distinction between aging & development is very strongly established in conventional language .
Also , shorter words make for slightly faster reading .

One can catalog changes that typically occur with age .
For people of developed countries age changes include : A loss of hearing ability , particularly for higher frequencies .
There is a decline in the ability to taste salt&bitter ( sweet &sour are much less affected ) .
There is a reduction of the thymus gland to 5−10 % of its original mass by age 50 .
Levels of antibodies increase with aging .
One third of men and half of women over 65 report some form of arthritis .
About half of those aged 65 have lost all teeth .
The elderly require twice as much insulin to achieve the glucose uptake of the young .
There is reduced sensitivity to growth factors & hormones due to fewer receptors and dysfunctional post - receptor pathways .
The temperature needed to separate DNA strands increases with age .
Weight declines after age 55 due to loss of lean tissue , water and bone ( cell mass at age 70 is 36 % of what it is at age 25 ) .
Body fat increases to age 60 .
Muscle strength for men declines 30 −40 % from age 30 to age 80 .
Reaction time declines 20 % from age 20 to 60 .
Elderly people tend to sleep more lightly , more frequently and for shorter periods — with a reduction in rapid eye - movement ( REM ) sleep .
Neurogenesis in the hippocampus declines with age .
Degree of saturation of fats drops by 26 % in the brains of old animals .
Presbyopia ( reduced ability to focus on close - up objects ) occurs in 42 % of people aged 52 −64 , 73 % of those 65 − 74 and 92 % of those over age 75 .
Most people over age 75 have cataracts .
About half of those over 85 are disabled ( defined as the inability to use public transportation ) .
Over 75 % of people over 85 have 3−9 pathological conditions , and the cause of death for these people is frequently unknown .
Aging changes are frequently associated with an increase in likelihood of mortality , but this is not necessarily the case .
For example , graying of hair is a symptom of aging , but graying does not increase likelihood of mortality .
Aging changes which are not associated with a specific disease , but which are associated with a generalized increase in mortality would qualify as biomarkers of aging — and would distinguish biological age from chronological age .
Biomarkers would be better predictors of the increased likelihood of mortality ( independent of specific disease ) than the passage of time ( chronological age ) .
Cross -linking of collagen , insulin resistance and lung expiration capacity have been proposed as candidates but , as yet , no biomarkers of aging have been validated and universally accepted .
( return to contents )
Many scientists have wondered whether a single cause ( probably cellular or hormonal ) lies behind all aging phenomena — or whether aging is inherently multi-faceted .
Differences in lifespan between species raise critical questions , in this regard .
Why is a rodent old at 3 years , a horse old at 35 years and a human old at 80 years ?
Are n't the cells much the same ?
Why is it that at age 3 about 30 % of rodents have had cancer , whereas at age 85 , about 30 % of humans have had cancer ?
Some species ( such as lobsters , alligators and sharks ) show few signs of aging .
Cancer cells , stem cells and human germ cells seem " immortal " when compared to other cells .
When discussing aging it is important to distinguish two points on survival curves .
Mean lifespan ( average lifespan ) corresponds to the age at which the horizontal line for 50 % survival intersects the survival curve .
Maximum lifespan corresponds to the age at which the survival curves touch the age - axis ( 0 % survival ) — and this represents the age at which the oldest known member of the species has died .
( In animal studies , maximum lifespan is typically taken to be the mean lifespan of the most long - lived 10 % . )
Curve A as shown is a pure exponential decay curve .
Curve B corresponds to the survival of small animals , such as mice or squirrels in a natural environment .
Human survival was still close to curve B in ancient Rome when average lifespan was 22 years , but by the mid−1800s the typical North American lived to be 40 — more like curve C. Today , people in the most developed countries have an average lifespan of about 80 — resembling curve D. Reduction of infant mortality has accounted for most of the increased longevity , but since the 1960s mortality rates among those over 80 years has been decreasing by about 1.5 % per year .
Maximum lifespan for humans , however , has remained about 115 −120 all through known history .
The longest documented human lifespan has been for Frenchwoman Jean Calment who lived 122.3 years .
Curing specific diseases such as heart disease or cancer can do no more than further " square " the survival curve ( toward curve E ) , with no effect on maximum lifespan .
Curing cancer would add about 2 years to human life , whereas eliminating heart disease would add 3 or 4 years .
Mean lifespan varies with susceptibility to disease , accident & homicide / suicide , whereas maximum lifespan is determined by " rate of aging " .
In aging research , maximum lifespan is regarded as a proxy for aging .
Chemicals , calorie restriction with adequate nutrition , or other interventions which increase maximum lifespan are said to have slowed the aging process .
If human beings were free of disease & senescence the only causes of death would be accident , suicide & homicide .
Under such conditions it is estimated that from a population of one billion , a 12 - year - old would have a median lifespan of 1,200 years and a maximum lifespan of 25,000 years .
In 1825 an English actuary named Benjamin Gompertz discovered that likelihood of dying increases exponentially with age after maturity — an empirical observation that has stood the test of time .
A 35 - year - old is twice as likely to die as a 25 - year - old and a 25 - year - old is twice as likely to die as a 15 - year - old .
The exponential increase does not continue past age 80 and death rate may even decline after age 110 [ SCIENCE 280:855-860 ( 1998 ) ] .
( Medflies — Mediterranean fruit flies — show a plateau of linear rather than exponential death rate when 20 - 25 % of the population remains ) .
Similarly , the risk of getting Alzheimer 's Disease doubles every 5 years past the age of 60 — probably plateauing after age 90 ( when over half the population is already demented ) .
Cancer rate increases exponentially with age , but also seems to plateau in the very elderly .
One explanation might be that subsets of the population that are considerably more hardy due to genetics or behavior may remain after the more heterogenous majority have died .
Another explanation suggests the complete elimination of the forces of natural selection at the oldest ages — which causes subsequent survival to be completely the result of genetic " random drift " [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) 93:15249-15253 ( 1996 ) ] .
Causes of death in middle - age tend to be due to diseases affecting high - risk individuals ( cancer , diabetes , hypertension , etc. ) , whereas the elderly are more vulnerable to multiple pathologies due to vulnerability of aging organs & tissues [ JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY 58A( 6 ) : B495 -B507 ( 2003 ) ] .
Attempts to classify theories of aging have led to the two major classifications programmed aging and wear&tear aging .
Programmed aging would be aging due to something inside an organism 's control mechanisms that forces elderliness & deterioration — similar to the way genes program other life - stages such as cell differentiation during embryological development or sexual maturation at adolescence .
By contrast aging due to wear&tear is not the result of any specific controlling program , but is the effect of the sum effect of many kinds of environmental assaults — ie , damage due to radiation , chemical toxins , metal ions , free - radicals , hydrolysis , glycation , disulfide - bond cross- linking , etc .
Such damage can affect genes , proteins , cell membranes , enzyme function , blood vessels , etc .
When Pacific salmon have lived in the ocean for 2 or 3 years , they make an arduous upstream journey against a raging riverswim until they find a place suitable for spawning .
After spawning , the adrenal gland releases massive amounts of corticosteroids — leading to rapid deterioration .
It would be costly for the species to have salmon that could live another year and repeat the journey — or compete with the offspring for food .
Although this process is obviously " programmed " , it is inaccurate to describe it as " aging " .
Programmed death , rather than programmed aging , is a common phenomenon among animals that reproduce only once .
Grazing animals show wear - and - tear to their teeth to the point where they can no longer eat , and they die of starvation .
Again , it stretches the point to say the teeth are aging .
The teeth of rabbits ( like human fingernails ) continue to grow as wearing occurs — and in this sense are " programmed " to compensate for " wear&tear " .
Why do n't grazing animals have teeth that continue to grow ?
Human beings can replace tissue , capillaries and bone in wound - healing , yet cannot regrow a severed limb the way a salamander can .
Why is n't human DNA " programmed " to re-grow kidney or liver tissue as it ages ?
Planarians ( flatworms ) have a pool of stem cells which can replace any of their fully differentiated cells .
Programming that compensates for wear & tear should be distinguished from programming that causes deterioration .

Russell Wallace , who with Charles Darwin discovered natural selection , speculated that longevity much beyond the age of procreation would be a disadvantage for a species .
Parents would threaten their children by competition for resources .
This would imply an evolutionary advantage to genetically programmed aging .
The programmed self - destruction with corticosteroids by Pacific salmon after spawning — and whose decaying bodies provide nutrient for their offspring — may be severe example indicating the possiblity of programmed senescence .
But as biologist Peter Medawar noted , there is circular reasoning in claiming that senescence evolved so that non-senescent individuals could more readily survive .
If there were no senescent , poorly - reproducing individuals , there would be no need for replacement .
If aging were the product of evolutionary forces , aging could reasonably be expected to result from programming .
But since most animals in the wild die of accident , attack or disease it seems questionable that evolutionary forces determine aging .
Robins in the wild , for example , have an estimated 12 - year maximum lifespan and a 40 % chance of surviving any given year .
With a ( 0.4 ) 12 — or 1 in 60,000 — chance that a robin can avoid accident , attack or disease for 12 years , there would seem to be little opportunity for natural selection to play a role in the evolution of senescence .
Against this argument is evidence that early stages of senescence reduce the ability of an animal to survive — thereby causing earlier selection against older animals .
An alternative to the view that senescence is the product of evolution compares genetic programming to the engineering of a fly - by satellite designed to gather data about a planet .
The engineering is focused on ensuring that the satellite reaches its destination and performs its data gathering / transmission when passing the planet .
Beyond the planet it is a matter of indifference to the engineers how long the satellite continues to function — random decay occurs .
Applying the analogy , the satellite passing the planet is like an organism passing its reproductive period .
Once the objectives of reproduction & parenting have been achieved the organism decays by random malfunction .
Maximum lifespan of many animal species
The vast range of maximum lifespan differences between species provides convincing evidence that longevity is genetically influenced .
An elephant lives about 10 − 20 times longer than a mouse , yet both animals have roughly the same number of lifetime heartbeats — the elephant at 30 per minute and the mouse at 300 per minute .
Both species take about 200 million breaths in a lifetime .
And both species have a metabolic potential ( total kilocalories used per gram of body weight per lifetime ) of about 200 kcal .
This figure is much the same for other mammals , but humans are exceptional with a metabolic potential of 800 kcal .
Brains use more energy than any other human organ .
( Basal metabolic rate for humans is about 80 watts = 70 Calories per hour . )
Birds have a metabolic potential of 1,000 to 1,500 kcal .
Gerontologists who compare the longevity of species explain this discrepancy by saying that while body weight correlates well with longevity , there is a better correlation with brain weight for primates .
For other species brain size may be more related to motor function than to cognitive capacity .
Flight , like brain weight , also confers a longevity advantage .
Finches & robins live about 3 times as long as rodents the same size .
Flying squirrels live twice as long as their close relatives the chipmunks .
Parrots have a maximum lifespan in excess of 90 years .
The Andean condor may be the most long - lived of any bird , but its maximum lifespan has not been confirmed .
Gross attributes of species typically associated with greater longevity are : large size , ability to fly , brainy , a spiny or shelled encasement , and cold - blooded .
All but the last attribute reduce vulnerability to predators .
Porcupines are the longest - lived rodents .
Naked mole rats , by living underground , are also safer from predators and live significantly longer than similarly - sized rats .
All adaptations that afford protection from predators and other hazards justify greater developmental resources to build a more durable animal with a longer maximum lifespan .
Opossums evolving on an island free of predators have been shown to have substantially longer lifespans and smaller litters than opossums living on the nearby mainland [ JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY ; 229:695-708 ( 1993 ) ] .
Where competition between individuals of a species for mates & resources is more important than survival against predators and other hazards , evolution causes more investment in making a more hardy & durable animal — which includes having fewer offspring on each birthing ( but more total offspring over the lifetime ) — with each offspring receiving more care and resources .
Gene survival can be better promoted ( up to a point ) by extending lifespan and reproductive period of reproductively successful adults than by creating many more offspring , a signficant number of whom will not survive to become reproductive adults .
Large size also confers protection against predators and confers an improved ability to escape dangerous environments .
Metabolic rate decreases proportionally with increases in body size , which allows larger animals to survive longer when food & water are scarce .
[ For a sphere , surface area S = 4πr2 and volume V = ( 4/3 ) πr3 , which means that S/V varies inversely with r ( radius ) .
Because heat is generated in the volume and dissipates in the surface area , relative dissipation decreases with an increase in radius because of the decrease in S / V. ]
Large animals are better able to withstand extreme temperatures because of greater body mass .
Large animals and birds are more easily able to travel long distances to find food or less harsh environments .
Cold - blooded animals need n't expend energy to maintain body temperature and therefore generate fewer free - radicals .
Also , the rate of chemical reactions more than doubles for each 10 ºC increase in temperature .
Cold - blooded animals may use one - tenth as much energy as warm - blooded animals of the same body weight .
The alligator , Galapagose tortoise and lake sturgeon combine large size with cold - bloodedness .
Turtles live longer than other reptiles because of the shell which protects against predators .
With the combination of hard shell , large size and cold - bloodedness , it is not surprising that the Galagose turtle is probably the most long - lived vertebrate .
Hard shell , cold - bloodedness and the ability to reduce metabolic rate allow some bivalves to live nearly four centuries [ GERONTOLOGY ; Philipp , EER ; 56( 1):55 -65 ( 2010 ) ] .
A short - lived organism would waste metabolic energy by over - investing in anti-oxidant or DNA - repair enzymes when the energy could be spent on rapid growth and reproduction .
When a species has fewer predators , evolution invests fewer resources into speedy reproduction and more genetic resources ( DNA repair , etc. ) into a longer reproductive period ( longer life ) .
In the case of birds , the mitochondrial membranes contain more unsaturated fat making them less vulnerable to lipid peroxidation .
And the protein complexes of the respiratory chain of mitochondria generate fewer free radicals in birds than in mammals .
It is conceivable that an animal with well - engineered cells could live many centuries .
Human germ cells have arguably lived for millions of years through an investment in DNA - repair enzymes , antioxidant enzymes and telomerase .
Evolutionary biologists are able to use artificial selection in the laboratory experimentally ( rather than passively studying natural selection in the wild ) to seek the evolutionary determinates of longevity .
Michael Rose at the University of California has shown that Drosophila ( fruit - flies ) bred for 15 generations by disposing of eggs laid early in life and only using eggs that were laid toward the end of reproductive life achieved maximum lifespans 30 % greater than that of controls .
The long - lived strains had increased levels of SOD , CAT and xanthine dehydrogenase as well as increased levels of heat shock proteins conferring stress resistance [ JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY 55A ( 11 ) : B552-B559 ( 2000 ) ] .
Hsp22 heat shock protein expression was 2−10 times greater in the long - lived strains as compared to controls .
Transgenic Drosophila ( ie , fruit flies with artificially altered genes ) with extra copies of hsp70 genes live nearly 8 % longer than controls following heat treatment [ NATURE ; Tatar , M ; 390:30 ( 1997 ) ] .
Dr. Rose has also observed the experimental increase in mortality associated with aging ceases late in life [ PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY ; Rose ; MR ; 78(6):869-878 ( 2005 ) ] .
Although mortality rates remain very high in late - life , they plateau .
Studies of inbred Drosophila indicate that the plateauing cannot be due to genetic variation .
From his evolutionary biology perspective Dr. Rose associates this phenomenon with a late - life end of the force of natural selection .
This would imply that senescence is genetically programmed and that studying the genetics of the plateau could be the key to understanding the genetics of longevity .

In nearly every culture on earth women outlive men — significantly so in the oldest years .
But the men who do survive to become elderly are hardier than the women .
A US National Institute of Aging study showed that 44 % of men over age 80 are " robust and independent " compared with only 28 % of women .
And the percentage of surviving males increases from 15 % at age 100 to 40 % at age 105 in the United States .
If aging has been programmed by evolutionary forces , sex could be a very important contributor to the program .
The reproductive organs of the human female exhibits a rate of aging that is among the most rapid of body systems .
The complete shutdown of female fertility at menopause may be of value in preventing the birth of deformed children or death in childbirth of a mother who has several dependent children .
For a species with a lengthy parenting period , it makes sense for fertility to cease long before the debilities of advancing age begin .
Gonadotropin hormones from the pituitary gland are controlled by gonadotropin - releasing hormone , a 10 - amino - acid peptide originating in neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus .
The two gonadotropin hormones ( FSH & LH ) are the same for females as for males , although their function is very different .
Simplistically , FSH stimulates egg production in females & sperm production in males , whereas LH stimulates estrogen production in females & testosterone production in males .
In fertile females FSH ( Follicle - Stimulating Hormone ) accelerates the growth of 6−12 primary follicles in the ovary each month — one of which may become a mature ovum .
The follicles secrete estrogens , the most powerful of which is estradiol .
A sudden increase in LH ( Luteinizing Hormone ) usually triggers ovulation ( follicle rupture with discharge of the ovum ) and the conversion of the follicle to the corpus luteum ( " yellow body " ) — which also secretes estrogen , but primarily secretes progesterone .
Progesterone stimulate the walls of the uterus to prepare it for implantation of the fertilized ovum .
If pregnancy occurs , progesterone inhibits ovulation ( by suppressing FSH & LH ) and promotes uterine development until the placenta becomes more mature .
( Progesterone is so - named because it promotes gestation , ie , the growth of offspring in the womb ) .
Graph of Female Hormonal Cycles
Aside from their role in the monthly cycle , estrogens are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female sexual organs , cause the deposition of fat in the breast &buttocks ( which contributes to the feminine figure ) and have a potent effect on bone development .
Menopause is the event in a woman 's life when her ovary literally runs out of eggs .
The loss of follicles to produce estradiol causes an end to menstrual cycling and production of estrogen & progesterone by the ovary .
At age 30 , a woman 's period is normally 28−30 days , but by age 40 her period is typically closer to 25 days and her rate of egg - loss has accelerated .
Further shortening ( accompanied by periods when no ovulation occurs ) eventually leads to menopause at an average age of 50 ( plus or minus 10 years ) .
The menopausal woman often experiences anxiety , irritability and fatigue .
Beginning before menopause most women experience " hot flashes " , ie , 3 minute surges of blood to the skin of the chest , shoulders & face leading to sudden hotness & sweating .
Hot flashes are associated with a pulsatile release of LH from hypothalamic neurons associated with body temperature elevation .
Estrogen therapy eliminates hot flashes .
The rate of loss of ovarian follicles doubles around age 35 , raising the suspicion that a hypothalamic mechanism may be the ultimate cause of menopause [ SCIENCE 273:67-70 ( 1996 ) ] .
The most serious complications of menopause are osteoporosis and a decline in cardiovascular health .
The Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that between ages 35 to 65 men have 10 times the incidence of heart attack as women — probably because estrogen protects against heart disease .
Estrogen elevates HDL cholesterol and reduces LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream .
After menopause , nipples decrease in size and the surrounding alveolar tissue shrinks .
Erection of these tissues with external stimulation is more difficult .
Vaginal contractions during orgasm is reduced to 4−5 at 0.8 - second intervals from 8−12 in young adults .
The testes have been regarded as the source of maleness at least since ancient Rome , where eunuchs & women were not permitted to " testify " ( testis is Latin for " witness " ) .
In the male , LH stimulates secretion of testosterone by the interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes .
FSH stimulates spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules of the testes .
Testosterone promotes development of male sexual organs in the foetus .
At puberty testosterone stimulates hair growth on the face & pubis , causes enlargement of the larynx to deepen the voice , increases skin thickness , causes a 50 % increase in muscle mass , promotes bone growth , increases basal metabolism up to 15 % and increases red blood cell concentration .
There is no sudden " andropause " event in males that is comparable to the menopause event of females .
Instead , testosterone levels tend to decline gradually with age .
This decline occurs most dramatically in those with cardiovascular disease or a predisposition to adult - onset diabetes .
Although sperm count declines , fatherhood has been verified for a male as old as 94 .
Semen production declines in the prostate as a man ages — and the smooth muscle is replaced by overgrowing connective tissue that enlarges the prostate , blocks urine and can lead to cancer .
85 % of men over age 50 have symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia — a noncancerous overgrowth of prostate tissue possibly caused by excessive expression of the anti-apoptosis protein bcl −2 [ HUMAN PATHOLOGY 27:668-675 ( 1996 ) ] .
In some tissues testosterone must be converted to dihydrotestosterone ( by the enzyme 5−α reductase ) in order to act .
This occurs most notably in the prostate gland , which produces semen ( a mixture of sugars , protein and water ) .
Dihydrotestosterone has also been implicated in baldness .
The European drug Permixon ( an extract of the saw palmetto berry ) inhibits 5−α reductase , and is used to prevent prostate hypertrophy and prostate cancer .
The Life Extension Foundation sells saw palmetto berry extracts as a dietary supplement for this purpose .
Testosterone has been used in elderly men for " rejuvenation " — to restore virility & muscle strength .
Testosterone increases the risk of cardiovascular disease — by increasing blood pressure , by lowering HDL cholesterol and by elevating LDL cholesterol .
These same dangerous side effects are also seen in athletes who attempt to use androgens or other anabolic steroids to improve athletic performance .
Eunuchs reportedly live longer , although there have been no controlled clinical trials to prove this observation .
Sterilization of a dog or cat ( male or female ) adds a couple of years to its lifespan .
Any reduction in sex hormones would be expected to reduce cell proliferation and hence reduce the probability of cancer .
Male libido peaks in mid-adolescence , and does not correlate exactly with testosterone blood levels .
In elderly men it may take from 10 seconds to several minutes to get an erection , in contrast to 3−5 seconds in young men .
Contractions of the penile urethra during orgasm is reduced to 1−2 contractions per 0.8 - seconds from 3 −4 in young adults .
Ejaculatory distance is reduced from 12 − 24 inches to 3−5 inches .

Aging in the female reproductive system provides the best example of programmed aging in mammals .
For many other organs — particularly the heart , brain , lung and kidney — specific disease states associated with aging are of more significance than generalized deterioration .
There is wide variation in the health status of specific organs among the elderly .
Skin , lungs , muscles , blood vessels and organ - function in general is adversely affected by protein cross-linking — which is increased in diabetes .
Because most of those 65 years of age have at least some symptoms of subclinical diabetes and because most of the symptoms of aging are accelerated in diabetes , diabetes figures strongly when the elderly are described in terms of averages .
Generalized reduction in blood flow due to atherosclerosis also has an adverse effect on most organ systems — some more than others .
Both protein cross-linking and cardiovascular deterioration are strongly influenced by genetics and environmental influences ( diet , smoking , etc. ) .
With aging there is normally an age - related decrease in insulin sensitivity as well as of resting metabolic rate per unit of fat - free mass .
These changes may not occur for those who maintain high levels of aerobic exercise [ JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY ; Clevenger , CM ; 93(6):2105-2111 ( 2002 ) and AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY ; van Pelt , RE ; 281( 3 ) : E633 -E639 ( 2001 ) ] .
A study of very long - lived persons ( over age 95 ) did not show a decline in resting metabolic rate [ THE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM ; Rizzo , MR ; 90 ( 1):409-413 ( 2005 ) ] , but another study of those over age 90 did show reduced metabolic rate [ JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY ; Frisard , MI ; 62A(7):752-759 ( 2007 ) ] .
Whether survival is due to this trait or whether the trait is a feature of aging cannot be distinguished by cross-sectional studies .
The kidney provides perhaps the most striking example of individual variation in the effects of aging .
On average , kidney weight declines about 15 % between ages 40 and 80 .
The kidney 's filtering capacity for the average 90 - year - old is typically half what it is for the average 20 - year - old .
But high blood pressure and diabetes are particularly damaging to kidney function .
A 20 - year longitudinal study showed no change at all among elderly men who had no health problems .
If this result can be extrapolated it would mean that within the human maximum lifespan there is no significant kidney deterioration in the absence of disease conditions .
( For a discussion of the issue of whether dietary protein can harm kidney function , see my essay Does Excess Protein Cause Kidney Damage ? ) .
Cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause of death among those over age 85 .
The left ventricle of the heart increases in size with age ( hypertropy ) due to an increase in size of the heart muscle cells that must work harder to pump blood through a circulatory system that has narrower channels and reduced elasticity .
Lipofuscin content of heart muscle cells increases from about 1 % in the young to over 5 % in the old .
Arteries thicken with age such that about three - quarters of elderly people have increased blood pressure ( both systolic & diastolic ) .
But , stated conversely , about a quarter of elderly people do not have elevated blood pressure .
According to the Framingham Heart Study , systolic blood pressure is a better predictor of mortality than diastolic blood pressure .
Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg .
Hypertension is present in 5 % of those aged 60 and nearly one quarter of those aged 75 - 80 .
While heart attacks from ischemia account for 43 % of deaths for those 65 − 74 years of age , it accounts for only 8 % of deaths for that age group in Japan ( where death - rate from stroke is much higher ) .
( For more details concerning cardiovascular disease , risk factors and prevention — see my essays Sudden Cardiovascular Death and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease . )
Aerobic capacity decline
Aerobic capacity ( VO 2 max — liters of oxygen consumed per minute during peak exercise ) declines increasingly steeply with age , and declines more steeply in men than in women .
Although exercise increases aerobic capacity at any age , exercise does not prevent accelerated decline [ CIRCULATION ; Fleg , JL ; 112(5):674-682 ( 2005 ) ] .
The claim that all people lose about 100,000 neurons per day has not been supported by modern research .
2 % of neurons are lost , on average , between ages 20 and 90 ( up to 40 % of this loss in the frontal cortex ) .
Those over age 86 show an average 10 % decline in brain weight from age 20 .
Between age 30 and 90 brain volume declines an average of 14 % in the cerebral cortex , 35 % in the hippocampus and 26 % in cerebral white matter .
But averaging can be misleading , because the elderly include many people with considerable dementia and others with little or none .
Nonetheless , a cross-sectional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) study of healthy volunteers showed age - related declines in the volume of gray matter in association area ( rather than sensory areas ) of the cerebral cortex , particularly in the prefrontal cortex [ CEREBRAL CORTEX ; Raz , N ; 7(3):268-282 ( 1997 ) ] .
Dementias are more common among the elderly who develop cardiovascular disease .
Dramatic reduction in cerebral blood flow and in brain oxygen&glucose utilization is frequently seen after the 8th decade of life .
Although most dementias are due to Alzheimer 's Disease , at least 20 % of dementias are due to stroke(s ) .
Skeletal muscles are " fast - twitch " or " slow - twitch " .
Fast - twitch muscles ( " white meat " ) can deliver much power over short periods through energy from anaerobic ( oxygen - free ) phosphagen ( creatine phosphate ) and glycogen / lactic - acid metabolism .
Slow - twitch muscles ( " dark meat " ) provide endurance with aerobic metabolism — using more mitochondria , more myoglobin and more capillaries per square inch .
Sprinters &jumpers have more fast - twitch muscle , whereas marathoners &swimmers have more slow - twitch muscle .
Posture is maintained with slow - twitch muscles .
Aging results in greater loss of fast - twitch than slow - twitch muscle .
Muscle fibers are replaced by fat & connective - tissue .
Mitochondria die .
Exercise can slow this deterioration because fast - twitch fibers atrophy due to loss of the nerves that innervate them ( a loss possibly due to disuse ) .
Muscles in the iris of the eye atrophy , and pupil size reduces , with age — increasing the need for illumination .
The lens thickens and becomes yellowed , reducing green - blue - violet discrimination .
( Elderly painters use less violet & dark blue because the colors look the same . )
Collagen & elastin in tendons & ligaments become less resilient and more fragmented as a person grows older , particularly due to glycation ( cross- linking of proteins by sugar ) .
Articular cartilage becomes frayed and the synovial fluid between joints becomes " thinner " .
Decline in circulatory function contributes to this process .
Glycation of collagen & elastin is accelerated in diabetics due to high blood sugar .
Hair graying accompanies aging regardless of gender or race .
By 50 years of age approximately 50 % of people have 50 % gray hair [ MICRON ; Van Neste , D ; 35( 3):193-200 ( 2004 ) ] .
Aging of skin is commonly divided into " chronological aging " and " photoaging " , with up to 80 % of skin aging attributed to photoaging in non-smokers .
Photoaging is due to ultraviolet ( UV ) light , which activates inflammatory cytokines & metalloprotein collagenases as well as inducing free radicals [ ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGY ; Fisher , GJ ; 138(11) :1462-1479 ( 2002 ) ] .
UV radiation generates singlet oxygen which both activates metalloproteinases and causes large scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Berneburg , M ; 274(22):15345-15349 ( 1999 ) ] .
Carotenoids , especially lycopene , are particularly effective quenchers of singlet oxygen [ ARCHIVES OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS ; Di Mascio , P ; 274(2):532-538 ( 1989 ) ] .
Collagen & elastin also cross -link in skin , resulting in a loss of elasticity .
The protein keratin in fingernails is also a component of the outer layer of skin ( epidermis ) , which provides " water - proofing " .
The epidermis thins with age , leading to wrinkles .
Decreased secretion by sweat glands increases vulnerability to heat stroke .
When the melanocytes ( cells that produce the skin&hair - coloring substance melanin ) associated with hair follicles cease functioning , hair turns white .
Partial reduction of melanocyte function results in hair that appears " gray " .
Yet 90 % of Caucasians show increased melanin in the form of brownish spots on the back of their hands ( " liver spots " ) .
Although heat waves tend to lead to increased mortality among the elderly , those affected are generally persons with chronic disease conditions and unhealthy lifestyles .
There is little alteration of thermoregulation with age among the normal elderly [ JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY ; Kenney ;LW ; 95(6):2598-2603 ( 2003 ) ] .
Loss of flexibility of the proteins collagen & elastin in the lung results in loss of elastic recoil .
It becomes too difficult to fully exhale , which reduces air exchange , reducing the capacity to do work .
Oxygen - to - tissue transfer rate is often halved by age 70 .
Bone is typically 25 % water , 30 % soft tissue ( cells & blood vessels ) and 45 % mineral deposits ( mostly calcium ) .
Most of the white ash remaining after cremation is calcium , lead , zinc and potassium from bone .
Both men & women lose bone mass between the ages of 39 and 70 ( osteoporosis ) , but post - menopausal women ( who have reduce estrogen ) lose bone mass at twice the rate as men .
Decreased growth hormone causes bone loss in both sexes .
The physical inactivity & malnutrition ( especially for calcium and Vitamins D & C ) of so many elderly also worsens bone loss .
A reduction of one to three inches in height by age 80 is not unusual , with women shrinking twice as much as men .
Young bones have been compared to green tree branches that can bend considerably before breaking — and upon breaking does so with splintering .
By contrast , old bone is like a dry stick that snaps upon bending .
20 % of hip fractures associated with osteoporosis are fatal in the US .
Joints in the bones of the inner ear calcify , contributing to a loss in the ability to hear higher tones .
Loss of sweat glands in the ear causes earwax to become drier & crustier .
Wax obstruction reduces the ability to hear low frequencies .
Aging reduces salivary secretion resulting in a drier mouth and decreased protection from bacterial infection of the mouth .
Gastric juice volume is reduced 25 % by age 60 and there is a 60 % decline in pepsin activity .
But this does not noticeably affect digestion except in the case of heavy meats .
Absorption of Vitamin D ( and , hence , calcium absorption ) , Vitamin B 12 ( affected by reduced " intrinsic factor " ) and folic acid all typically decline with age .

Atomic nuclei are surrounded by electron orbitals which contain a maximum of two electrons , each having opposite spin .
Hydrogen has one outer orbital , but nitrogen , carbon and oxygen have 4 outer orbitals — with a capacity for 8 electrons ( an " octet " ) .
Atoms are most stable when they have filled orbitals .
Free radicals are highly reactive molecules or atoms that have an unpaired electron in an outer orbital that is not contributing to molecular bonding ( " free " ) .
Atoms or small molecules that are free radicals tend to be the most unstable , because larger molecules can have the capacity to form resonance structures .
Electron States of ROS . ( dot ) indicates free - radical extra electron
Normal molecular oxygen ( 3O 2 , so - called triplet oxygen ) is a very unusual free - radical in that it has two unpaired electrons in outer orbitals ( a double radical ) .
Pi−bonds are bonds formed from overlapping p−orbitals .
But for 3O 2 , two pi−bonds are formed from two p−orbitals , each containing one electron .
The two electrons can have three possible arrangements : two " up " −spin ( indicated by two up - arrows in the diagram ) , two " down " −spin or one spin " up " and one spin " down " — which makes 3O 2 somewhat stable .
But by the addition of energy ( 22.5 kcal / mole ) , both electrons are move into a single p−orbital , with the electrons having opposite spins — giving singlet oxygen ( 1O 2 ) .
Although singlet oxygen is not a free - radical , the electrons are in an excited state and can thus cause damaging reactions similar to those caused by oxygen free - radicals .
On the other hand , if an electron is added to normal triplet oxygen , the new electron completes one orbital , leaving the other orbital with an unpaired electron — resulting in a superoxide anion ( .O 2 − ) , which is a conventional , unitary free - radical .
Singlet oxygen is attracted to double - bonds and can react destructively with DNA & proteins .
Singlet oxygen is especially reactive with the amino acid histidine — resulting in enzyme denaturation .
Singlet oxygen oxidizes the guanine base of DNA to produce 8 −OHdG / 8−oxoG [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Ravanat , J ; 275(51):40601-50604 ( 2000 ) ] .
Singlet oxygen from ultraviolet light is believed to be the major contributor to " photoaging " of the skin [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Berneburg , M ; 274(22):15345-15349 ( 1999 ) ] .
Lewis structures are structural chemical formulas depicting outer - shell electrons .
I use abbreviated Lewis structures showing only relevant outer - shell electrons to explain free radicals — ie , I show a single orbital containing paired or unpaired electrons .
Because an orbital containing one ( unpaired ) electron is not being complemented with an electron of opposite spin , the electron is said to be in an " unstable spin state " ( another term for " free radical " ) .
Thus , chemicals that react - with and stabilize free radicals are called spin-trapping substances .
Free radicals can damage nucleic acids , proteins or lipids .
For biological systems , oxygen free radicals are the most important , in particular superoxide ( .O 2 − ) , nitric oxide ( .NO ) and the hydroxyl radical ( . OH ) .
About 0.3 % of superoxide exists in protonated form ( HO 2 . ) , which is more reactive than superoxide itself .
Because the protenated form of superoxide is uncharged , it can penetrate cell membranes more effectively than superoxide .
Nitric oxide is a relatively unreactive free - radical which has a half - life of a few seconds , normally reacting quickly with oxygen ( O 2 ) .
But if nitric oxide encounters a superoxide ( .O 2 − ) , it forms peroxynitrite ( ONOO − ) which can decompose to form a hydroxyl radical ( . OH ) .
Peroxynitrite , like the hydroxyl radical , can react directly with proteins and other macromolecules to produce carbonyls ( aldehydes & ketones ) , cross-linking and lipid peroxidation .
Only 1−4 % of the DNA single - strand breaks caused by peroxynitrite are due to hydroxyl radical ( indicating the minor effect decomposition has on total DNA damage by peroxynitrite ) [ ARCHIVES OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS ; Roussyn , I ; 330(1):216-218 ( 1996 ) ] .
Although hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) and hypochlorite ( OCl− — the active ingredient in bleach ) are not themselves free radicals , these oxygen - containing molecules can facilitate free - radical formation .
Moreover , HOCl is estimated to be hundreds of times more toxic than either hydrogen peroxide or superoxide [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Reiter , RJ ; 917:376-386 ( 2000 ) ] .
All of these highly reactive oxygen - containing molecules ( including singlet oxygen ) are described as Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) .
ROS attack bases in nucleic acids , amino acid side chains in proteins and double - bonds in unsaturated fatty acids — with the hydroxyl radical being the strongest attacker .
ROS attack of macromolecules is often called oxidative stress .
Reactive Nitrogen Species ( RNS ) also cause free radical damage .
Peroxynitrite , which does most of its damage to endothelial cells , is nearly as destructive as the hydroxyl radical .
In a neutral water solution about one per 10−7 water molecules will dissociate into two ions , a reaction that can be represented as :
H:O:H => :OH− + H +
However , a water molecule subjected to ionizing radiation might dissociate into two free radicals : a hydroxyl radical & a hydrogen atom .
The reaction can be represented as :
H:O:H => .OH + .
H
A superoxide ion ( .O 2 − ) would result from the addition of an electron to a normal oxygen molecule ( O 2 ) .
A more complete Lewis structure of oxygen - containing free - radical molecules ( with oxygen & hydroxide ion also illustrated for contrast ) showing all outer shell electrons would be :
It would be more accurate to draw resonance structures , but the above representations may be better for explanatory purposes .
The weed - killing herbicide paraquat generates superoxide .
Superoxide ( .O 2 − ) ions are generated in large numbers in the mitochondria .
Two superoxide ions are enzymatically converted to hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) by the enzyme superoxide dismutase :
. O 2 − + .O 2 − + 2H + =>
H 2 O 2 + O 2
The hydroxyl radical ( .OH ) is typically formed by oxidation of a reduced heavy metal ion ( Fe++ or Cu+ , usually ) by the hydrogen peroxide :
Fe++ + H 2 O 2 => Fe +++ + .OH + :OH −
The last reaction , known as the Fenton Reaction , may be the most dangerous because it can occur in the cell nucleus and lead to DNA damage .
The oxidized iron ( Fe +++ ) can then catalyze the Haber - Weiss Reaction between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to produce more hydroxyl radicals :
. O 2 − + H 2 O 2 => O 2 + .OH + :OH −
At neutral pH the Haber - Weiss reaction occurs only to a negligible extent when no metal ion is available to act as a catalyst .
In the human body ascorbic acid is normally beneficial rather than harmful because nearly all iron and copper ions are tightly bound to carrier proteins ( transferrin for iron and cearuloplasmin for copper ions ) , but this is not the case in the Cerebral Spinal Fluid ( CSF ) or where there is cellular breakdown due to ischemic - reperfusion injury .
Bacteria are rich in iron , which is why hydrogen peroxide from macrophages is such an effective bacterial killer .
Metal ions can also react with ascorbate ( Vitamin C ) to produce singlet oxygen ( 1O 2 ) from normal triplet oxygen ( 3O 2 ) :
Cu++ + ascorbate + 3O 2 => 1O 2
Unlike iron , copper generates more singlet oxygen than hydroxyl radical upon its reaction with hydrogen peroxide .
Wherever it is produced , the hydroxyl radical is highly reactive and can cause covalent cross-linking or free - radical propagation in a wide variety of biological molecules .
A cell 's superoxide ions tend to be concentrated in the mitochondria because they are too reactive to travel very far in an unaltered state — and are much less frequently found in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm .
Similarly , hydroxyl radicals ( which have a billionth - of - a - second half - life ) do not drift far from their site of formation .
But hydrogen peroxide molecules are more stable and can drift across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus or near cell membranes where hydroxyl radicals can be generated when heavy metal ions are encountered .
Hydrogen peroxide can damage proteins directly by the oxidation of −SH groups .
The hydroxyl radical can react with molecules ( LH ) in membranes to produce lipid molecule radicals ( alkyl = .L )
Peroxyl Radical from Alkyl Radical
. OH + LH => .L + H 2 O
These lipid radicals can then react directly with oxygen ( autoxidation ) in a self - propagating chain reaction forming lipid peroxides ( lipid peroxyl radicals , lipid molecules containing paired - oxygen groups − − OO − − ) :
.L + O 2 => LOO .
LOO . + LH => LOOH + .
L
The first reaction is about fifteen hundred times faster with singlet oxygen ( 1O 2 ) than with normal triplet oxygen ( 3O 2 ) .
Singlet oxygen is energetic enough , however , that it can react directly with the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids , without requiring a free radical intermediate .
The lipid hydroperoxides ( LOOH ) can promote a Fenton reaction :
Fe++ + LOOH + H+ => Fe +++ + .OL + H 2 O
The lipid alkoxyl radical ( alkoxy = alkoxyl = .OL ) is more reactive and damaging than the lipid peroxide ( peroxyl ) radical ( peroxy = peroxyl = LOO . ) .
Thus , by a small sequence of steps one free - radical ( .L ) has become two radicals ( .L and .OL ) — conditions for an auto - amplifying chain reaction .
Nonetheless , if two alkyl , alkoxyl or peroxyl radical molecules collide they will nullify each other , but at the cost of creating a cross- link ( covalent bond ) between the two lipids .
Free Radical Half - Life at 37 ºC Radical Symbol Half - Life Time Hydroxyl .OH one nanosecond Singlet Oxygen 1O 2 one microsecond Superoxide .O 2 − one microsecond Alkoxyl .OL one microsecond Peroxyl LOO .
ten milliseconds Nitric Oxide .NO few seconds
The reactivity of free radicals can be quantified by a table of half - life ( time taken for half of the remaining radicals to react ) values at 37 ºC ( body temperature ) .
Short half - life corresponds to high reactivity .
The one nanosecond half - life of the hydroxyl radical indicates that it is so reactive that it reacts with the first molecule it bumps into .
Outside of the mitochondria , superoxide and hydrogen peroxide can be generated on the endoplasmic reticulum through oxidation processes involving cytochrome P−450 and NADPH −cytochrome c reductase .
Abnormal accumulation of normal metabolites such as lactate , pyruvate , acetoacetyl −CoA and glyceraldehyde−3 −phosphate can abnormally increase levels of NADH oxidase & reduced flavoenzymes such as xanthine oxidase .
In the absence of sufficient electron acceptor substrates these enzymes can directly transfer electrons to O 2 or Fe +++ to form superoxide or Fe ++.
Ascorbate forms H 2 O 2 on autoxidation ( direct combination with oxygen ) .
Both ascorbate & mercaptans ( thioalcohols , ie , compounds having " −SH " groups , where sulfur is substituted for the oxygen of alcohol ) are capable of reducing Fe +++ & Cu++ to Fe++ & Cu+ , thereby promoting Fenton reactions .
Lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids exposed to oxygen leads to rancidity in foods .
In living animal cells peroxidized membranes lose their permeability , becoming rigid , reactive and nonfunctional .
Lipid peroxidation can produce singlet oxygen , hydroperoxides and lipid epoxides .
In addition , many damaging aldehydes are formed during lipid peroxidation , particularly MalonDiAldehyde ( MDA , propanedial ) & 4 − HydroxyNonEnal ( 4−HNE ) .
MDA is a major metabolite of arachidonic acid ( 20:4 ) [ fatty acid with 20 − carbons & 4 double - bonds ] .
MDA assays ( notably TBARS — ThioBarbituric Acid-Reacting Substances ) have been widely used as a measure of cell membrane lipid peroxidation .
4−HNE is also a product of 20:4 fatty acid autoxidation .
4−HNE reacts with cellular components more strongly than MDA .
4−HNE reacts readily with histidine residues , sulfhydryl groups and primary amino groups of proteins [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Uchida , K ; 89(10):4544-4548 ( 1992 ) ] .
The fact that 4−HNE is the most toxic known aldehyde produced by lipid peroxidation ( much more toxic than MDA ) and yet is practically non-reactive with TBA ( about 95 % of TDA reactivity is due to MDA ) points to the deficiency of TBARS as a lipid peroxidation assay [ ALCOHOL & ALCOHOLISM 20( 2) :161-173 ( 1985 ) ] .
F 2 −isoprotanes , produced by oxidation of arachidonic acid , are the best biomarkers of lipid peroxidation [ FASEB JOURNAL ; Montuschi , P ; 18(15):1791-1800 ( 2004 ) ] .
LIPID PEROXIDATION FORMING MDA
Unlike free - radicals , the aldehydes MDA , 4−HNE & other aldehydes are rather long - lived and can drift far from membranes , damaging a wide variety of proteins , lipids & nucleic acids [ FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE 11:81 -128 ( 1991 ) ] .
Such damaged molecules are called Advanced Lipid peroxidation End-products ( ALE , which can be as resistant to degradation as AGEs [ BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY ; Negre - Salvayre , A ; 153( 1) :6-20 ( 2008 ) ] .
4−HNE inactivates glucose −6 −phosphate dehydrogenase , an enzyme required for the formation of NADPH and for forming ribose residues for nucleic acid biosynthesis .
Aldehyde - bridge formation leads to the protein - protein cross-linking associated with lipofuscin formation .
Plasma levels of both MDA and 4−HNE rise significantly with age [ FREE RADICAL RESEARCH ; Gil , L ; 40(5):495-505 ( 2006 ) ] .
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are more vulnerable to free radical oxidation than any other macromolecules in the body — and the sensitivity to free radical damage increases exponentially with the number of double bonds .
Studies of the liver lipids of mammals & a bird ( pigeon ) show an inverse relationship between maximum lifespan and number of double bonds [ JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY 55A( 6 ) : B286-B291 ( 2000 ) ] .
Nonetheless , brain phospholipid unsaturation does not vary much between mammals , probably indicating the importance of unsaturated fatty acids for neural function [ COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY Part B 132:515-527 ( 2002 ) ] .
Animal cells contain three important enzymes to deal with the superoxide and hydrogen peroxide : SuperOxide Dismutase ( SOD ) , glutathione peroxidase and CATalase ( CAT ) .
A dismutase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of two identical molecules to produce molecules in different oxidative states .
In the absense of SOD , two superoxide ions can spontaneously dismutate to produce hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen .
SOD catalyzes a reaction between two superoxide ions to produce hydrogen peroxide and triplet oxygen .
Catalase catalyzes the formation of water & free oxygen from hydrogen peroxide .
CAT is present in membrane - limited organelles known as peroxisomes .
Peroxisomes contain enzymes that degrade amino acids & fatty acids — producing hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct .
Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of the amino acids cysteine , glycine and glutamic acid .
Glutathione is the major antioxidant in the non-lipid portion of cells ( most of the cytoplasm ) .
Glutathione exists in a reduced form ( GSH ) and an oxidized form ( GSSG ) .
Reduced glutathione hydrogen donation can neutralize a hydroxyl radical :
GSH + .OH —> .GS + H 2 O
and then oxidized glutathione radicals can neutralize each other :
. GH + . GH —>
GSSG
Glutathione peroxidase neutralizes hydrogen peroxide by taking hydrogens from two GSH molecules — resulting in two H 2 O and one GSSG .
The enzyme glutathione reductase then regenerates GSH from GSSG with NADPH as a source of hydrogen .
The elimination of hydrogen peroxide by glutathione can be written as the reaction :
2 GSH + H 2 O 2 => GSSG + 2 H 2 O
Long - lived transgenic fruit flies in which the enzyme which synthesizes GSH was overexpressed showed a maximum lifespan extension of nearly 50 % [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Orr , WC ; 280(45):37331-37338 ( 2005 ) ] .
Glutathione levels generally decline with age [ JOURNAL OF ANTI - AGING MEDICINE ; Lang , CA ; 4( 2):137-144 ( 2001 ) ] , although no reduction of serum glutathione was seen in elderly women deemed to be in excellent physical and mental health [ JOURNAL OF LABORATORY AND CLINICAL MEDICINE ; Lang , CA ; 140(6):413-417 ( 2002 ) ] .
Free radicals act on lipids to produce peroxides ( −O− O− bonds ) resulting in mutagenic epoxides and insoluble & non-digestible age pigments such as lipofuscin .
Glutathione peroxidase / glutathione destroys fat peroxides in the same way it eliminates hydrogen peroxide :
2 GSH + ROOH => GSSG + ROH + H 2 O
Superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) is the most abundant anti-oxidant enzyme in animals .
The liver , in particular , is very high in SOD .
Cellular concentration of SOD relative to metabolic activity is a very good lifespan predictor of animal species .
Most mammals experience a lifetime energy expenditure of 200,000 calories per gram , but humans have an amazing 800,000 calories per gram .
Humans have the highest levels of SOD — relative to metabolic rate — of all species studied .
Oxidative damage to DNA is ten times greater in rats than in humans .
Maximum lifespan correlates with lower rate of free - radical production and higher rate of DNA repair [ JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B 168(3) :149-158 ( 1998 ) ] .
The SOD molecule in the cytoplasm ( SOD1 ) and outside of cells ( SOD3 ) contains copper & zinc atoms ( Cu / Zn −SOD ) , whereas the SOD in mitochondria ( SOD2 ) contains manganese ( Mn−SOD ) .
Superoxide dismutase without glutathione peroxidase or catalase ( CAT ) to remove hydrogen peroxide is of little value .
Insects lack glutathione peroxidase , but experiments have been performed on fruit flies made transgenic by having extra genes for SOD , CAT or both .
The flies that were given extra genes for SOD or CAT ( but not both ) had no more than a 10 % increase in mean lifespan , with no increase in maximum lifespan .
But flies that had extra genes for both SOD and CAT showed maximum lifespan increase by as much as a third , while showing less protein oxidative damage and better physical performance [ SCIENCE 263:1128-1130 ( 1994 ) ] .
But criticisms that the above experiments had been performed on short - lived strains of flies led to later experiments on long - lived strains of flies which showed no lifespan extension for overexpression of Cu / Zn −SOD , Mn−SOD , catalase and thioredoxin [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Orr , WC ; 278(29):26418-26422 ( 2003 ) ] .
Nonetheless , an experiment using SOD / CAT mimetics in nematode worms increased mean lifespan 44 % [ SCIENCE 289:1567-1569 ( 2000 ) ] .
Selective inbreeding of bread - mold fungus resulted in strains with lifespans more than 6 times longer than wild - type — a change that was shown to be due to increased expression of antioxidant enzymes [ FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY & MEDICINE 8:355-361 ( 1990 ) ] .
Females express both more Mn−SOD and more glutathione peroxidase than males , and this has been suggested to be the reason females live longer than males in mammalian species [ FEBS LETTERS ; Vina , J ; 579( 12):2541-2545 ( 2005 ) ] .
The maximum lifespan of transgenic mice has been extended about 20 % by overexpression of human catalase targeted to mitochondria [ SCIENCE ; Schriner , SE ; 308:1909 - 1911 ( 2005 ) ] .
Although naked mole rats exhibit high levels of oxidative damage , these levels remain unchanged for over two decades [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Perez , VI ; 106(9):3059-3064 ( 2009 ) ] .
Radiation produces the hydroxyl radical , but most of the oxygen free radicals are byproducts of cell metabolism — particularly in the mitochondria , the lysosomes and the peroxisomes .
One of the reasons these organelles are surrounded by membranes may be to protect the cell from the free - radicals they generate .
DNA may be sequestered in the nucleus , in part , as additional protection against free radicals .
Nonetheless , free radicals contribute to DNA damage and mutation .
In addition to enzymes , the animal cell uses many other chemicals to protect against oxygen free - radicals .
Vitamin E is the main free - radical trap in the ( lipid ) membranes .
Vitamin C acts as an anti-oxidant in the non-lipid ( " watery " ) portions of cells , between cells and in the bloodstream .
Melatonin , a hormone produced by the pineal gland in decreasing quantities with aging , efficiently crosses membranes ( including the nucleus ) and is effective against hydroxyl radicals .
Uric acid ( which is mostly formed from purine degradation ) protects Vitamin C from oxidation by divalent ions and can act as an anti-oxidant .
Uric acid also protects against free - radical catalysis by binding iron .
Humans have higher levels of uric acid than monkeys and other mammals because humans lack the enzyme uricase .
But birds typically have twice the plasma uric acid concentration as humans .
Birds often live several times as long as comparably sized mammals despite over twice the metabolic rate , 2−6 times the plasma glucose and a 3 º C higher body temperature .
Mammals fed anti-oxidants show up to a 30 % increase in average lifespan , but no increase in maximum lifespan .
Anti-oxidants are most valuable for animals that are cancer - prone , or subjected to radiation or chemical toxins .
There are evidently homeostatic mechanisms in cells that govern the amount of allowable anti-oxidant activity .
For example , increased levels of Vitamin E in the diet correlates with reduced levels of glutathione peroxidase activity , and vice versa .
Vitamin E was shown to increase catalase in banana fruit - flies — with increasing doses of Vitamin E extending fruit - fly lifespan up to a dose of 5 micrograms / mL , above which increasing doses decreased lifespan [ GERONTOLOGY 42:312-321 ( 1996 ) ] .

Mitochondrion organelle
The mitochondria are capsule - shaped cellular organelles that generate energy ( ATP molecules ) from aerobic ( oxygen- utilizing ) metabolism utilizing respiratory chain and ATP synthase enzymes .
Most animal cells contain between a few hundred and a few thousand mitochondria .
The most mitochondria are found in the cells that are most metabolically active : neurons and muscle cells , where mitochondria make up about 40 % of cell volume .
About 10 % of the body weight of a human adult is mitochondria .
A mitochondrion has two membranes .
The outer membrane contains small pores ( porins , also known as Voltage - Dependent Anion Channels , VDACs ) that are freely permeable to ions and other molecules smaller than 10 kiloDaltons in size .
The inner membrane is highly impermeable , even to protons ( H+ ions ) .
The proton gradient across the inner membrane is used by ATP synthetase enzyme to generate ATP molecules .
The region between the outer membrane and the inner membrane is more positively charged ( P−phase ) because of the higher proton concentration , whereas the inside of the inner membrane is more negatively charged ( N−phase , the matrix ) .
It is in the matrix that the Krebs citric acid cycle occurs .
There can be tens of thousands of respiratory chain and associated ATP synthase molecules embedded in the inner membrane of a mitochondrion , especially in metabolically active cells that have their inner membranes most highly folded into cristae that increase surface area .
The inner membrane contains a number of active molecule carriers , including a phosphate ( P i = H 2 PO 4 -) carrier and the Adenine Nucleotide Transporter ( ANT ) .
The ANT imports ADP molecules into the matrix for ATP synthesis in exchange for ATP molecules which are exported for energy use throughout the cell ( like portable batteries ) .
The respiratory chain ( " electron transport chain " ) attached to the inner wall of the inner membrane is composed of 4 protein complexes .
These protein complexes are identified as Complex I , II , III and IV .
Complex II consists of only four peptides , two of which comprise the Krebs citric acid cycle protein succinate dehydrogenase , and two of which anchor the complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane .
Complex I and Complex II independently supply electrons to Complex III , which supplies electrons to Complex IV .
Soluble carriers are used to transport electrons to and from Complex III .
The soluble carrier transporting electrons from Complex I & II to Complex III is Coenzyme Q ( CoQ ) .
The soluble carrier that transports electrons from Complex III to Complex IV is cytochrome−c .
For this reason Complex III is also known as cytochrome−c reductase and Complex IV is also known as cytochrome−c oxidase .
Complex IV combines its electrons ( which are actually hydrogen atoms ) with oxygen to form water .
The energy released by the oxidations in the respiratory chain are used to pump protons outside the inner mitochondrial membrane .
Protons pumped out of mitochondrial matrix Re-entering protons drive " ATP turbine "
The inner mitochondrial membrane is fairly impermeable to H+ ions ( " protons " ) and thus is able to function much like a hydroelectric dam .
Respiratory enzymes ( Complex I , III & IV ) pump protons out of the inner mitochondrial matrix , building proton pressure outside the " dam " ( the membrane ) .
The proton pressure ( " proton - motive force " ) across the inner membrane is composed of two components : a pH difference and an electrical potential ( membrane potential ) , which is the most important component .
The pH difference is small , amounting to only about 0.5 pH units .
The membrane potential of the mitochondrial membrane is about twice as great as that of a large nerve fiber , amounting to over 200 milliVolts .
Complex V ( F 0 F 1 − ATP synthase ) is the " hydroelectric turbine " that utilizes the energy of the proton flow into the matrix through the " turbine " to synthesize ATP .
The ATP synthase ( Complex V ) " rotary motor " is the smallest known natural nanomachine .
It uses proton - motive force to drive the endothermic reaction :
ADP + P i => ATP
The combined result of respiratory ( oxidative ) steps and the ATP - creation ( phosphorylation of ADP ) step is called oxidative phosphorylation .
Normally respiration ( oxygen consumption ) and phosphorylation ( ATP production ) are tightly coupled , ie , the amount of ATP produced corresponds to the amount of oxygen consumed — referred to as state 3 respiration .
In the absence of ADP ( eg , in a resting state ) , however , any respiration that occurs will be due to " proton leak " through the inner mitochondrial membrane rather than due to ATP production — referred to as state 4 respiration .
( State 1 , state 2 and state 5 are experimental conditions of more historical interest than metabolic interest . )
In state 4 respiration protons flowing directly through the inner membrane rather than through the " ATP turbine " ( Complex V ) produce heat energy rather than ATP energy .
Uncoupling proteins are weak acids that dissolve inner membrane lipids thereby increasing the uncoupling of oxidation from phosphorylation .
Uncoupling respiration from phosphorylation to produce heat is useful for small rodents , naked newborn babies , and hibernating & cold - acclimated animals , all of which contain " brown fat " .
Uncoupling is also useful for fever production .
UCP1 is the UnCoupling Protein found in " brown fat " , fat which has been made brown by high concentrations of mitochondria .
UCP2 has broad tissue distribution and seems to function in stress response , but its expression is less than 1 % of UCP1 .
UCP3 is found in muscle and is regulated by thyroid hormone ( T 3 ) .
UCP2 & UCP3 may cause uncoupling for the purpose of reducing mitochondrial superoxide production [ FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY & MEDICINE ; Echtay , KS ; 43( 10 ) :1351-1371 ( 2007 ) ] .
The function of UCP1 is to generate heat ( " thermogenesis " ) .
Claims have been made that UCP3 generates little heat , but functions to reduce free radical damage by lowering protein gratient during periods of high metabolic activity .
Mice with higher UCP3 have shown higher metabolic intensity ( 17 % greater resting oxygen consumption ) and 36 % longer lifespan [ AGING CELL ; Speakman , JR ; 3( 3):87-95 ( 2004 ) ] .
Proton leak has not been shown to be a factor in CRAN ( Caloric Restriction with Adequate Nutrition ) [ AMERICIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY ; Ramsey , JJ ; 286( 1 ) : E31-E40 ( 2004 ) ] .
The fact that dieting - resistant obese subjects have been shown to have smaller amounts of UCP3 [ DIABETES ; Harper , M ; 51(8):2459-2466 ( 2002 ) ] would seem to indicate that thermogenesis from UCP3 is not negligible .
Compared to the heart & brain , mitochondria in the liver are more tightly coupled and use oxygen more efficiently for ATP production .
The heart & brain mitochondria use more oxygen than liver mitochondria , but can produce ATP faster .
Brain mitochondria are more geared toward maintaining cell integrity , in contrast to heart mitochondria which are more geared toward preserving cellular energy state [ AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY ; Cairns , CB ; 274(5 ) : R1376-R1383 ( 1998 ) ] .
Increasing insulin levels associated with aging and type −2 diabetes stimulates nitric oxide synthetase resulting in peroxynitrite [ THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY 34:1340-1354 ( 2002 ) ] .
Lipid peroxidation of the inner mitochondrial membrane by peroxynitrite can increase proton leak independent of uncoupling protein .
Peroxynitrite can also degrade function of respiratory enzymes [ JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY 70:2195-2202 ( 1998 ) ] and inactivate mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( Mn−SOD ) enzyme [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) 93(21) :11853-11858 ( 1996 ) ] .
Mitochondria are the only cellular organelles with their own DNA .
( There is no other cellular DNA outside the nucleus apart from the DNA of mitochondria . )
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) in humans are circular strands of 16,569 nucleic acids that code for 37 genes — 22 transfer RNAs , 2 ribosomal RNAs and 13 transmembrane proteins .
There are nearly 1,500 other gene products in mitochondria , which are coded - for by nuclear DNA ( nDNA ) .
In contrast to nDNA , the mtDNA is derived almost entirely from the mother .
Each cell contains many mitochondria , but the total mtDNA in a cell represents less than 1 % of the amount of DNA found in the nucleus .
Inner Membrane mtDNA - coded Proteins in Complex I , III , IV & V Re-entering protons drive " ATP turbine "
Each mitochondrion contains 2 - to - 12 identical copies of mitochondrial DNA ( 2 - to - 12 circular strands ) .
Each mtDNA strand codes for 13 proteins , all of which are transmembrane subunits of Complex I , III , IV or V .
Of the 13 mtDNA proteins , 7 are in Complex I , 1 is in Complex III , 3 are in Complex IV and 2 are in Complex V . A distinctive feature of the 13 proteins coded - for by the mtDNA is that they are hydrophobic ( not easily dissolved in water ) , suggesting that it might be difficult to synthesize & transport them in the watery cytoplasm .
For this reason it has seemed improbable that the mtDNA for these proteins could be moved to the nucleus where they would be better protected & repaired .
But one of the Complex V ( ATPase ) mtDNA - coded proteins has been successfully synthesized in the nucleus and utilized in the mitochondria for a mammalian cell [ REJUVENATION RESEARCH ; Zullo , SJ ; 8 ( 1):18 - 28 ( 2005 ) ] giving hope to the idea that all 13 mtDNA proteins might eventually be moved to the nucleus .
An alternate hypothesis , however , claims that the mtDNA genes are of value in providing rapid local synthesis of proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation .
Oxidative stress due to insufficient oxidative phosphorylation capability could signal mitochondrial transcription factors to induce production of mtDNA - coded proteins that are then implanted into the inner membrane where they attract the nDNA - coded proteins required for complete assembly of the complexes [ PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY ; Allen , JF ; 358( 1429 ) :19-38 ( 2003 ) ] .
Complex I , which has 7 mtDNA - coded proteins ( more than a quarter of all the proteins in the Complex ) , ages most rapidly .
Substantia nigra neurons have increased susceptibility to Complex I defects — which may be responsible for Parkinson 's Disease [ NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING ; Smigrodzki , R ; 25:1273-1281 ( 2004 ) ] .
By contrast , Complex II ( which has no mtDNA - coded proteins ) and Complex III ( which has only one ) are relatively unaffected by aging .
Cytochrome−c oxidase ( between Complex III and Complex IV ) activity declines with age , resulting in increased production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide .
Diseases due to mutated mtDNA have the greatest effect on cells producing the most energy — cells of brain and muscle — hence mitochondrial diseases are often encephalomyopathies .
A very common syndrome of mitochondrial disease is Mitochondria Encephalomyopathy , Lactic Acidosis & Stroke ( MELAS ) .
Homoplasmy describes the original condition of all of a person 's mtDNA being the same , but as mtDNA mutations occur and the mutated mtDNA replicates , cells , tissues and even mitochondria can have a mixture of mtDNA types , a condition known as heteroplasmy .
An estimated 1−2 % of oxygen used by mitochondria will normally " leak " from the respiratory chain to form superoxide [ JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY 59:1609 -1623 ( 1992 ) & JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 238:405-421 ( 1995 ) ] .
The pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor−alpha ( TNF−α , associated with the metabolic syndrome ) induces increased free radical production from the respiratory chain [ AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ; Corda, S ; 24(6):762-768 ( 2001 ) ] .
Aging is associated with decreased oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency and increased superoxide production .
Free radicals can damage the mitochondrial inner membrane , creating a positive feedback - loop for increased free - radical creation .
The " viscious cycle " theory that free radical damage to mitochondrial DNA leads to mitochondria that produce more superoxide has been questioned .
The most damaged mitochondria are consumed by lysosomes whereas the more defective mitochondria ( which produce less ATP as well as less superoxide ) remain to reproduce themselves [ REJUVENATION RESEARCH ; de Grey , A ; 8 ( 1):13 -17 ( 2005 ) ] .
But the efficiency of lysosomes to consume malfunctioning mitochondria declines with age , resulting in more mitochondria producing higher levels of superoxide .
Mitochondria of older organisms are fewer in number , larger in size and less efficient ( produce less energy & more superoxide ) .
Coenzyme Q ( CoQ , in humans CoQ 10 ) is also known as ubiquinone , so - called because it is " ubiquitous " ( universally - found ) in almost all cellular organisms , with the exception of gram - positive bacteria and some fungi .
CoQ is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain .
From Complex
I or Complex II dehydrogenase CoQ is reduced to CoQH 2 and subsequently oxidized in two steps — first to .
CoQ− and then to CoQ .
But .
CoQ− is unstable and can easily errantly transfer an electron to an O 2 molecule resulting in superoxide ion ( .O 2 − ) .
. O 2 − from Complex III escapes Mitochondria
Complex I has been believed to generate .O 2 − in one of the iron - sulfur clusters , which would go to the mitochondrial matrix where it could be neutralized by Mn−SOD .
Experiments on isolated mitochondria identified the site of superoxide generation to be at the flavine mononucleotide moiety of Complex I [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Kudin , AP ; 279(6):4127-4135 ( 2004 ) ] , but claims have been made that experiments on isolated mitochondria are misleading [ ACTA BIOCHEMICA POLONICA ; Nohl , H ; 51(1):223-229 ( 2004 ) ] .
An experiment on isolated synaptosomes indicated that Complex I inhibition increases H 2 O 2 production [ THE JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE ; Tretter , L ; 24(36):7771-7778 ( 2004 ) ] .
Most of the .O 2 − generated from Complex III comes from .
CoQ− , with about half going to the matrix to be neutralized and half floating toward the cytoplasm [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Muller , FL ; 279(47):49064-49073 ( 2004 ) ] .
Thus , .O 2 − from Complex I & III can cause lipid peroxidation of the inner mitochondrial membrane and mtDNA damage , whereas .O 2 − from Complex III can damage the whole cell , including nDNA .
Membrane potentials below 140 mV ( potential resulting from the proton gradients across the inner mitochondrial membrane ) are not associated with .O 2 − , but above 140 mV .O 2 − generation increases exponentially with potential .
Uncoupling proteins can be a device for reducing proton pressure ( membrane potential ) , thereby reducing superoxide production .
Voltage drops between Complexes
Higher voltage drops between energy states in the Complexes also result in greater capacity for superoxide generation .
This may account for the high superoxide production associated with Complex I , which has a high voltage drop in transferring its electrons to Complex III .
Oxidative damage to particular mitochondrial proteins in the flight muscles of houseflies has been identified as a biomarker of aging for those insects .
Specifically , adenine nucleotide transferase enzyme in mitochondrial membranes [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Yan , L ; 95(22):12896-12901 ( 1998 ) ] and the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Yan , L ; 94(21 ) :11168-11172 ( 1997 ) ] are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage and are used to identify the " physiological age " of houseflies .
Aconitase also shows the most significant age - related decline of any citric acid cycle enzyme in mice [ MECHANISMS OF AGING AND DEVELOPMENT ; Yarian , CS ; 127(1):79 - 84 ( 2006 ) ] .
Aconitase is readily oxidized by superoxide , a process that generates hydroxyl radical [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Vasquez - Vivar , J ; 275(19 ) :14064-14069 ( 2000 ) ] .
CoQ forms an important part of the antioxidant defense against these superoxide radicals [ BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY 70:390-403 ( 1992 ) ] .
The Mn−SOD ( SuperOxide Dismutase ) of mitochondria can be induced to higher concentrations by oxidative stress ( in contrast to the cytoplasmic Cu / Zn −SOD which is constitutive rather than induced ) .
Heart mitochondria also contains catalase ( which is confined to peroxisomes in most other tissues ) [ BIOSCIENCE REPORTS 17 ( 1) :3-8 ( 1997 ) ] .
Associated with aging is a decline in the amount of CoQ in organs .
A person 80 years old will typically have about half as much CoQ 10 in the heart , lungs and spleen as a 20 - year - old [ LIPIDS 24(7):579-584 ( 1989 ) ] .
Declines in functional mitochondria & CoQ 10 with age is most damaging to those organs that have the highest energy demands per gram of tissue , namely : the heart , kidney , brain , liver and skeletal muscle , in that order [ JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 238:405-421 ( 1995 ) ] .
Neurons are the largest cells in the body and have the highest metabolic demands , with 70 % of ATP produced required to maintain the sodium - potassium pump .
Clinically , damage to brain and muscle tissue are the first symptoms of mitochondrial disease .
Mitochondria in the brain tissue of Alzheimer 's Disease patients is particularly damaged .
Therapy has included the B−vitamins that act as coenzymes in the respiratory chain ( thiamine , riboflavin , niacinamide ) and CoQ 10 [ ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVIA 92:273-280 ( 1995 ) ] .
mtDNA deletion mutations accumulate in post-mitotic cells with age [ BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA 410:183-193 ( 1999 ) ] .
The " mitochondrial theory of aging " postulates that damage to mtDNA and organelles by free radicals leads to loss of mitochondrial function and loss of cellular energy ( with loss of cellular function ) .
Mutations in mtDNA occur at 10 - 20 times the rate seen in nuclear DNA .
A significant portion of " photoaging " of the skin may be due to mtDNA deletions from singlet oxygen induced by ultraviolet light [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Berneburg , M ; 274(22):15345-15349 ( 1999 ) ] .
Transgenic mice having high levels of mtDNA point mutations and deletions are models of accelerated aging [ CELL METABOLISM ; Edgar , D ; 10(2):131-138 ( 2009 ) and AGING ; Edgar , D ; 1( 12):1028-1032 ( 2009 ) ] .
Unlike nuclear DNA , mtDNA has no protective histone proteins .
And DNA repair is less efficient in mitochondria than in the nucleus .
These factors account for the more rapid aging seen with Complex I & III as compared to Complex II & IV .
Aging mitochondria become enlarged and , if they can be engulfed by lysosomes , are resistant to degredation and contribute to lipofuscin formation [ EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY ; Brunk , UT ; 269(8):1996-2002 ( 2002 ) ] .
A comparison of 7 non-primate mammals ( mouse , hamster , rat , guinea - pig , rabbit , pig and cow ) showed that the rate of mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in heart & kidney were inversely correlated with maximum life span [ FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY & MEDICINE 15:621-627 ( 1993 ) ] .
A similar study of 8 non-primate mammals showed a direct correlation between maximum lifespan and oxidative damage to mtDNA in heart & brain .
There was a 4 - fold difference in levels of oxidative damage and a 13 - fold difference in longevity , supportive of the idea that mtDNA oxidative damage is but one of several causes of aging [ THE FASEB JOURNAL ; Barja , G ; 14(2):312-318 ( 2000 ) ] .
A comparison of the heart mitochondria in rats ( 4 - year lifespan ) and pigeons ( 35 - year lifespan ) showed that pigeon mitochondria leak fewer free - radicals than rat mitochondria , despite the fact that both animals have similar metabolic rate and cardiac output .
Pigeon heart mitochondria ( Complexes I & III ) showed a 4.6 % free radical leak compared to a 16 % free radical leak in rat heart mitochondria [ MECHANISMS OF AGING AND DEVELOPMENT 98(2):95-111 ( 1997 ) ] .
Hummingbirds use thousands of calories in a day ( more than most humans ) and have relatively long lifespans ( the broad - tailed hummingbird Selasphorus platycerus has a maximum lifespan in excess of 8 years ) .
Birds have less unsaturation ( oxidizability ) in their mitochondrial membranes and have higher levels of small - molecule antioxidants , such as ascorbate & uric acid .
Even for mammals there is a direct relationship between mitochondrial membrane saturation and maximum lifespan [ JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH ; Pamplona , R ; 39( 10):1989 -1994 ( 1998 ) ] .
Free-radicals from mitochondria result in damage to cellular protein , lipids and DNA throughout the cell .
This damage has been implicated as a cause of aging .
If the fatty acids entering the mitochondria for energy - yielding oxidation have been peroxidized in the blood , this places an additional burden on antioxidant defenses .
The greatest damage occurs in the mitochondria themselves , including damage to the respiratory chain protein complexes ( leading to higher levels of superoxide production ) , damage to the mitochondrial membrane ( leading to membrane leakage of calcium ions and other substances ) and damage to mitochondrial DNA ( leading to further damage to mitochondrial protein complexes ) .
An experiment in yeast that improved the accuracy of mitochondrial protein synthesis demonstrated a 27 % longer mean life span [ JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGY 57A( 1 ) : B29-B36 ( 2002 ) ] .
Mitochronrial Permaeability
Transition Port ( MPTP )
Mitochondria play a key role in apoptosis ( " cell suicide " ) .
Release of cytochrome−c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm is the event which initiates apoptotic cell destruction by caspase enzymes .
Release of cytochrome−c into the cytoplasm can occur either by a Ca2 + − dependent mechanism or a Ca2+ −independent mechanism .
In the Ca2 + −dependent case Ca2 + overload in the mitochondrion triggers opening of the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore ( MPTP ) , which penetrates both the outer and inner membranes making a channel between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol outside the mitochondrion .
The MPTP is a complex consisting of three proteins , VDAC ( porin ) of the outer membrane , ANT ( Adenine Nucleotide Translocator ) of the inner membrane and cyclophilin−D.
Cyclophilin−D protein binds to ANT to promote MPTP formation [ BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL ; Li , Y ; 383( Pt 1):101-109 ( 2004 ) ] , possibly by increasing the sensitivity of the MPTP components to the effects of Ca2 + [ CIRCULATION RESEARCH ;
Weiss , JN ; 93(4):292-301 ( 2003 ) ] .
The entry of large solutes and accompanying water into the matrix causes the mitochondrion to swell and burst , releasing cytochrome−c into the cytoplasm .
The Ca2 + −independent case requires two separate events for cytochrome−c release : ( 1 ) formation of large pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane by Bax / Bak proteins and ( 2 ) release of cytochrome−c from the inner mitochondrial membrane [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Ott , M ; 99(3):1259-1263 ( 2002 ) ] .
The Ca2 + −independent case can lead to apoptosis , whereas the Ca2 + −dependent case is invariably associated with necrosis .
In apoptosis the MPTP opens only briefly ( if it opens at all ) , whereas in necrosis the MPTP remains open .
Apoptosis requires ATP energy , but ATP energy is depleted if the MPTP remains open [ NATURE ; Halestrap , A ; 434:578-579 ( 2005 ) ] .
The threshold amount of Ca2 + which causes MPTP opening in lymphocytes , brain and liver of old mice is significantly lower than that of young mice [ BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS ; Mather , M ; 273(2):603-608 ( 2000 ) ] .
CoEnzyme Q 10 has been shown to reduce apoptosis by direct inhibition of the MPTP [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Papucci , L ; 278(30):28220-28228 ( 2003 ) ] .
Cardiolipin
Cytochrome−c is normally held to the inner mitochondrial membrane by the lipid cardiolipin ( diphosphatidylglycerol ) .
Cardiolipin composes 10 % of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is present at lower concentrations in the outer mitochondrial membrane ( especially near contact sites between the two membranes ) .
This distinctive lipid is found only in mitochondrial membranes .
Mitochondrial membrane cardiolipin content declines with age , resulting in a decline in cytochrome−c activity .
40 % lower cardiolipin content and 35 % lower cytochrome−c activity has been demonstrated in old rats compared to young rats .
Restoration of membrane cardiolipin content restored cytochrome−c activity [ FEBS LETTERS ; Paradies , G ; 406(1-2):136-138 ( 1997 ) ] .
Oxidation of cardiolipin releases cytochrome−c from the inner mitochondrial membrane , but cytochrome−c will not be released into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis without the formation of large pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane by Bax / Bak protein .
Bax / Bak membrane permeabilization occurs preferentially at cardiolipin - rich contact sites between the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane [ BMC CELL BIOLOGY ; Lutter , M ; 2:22-30 ( 2001 ) ] .
But Bax / Bak permeabilization of the outer membrane alone may be sufficient to induce apoptosis .
If only one or a few mitochondria release cytochrome−c apoptosis may not occur , but the damaged mitochondria would themselves be degraded .
By this means a few aberrant mitochondria which are producing excessive free radicals can be eliminated .
( For more about mechanisms of apoptosis see Cellular Senescence and Apoptosis in Aging )

Proteins are long chains of amino acids ( amino acid polymers , or polypeptides ) .
20 different amino acids occur in animal proteins .
Amino acids are all organic compounds with a protonated amino group [ −NH 3 +] and an ionized carboxyl group [ −COO− ] attached to the same ( alpha - position ) carbon atom .
Proteins can be damaged both by free - radicals and by glycation .
Glycation ( also called the Maillard reaction , or non-enzymatic glycosylation ) is a reaction by which reducing sugars become attached to proteins without the assistance of an enzyme .
( For details on the properties of reducing sugars , see cryopreservation with sugars . )
This attachment occurs at the free amine group of lysine or arginine , which is not involved in the peptide bond .
The reaction between glucose and a lysine amino acid in a protein molecule can be represented as follows :
In the diagram , glycation is the formation of a double - bond between the glucose aldehyde - group and the lysine amino group with the elimination of a water molecule .
The double - bond between the glucose carbon and the lysine nitrogen is an imine ( also known as a Schiff base ) .
The imine can quickly re-arrange atoms such that the 2 - carbon ( 2nd carbon ) of the glucose loses its two hydrogens — resulting in a carbonyl group ( > C=O ) and in hydrogen - saturation of the carbon & nitrogen which formerly constituted the imine .
This re-arrangement structure is called an Amadori product ( a ketoamine ) .
Both glycation and Amadori product formation are completely reversible reactions .
But the formation of Advanced Glycation End-products ( AGEs ) by oxidation of Amadori products is irreversible .
AGEs in tissues increase the rate of free radical production to 50 - times the rate of free - radical production by unglycated proteins .
Histochemical analysis of the hippocampus of human cadavers shows that chronological age can be estimated by hippocampal AGE levels [ HISTOPATHOLOGY ; Sato , Y ; 38(3):217-220 ( 2001 ) ] .
AGEs attached to LDL - cholesterol accelerates oxidation and subsequent atherosclerosis .
The irreversible cross-linked proteins of AGEs in vessel collagen also contributes to atherosclerosis , as well as to kidney failure — conditions worsened in diabetes [ DIABETES 46 ( Suppl 2 ) : S19 - S25 ( 1997 ) ] .
Cataracts are composed of urea - insoluble proteins in the lens of the eye .
AGEs aggravate protein cross-linking in the plaques & tangles of Alzheimer 's Disease , thereby accelerating neuron death [ BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEW 23:134-143 ( 1997 ) ] .
AGEs can be formed in the body from glycation & oxidation or can be ingested directly from browned foods ( such as fried poultry skin ) or tobacco smoke .
Approximately one third of absorbed dietary AGEs are excreted in urine and rest is presumably incorporated into body tissues [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Koschinsky , T ; 94(12):6474-6479 ( 1997 ) ] .
( For more on the effect of ingested AGEs , see INGESTION OF ADVANCED GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS ( AGES ) . )
The higher glycation rate in diabetics is undoubtedly related to the fact that diabetes greatly resembles accelerated aging .
Hemoglobin glycation is often used as a time - integrated ( as opposed to instantaneous ) measure of blood glucose levels in diabetics .
AGEs are universal symptoms of aging — adversely affecting skin , lungs , muscles , blood vessels and organ - function in general .
Increased insulin resistance and other symptoms of diabetes are commonly seen features of aging .
Diabetes - like atherosclerosis and the resultant generalized reduction in blood flow has an adverse effect on most organ systems .
Although most proteins are short - lived ( mouse liver proteins have a half - life of 3 days ) some proteins , such as crystallins in the eye lens of mammals , can last a lifetime .
Lens crystallines , collagen and basement membrane are the proteins most vulnerable to cross-linking and AGE formation because they are the most long - lived proteins , with a slow rate of turnover .
AGE cross-links can be broken by N−PhenacylThiazolium Bromide ( PTB ) , but 3 − phenacyl - 4,5 - dimethylthiazolum chloride ( ALT −711 , alagebrium ) has proven to be even more effective than PTB in breaking cross-links [ CIRCULATION RESEARCH ; Candido , R ; 92(7):785-792 ( 2003 ) ] .
Alagebrium has proven effective in reducing systolic blood pressure [ AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION ; Bakris , GL ; 17( 12 Pt 2):23S-30S ( 2004 ) ] and providing therapeutic benefit for patients with diastolic heart failure [ JOURNAL OF CARDIAC FAILURE ; Little , WC ; 11(3):191-195 ( 2005 ) ] .
Carnosine also has anti-glycating effects [ CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY ; Guiotto , A ; 12(20):2293-2315 ( 2005 ) ] .
In the extracellular matrix of senescent skin , the major protein cross- link is the arginine - lysine glucose product glucosepane [ REJUVENATION RESEARCH ; Svantesson , J ; 12(3):137-148 ( 2009 ) ] .
In non-diabetic 90 - year - olds glucosepane accounts for about 50 times the cross-linking as all other forms of cross-linking , and is more than twice as prevalent in diabetics as in non-diabetics [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; Sell , DR ; 280( 13):12310-12315 ( 2005 ) ] .
In diabetics , prosclerotic growth factors like TGF−ß ( Transforming Growth Factor beta ) promote extracellular matrix synthesis .
Collagen accounts for about a third of total body protein in mammals .
Collagen cross-linking in skin , muscle and organs throughout the body leads to the sinewy , inelastic tissue characteristic of aging .
Cross - linking of proteins makes connective tissue lose elasticity , increases arteriosclerosis , reduces kidney function , slows wound healing , reduces the vital capacity of the lung and contributes to cataracts .
Cross -linking also contributes to arteriosclerosis by making LDL - cholesterol unrecognizable to LDL - receptors , thereby increasing LDL in the blood .
Birds have blood glucose levels that are 2−10 times higher , metabolic rates that are more than double and body temperatures 2 º C − 4 ºC higher — than similarly - sized mammals .
Higher temperatures & higher blood glucose would be expected to accelerate glycation & AGE formation in birds — yet their lifespans are considerably longer than those of comparably - sized mammals .
Hummingbirds have the highest levels of glycated hemoglobin of any bird , but these levels are lower than those seen in non-diabetic humans , partially because of higher red blood cell turnover and partially because of better membrane control of glucose transport [ COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY ; Beuchat , CA ; 120 ( Part A ) : 409-416 ( 1998 ) ] .
Muscle carnosine correlates with mammalian lifespan
Birds have twice the blood concentration of antioxidant uric acid as humans and a much lower rate of free radical production .
A study of hens showed less than one hundredth the quantity of Advanced Glycation End-products ( AGES ) as would be found in humans [ JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY ; Iqbal , M ; 54A ( 4 ) : B171-B176 ( 1999 ) ] .
The dipeptide carnosine ( ß−alanyl - L- histidine ) both inhibits glycation and has antioxidant metal chelating activity .
Skeletal muscle concentrations of carnosine correlate with lifespan in mammals [ BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS 23:134-143 ( 1997 ) ] .
Vitamin C also has anti-glycation properties as well as antioxidant action [ DIABETES ; Davie , SJ ; 41(2):167-173 ( 1992 ) ] .
Glucose is not the most active sugar for glycation .
Galactose is 5 times more reactive than glucose , fructose is 8 times more reactive , deoxyglucose is 25 times more reactive , ribose is 100 times more reactive and deoxyribose is 200 times more reactive .
[ Sucrose is composed of the two monosaccharides glucose & fructose , whereas lactose ( milk - sugar ) is composed of the two monosaccharides glucose & galactose . ]
Mice injected with galactose are models of accelerated aging [ MECHANISMS OF AGING AND DEVELOPMENT ; Song , X ; 108(3):239-251 ( 1999 ) ] .
Some aldehydes produced by lipid peroxidation are more reactive than any of the sugars .
Glucose assumes the cyclic conformation more readily than any other monosaccharide , making it the most resistant to both glycation and oxidation of any sugar .
It is no evolutionary accident that the least reactive of sugars is the sugar organisms most use for energy .
Lipids as well as proteins are subject to glycation .
Lipid glycation of LDL cholesterol increases the LDL oxidation associated with atherosclerosis [ ATHEROSCLEROSIS , THROMBOSIS , AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY ; Ravandi, A ; 20(2):467-477 ( 2007 ) ] .
Vitamin B 6 prevents lipid glycation more effectively than other common anti-glycation agents [ JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH ; Higuchi , O ; 47(5):964-974 ( 2006 ) ] .
( For more information on glycation , see the International Maillard Reaction Society . )
( return to contents )
Not all of the damaging effects of sugar are due to glycation .
Glucose & fructose are reduced to sorbitol by the enzyme aldol reductase .
Sorbitol is a tissue toxin , contributing to retinopathy , neuropathy , cataracts and kidney disease in diabetes .
And not all protein cross-linking is due to glycation .
Aldehydes produced by lipid peroxidation , such as MalonDiAldehyde ( MDA , propanedial ) , can cross - link proteins by forming covalent bonds with lysine amino acids .
Cross-linking of protein with lipid peroxidation product MDA
Mitochondria produce nitric acid at a rate comparable to the rate of superoxide production [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; 273(18 ) :11038-11043 ( 1998 ) ] .
Peroxynitrite formed by reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide can irreversibly form covalent bonds with tyrosine amino acids in proteins , thereby blocking phosphorylation .
Phosphorylation & dephosphorylation of enzymes by kinases & phosphatases at tyrosine , serine & threonine protein residues play a central role in enzyme activation / deactivation & cell signalling — both of which would be disrupted by nitrotyrosine formation .
Another form of protein damage is racemization , although this kind of protein damage is less serious than glycation .
Cells can only make proteins from L−isomer ( " left - handed " ) amino acids .
Only L−isomer proteins are functional .
Some D−isomer ( " right - handed " ) proteins are not only non-functional , but harmful .
Thermal energy causes a small percentage of proteins to spontaneously change from the L−form to the D−form — and this form of molecular deterioration is known as racemization .
( Racemization allows for determination of an animal 's age from the ratio of D−form to L−form in the dentine of a tooth ) .
Asparagine and glutamine amino acids on proteins spontaneously deaminate , especially when a glycine is in the adjacent carboxyl position .
The rate of deamination of asparagine is 400 times greater than for glutamine .
When the enzyme which can repair this protein damage is missing from experimental ( knockout ) mice , the mice suffer brain damage and die young [ JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY ; 276(23):20695-20702 ( 2001 ) ] .
Carbonyl ( > C=O , ie , aldehyde or ketone ) content of protein is used as a rough measure of protein oxidation .
Carbonyl formation is irreversible , so oxidized proteins must be removed by degradation .
Carbonyl content of protein in an animal cell increases exponentially with age .
At least 30 −50 % of protein is oxidized in old animals , which correlates well with an estimated 30−50 % decrease in enzyme activity in old animals .
A study on houseflies showed an association between protein carbonyls and life expectancy , possibly indicative of an effect on rate of aging [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Sohal , RS ; 90(15):7255-7259 ( 1993 ) ] .
A study of several species of mammals & a bird ( pigeon ) indicated a linear relationship between oxidative damage to protein and maximum life span [ EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY 31(3):365-372 ( 1996 ) ] .
Cysteine & methionine are by far more vulnerable to oxidation by reactive oxygen species than any other protein amino acids because of their sulfhydryl groups .
Oxidation of cysteine sulfhydryls can result in disulfides that cause protein aggregation and lipofuscin .
Naked mole rats ( which live at least 9 times longer than mice ) have much more oxidative damage to proteins than mice , but maintain that level of damage unchanged for two decades .
Although mice have a 12 % oxidative decline in cysteine with age , naked mole rats show no age - related change in cysteine for two decades [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; Perez , VI ; 106(9):3059-3064 ( 2009 ) ] .
Methionine is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide , but methionine sulfoxide reductases enzymatically regenerate methionine [ BIOPHYSICA ET BIOCHEMICA ACTA ; Lee , BC ; 1790 ( 11 ) : 1471-1477 ( 2009 ) ] .
Additionally , isomerases can reverse the aberrant disulfide bridges — the only known enzymatic repairs of protein oxidation [ FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY & MEDICINE ; Shringarpure , R ; 32(11):1084-1089 ( 2002 ) ] .
Transgenic fruit flies that overexpress methionine sulfide reductase primarily in the nervous system have shown a median lifespan extension of about 70 % [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; 99 ( 5 ) : 2748-2753 ( 2002 ) ] .
In one study , methionine sulfoxide reductase knockout - mice showed reduced lifespan and increased carbonyl content on protein [ PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ( USA ) ; 98( 23 ) : 12920-12925 ( 2001 ) ] , but another study showed no reduction in lifespan [ THE FASEB JOURNAL ; Salmon , AB ; 23(20):4601-3608 ( 2009 ) ] .
Reducing dietary methionine to a fifth the normal intake has increased the lifespan of rats by 30 % [ JOURNAL OF NUTRITION ; Orentreich , N ; 123(2):269-274 ( 1993 ) ] .
Body weight is just over half normal for the rats and there are increased blood as well as decreased tissue levels of glutathione [ THE FASEB JOURNAL ; Richie , JP ; 8( 15):1302-1307 ( 1994 ) ] .
Oxidized protein is more vulnerable to cross-linking by lipid peroxidation aldehydes such as MDA & 4−HNE [ FEBS LETTERS 405:21 -25 ( 1997 ) ] .
Hydroxyl radicals cause protein crosslinking by the formation of dityrosine bridges .
Oxidized & cross - linked proteins are resistant to degradation and therefore contribute to the accumulation of damaged proteins in many degenerative diseases .
Cellular proteins are continually being degraded ( hydrolyzed ) within cells by proteolytic enzymes , both for regulation of cellular processes and for " quality control " of proteins ( eliminating malformed or malfunctional ones ) .
Transcription factors and cell - cycle proteins must be quickly eliminated after having served their purpose .
The four major classes of cellular proteolytic enzymes are ( 1 ) caspases ( 2 ) calpains ( 3 ) cathepsins and ( 4 ) proteasomes .
Caspases are mainly active in apoptosis and are therefore in the category of regulatory proteases .
Calpains are Ca2 + −dependent , ATP - independent proteases that mainly degrade membrane & cytoskeletal proteins ( as well as certain transcription factors ) .
Cathepsins are the major class of proteolytic enzymes found in lysosomes , although there are others .
( As well , lysosomes contain enzymes for degrading lipids , carbohydrates and nucleic acids . )
Proteasomes are enzymatic , prote

Effect on Further Disposition of Copy or Phonorecord .
Section 109 ( a ) restates and confirms the principle that , where the copyright owner has transferred ownership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work , the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale , rental , or any other means .
Under this principle , which has been established by the court decisions and section 27 of the present law [ section 27 of former title 17 ] , the copyright owner ’s exclusive right of public distribution would have no effect upon anyone who owns “ a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title ” and who wishes to transfer it to someone else or to destroy it .
Thus , for example , the outright sale of an authorized copy of a book frees it from any copyright control over its resale price or other conditions of its future disposition .
A library that has acquired ownership of a copy is entitled to lend it under any conditions it chooses to impose .
This does not mean that conditions on future disposition of copies or phonorecords , imposed by a contract between their buyer and seller , would be unenforceable between the parties as a breach of contract , but it does mean that they could not be enforced by an action for infringement of copyright .
Under section 202 however , the owner of the physical copy or phonorecord cannot reproduce or perform the copyrighted work publicly without the copyright owner ’s consent .
To come within the scope of section 109 ( a ) , a copy or phonorecord must have been “ lawfully made under this title , ” though not necessarily with the copyright owner ’s authorization .
For example , any resale of an illegally “ pirated ” phonorecord would be an infringement , but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115 would not .
Effect on Display of Copy .
Subsection ( b ) of section 109 deals with the scope of the copyright owner ’s exclusive right to control the public display of a particular “ copy ” of a work ( including the original or prototype copy in which the work was first fixed ) .
Assuming , for example , that a painter has sold the only copy of an original work of art without restrictions , would it be possible for him to restrain the new owner from displaying it publicly in galleries , shop windows , on a projector , or on television ?
Section 109 ( b ) adopts the general principle that the lawful owner of a copy of a work should be able to put his copy on public display without the consent of the copyright owner .
As in cases arising under section 109 ( a ) , this does not mean that contractual restrictions on display between a buyer and seller would be unenforceable as a matter of contract law .
The exclusive right of public display granted by section 106 ( 5 ) would not apply where the owner of a copy wishes to show it directly to the public , as in a gallery or display case , or indirectly , as through an opaque projector .
Where the copy itself is intended for projection , as in the case of a photographic slide , negative , or transparency , the public projection of a single image would be permitted as long as the viewers are “ present at the place where the copy is located . ”
On the other hand , section 109 ( b ) takes account of the potentialities of the new communications media , notably television , cable and optical transmission devices , and information storage and retrieval devices , for replacing printed copies with visual images .
First of all , the public display of an image of a copyrighted work would not be exempted from copyright control if the copy from which the image was derived were outside the presence of the viewers .
In other words , the display of a visual image of a copyrighted work would be an infringement if the image were transmitted by any method ( by closed or open circuit television , for example , or by a computer system ) from one place to members of the public located elsewhere .
Moreover , the exemption would extend only to public displays that are made “ either directly or by the projection of no more than one image at a time . ”
Thus , even where the copy and the viewers are located at the same place , the simultaneous projection of multiple images of the work would not be exempted .
For example , where each person in a lecture hall is supplied with a separate viewing apparatus , the copyright owner ’s permission would generally be required in order to project an image of a work on each individual screen at the same time .
The committee ’s intention is to preserve the traditional privilege of the owner of a copy to display it directly , but to place reasonable restrictions on the ability to display it indirectly in such a way that the copyright owner ’s market for reproduction and distribution of copies would be affected .
Unless it constitutes a fair use under section 107 , or unless one of the special provisions of section 110 or 111 is applicable , projection of more than one image at a time , or transmission of an image to the public over television or other communication channels , would be an infringement for the same reasons that reproduction in copies would be .
The concept of “ the place where the copy is located ” is generally intended to refer to a situation in which the viewers are present in the same physical surroundings as the copy , even though they can not see the copy directly .
Effect of Mere Possession of Copy or Phonorecord .
Subsection ( c ) of section 109 qualifies the privileges specified in subsections ( a ) and ( b ) by making clear that they do not apply to someone who merely possesses a copy or phonorecord without having acquired ownership of it .
Acquisition of an object embodying a copyrighted work by rental , lease , loan , or bailment carries with it no privilege to dispose of the copy under section 109 ( a ) or to display it publicly under section 109 ( b ) .
To cite a familiar example , a person who has rented a print of a motion picture from the copyright owner would have no right to rent it to someone else without the owner ’s permission .
Burden of Proof in Infringement Actions .
During the course of its deliberations on this section , the Committee ’s attention was directed to a recent court decision holding that the plaintiff in an infringement action had the burden of establishing that the allegedly infringing copies in the defendant ’s possession were not lawfully made or acquired under section 27 of the present law [ section 27 of former title 17 ] .
American International Pictures , Inc. v. Foreman , 400 F.Supp. 928 ( S.D.Alabama 1975 ) .
The Committee believes that the court ’s decision , if followed , would place a virtually impossible burden on copyright owners .
The decision is also inconsistent with the established legal principle that the burden of proof should not be placed upon a litigant to establish facts particularly within the knowledge of his adversary .
The defendant in such actions clearly has the particular knowledge of how possession of the particular copy was acquired , and should have the burden of providing this evidence to the court .
It is the intent of the Committee , therefore , that in an action to determine whether a defendant is entitled to the privilege established by section 109 ( a ) and ( b ) , the burden of proving whether a particular copy was lawfully made or acquired should rest on the defendant .
This iguana , and the other three found , will now be re-housed
Prosecutors say Jereme James stole the banded iguanas while on a visit to the South Pacific island in 2002 .
He is alleged to have constructed a special compartment inside his prosthetic limb to move the reptiles .
Officials began investigating Mr James after receiving a tip off that he was in possession of several of the beasts .
The Fiji Island Banded Iguana ( Brachylophus fasciatus ) , noted for its bright green skin , is threatened with extinction and protected under an international treaty regulating trade in endangered species .
Mr James could face up to five years in prison if convicted .
' Admission '
Having been informed that Mr James had several specimens at his home , the United States Fish & Wildlife Service launched an undercover investigation into his activities .
On one occasion , Mr James reportedly told an undercover agent that he sold three banded iguanas for the sum of $ 32,000 ( £ 16,000 ) four years ago .
When Mr James 's house was searched in July agents are said to have found a further four banded iguanas .
Officials say they think Mr James was breeding the animals for sale .
" That 's what we believe has been going on , " Assistant US Attorney Joseph O Johns told the Associated Press news agency .
" Mother Nature has taken her course . "
The iguanas would now be placed in a breeding programme in the US , Mr Johns added .
Senator McCain has mounted a high horse over eminent domain , we see from the text of a speech prepared for delivery yesterday in Cedar Rapids and sent out by his press office .
He starts off with stirring words about the war against Islamist terror , which he calls " a profound and hugely consequential clash of ideals a fight between right and wrong , in which relativism should have no place . "
He quickly goes on to say that " central to our ideals is the sanctity of property rights .
Without private property there can be no freedom , and without freedom there can be no America . "
He quotes John Adams as saying , " Property is surely a right of mankind as real as liberty . "
And in respect of the decision of the Supreme Court against Susette Kelo , the homeowner in Connecticut whose property the court allowed to be seized for use by a private developer , Mr. McCain says : " Mr. Adams would be shocked to learn what both the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Connecticut did to Susette Kelo . "
Well , he'd also be shocked at what the Supreme Court of the United States did to Senator McConnell , when the sage of Kentucky sued over the abridgement of the First Amendment that the Congress put through with the McCain - Feingold speech regulation act in respect of campaign finances .
We 're all for restricting eminent domain to the plain language meaning of the Constitution , which says " nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation . "
But this is the tragedy of the superannuated senator from Arizona .
He is learning the hard way that if one wants to stand on the Bill of Rights , one has got to do it all the way through .
One can't traduce the First Amendment one season and then come rushing in brandishing the Fifth Amendment , even if one is a senator .
Else wise one just starts to look hollow and foolish .
Senator McCain pledged , in his remarks prepared for delivery in Iowa , that he would " appoint strict constructionist judges who respect the Constitution and understand the security of private property it provides . "
Quoth he : " If need be , I would seek to amend the Constitution to protect private property rights in America . "
We wish him luck .
Maybe he can amend the Constitution to shore up the First Amendment he left shredded by his campaign finance reforms .
His amendment on eminent domain will stand until some McCain - like figure , currying favor with the glitterati , decides to legislate a way around it the way he and Senator Feingold did on the First Amendment .
This is McCain 's story .
He has lived a heroic life , but at key points he has shown a certain kind of weakness .
And as a defender of Constitutional rights , he just lacks credibility .
Time for the inaugural Point / Counterpoint .
The topic will be a debate between the philosophy of a non-interventionist foreign policy versus the policy of fighting the war on terror through an offensive military war to expand freedom in the Middle East .
It ’s been suggested that the case for non-interventionism should be the opening case , which I disagree with ( I think non-interventionism is the more doctrinaire Libertarian position ) , but I ’ll be arguing the point .
I would immediately point out , though , that I am not arguing isolationism or pacifism .
There are times in life , whether on a personal or national level , where force is justified .
My argument is against the attempt to stick our nose into the internal business of other nations through military means or threats .
Stephen Littau ’s response is here .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
My journey towards libertarianism , like many others , came from a pro-defense Republican standpoint .
Thus , the idea that I ’ve taken the charge to cover the non-interventionist point was almost a surprise to me .
But for the life of me , it seems that the pro-interventionist Libertarians are falling victim to a fatal conceit : that man can shape the world around him according to his wishes .
Now , it all sounds wonderful .
I ’d like to believe that our government is capable of utilizing force in a fair and just manner to drain the swamps in Middle Eastern countries , put those countries on a path to democracy , and eventually transform our world into a much more peaceful place .
Unfortunately , we ’re talking about government , and I ca n’t say their track record of meeting their goals is quite exemplary .
The governance of most of the Middle East and Arab - Islamic world is desperately in need of a Reformation .
It is a land dominated by secular and religious dictatorships , Sharia law , and all sorts of monstrosities unimaginable to those of us in the west .
I used the term “ swamp ” earlier with a purpose .
Nobody wants to live in a swamp .
It ’s miserable , and the people in that swamp might be a little upset about living in a swamp simply seeing people in the West basking in opulence that they cannot attain in a world without solid capitalism or private property rights .
But American foreign policy is not about trying to trade with the people of that swamp and raise their standard of living .
It ’s not about trying to create a rising tide to lift boats that even their own dictators are trying to sink .
America ’s foreign policy , at least over the last 60 years , has been a combination of propping up those dictators and dropping bombs on the swamp .
For 60 years , we have been pursuing an interventionist foreign policy , and for 60 years we ’ve watched as we have n’t seen any positive results in that part of the world .
In fact , I think it ’s clear that our interventionism has painted a big target on our backs , and yet has n’t come close to improving our security among the nations of that part of the world .
Now , we ’re being told that our way out of the mess we ’ve gotten ourselves into is to throw more interventionism after failed interventionism .
It ’s couched in terms such as “ spreading democracy ” , by a President who does n’t understand that allowing people who we ’ve trained to hate us to vote will result in them voting for leaders who hate us .
It involves putting our own citizens in the armed forces in harms way , trying to mediate an internal power struggle , smoldering and waiting to blaze into a true civil war .
All through this , our leaders are telling us that we need to give up our liberties to remain safe from terrorism , when the best rationale that they can offer for this war in Iraq is that it will attract all the terrorists to Iraq to fight us “ over there ” instead of on our own shores .
Yet at the same time they crow about all the terror plots they ’ve foiled at home , suggesting the terrorists ’ actions are n’t limited to “ over there ” .
My criticism of foreign interventionism is simple .
Interventionism , when pursued by the government , is like any other government program : it ’s going to cost more than advertised , it ’s not going to achieve the stated objectives , and it ’s going to be filled with mountainous unintended consequences that will make the original problem look like an anthill .
And like any other government program , when it fails our politicians will tell us the only solution is more government .
I ’m not arguing against the goals of interventionism , because I see that the people in the swamp need help to drain the swamp .
I just do n’t see any reason to believe that government and military are capable of the task .
I say it ’s time to stop .
Extricating ourself from the situation we ’ve created abroad is not going to be easy , but I believe we need to be looking for solutions which decrease our interventionism abroad , not increase it .
There are problems all over the world , but when the US government can’t solve a single problem it tries to solve at home , why would we believe that we can solve the problems of other cultures , on the other side of the world , by sending men with guns ?
Hayek used the term “ fatal conceit ” to describe socialists who believed they could remake society in order to how they believed it “ should ” operate .
I fear that pro-interventionist libertarians have the same fatal conceit .
Despite all evidence to the contrary on a wide host of issues , they believe that government will do what it promises when it comes to foreign interventionism .
Government , though , is the reverse of King Midas : everything the government touches turns to shit .
I think the burden of proof is on the pro-interventionists to explain why it will be different this time .
House decides against tougher fuel economy But Democrat says issue is n't dead despite plan to withdraw amendment raising mileage standards for vehicles
WASHINGTON — House Democrats decided today not to try to raise fuel mileage standards for cars and trucks as part of the energy package lawmakers will vote on this week .
As Democrats put the finishing touches on a pair of bills they hope to pass out of the House on Friday , Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass . — after consulting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . — announced he would withdraw an amendment designed to raise fuel mileage requirements to 35 miles per gallon by 2019 .
Raising fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks was the centerpiece of an energy bill the Senate approved in June .
It would require automakers to achieve average 35 miles per gallon for cars , pickup trucks , sport utility vehicles and minivans by 2020 .
But House Democrats have been at war with themselves over fuel economy standards .
The nation 's automakers and their allies on Capitol Hill — including House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell , D - Mich . — had thrown their support behind a more modest fuel efficiency increase proposed by Rep. Baron Hill , D - Ind .
He has withdrawn the proposal .
Markey said he is confident the fuel efficiency issue can be addressed when House and Senate negotiators meet in a conference committee to hash out differences between their proposals .
That probably will be in September if the House passes its bill before the August recess .
" The country cannot afford to accept less than a 35 mile - per - gallon standard if we are to wean ourselves off of our addiction to imported oil , " he said .
Pelosi said she supports the fuel mileage language in the Senate bill , but did n't want to cause problems within her own ranks .
" My long - stated goal has been to bring to the floor a strong energy bill that builds on the unity we have within the Democratic caucus , " Pelosi said in a statement .
Legislation targeting utilities raises concerns
Rep. Tom Udall , D - N.M. , will offer an amendment that would require utility companies to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power by 2020 .
But Rep. Gene Green , of Houston , a leader of a group of about two dozen Democrats from energy states , worries whether utilities will be able to meet that kind of standard without raising utility bills .
" I do n't know if Texas or other states can get to 15 percent , " Green said .
" It sounds like we 're voting on great messages but not good law . "
The thrust of the House bill is to reduce the nation 's dependence on foreign oil with a host of conservation measures , including new efficiency standards for dishwashers , refrigerators and other appliances ; more energy efficient lighting ; expanded use of ethanol ; and tax incentives for consumers to buy fuel - efficient '' plug - in " hybrid cars featuring batteries that can be recharged when the car is not in use .
The Democrats ' package also includes a tax bill that would slap the oil companies with $ 16 billion in new taxes .
The Senate rejected a similar tax package .
In the House , Green and others who 've become known as " hydrocarbon Democrats " have been scrambling to remove some of the language targeting the industry .
Pelosi agreed last week to drop some provisions aimed at oil and gas royalties , drilling permits and interstate electric power lines .
Green was back at it today , trying to persuade House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , to relent on some of the tax provisions .
Green argues that while the oil and gas industry may be profitable of late , " it 's a very cyclical business . "
Republicans in the House cheered Green 's efforts .
" Bless Gene Green , " said Rep. Joe Barton , of Ennis , the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
" I hope he wins more than he loses . "
Barton and other Republicans argued that the Democrats ' package does nothing to help generate new energy supplies .
Republicans are drafting a proposal that would encourage the development of fuel from coal , push for expanded use of nuclear power and encourage more oil and gas drilling .

New iMacs now have a slimmer design in aluminum casings .
Even with faster chips and glossy screens , they are up to $ 300 cheaper than their predecessors .

Three months after the debut of the most - hyped technology product in history , the jury is in on Apple 's iPhone :
While it's a " beautiful and breakthrough " product , as Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg wrote in his influential review of the touch - screened smart phone , it simply is n't worth its initial $ 599 price tag — a fact that Apple CEO Steve Jobs all but admitted earlier this month .
" This is life in the technology lane , " Jobs said of his decision to slash the iPhone 's price by $ 200 .
You might have thought such capitulation would send shivers down Apple investors ' spines .
Indeed , after it had surged to a record high of $ 146 a share in July , rumors that the iPhone was n't selling like hotcakes sent the stock down by nearly 10 percent after Apple 's price - cut announcement .
( It was off by twice as much during the stock market 's mid-August swoon . )
New outlook for earnings .
Yet for smart investors , it appears the recent sell - offs were , in fact , buying opportunities .
Thanks in part to a raft of analyst upgrades over the past few days , the stock hit a new all - time high of $ 153 on Tuesday as news arrived that the company 's core products — its Macintosh computers — are selling far better than the iPhone .
" Despite an overhyped phone , in our opinion , we believe Apple 's business continues to accelerate and is firing on all cylinders , " W.R. Hambrecht analyst Matthew Kather wrote last week of his decision to up his earnings estimates for the company .
Citing " stronger than expected iMac momentum , " as well as falling costs for the memory chips needed to make them , Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner followed on Monday , not only upping his estimate but also his 12 - month price target for the stock , to $ 180 a share , a 20 percent premium over its current price .
In fact , many believe Apple is finally succeeding at doing what it has long failed at : convincing the bulk of personal computer users to shell out as much as twice the price of a comparable Windows - based machine for the elegant functionality — and the pure " bling " — of owning a Mac.
Indeed , although the Mac has long enjoyed a cult - like following , its overall market share has only recently vaulted toward the double digits , more than tripling the paltry share it had three years ago .
Running Windows on the Mac .
While there 's certainly been a " halo effect " from Apple 's wildly popular iPod and , to a lesser extent , from the iPhone , the growth in Mac sales is thanks mostly to Apple 's decision a few years back to switch to industry - standard Intel microprocessors .
With the help of special software , they allow PC users to run all their software applications on the Mac .
For many converts , it 's been a revelation : no viruses to deal with , no crapware to uninstall ... in fact , some technologists have argued that Windows actually runs better on the Mac — faster and with fewer crashes — than it does on Windows machines .
Despite fears that last fall 's release of Microsoft 's Vista operating system would dampen Mac sales , the unimpressive , memory - hogging Vista has only given longtime PC users more reason to make the switch .
And with Apple 's new " Leopard " operating system due out in October , many believe Mac sales are finally on the verge of the sort of breakthrough that the iPhone promised but has yet to deliver .
Meanwhile , Apple continues to roll out new products , from a touch - screen version of the iPod to a much - rumored sub - laptop - size Mac , which is expected to be released in time for Christmas .
FORT LAUDERDALE , Florida ( CNN ) -- Francisco Rodriguez owes more than $ 10,000 in back child support payments in a paternity case involving a 15 - year - old girl who , according to DNA results and the girl 's mother , is not his daughter .
Francisco Rodriguez is fighting for leniency in his paternity case .
" It 's not right .
I 'm not the father , " he said .
Rodriguez , who is married with two daughters and a son from his wife 's previous marriage , is fighting for leniency .
" It 's not right .
I 'm not the father , " he said at a recent court hearing .
He says he knew nothing about the other girl until paperwork showed up about four years ago saying he was the father .
He now has DNA results that show the 15 - year - old girl was n't fathered by him .
He even has an affidavit from the girl 's mother -- a former girlfriend from 1990 -- saying he 's " not the father " and asking that Rodriguez no longer be required to pay child support .
Yet the state of Florida is continuing to push him to pay $ 305 a month to support the girl , as well as the more than $ 10,000 already owed .
He spent a night in jail because of his delinquent payments .
Why is he in such a bind ?
He missed the deadline to legally contest paternity .
That 's because , he says , the paperwork did n't reach him until after the deadline had passed .
Watch Rodriguez plead in court for a break »
" It 's like you 're drowning every day , " says Rodriguez , a massage therapist .
Rodriguez 's case highlights the legal dilemma states face over how to handle paternity cases .
More than a third of children born in the United States are born to unmarried parents , according to the National Center for Health Statistics .
But paternity laws vary from state to state , according to the Center for Law and Social Policy ( CLASP ) , a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of low - income families .
Supporting a stranger " Paula Zahn Now " examines men paying child support for children that are n't theirs .
Thursday , 8 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Some states have detailed laws to challenge paternity within deadlines , while others offer little guidance .
In most cases , men have 60 days to challenge paternity , according to CLASP .
After that , it can be " challenged only on the basis of fraud , duress or material mistake of fact , " CLASP said last year in an update to a report on paternity law .
" There are no perfect answers , " says Susan Paikin of the Center for Support of Families in Delaware .
" Deadlines are imposed so that when families are broken -- the legal process is handled quickly . "
She says state legislatures and courts struggle with paternity cases , trying to strike the proper balance between children 's rights and adults ' rights , always keeping in mind any potential harm to the child .
" This is a struggle .
It 's not something easy for courts or legislatures , " she says .
Paikin says it 's especially tricky in cases where a father has raised a child thinking it was his , only to learn years later the child had a different father .
" Most men who have a relationship with their child do n't think of their child in terms of DNA , " she said .
" The real issue in most of these cases is anger and money . "
Tampa Police officer Michael Anderson understands that sentiment .
He paid child support for more than 12 years -- a total outlay he says amounted to more than $ 80,000 .
But a DNA test after he and his wife divorced showed the daughter he thought was his was somebody else's .
He then separated himself and his feelings from the child .
" I stopped having a relationship with the girl right from the beginning , when I found out , " he said .
" It was hard , but I had to do it . "
A Tampa court earlier this year disestablished him as father and relieved him of his future child support payments .
But by law , he is unable to get back the $ 80,000 he already paid .
Carnell Smith , who founded a group called U.S. Citizens Against Paternity Fraud , wants mandatory DNA tests when a child is born to avoid legal wrangling and anguish .
" Unfortunately , today it 's not a crime for someone to lie about which man is the father , " Smith said .
" The mother does n't have to return the money and rarely , if ever , is she prosecuted for perjury , for fraud . "
Rodriguez 's odyssey began in 1990 , when he says at age 16 he had a four - to five - month relationship with a woman CNN is not identifying .
He says when the relationship ended , he did not hear from her again until child support papers arrived at his home in 2003 .
" My wife and I both had a confused look , and we 're wondering , ' Where is the DNA test ? ' " he says .
But it was long past Florida 's deadline to contest paternity .
A court had already named him the father three years before when he did not respond to notices to appear , notices he says he never received because he had moved a lot .
He was now on the hook for monthly child support , as well as $ 10,623 in back child support .
He eventually paid for DNA testing .
The test showed he was not the father .
A judge has now ordered a court - sanctioned DNA test for Rodriguez and the 15 - year - old girl .
Rodriguez has taken that test ; the girl and her mother did not show up for their appointment to submit to DNA testing and it's unclear if the girl has complied .
CNN has repeatedly tried to contact the mother , but has been unable to reach her .
Rodriguez and his family continue to wait for answers .
" It 's hard when your daughter needs sneakers and you have to pay $ 305 or your husband goes to jail , " said Rodriguez 's wife , Michele .
" It 's just unfair . " E-mail to a friend
CNN 's Rich Phillips contributed to this report .
All About Child Custody Law • Parenting
How can you intelligently decide what to do with the rest of your life ?
And how can you find an answer that you wo n’t later change on a whim ?
Many of us face this decision for the first time in our late teens and early 20s .
Some never face it at all and shrink from the magnitude of it , allowing chance to decide .
But this is a decision that can be made consciously — you just have to know how to approach it .
If you ’re a typical reader of this site , then you have a number of long - term career possibilities .
You could succeed at many different things if you put your mind to them .
The problem is n’t that you do n’t have a choice — it ’s that you have too many choices .
And because of the overload of choices , it ’s difficult for you to commit to any of them .
Perhaps you ’ve made certain commitments in the past , only to change your mind a short way down the path .
The problem with outside - in
Most likely you were raised to make your career choices in an outside - in manner .
Would you rather be a doctor , a lawyer , or an engineer ?
Do you want to get a job , go into the family business , or become self - employed ?
You scan the available options — even though they seem countless — and do your best to make a reasonable choice .
Many people would consider this an intelligent approach .
The problem with the outside - in approach , however , is that it ’s ultimately circular .
Suppose you want to make the best choice you can regarding what to do with your life .
If you look outside yourself for the answer , you ’ll see an overload of options — way too many for you to consider with any depth .
You ca n’t make the best choice by scanning all the possibilities .
You ’ll die before you get close to finishing , and new career possibilities are being created all the time .
So instead of best , perhaps you ’re willing to settle for a good choice .
In order to know what a good choice is though , you need some kind of evaluation criteria .
How do you define the “ should ” in “ What should you do ? ”
You need a context .
For example , if you ’re playing a game of chess and you want to know what move to make next , you need to know the rules of the game , the current board configuration , and ideally something about your opponent .
If you do n’t even know what game you ’re playing , then you ca n’t intelligently answer the question , “ What should you do ? ”
And that ’s the basic problem — you do n’t really know what game you ’re playing here on earth .
You do n’t know the complete rules of the game .
None of us do .
Science and religion attempt to give us answers , but the most brilliant and respected people on both sides often disagree , and each side still has many unanswered questions .
You can jump to conclusions like many people do , but the wisest approach may be to simply admit , “ There are some things I just do n’t know . ”
You could take this a step further and say that if you do n’t know the rules of the game , then your purpose should be to learn them .
Figure out how the world works , and then your role may become more clear .
This line of questioning leads many people into scientific and religious studies .
And that ’s fine .
Humanity slowly pushes forward in these areas , but you as an individual still need to decide what piece of the puzzle to work on during your lifetime , and you ’re still left swimming in a sea of choices .
But at least this line of thinking gives you a goal — to learn why you exist and what you should do with your existence .
You ’ve come full circle though .
You conclude that what you should do with your life is to figure out what you should do with your life .
Dead end .
You ’re playing a game where you do n’t know all the rules , and the exact purpose of the game is n’t clear .
However , you still have to make a move .
You have no choice in that respect .
Even standing still is a valid move in the game of life .
If you look to the game for answers , the ultimate answer will be that you should make moves that will help you figure out the game .
But since you do n’t know the game well enough , you still do n’t know what move to make right now .
This approach simply is n’t helpful .
It just does n’t create clarity .
It will only leave you more confused .
Of course , you could just start making random moves to learn about life through trial and error .
That ’s a valid short - term approach , but we can do better than that …
The inside - out approach
The inside - out approach means that instead of looking to the game for guidance , look within yourself .
Instead of asking , “ What should I do ? ” or “ What move should I make ? ” or “ What career should I select ? ” just ask yourself , “ What kind of player am I ? ”
Regardless of what game you ’re playing , you bring a unique style to it .
How would you describe that style ?
What is the style in which you would most like to play the game of life ?
Are you aggressive , calculating , spontaneous , generous , compassionate , courageous , cautious , exploratory , etc ?
We ’re not really talking about values here .
Values can shift around a lot .
Sometimes your career may be more important than your social life , and other times your social life may come first .
In this case we ’re talking about deeply imbedded character traits .
What kind of person are you at the core of your being ?
How would you describe the “ I ” that is you ?
What do you love most ?
I love to grow .
It ’s such an imbedded part of my psyche that I ca n’t not grow .
Another attribute of my core self is courage .
I have an almost inborn desire to want to run towards fear instead of away from it .
And a third component is freedom .
I love having tremendous personal freedom , especially when it comes to how I use my time .
The opposites of these attributes repel me .
The opposite of growth would be stagnation or complacency ( not decline because even in a state of decline , you can still learn something from it ) .
The opposite of courage is cowardice .
And the opposite of freedom is confinement .
Someone who is my opposite would thus be drawn to lead a stagnant , cowardly , and confined existence .
Once you develop a sense of what kind of player you are , you can then play the game of life by injecting your own character into it .
Whenever you do n’t comprehend the rules of the game , supplement them with a part of yourself .
So if it is n’t obvious what career you should pursue , look inward instead of outward for the answer .
This will greatly narrow the field of possibilities and allow you to make a fairly intelligent choice .
The better you come to know yourself , the more intelligently you can narrow that field .
As your inward focus improves , your outer world will become more focused as well .
Being vs. doing
Suppose you list your core character attributes .
How do you use those to make a long - term career choice ?
First , let ’s redefine the way you think about career .
Just for a moment , forget about job titles , responsibilities , goals , projects , and tasks .
Consider your career as an expression of who you are : being instead of doing .
If you ’re an artist , your career is to create art .
But what creates a masterpiece ?
Is it the brush strokes or the canvas ?
Is it the education of the artist ?
What creates a masterpiece is the artist .
Really it ’s the artist who ’s the true masterpiece , and the artwork is the physical manifestation of the artist ’s inner self .
The Mona Lisa is Leonardo da Vinci .
Once you come at this problem from the mindset of beingness , instead of doingness , your real career becomes this :
Your career is to express your inner self through the physical universe .
That ’s your job description .
Your true career is the dynamic expression of your inner being .
Instead of thinking of your career in such narrow terms as job titles , think of your career as an outward expression of your inner self .
If I gaze inward and see that I resonate with growth , courage , and freedom , then my career is actually to express these inner qualities out into the world .
My job is essentially just to be myself .
Now as simplistic as this sounds , it ’s actually very practical .
How would you use this mindset to make real - life career decisions ?
You make your choices by asking , “ Which is the best way to express my inner self ? ”
For example , when faced with a career - related choice , I can ask questions like , “ Which choice will yield the most growth , require the most courage , and provide the most freedom ? ”
These parts of my inner being shape my outward doing .
I run a personal development business ( growth ) .
I work hard to increase web traffic ( growth ) .
I like to tackle controversial topics ( courage ) .
I do public speaking ( courage ) .
I work from home and set my own hours ( freedom ) .
I create mostly automated streams of income ( freedom ) .
I love this approach because it creates clarity .
The outside - in approach just does n’t work for me .
Should I be a writer , a speaker , an Internet entrepreneur ?
I ca n’t decide — all of them seem interesting .
But when I turn inward , I see that all of these can be parts of my career because they all harmonize with my inner self .
They ’re all valid .
I do n’t need to choose just one of these narrow bands ; in fact , the type of “ player ” I am dictates that I should include all of these things under the same umbrella .
To thine own self be true
Do you hesitate to make a long - term career commitment because you do n’t want to limit yourself ?
I do n’t want to limit myself either .
By using an inside - out approach to career , you do n’t have to limit yourself .
You can express the whole you to the world , not just a small piece .
Do you find your current career too limiting ?
Do you enjoy your work while also wondering about all the other things you could be doing ?
Why not find a way to do them too ?
Stop thinking in terms of A or B , and think A and B .
What would happen if you redefined your career as the outer expression of your inner being ?
What parts of your inner being are not enjoying enough outward expression ?
Are you incapacitating your intellect ?
Curtailing your creativity ?
Squelching your sense of humor ?
Do n’t turn your career into a prison for your soul .
If your inner self wants to spread out , let it .
To thine own self be true .
Update CSS - SSPP has been retired in favor of the newer , extensible CSS Cacheer .
Last week while digging around an old / tmp / directory I came across an abandoned project from late 2005 .
Inspired by CSS - SSC and pre-processing CSS I had been playing around with the idea of nested selectors .
What do I mean by nested selectors ?
HTML markup consists of nested elements :
< ul > < li>
One </li > < li> Two </ li > < li > Three </ li > </ul >
To apply a style to the nested list - item we write a style definition with flattened selectors :
ul { list - style : none ; } ul li { font - size : 0.9em ; }
What if our CSS more closely matched the structure of our HTML ?
ul { list - style : none ; li { font - size : 0.9em ; } }
The benefits in this simplified example might not be immediately apparent .
Most CMSes use highly modularized markup .
A 1:1 relationship to markup and styles would simplify navigating and sharing the CSS written for those modules ( especially when collaborating in a team environment ) .
Two years later this still seems like a useful idea so on the flight back from An Event Apart Seattle I revisited it and mixed in a few other ideas .
Constants
In addition to nested selectors , server - side constants are back with a slightly different syntax .
Constants can be defined two ways .
Individually :
@server constant constantName : constantValue ;
or en masse :
@server constants { constantName1 : constantValue ; constantName2 : constantValue ; constantName3 : constantValue ; }
Constant values are retrieved the same way regardless of how they are defined .
a { color : constantName ; }
will output :
a { color : constantValue ; }
Individually defined constants will be overridden by constants defined en masse .
Constant names may only contain alpha- numerics ; constant values , anything but a semi-colon .
Variables
Variables work the same way as constants except their values can also be passed in via the query string .
Variable names begin with a dollar sign .
All variables must be pre-defined with a default .
Set individually :
@server variable $ variableName : defaultVariableValue ;
or en masse :
@server variables { $ variableName1 : defaultVariableValue ; $ variableName2 : defaultVariableValue ; $ variableName3 : defaultVariableValue ; }
Variable values are retrieved the same way regardless of how they are defined .
body { background - color : $ variableName ; }
will output :
body { background - color : defaultVariableValue ; }
if the variable does not appear in the query string .
But add the variable name / value pair to the query string ( without the dollar sign ) like so :
sample.css?variableName=variableValue
and the previous example will output :
body { background - color : variableValue ; }
Variable names may only contain alpha-numerics and must start with a dollar sign , variable values anything but a semi-colon .
Do n’t forget to encode values included in the query string ( # should be % 23 in particular ) .
When variables are present in the query string caching is not used .
The cache is deleted and recreated on every request .
I may revisit the caching mechanism in the future to address this inefficiency .
Import
Additional stylesheets can be imported using :
@server import url( stylesheetName.css ) ;
The url value can be un- , single - or double - quoted but cannot contain a closing parenthesis .
Imported styles can include nested selectors , constants , variables and bases .
Bases and Based - on
Similar to constants , bases allow you to define many property / value pairs and include them in any style definition using the based - on property .
Defining a base :
@server base baseName { property : value ; property : value ; property : value ; property : value ; }
Basing another style on a base :
a { based - on : baseName ; }
would result in the following output :
a { property : value ; property : value ; property : value ; property : value ; }
In the current version of the Server - side Pre-processor bases cannot contain nested selectors .
Caching and Compression
A processed copy is cached in the / cache / directory .
Comments and extraneous whitespace are stripped during processing .
All nested selectors are flattened and grouped so that browsers can understand them .
Inline CSS hacks may cease to function .
We ’re all using conditional comments anyways , right ?
Changes to imported CSS files are not detected by the caching mechanism — doing so would require a “ shallow ” reprocessing of the file — but you can force a recache by adding ? recache to the parent CSS file .
Usage
The CSS Server - side Pre-processor requires PHP , Apache and mod_rewrite .
Simply download the sspp -v002.zip archive and unzip .
The archive contains one directory and four files :
. htaccess
cache / .htaccess cacheer.php
cache.php
Add the contents of the archive to your existing style directory .
Change the permissions of the / cache / directory to 777 .
Then have at it .
The CSS Server - side Pre-processor is offered as - is , as always .
I ’ve built in catches to prevent processing non-css files and files above the style directory but the internets is a clever place .
Use at your own risk .
How Nested Selectors Work
Briefly , after importing and applying constants and variables , the nested selectors are transformed into a CSSML that looks something like :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> < css > < rule selector= " ul " > < property name = " list - style " value = " none " /> < property name= " margin " value= " 0 " /> < property name= " padding " value= " 0 " /> < rule selector= " li " > < property name= " margin " value= " 0 " /> < property name= " padding " value= " 0 " /> </rule > < /rule > < rule selector= " a " > < property name= " color " value= " # AB6666 " /> < property name = " text - decoration " value = " none " /> < rule selector= " : hover " > < property name= " color " value= " #710101 " /> </rule > < /rule > </css >
That XML is then parsed into a DOM and transformed into standard CSS .
It is n’t pretty but it gets the job done .
( As you may have noticed in the example above , pseudo - selectors like : hover can be nested inside of the element they refer to .
This only applies to pseudo - selectors , not different classes of the same element . )
Updates
v004 adds support for nested child and adjacent selectors .
The following :
h1 { font - size : 2.0 em ; + p { margin - top : 0 ; } }
generates :
h1 { font - size : 2.0em ; } h1 + p { margin - top : 0 ; }
The current version of CSS Server - side Pre-processor has been downloaded 1804 times .
Architect Of The DMCA Admits It Has n't Worked Out ; Suggests New Approach Needed

Michael Geist notes the surprising news that Bruce Lehman , an original architect of what became the DMCA , is basically admitting that the law has been a failure and has n't worked out at all as planned .
Lehman made his comments at a panel discussion ( from about minute 11 to about minute 31 ) .
He describes the basis for what he , and others , were trying to do with the DMCA .
That is , he earnestly believed that such a law was needed to create the framework for economic benefit from an information economy -- and like plenty of others , he felt that the need to do so was to create artificial scarcity to create the right incentives .
However , it 's turned out that he was n't just wrong -- but disastrously so .
Of course , he does n't blame himself for being wrong .
He blames the recording industry execs ( who certainly do seem to deserve some of the blame ) .
He notes that they never understood the digital world , and had no idea about new distribution technologies .
He believes that if they had embraced going digital much earlier , then the DMCA would n't be such a disaster .
However , as some folks have pointed out , it should be no surprise that the record labels did n't innovate .
After all , the DMCA gave them the extra protections they needed to prop up their business model for a few extra years , rather than innovating .
As economist David Levine notes , " You give the big guys more monopoly power and they innovate less .
Who'd have thunk it ?
" Lehman also does n't bother to acknowledge that there were plenty of people who told him very early on that his proposal for the DMCA was incredibly dangerous -- and Lehman 's response to those people was n't exactly gentlemanly .
James
Boyle loudly critiqued Lehman 's plans in 1996 , and Lehman allegedly threatened to have Boyle denied tenure at the university where he was teaching and ( this was the nice one ) saying that he would " rip Boyle 's throat out . "
One would think that , having admitted a decade later that the law has n't worked , Lehman at least owes Boyle an apology .
Lehman goes on to suggest that we 're entering a " post - copyright era , " which many people agree on .
Lehman , however , having lived his entire life focused so much on using copyright law as a lever seems to believe this will mean less music -- but there 's very little to indicate that 's the case .
He recognizes that other business models will have to come into play , and many of them sound like the business models that are already starting to show up .
He points out that plenty of other industries need music , and will pay for its creation -- suggesting , for example , that companies like XM and Sirius might " commission " songs .
He notes that even the record labels are realizing that the money is n't coming from the music directly , but from merchandise and concerts and are negotiating new contracts to make sure they 're included in the profits from those non-music sales .
This is exactly what should happen .
However , where it's likely that Lehman is wrong is in the idea that this somehow marginalizes the value of musicians .
Rather , thanks to new technologies , the musicians have unprecedented ability to have much more power and say in what happens to their careers .
It was the record labels themselves that marginalized the musicians , telling them what they could do and how they can do it .
These days , the musicians themselves can create the music , make better deals for themselves , and figure out how to embrace these new technologies , without ever having to bother working with the traditional record labels who only know how to squeeze them , not help them .
If that 's what the " post - copyright era " is about , it 's going to make for a lot happier musicians , rather than a lot fewer .
Word numbers , Part 1 : Billion approaches
ITA Software recruits computer scientists using puzzles such as the following .
If the integers from 1 to 999,999,999 are written as words , sorted alphabetically , and concatenated , what is the 51 billionth letter ?
In a series of posts , Dylan Thurston and I will solve this problem step by step , introducing concepts such as monoids and differentiation along the way .
We will use the programming language Haskell : every post will be a literate program that you can run as is .
For example , you can download this post as a program .
Our basic strategy is quintessential computer science : first write a program to specify the problem , then interpret the program creatively to find the solution before the the universe ends .
Our first step , then , is to specify how to write integers as words in English .
Such a specification defines a long list of strings
[ " one " , " two " , ... , " onehundred " , ... , " ninehundredninetyninemillionninehundredninetyninethousandninehundredninetynine " ]
of type [ String ] .
There is a lot of repetitive structure within and among these strings .
We need to express this structure concisely so that we can exploit it later to solve the problem efficiently .
The structure we will use is that lists of strings form a seminearring .
To use the nice - looking symbols + and * for operations in a seminearring , we hide the definitions of these operators from the Prelude , but we will keep the same infix precedences .
{-# OPTIONS - W - fglasgow - exts #-} module WordNumbers1 where import Prelude hiding ( (+ ) , ( * ) , sum , product ) import qualified Prelude as P infixl 6 + infixl 7 *
A seminearring is first of all a monoid .
A monoid is a set along with an associative operation + and its identity element zero .
class Monoid a where zero :: a (+ ) :: a -> a -> a
( The Data .
Monoid module already defines a Monoid type class , but our notation fits better with the development below . )
Any list type is a monoid : addition is concatenation , and the identity is the empty list .
instance Monoid [ a ] where zero = [ ] (+ ) = (++)
You can think of + as nondeterministic choice and zero as failure .
A seminearring is a monoid with an additional associative operation * and its identity element one —
class ( Monoid a ) =>
Seminearring a where one :: a (* ) :: a -> a -> a
— satisfying distributivity ( x+y ) * z = x*z + y*z on one side only .
That is , the other distribution law x * ( y+z ) = x*y +
x* z does not necessarily hold ( hence the “ near ” in “ seminearring ” ) .
For example , every list - of - list type ( including [ String ] because String is just [ Char ] ) is a seminearring : to multiply two string lists is to concatenate every string in the first list and every string in the second list ; the identity for this operation is the singleton list containing the empty string .
instance Seminearring [ [ a ] ] where one = [ [ ] ] xss * yss = [ xs ++ ys | xs <- xss , ys <- yss ]
Whereas distributivity holds on one side …
* WordNumbers1 > ( [ " twenty " ] + [ " thirty " ] ) * [ " " , " one " , " two " ] [ " twenty " , " twentyone " , " twentytwo " , " thirty " , " thirtyone " , " thirtytwo " ] * WordNumbers1 > [ " twenty " ] * [ " " , " one " , " two " ] + [ " thirty " ] * [ " " , " one " , " two " ] [ " twenty " , " twentyone " , " twentytwo " , " thirty " , " thirtyone " , " thirtytwo " ]
… it does not hold on the other side .
* WordNumbers1 > [ " twenty " , " thirty " ] * ( [ " " , " one " ] + [ " two " ] ) [ " twenty " , " twentyone " , " twentytwo " , " thirty " , " thirtyone " , " thirtytwo " ] * WordNumbers1 > [ " twenty " , " thirty " ] * [ " " , " one " ] + [ " twenty " , " thirty " ] * [ " two " ] [ " twenty " , " twentyone " , " thirty " , " thirtyone " , " twentytwo " , " thirtytwo " ]
We require distributivity on one side only because a list of choices , unlike a set of choices , is ordered : concatenating a choice of 2 strings and a choice of 3 strings yields a choice of 6 strings , but there are two obvious ways to order the output choices , depending on which input choices are grouped together .
The definition of * in the instance above enforces left - to - right evaluation : the leftmost choice is the outermost loop .
This convention makes sense for English because we pronounce the most significant digit first and we want a list of English strings ordered by their numeric value .
Unfortunately , some mathematicians use the opposite convention .
The seminearring [ String ] is generated by characters : every character maps to an element of this seminearring .
Let us represent this property by a type class .
class Character a where char :: Char -> a instance Character Char where char = id instance ( Character a ) => Character [ a ] where char c = [ char c ]
We can extend this mapping from characters to strings by concatenating ( multiplying ) its output .
product :: ( Seminearring a ) => [ a ] -> a product = foldr ( * ) one string :: ( Seminearring a , Character a ) => String -> a string = product .
map char
We can now express a choice of strings , such as a digit between " one " and " three " , not just as a list of strings but generically as a value of any type that is an instance of Seminearring and Character .
string " one " + string " two " + string " three " :: ( Seminearring a , Character a ) => a
We can specify a choice of words more concisely as a space - delimited string , as in strings " one two three " .
sum :: ( Monoid a ) => [ a ] -> a sum = foldr (+ ) zero strings :: ( Seminearring a , Character a ) => String -> a strings = sum .
map string .
words
We can now concisely define the list of 109−1 strings at the core of the ITA problem , in a way that expresses its repetitive structure .
ten1 , ten2 , ten3 , ten6 , ten9 :: ( Seminearring a , Character a ) => a ten1 = strings " one two three four five six seven eight nine " ten2 = ten1 + strings " ten eleven twelve " + ( strings " thir four " + prefixes ) * string " teen " + ( strings " twen thir for " + prefixes ) * string " ty " * ( one + ten1 ) where prefixes = strings " fif six seven eigh nine " ten3 = ten2 + ten1 * string " hundred " * ( one + ten2 ) ten6 = ten3 + ten3 * string " thousand " * ( one + ten3 ) ten9 = ten6 + ten3 * string " million " * ( one + ten6 )
If you ignore the order of strings in these lists , the code above is just a context - free grammar for numbers in English .
It is a bit strange for one to mean the empty string ( usually notated ε or λ ) , but you get used to it .
And it is super natural for + to mean alternation and * to mean concatenation .
We can check by brute force that ten6 contains 106−1 strings , but the same check on ten9 exhausted my patience .
* WordNumbers1 > length ( ten6 :: [ String ] ) 999999 * WordNumbers1 > length ( ten9 :: [ String ] ) Interrupted .
We can even compute the total length of all words between
* WordNumbers1 > head ( ten6 :: [ String ] ) " one "
and
* WordNumbers1 > last ( ten6 :: [ String ] ) " ninehundredninetyninethousandninehundredninetynine "
by evaluating
* WordNumbers1 > length ( concat ( ten6 :: [ String ] ) ) 44872000
by brute force .
But again , the same computation on ten9 exhausted my patience .
* WordNumbers1 > length ( concat ( ten9 :: [ String ] ) ) Interrupted .

Human Pixels : Group
Art during the days of early photography
Just before the World War
One the country needed patriotic images , aiming to recover national identity with the help of the rising art of photography .
Arthur Mole ( 1889 - 1983 ) together with John Thomas used their 11 x 14 - inch view camera to create the so - called " living photographs " , done on a monumental scale .
By arranging thousands of soldiers ( reservists , or nurses ) in various patriotic symbols and photographing them from above , they were able to use lines of perspective to transform meaningless masses into artistic shapes and even portraits .
( See more images at the Library of Congress gallery , not copyrighted )
" Sincerely yours , Woodrow Wilson , 1918 "
21,000 officers and men , Camp Sherman , Chillicothe , Ohio
" The Human U.S. Shield , 1918 "
30,000 officers and men , Camp Custer , Battle Creek , Michigan
From his 80 - feet viewing tower , Arthur Mole would shout into his megaphone , or even use a long pole with a white flag to position tens of thousands of soldiers on the field and then nail the pattern to the ground with miles of lace borders .
He also had to figure out the exact numbers of troops required and the final perspective at the viewpoint .
The monumentality of each project called for many weeks of meticulous preparation work .
" Living Uncle Sam , 1919 "
" The Human American Eagle , 1918 "
12,500 officers , nurses and men ; Camp Gordon , Atlanta , Ga .
" Living Emblem of the United States Marines , 1919 "
" The Human Liberty Bell , 1918 "
25000 officers and men at Camp Dix , New Jersey
See many other Arthur Mole & John Thomas works ( in higher resolution ) at the Hammer Gallery .
" A Living Flag , 1917 " ( Mayhart Studio , Chicago )
Based in Zion , Illinois , Arthur Mole visited many army , marine and navy camps across the country , carrying out his inspired & monumental work .
He was clearly influenced by the patriotic spirit of his fellow Americans during a " life during wartime " , as well as driven by his personal spiritual convictions .
In the end , Mole and Thomas donated the entire income from their endeavors to the families of the returning soldiers and the government 's efforts to re-build their lives .

Other Connoisseurs of Early Group Photography
One of the most notable photographers of " living people groups " was Eugene Omar Goldbeck .
Along with the large scale work , he also took photographic portraits of important personalities , such as Albert Einstein .
A detail of larger group , made as late as 1947 :
Indoctrination Division , Air Training Command , Lackland
Air Base San Antonio , TX , 1947
Other unknown photographers :
Grenzhausen , Germany
1st Field Artillery Brigade , 1st Division , 1919
209th Engineers , Camp Sheridan , Alabama , 1919
I have mixed feeling about the rise of " large scale mass photography " as an art form .
Many " communal " ideas were taking shape at the start of the century , with majority of artists / sculptors not considering such experimentations as depersonalizing or evil .
But look what the all - too - eager dictators did with " mass performance " art when they came to power in the Thirties .
It became an integral part of the totalitarian art and ideological hysteria .
The spiritual " unification " principle in the early works was perversely transformed into " cult " and even " occult " mass performances of frenzied crowds .
Living Masses of People as Totalitarian Art
You know of course about Nazi Torchlight Parades ( documented during many Nazi Party Rallies in Nuremberg ) :
Some installation could be considered " inspired " , even urban masterpieces , such as " The Light Cathedral " of Albert Speer and Eberhard von der Trappen , designed for the closing ceremonies of the 1936 Berlin Olympics :
( Source article )
But ultimately , we know the purpose behind Nazi party rallies , where de-humanizing mass movements ( containing , some say , even elements of the occult rites ) added to the whole political hysteria action .
Closer to our times : North Korean Parades
Totalitarian Esthetics at their " worst " ...
Their own version of torchlight parades :
( image credit : Potatohai )
( image credit : Rodrigo Bravo )
Children are made to participate in such " cultural events " from a very young age " .
Watch the giant human mosaic in the background , composed of 15,000 or more individuals each holding a colored placard .
The mosaic changes with the music .
Children 's Parade at Arirang / Mass Games in 2005 :
" 20,000 North Korean middle school students form an image of North Koreans with flip cards which become a gigantic human mosaic screen during the 100,000 men mass gymnastics performance " :
( image credit : J. Chung )
These examples are the opposite of " living " photographs , as envisioned by Arthur Mole and others , as they deaden the individuality into one gray unrecognizable whole .
Opening ceremonies , Moscow Olympics , 1980 .
Finally , a slightly shocking but fresh approach
Spencer Tunick makes his artistic formations from thousands of NAKED people .
His works convey entirely different sensibilities than the usual group photography .
According to Spencer , " the nude form becomes abstract due to the sheer number of people so closely placed together " - plus it places human body in stark contrast with the cold industrial landscapes .
The Wikipedia article lists in detail his latest international exploits , but here is the site where you can sign in to participate yourself , if you live close to the next planned installation .
( this time it 's Amsterdam ) .
700 naked people arranged in a theatre in Bruges :

Since 1992 , Tunick has been arrested five times while working outdoors , but released shortly thereafter .

Wild idea : these happenings are organized , but nobody had the guts yet to set up the similar thing as a flash mob .

Expanding claim of executive authority , White House official tells paper staff can't be charged John Byrne
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email
This A senior Bush Administration official unveiled a new strategy in Friday 's Washington Post -- anonymously -- to combat Democrats in Congress who are clamoring to file contempt charges against officials who refuse to talk about the firings of nine US prosecutors .
In sum , this strategy amounts to , " once we say no , we can't be charged . "
Ironically , President Bush 's new legal argument hinges on whether one of his own US prosecutors can file charges against his staff .
According to the Post , " Administration officials argued yesterday that Congress has no power to force a U.S. attorney to pursue contempt charges in cases , such as the prosecutor firings , in which the president has declared that testimony or documents are protected from release by executive privilege .
Officials pointed to a Justice Department legal opinion during the Reagan administration , which made the same argument in a case that was never resolved by the courts . "
" A U.S. attorney would not be permitted to bring contempt charges or convene a grand jury in an executive privilege case , " a senior official told the Post , which granted the official anonymity because 'he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly . '
" And a U.S. attorney would n't be permitted to argue against the reasoned legal opinion that the Justice Department provided .
No one should expect that to happen . "
Under law , a contempt citation by the House or Senate must be submitted to Washington , D.C. US attorney , who then brings the charge to a grand jury .
" It has long been understood that , in circumstances like these , the constitutional prerogatives of the president would make it a futile and purely political act for Congress to refer contempt citations to U.S. attorneys , " the anonymous Bush official added .
George Mason University professor of public policy Mark J. Rozell called the administration 's stance " astonishing " in the article .
" That 's a breathtakingly broad view of the president 's role in this system of separation of powers , " Rozell told the reporter .
" What this statement is saying is the president 's claim of executive privilege trumps all . "
The White House did not inform Democrats of the plan , which the Post called a " bold new assertion of executive authority . "
Reached for comment , Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) told the paper it was " an outrageous abuse of executive privilege " and said : " The White House must stop stonewalling and start being accountable to Congress and the American people .
No one , including the president , is above the law . "

Underweight
My friend
health would have been a good idea for her at that point ( although , ahem , her doctor would n't have known that , since most doctors would never think to hassle someone with a BMI of 22 about her eating and exercise habits ) .
But back then , Mindy was n't really thinking about her health , frankly .
What she was thinking was , I am too fat .
So she went on a diet .
She ended up here :
Mindy is naturally very thin ( as you 'll see in the " normal " picture below ) .
But even she fell victim to the pressure to be thinner .
For a while , she was depressed , overeating , and not exercising .
She ended up at 5 ' 8 " and 145 lbs. , BMI of 22 -- well within the " normal " range .
( That 's what happens when a naturally thin person acts like a stereotype of a fat person , y'all .
BMI of freakin ' 22 . )
Changing her eating and exercise habits for herwould have been a good idea for her at that point ( although , ahem , her doctor would n't have known that , since most doctors would never think to hassle someone with a BMI of 22 about her eating and exercise habits ) .
But back then , Mindy was n't really thinking about her health , frankly .
What she was thinking was , .
So she went on a diet .
She ended up here :
Normal
But this is the category we are all supposed to aspire to
naturally thin
that
that
These are the first 5 brave souls who agreed to participate in this project -- all friends of mine , so it 's not like I had to go looking very far or bust out the professional athletes to provide good examples of why BMI is a crock .
5' 8 " , 114 lbs. , BMI 17.4 .
Please note that although Mindy 's thinking and behavior were somewhat disordered ( like , uh , practically every western woman's ) , she was not anorectic .
She was just on a regular old diet , like millions and millions of regular women .
Please also note that according to the National Eating Disorders Association , the average top fashion model 's BMI is 16.3 .
Mindy would have had to lose another 7 pounds to fit in with them .
The good news is , looking at that very photo made Mindy realize she 'd gone too far .
She knocked off the dieting , gained a whopping 11 lbs. , and is now also our poster girl for the " normal " category .
Here 's Mindy again at 5 ' 8 " , 125 lbs. , BMI 19 : That , my friends , is " normal .
" Now , do n't get me wrong -- for Mindy , it IS normal .
She 's healthy and beautiful at that weight , and it would be hard for her to get very much fatter if she wanted to .
She 's got beanpole genes going back a long way ..
And how manypeople do you know who arethin ?
Well , you 're saying , Mindy 's close to the bottom of the " normal " category .
Surely , no one 's suggesting I have to bethin to be healthy ?
So let 's look at the bottom of the " overweight " category .
QR Code Link to This Post
I wrote her , told the truth about myself , attached a picture and hoped for the best .
The next day I get a response , she asks a few questions , I answer , and she writes back with her phone number .
That 's right , I did n't need to provide proof of birth or a pay stub .
I called and she picked up on the first ring .
Her voice was n't high - pitched or deep , it was just normal and a little perky , she rambled on and then I rambled on .
I called her again , and then again , our conversations were fluid , no awkward pauses , she was simultaneously available and unavailable .
We met at the Matador in Ballard for our first date , her choice .
I gave myself plenty of time but there was an accident on 520 and I was 15 minutes late , I showed up frazzled .
But instead of being rude , she was understanding and pleasant .
Apparently she 'd showed up early , put our name down on the list , sat at the bar with a glass of white wine .
She was even prettier than her pictures , her face had matured , her hair was looser and wilder .
She wore a pale yellow strapless top and dark jeans .
The curve of her neck and shoulders and collarbone , her tan skin , I tried not to stare .
The hostess took us to our table .
The bar was loud so we sat on the same side of the booth .
She was n't nervous at all and her hand was ice cold and smooth .
She made me laugh .
I was in love with her then , and I knew it , and it was terrifying .
I called her the next day , she answered , we made a date .
I offered dinner , she suggested the Pink Door .
It was Halloween weekend and she wore an outfit that was almost - a- costume .
She refused the first table the hostess offered us , requesting one along the banquette .
I expected the hostess to refuse , the staff there is infamously snotty , but instead changed direction and took us to the requested table .
She seemed to know the staff , the wine - list made sense to her .
She over - ordered and ate little .
After dinner I walked her to her car , everyone on 1st Ave. looked at her as we walked by .
When we got to her car I kissed her .
Afterward she smiled and said goodnight .
We had another date , and another , and another , it was perfect , we made - out in her cold car , NPR droning in the background .
And then another date - she came over to my place and we watched When Harry Met Sally , she said it was the sweetest movie of all time .
We did n't really watch much of it , of course .
She said " yes " all night long .. " yes " over and over and over again , and " please . "
She said " yes " and then " please " over and over , and breathed into me .
She left the next morning .
" Thanks for having me over , " she said .
It was raining and cold outside , but I was warm and sleepy .
I called into work and went back to bed and woke up to her smell on my sheets .
It was 5 days before Christmas .
I never saw her again .
I called , texted , and e-mailed for weeks , long after I should have stopped , but I just could n't accept it .
Then I started to realize that I did n't know her last name , where she worked , or where her apartment was .
I had no way to find her .
Why had n't I ever thought to ask ?
Why had n't it just come up naturally in conversation ?
Was it all on purpose ?- some sick manipulation ?
But why ?- to what end ?
I 'd become paranoid .
Distant .
I re-bounded badly , very badly , embarrassingly , over and over again .
But it started to get better .
A new girl started a few weeks ago on my floor .
She smiled at me every time we passed each other .
I asked her out , she accepted .
There we were , this past Saturday night , in El Camino in Fremont , and I look up , and there she is .
She looked fantastic , wearing all black with high boots .
She was with some guy , a tall , big guy with blond hair .
I put my head down but it was too late , she saw me and came over .
She leaned in and kissed me hello , asked me how I 've been , complimented ( with a totally sincere tone ) my date .
She suggests some specialty drink , then excuses herself .
I could n't tell my date the truth , of course , so I had no excuse to leave .
About 1 / 2 an hour later she leaves , waving goodbye quietly as she passed through the door .
I could n't help myself - I went home , already drunk and then drank more .
I called her around 2 AM .
She did n't answer .
なぜ、 「 まつもとゆきひろ」か？
「 Railsによるアジャイ ルWebアプリケーション開発」は一風変わった書籍である。RubyによるWebアプリケーションフレームワーク、Ruby on Rails解説の決定版である本書は、書名に「アジャイル」を冠しながらも、本文では具体的なアジャイルソフトウェア開発手法への言及がほとんどない。その理由は「アジリティ（agileであること）はRailsの構造の一部」であり「フレームワーク自体にアジャイル宣言の原則を語らせるように」執筆したという。
Railsのように野心的なWebアプリケーションフレームワークの出現を可能にしたプログラミング言語Ruby。われわれアジャイル開発の実践者たちは、今回のRubyブームに乗じて、アジャイル開発をソフトウェアビジネス界に対してアピールする作戦を考えた。いま、Rubyについて考えることは、アジャイル開発の、そしてソフトウェア開発ビジネスの未来を考えることでもある。
そこでわれわれは、現在の日本で最もRubyについて語るのに適切な人物との「鼎談」（ていだん）を申し入れた。その人物とはほかならぬ、プログラミング言語Rubyの言語設計者にして自他ともに認める日本を代表する言語オタクである、まつもとゆきひろ氏である。
鼎談は、Rubyとアジャイル開発、そして2007年現在のビジネスアプリケーションを語るうえで欠かせないJavaのそれぞれについて、現在に至る流れを振り返ることから始まった。
Javaの来歴
1996 年 にJDK 1.0がリリースされて以来の十年余にわたるJavaの発展の歴史は、間接化とコンポーネント化の歴史でもある。JVM、Webアプリケーションフレームワーク、O/Rマッパ、EJBコンポーネント、XML設定ファイル、Dependency Injectionコンテナ。こうしたJavaの発展を支えたのは、コンピュータの処理速度の向上と高速なネットワークインフラの整備である。間接層の導入はさまざまな問題を解決するが、同時に複雑さも増す。
Java陣営もこの複雑さの増加を認識しており、現在はEoDを標榜（ひょうぼう）しているが、それでもやはり大規模な基幹業務システムではない「普通の」Webアプリケーション開発にとって、JavaEEは依然として複雑過ぎるのが実態である。
Rubyの開発とブーム
Rubyはまつもと氏によって1993年に生まれ、1995年に最初のバージョンがリリースされた（0.95）。開発動機は「作りたかったから」。
現在 、Rubyの開発は 「まつもとゆきひろと愉快なコミッタたち」によって続けられている。目下の開発のメインターゲットは、処理系の刷新されるRuby 1.9.1のリリース。リリース予定は2007年12月である。
日本国内で のRubyの知名度の向上は、2000年に京都で開催されたPerl/RubyConferenceと、その前後に起きたRuby関連本の出版ラッシュである。このころのブームは「第1次Rubyバブル」と呼ばれている。
海外でRubyが認知される大きなきっかけとなったのは、「プログラミングRuby 達人プログラマーガイド」の出版である。Dave Thomas とAndrew Huntの 「 達人プログラマー システム開発の職人から名匠への道」のコンビによって執筆された。彼らは本書を1年足らずの間に、怒とうの勢いで書き上げた。
当時、Rubyの存在を知る海外プログラマーの多くが、本書をきっかけにRubyを使い始めたという。そして、本書が出版された翌2001年に米国ではRuby単独カンファレンス「RubyConf」の第1回が開催された。
Rubyが広く認知され始めたのは21世紀に入ってからであるが、それでもなお、2005年にRuby on Railsが流行し始めるまでは 「 知る人ぞ知る」言語だった。
Rubyコミュニティとしては普及すること自体を重視しておらず、現在のようにRubyが幅広く注目を集めたのも「結果的にマーケティングだよね」とまつもと氏は語った。
プログラミング言語の潮流
10年前に登場した当初、Javaはビジネスアプリケーションの世界では「おもちゃ」「遅くて仕事には使えない」という評価を受けていた。現在のRubyも多かれ少なかれ似たような状況にある。「プログラマーのおもちゃ」「大規模開発には向かない」などなど。
「 Javaか らRuby へ マネージャのための実践移行ガイド 」によれ ば 「 成功するプログラミング言語は、ほぼ10年毎に出現している」という。Cの登場が1971年、C++は1983年、Javaが1996年。そして2007年の現在、数多くのソフトウェア開発者の興味を集めている言語の1つがRubyである。
「 Javaで起きたような変化が、もう一度起こるのではないか？」こうした予感を抱いているソフトウェア開発者は、われわれだけではなさそうだ――少なくともあと1人、「JavaからRubyへ」の著者であるBruce Tateは、Rubyの勢いにJavaと同じものを感じているようだ。
アジャイルソフトウェア開発の評価
アジャイルソフトウェア開発は、状況の変化に対して迅速かつ適応的にソフトウェアを開発する軽量な開発手法である。アジャイル開発のムーブメントは、1999年の「XP エクストリーム ・プログラミング入門」出版をきっかけに、21世紀初頭に盛り上がりを見せ、2001年2月の「アジャイルマニフェスト」の制定へと結実した。その後に表面的なアジャイルブームは去り、2004年に「エクストリーム・プログラミング入門
第2版」が出版されたが、第1版が出版された当時のような大きな盛り上がりには欠いた状況にある。
しかし、海外では一定の間隔でアジャイル開発関連書籍が出版されており評価の高い書籍も多い。2007年のJolt Awardsを受賞したの はAlister Cockburn の 「 Agile Software Development ：The Cooperative Game」 の第2版であった。こうした海外のアジャイル開発関連書籍のうちの何冊かは、2007年以降に日本でも翻訳書籍の出版が予定されている。
アジャイルソフトウェア開発は、当初にブームを巻き起こしたような派手さはないが、実践経験を踏まえた次なる段階へと着実に進みつつある。
「 達人プログラマー」という書籍の存在
時系列 でRubyとアジャイルとを振り返ると、いずれの流れにおいても重要な役割を果たしている存在が、1999年に「達人プログラマー
」（日本語版は2000年）を出版したDave Thomas とAndrew Huntの2人である。アジャイル開発の文脈では、「達人プログラマー」の2人は「アジャイルマニフェスト」の署名メンバーであり、Rubyの文脈ではすでに述べたとおり「プログラミングRuby 達人プログラマーガイド」の著者である。Dave Thomasは、初めに言及した「 RailsによるアジャイルWebアプリケーション開発」の著者でもある（Railsの作者であるDavid Heinemeier Hanssonと共著）。
達人プログラマーの2人は、1999 年にThe Pragmatic Programmers , LLC .を設立し、2003年からソフトウェア技術書籍の出版事業を行っている。書籍のラインアップにはアジャイル開発やRubyに関連したものを中心に幅広い内容をカバーしている。
ソフトウェア開発の動向を知るには、中心となる人物の動向をフォローするのが良い方法である、という平鍋の主張に従うならば、今後のRubyとアジャイルとの関連を考えていくうえでは、「達人プログラマー」の2人の動向に注目していくとよさそうだ。ちなみに、The Pragmatic Programmers , LLC .の新刊 が“ Programming Erlang ” であることが、海外プログラマーの間では大きな話題となっている。
なお、達人プログラマーの1人 、Dave Thomasは6月に東京で開催される「日本Ruby 会議2007」で基調講演を行う予定である。
1990 年代後半に登場し たRubyとアジャイル開発について、それぞれの登場から現在まで流れを簡単に振り返った。結果、Rubyとアジャイル開発の発展を考えるうえで「達人プログラマー」の著者であるDave Thomas とAndrew Huntがキーパーソンであることが浮き彫りになった。次回は、こうした時代状況の流れの背景について議論する。

No manners berating today , folks .
No me saying , “ Do this , not that , ” or “ Do n’t stick that there , stick it here , ” etc .
Nope .
I just wanted to share with you guys what I did over Christmas vacation .
That ’s it .
I get a real swelling of pride whenever I show anyone these pictures .
It ’s a warm fuzzy feeling , mixed with a little bit of dorky shame .
This past Christmas Vacation my brothers , sister , myself and my girlfriend built a scale replica of the battle of Helms Deep , from the second book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy , The Two Towers penned by the late , great , J.R.R. Tolkien .
Here are some pictures :
This is the zoomed out view .
The whole thing was constructed out of cardboard , glue , icing and … well , candy .
It clocked in at about 7 feet long by 3 feet deep by 2 feet tall .
We used over 500 Gummy Bears as orcs and Uruk - Hai .
The Elves , Dwarves and Men were represented by sour patch kids .
Most of these were of course corpses .
This is the reverse view .
As you can see , my mom has a bitching rug .
Also you can see that by this point the evil army of Saruman ’s creation has broken through the wall and is streaming in for the sweet sweet sugary kill .
We made some siege machinery as well .
The Catapults were Tootsie pops .
Leaning against the Jolly Rancher wall is a siege tower made of other tootsie type stuff .
There are some red licorice ropes as , well … rope .
Here you can see how skilled we are at cardboard mountain creation .
Seeing this again almost makes me aroused at my own awesomeness .
Notice the brutal carnage happening on the walls as the men and orcs battle .
Alas !
The evil host is through the walls !
And up the carefully crafted stairs of Starburst candies .
Is there no end to their cruelty ?
The answer is most definitely NO , as you can see from the piles of dead men and elves .
They are covered in the sweetest candy blood we could find ( red Nerds and more licorice rope ) .
One last charge for glory .
Theoden and Aragorn charge forth from the castle atop mighty steeds ( gummy Target dogs ) , with mighty spears ( toothpicks , not actually candy ) , into the teeming multitude of evil .
I ’m pretty sure they ’re doing it for wrath and ruin , or something .
This is the hold .
My girlfriend , Eileen , did most of this and you can tell because it ’s super bad ass .
Notice the Nerd graveled path and the brickwork .
This shot is dramatic in that last scene from Saving Private Ryan everyone is getting shot and dying sort of way .
You ’re terrified , but you feel for the characters , even though they are only sugar .
And finally , just like he said he would , Gandalf comes to the rescue .
If you look closely you can see him with a wizard ’s staff just wrecking shit in the middle of orcs who are getting fucking pwnt .
Pwnt is Ent - speak for owned .
So there you have it .
Next year we ’re building Minas Tirith , all seven rings .
What did you do over the break ?
Haha , I really do n’t care because there is NO way it was even close to as cool as this .
For thousands of years , prophets have predicted the end of the world .
Today , various religious groups , using the latest technology , are trying to hasten it .
Their endgame is to speed the promised arrival of a messiah .
For some Christians this means laying the groundwork for Armageddon .
With that goal in mind , mega - church pastors recently met in Inglewood to polish strategies for using global communications and aircraft to transport missionaries to fulfill the Great Commission : to make every person on Earth aware of Jesus ’ message .
Doing so , they believe , will bring about the end , perhaps within two decades .

In Iran , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has a far different vision .
As mayor of Tehran in 2004 , he spent millions on improvements to make the city more welcoming for the return of a Muslim messiah known as the Mahdi , according to a recent report by the American Foreign Policy Center , a nonpartisan think tank .
To the majority of Shiites , the Mahdi was the last of the prophet Muhammad ’s true heirs , his 12 righteous descendants chosen by God to lead the faithful .
Ahmadinejad hopes to welcome the Mahdi to Tehran within two years .
Conversely , some Jewish groups in Jerusalem hope to clear the path for their own messiah by rebuilding a temple on a site now occupied by one of Islam ’s holiest shrines .

Artisans have re-created priestly robes of white linen , gem - studded breastplates , silver trumpets and solid - gold menorahs to be used in the Holy Temple -- along with two 6 1/2 - ton marble cornerstones for the building ’s foundation .
Then there is Clyde Lott , a Mississippi revivalist preacher and cattle rancher .
He is trying to raise a unique herd of red heifers to satisfy an obscure injunction in the Book of Numbers : the sacrifice of a blemish - free red heifer for purification rituals needed to pave the way for the messiah .
So far , only one of his cows has been verified by rabbis as worthy , meaning they failed to turn up even three white or black hairs on the animal ’s body .
Linking these efforts is a belief that modern technologies and global communications have made it possible to induce completion of God ’s plan within this generation .

Though there are myriad interpretations of how it will play out , the basic Christian apocalyptic countdown -- as described by the Book of Revelation in the New Testament -- is as follows :
Jews return to Israel after 2,000 years , the Holy Temple is rebuilt , billions of people perish during seven years of natural disasters and plagues , the antichrist arises and rules the world , the battle of Armageddon erupts in the vicinity of Israel , Jesus returns to defeat Satan ’s armies and preside over Judgment Day .
Generations of Christians have hoped for the Second Coming of Jesus , said UCLA historian Eugen Weber , author of the 1999 book “ Apocalypses : Prophecies , Cults and Millennial Beliefs Through the Ages . ”
“ And it ’s always been an ultimately bloody hope , a slaughterhouse hope , ” he added with a sigh .
“ What we have now in this global age is a vaster and bloodier - than - ever Wagnerian version .
But , then , we are a very imaginative race . ”

Apocalyptic movements are nothing new ; even Christopher Columbus hoped to assist in the Great Commission by evangelizing New World inhabitants .
Some religious scholars saw apocalyptic fever rise as the year 2000 approached , and they expected it to subside after the millennium arrived without a hitch .
It did n’t .
According to various polls , an estimated 40 % of Americans believe that a sequence of events presaging the end times is already underway .
Among the believers are pastors of some of the largest evangelical churches in America , who converged at Faith Central Bible Church in Inglewood in February to finalize plans to start 5 million new churches worldwide in 10 years .
“ Jesus Christ commissioned his disciples to go to the ends of the Earth and tell everyone how they could achieve eternal life , ” said James Davis , president of the Global Pastors Network ’s “ Billion Souls Initiative , ” one of an estimated 2,000 initiatives worldwide designed to boost the Christian population .
Advertisement
“ As we advance around the world , ” Davis said , “ we ’ll be shortening the time needed to fulfill that Great Commission .
Then , the Bible says , the end will come . ”
An opposing vision , invoked by Ahmadinejad in an address before the United Nations last year , suggests that the Imam Mahdi , a 9th century figure , will soon emerge from a well to conquer the world and convert everyone to Islam .
“ O mighty Lord , ” he said , “ I pray to you to hasten the emergence of your last repository , the promised one , that perfect and pure human being , the one that will fill this world with justice and peace . ”
At the appropriate time , according to Shiite tradition , the Mahdi will reappear and , along with Jesus , lead Muslims in a struggle to rid the world of corruption and establish justice .

For Christians , the future of Israel is the key to any end - times scenario , and various groups are reaching out to Jews -- or proselytizing among them -- to advance the Second Coming .
A growing number of fundamentalist Christians in mostly Southern states are adopting Jewish religious practices to align themselves with prophecies saying that Gentiles will stand as one with Jews when the end is near .
Evangelist John C. Hagee of the 19,000 - member Cornerstone Church in San Antonio has helped 12,000 Russian Jews move to Israel , and donated several million dollars to Israeli hospitals and orphanages .
“ We are the generation that will probably see the rapture of the church , ” Hagee said , referring to a moment in advance of Jesus ’ return when the world ’s true believers will be airlifted into heaven .
Advertisement
“ In Christian theology , the first thing that happens when Christ returns to Earth is the judgment of nations , ” said Hagee , who wears a Jewish prayer shawl when he ministers .
“ It will have one criterion : How did you treat the Jewish people ?
Anyone who understands that will want to be on the right side of that question .
Those who are anti-Semitic will go to eternal damnation . ”
On July 18 , Hagee plans to lead a contingent of high - profile evangelists to Washington to make their concerns about Israel ’s security known to congressional leaders .
More than 1,200 evangelists are expected for the gathering .
“ Twenty - five years ago , I called a meeting of evangelists to discuss such an effort , and the conversation did n’t last an hour , ” he said .
“ This time , I called and they all came and stayed .
And when the meeting was over , they all agreed to speak up for Israel . ”
Underlining the sense of urgency is a belief that the end - times clock started ticking May 15 , 1948 , when the United Nations formally recognized Israel .
Advertisement
“ I ’ll never forget that night , ” Hagee said .
“ I was 8 years old at the time and in the kitchen with my father listening to the news about Israel ’s rebirth on the radio .
He said , ‘ Son , this is the most important day in the 20th century . ’ ”
Hagee ’s message is carried on 160 television stations and 50 radio stations and can be seen in Africa , Europe , Australia , New Zealand and most Third World nations .
By contrast , Bill McCartney , a former University of Colorado football coach and co-founder of the evangelical Promise Keepers movement for men , which became huge in the 1990s , has had a devil of a time getting his own apocalyptic campaign off the ground .
It ’s called The Road to Jerusalem , and its mission is to convert Jews to Christianity -- while there is still time .
Advertisement
“ Our whole purpose is to hasten the end times , ” he said .
“ The Bible says Jews will be brought to jealousy when they see Christians and Jewish believers together as one -- they ’ll want to be a part of that .
That ’s going to signal Jesus ’ return . ”
Jews and others who do n’t accept Jesus , he added matter - of - factly , “ are toast . ”
McCartney , who only a decade ago sermonized to stadium - size crowds of Promise Keepers , said finding people to back his sputtering cause has been “ like plowing cement . ”
Given end - times scenarios saying that non-believers will die before Jesus returns -- and that the antichrist will rule from Jerusalem ’s rebuilt Holy Temple -- Jews have mixed feelings about the outpouring of support Israel has been getting from evangelical organizations .
Advertisement
“ I truly believe John Hagee is at once a daring , beautiful person -- and quite dangerous , ” said Orthodox Rabbi Brad Hirschfield , vice president of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership in New York .
“ I sincerely recognize him as a hero for bringing planeloads of people to Israel at a time when people there were getting blown up by the busloads , ” Hirschfield said .
“ But he also believes that the only path to the father is through Jesus .
That leaves me out . ”
Meanwhile , in what has become a spectacular annual routine , Jews -- hoping to rebuild the Holy Temple destroyed by the Romans in AD 70 -- attempt to haul the 6 1/2 - ton cornerstones by truck up to the Temple Mount , the site now occupied by the Dome of the Rock shrine .
Each year , they are turned back by police .
Among those turned away is Gershon Solomon , spokesman for Jerusalem ’s Temple Institute .
When the temple is built , he said , “ Islam is over . ”
Advertisement
“ I ’m grateful for all the wonderful Christian angels wanting to help us , ” Solomon added , acknowledging the political support from “ Christians who are now Israel ’s best lobbyists in the United States . ”
However , when asked to comment on the fate of non-Christians upon the Second Coming of Jesus , he said , “ That ’s a very embarrassing question .
What can I tell you ?
That ’s a very terrible Christian idea .
“ What kind of religion is it that expects another religion will be destroyed ? ”
But are all of these efforts to hasten the end of the world a bit like , well , playing God ?
Advertisement
Some Christians , such as Roman Catholics and some Protestant denominations , believe in the Second Coming but do n’t try to advance it .
It ’s important to be ready for the Second Coming , they say , though its timetable cannot be manipulated .
Hirschfield said he prays every day for the coming of the Jewish messiah , but he too believes that God ca n’t be hurried .
“ For me , ” he said , “ the messiah is like the mechanical bunny at a racetrack :
It always stays a little ahead of the runners but keeps the pace toward a redeemed world .
“ Trouble is , there are many people who want to bring a messiah who looks just like them .
For me , that kind of messianism is spiritual narcissism . ”
Advertisement
But some Christian leaders say they are n’t playing God ; they ’re just carrying out his will .
Ted Haggard , president of the National Assn. of Evangelicals , says the commitment to fulfilling the Great Commission has naturally intensified along with the technological advances God provided to carry out his plans .
Over in Mississippi , Lott believes that he is doing God ’s work , and that is why he wants to raise a few head of red heifers for Jewish high priests .
Citing Scripture , Lott and others say a pure red heifer must be sacrificed and burned and its ashes used in purification rituals to allow Jews to rebuild the temple .
But Lott ’s plans have been sidetracked .
Advertisement
Facing a maze of red tape and testing involved in shipping animals overseas -- and rumors of threats from Arabs and Jews alike who say the cows would only bring more trouble to the Middle East -- he has given up on plans to fly planeloads of cows to Israel .
For now .
In the meantime , some local ranchers have expressed an interest in raising their own red heifers for Israel , and fears of hoof - and - mouth disease and blue tongue forced Lott to relocate his only verified red heifer -- a female born in 1993 -- to Nebraska .
Cloning is out of the question , he said , because the technique “ is not approved by the rabbinical council of Israel . ”
Artificial insemination has so far failed to produce another heifer certified by rabbis .
“ Something deep in my heart says God wants me to be a blessing to Israel , ” Lott said in a telephone interview .
“ But it ’s complicated .
We ’re just not ready to send any red heifers over there . ”

If not now , when ?
“ If there ’s a sovereign God with his hand in the affairs of men , it ’ll happen , and it ’ll be a pivotal event , ” he said .
“ That time is soon .
Very soon . ”

Mozilla and IronPython : IronMonkey
Mozilla have finally announced their new project that I blogged cryptically about a few months ago .
The new project is called IronMonkey and has just been announced by Brendan Eich ( Chief Architect of the Mozilla project ) along with two other equally wonderfully named projects :
Action Monkey
Screaming Monkey
All three projects are based around integrating the Tamarin Virtual Machine into Mozilla ( principally Firefox ) .
Tamarin will become the heart of SpiderMonkey which is the JavaScript engine embedded in Firefox .
ActionMonkey is the integration project and headed by Jason Orendorff who is a noted Pythonista ( particularly for his excellent path module which nearly made it into the Python standard library ) .
ScreamingMonkey has another famous Pythonista at the helm , Mark Hammond .
The project aims to ' to add script - engine integration glue ' to Tamarin .
It will bring a JS2 implementation to IE .
Seo Sanghyeon has taken the job of lead developer on IronMonkey .
The goal of this project is to get the DLR ( Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime ) and its target languages ( IronPython and IronRuby ) running on Tamarin .
This will be a lot of work - including changes to Tamarin ( perhaps implementing DynamicMethod in C++ ) .
I believe the approach they are taking is to convert .NET bytecode to Tamarin byte - code rather than cross-compiling C# .
You will have to ask Seo though , this is all lower level than I usually go .
The end result is that Firefox should be ' natively ' scriptable with IronPython and IronRuby , and possibly that you will be able to create applications on the Mozilla platform with these languages instead ofJavaScript .
This is great news , but it still vapourware - this is just the announcement of the project start .
If anyone can do it though , Seo can !
It is also interesting to note that Mozilla have enough faith in Microsoft 's Open Source license to attempt this .
Oh and on a vaguely related note , there is a new ' community ' site dedicated to IronRuby : RubyDoes .
NET .
TDD at PyCon UK
Jonathan has been announced !
My esteemed colleague will be giving a talk at PyCon UK .
From the announcement :
Jonathan Hartley of Resolver is giving a talk on Test Driven Development , an illustration of how to perform test - driven development for those who have not done it before .
Jonathan thinks that TDD could be the closest thing to Brooks ' silver bullet that software engineering will ever find .
The presentation will focus on how to start a new project using TDD , and specifically on what techniques and libraries are available to Python programmers .
It should be good .
Welcome to Kamil
Welcome to the second of our interns for the summer , Kamil Dworakowski .
He is a student from Poland , and has almost completed his masters in computer science with the University of Wroclav .
He is also a contributor to the Nemerle programming language .
From the Nemerle website :
Nemerle is a high - level statically - typed programming language for the .NET platform .
It offers functional , object - oriented and imperative features .
It has a simple C# - like syntax and a powerful meta- programming system .
Nemerle has a great macro system , so we are hoping that he will teach it to us over the summer .
Dynamically Compiling C# from IronPython
IronPython is a great way to use the .NET framework .
It comes packed full of Python dynamic goodness .
Unfortunately it is n't perfect .
One noteworthy hole in the IronPython .NET integration is attributes .
You ca n't use attributes in IronPython , which can sometime be a problem .
The normal way round this problem is to create stub C# classes with methods that you can override in IronPython .
This does n't always work though ; sometimes you want to dynamically specify the arguments to the attributes - which can only be done at compile time with C# .
This article explores a way round the problem , with a solution that potentially has many other uses .
It provides a way to dynamically compile C# source code into assemblies .
These assemblies can be used in memory or saved to disk .
This means that C# code can be generated and compiled dynamically from IronPython , and the assemblies saved to disk or used directly within the same application .
IronPython to Accept User Contributions
Up until now Microsoft have been unwilling / unable to accept user contributions to the IronPython project .
This has been a source of frustration for the IronPython community because the FePy Project has often fixed bugs - fixes that have not been able to make their way back upstream .
Since John Lam announced that IronRuby would be accepting user contributions the obvious question was - would the same apply to the IronPython project ?
Jim Hugunin has just answered this question on the IronPython mailing list with an enthusiastic yes .
There are caveats , but the long term prognosis is good .
In the longer term , we will establish a more official structure so that the community can contribute to more of the IronPython project and so that our " official " releases will include these contributions .
Right now , our fairly small team is still focused on working out the details for our new IronRuby release .
While we 're doing this , we do n't want to make any changes to disrupt the IronPython project that has been running successfully for over two years .
After the IronRuby sources do in fact go up on Rubyforge , we 'll be able to devote the time to talk with folks both within MS and within the Python community to work out the best next step for IronPython to increase our support for community contributors .
I 'm sorry this is going to take a little more time and thank you for your patience .
Microsoft are gradually dipping their toes into the Open Source world , and suspicions of sinister motives apart ( although realistically they have little choice but to be involved ) , they do seem to be making a genuine effort .
Oh , and by the way , David Peterson has created a Facebook group : .NET Dynamic Languages .
Looks like the march of facebook proceeds inexorably ...
IronRuby Released
John Lam has announced that a ' Pre - Alpha ' version of IronRuby is now available .
It comes as a source distribution that can be built even ( allegedly ) only with the .NET Framework 2 redistributable installed .
I 've had a play , not knowing any Ruby I can't do much with it .
I can't easily see how to convert the project into Silverlight assemblies .
It would be fun to use it with the DLRConsole sample .
Interestingly though , John says of the IronRuby project :
We 're also happy to announce that we will be accepting source code contributions into the IronRuby libraries .
[...] once the DLR matures and reaches 1.0 status with fully supported public interfaces , we will fully open up all parts of the IronRuby project for external contributions .
This is very different to the situation with IronPython , where no external contributions are accepted .
This is a positive step forward , and hopefully heralds change for IronPython at some point ...
The project will also be hosted at RubyForge rather than Codeplex which is another first for Microsoft .
Scott Guthrie has posted a long introduction and examples of using IronRuby : First Look at IronRuby .
Succumbed at Last : MacBook Ordered
My gadget fund has been building up recently and I 've been uhming and ahing about whether to buy a Macbook .
Over the weekend I was browsing the Apple store and saw a refurbished MacBook Pro at a price I could n't resist .
So I 've finally succumbed and buying a machine without a Micro$oft OS .
The spec of the machine ( which I should have in my grubby hands by Wednesday ) is :
Refurbished MacBook Pro , 15 - inch , 2.33 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 15.4 - inch widescreen display ( 1440x900 resolution ) 2GB ( two SODIMMs ) 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM 120 GB 5400 - rpm Serial ATA hard drive Slot - load 6x SuperDrive ( DVD±RW / CD - RW ) ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 with 256MB GDDR3 memory
I use my laptop for at least two hours a day whilst commuting , but will continue to use my desktop with Windows XP at home .
I wonder how annoying it will be to use two different operating systems like this ?
If I like Mac OS then when I change my desktop next year I will switch to a Mac .
I 've been seriously tempted by the Apple Mac Pro with Twin Quad Core processors .
( Not that I need this , but it would be nice ) .
With two 3.0GHz Quad Core Xeon processors , it costs £ 2700 in the UK ( but would need some extra memory ) .
I looked at alternative suppliers for similar specced hardware and could n't find anyone cheaper .
Unusual for Apple to be cheapest for a hardware spec !
Allegedly Intel are about to announce additions to their Core 2 Duo and Quad core processor ranges , with a big price drop - so it will be interesting to see what the situation is next year .
For writing ( the dreaded book ) I still need Microsoft Word , and as I have a license for the PC version I think I will run it under virtualisation rather than buy a license for the Mac version .
I look forward to using IronPython with Mono , but I will also need Windows for running Resolver and using the parts of .NET that are n't fully implemented in Mono .
Parallels has a very good reputation for Windows virtualisation on the Mac and costs $ 80 .
VMWare , who have a good reputation for virtualization on other platforms , have announced a beta of VMWare Fusion for the Mac .
This will cost the same as Parallels but is available as a pre-order for $ 40 so I 'm not sure which to go with .
To decide which version of Windows to run under virtualisation on the Mac I 've installed Vista Ultimate into a Virtual PC .
It 's been fun to use it as an isolated development machine - and all the software I rely on seems to work .

Henry Rollins ' Tees Off ' on Halliburton - style privatization David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Punk singer - songwriter Henry Rollins took on Iraq War profiteers on his Independent Film Channel show this Saturday .
" The invasion and occupation of Iraq and the resulting nightmare we are enduring are for some a depressing , ongoing catastrophe with no end in sight , " he said .
" Yet for another group , it is the best thing that could ever happen .
...
The corporations that provide services to the military are making more money in this time than ever before .
Troop withdrawal is not in their interest . "
" Why not bring that overpriced roadshow here to America and treat the citizens to a little of that privatized efficiency ? "
Rollins went on .
" I 'm sure KBR knows what to do with my freedom a lot better than I do .
Might as well privatize that , too .
Keep it up , Cheney .
All you 're doing is emboldening me . "
The following video is from IFC's Henry Rollins Show , broadcast on June 16 .

3D Full Moon
Credit & Copyright : Laurent Laveder ( PixHeaven.net )
Explanation :
Get out your red / blue glasses and check out this satisfying stereo anaglyph of the Full Moon .
A corresponding stereo image pair , intended for cross-eyed viewing , is also available through this link .
Regardless of your preferred technique for stereo viewing , the 3D effect comes from combining pictures of the same scene taken at different angles -- mimicking the slightly different perspective of each eye .
Perhaps surprisingly for Earthdwellers , getting two pictures of the Full Moon from different angles only requires a little patience .
In this case , photographer Laurent Laveder used pictures taken months apart , one in November 2006 and one in January 2007 .
He relied on the Moon 's continuous libration or wobble as it orbits to produce two shifted images of a Full Moon .

Silicon Insider : Why Old Rockers Sound Better Than Ever
They might be eligible for AARP , but the old folks ' tours still make big cash .
Dec. 20 , 2007  --
If there 's one place in the world I 'd like to be the first week of March 2008 it would be the Shepard 's Bush Empire Auditorium in London .
And that 's despite being thoroughly sick of visiting London over the last six months .
That night , the surviving members of the Zombies -- Colin Blunstone , Rod Argent , Chris White and Hugh Grundy -- will hold a reunion to perform the album " Odyssey and Oracle . "
They will also be performing " other solo tracks " with a string quartet , which no doubt means that Blunstone will be singing works from his solo albums .
And no doubt Argent and White will be doing their big Argent hits from the '70s .
I know this sounds like the wheezings of yet another old baby boomer lost in nostalgia for his past .
But bear with me for a few minutes , because I 'm actually going somewhere with this .
First , the Zombies and their extraordinary album .
Of all of the great albums of the British Invasion , none is more unusual , both in content and history , than " Odyssey and Oracle . "
Always ranked among the 10 best Britpop albums of the era -- pretty heady company when you consider that list also includes " Meet the Beatles , " " Revolver , " " Out of Our Heads , " " Something Else " and " The Who Sings My Generation " -- " Odyssey and Oracle " had the unhappy distinction of being released after the Zombies broke up .
So there was no tour -- and those millions of listeners who were enchanted by the album 's masterpiece , " Time of the Season , " never actually got to see the band perform it .
This bit of bad luck was of a piece with the rest of the Zombies history .
The band never fit any of the usual molds .
They were neither working class heroes nor aristos , but just public school kids from the unlikely location of St. Albans .
They did n't sound like any other band either : classically structured songs driven by Rod Argent 's keyboards and featuring one of rock 's greatest treasures : the mysterious , breathy vocals of Colin Blunstone .
The band had two huge hits , " Tell Her No " and " She 's Not There , " both usually listed in Rock 's Top 100 , and successfully toured the U.S. to the sound of screaming girls .
With this success , the band went for it all , producing " Odyssey and Oracle , " an album of complex lyrics , melodies and instrumentation every bit as ambitious as " Sgt. Peppers " or " Days of Future Past . "
The album came out in early 1968 to some acclaim … and nobody bought it .
Even more embarrassing , when the album appeared on the shelves the title was misspelled as " Oddessey and Oracle . "
But it did n't much matter , because by then the band had already broken up in frustration over its bad luck .
A year later , the single " Time of the Season " was released and rocketed up the charts all over the world .
When the band was approached to tour behind the record , it refused , so the record company just sent out phony bands bearing the Zombies name .
And that 's how it went .
Argent and White went off to have a gold record hit with Argent 's " Hold Your Head Up " and Blunstone created two of the most beautiful albums in pop music history : " One Year " and " Ennismore , " the latter containing the classic " I Don't Believe in Miracles . "
And that was that .
Argent and White cut a number of albums over the subsequent decades , and Blunstone 's voice was always in demand by everyone from the Alan Parson 's Project ( his " Old and Wise " is the high point of " Eye in the Sky " ) to Dave Stewart .
But , like most aging rockers , they fell off the radar for an entire generation .
Now they 're back , and both old fans and that lost new generation will finally get to hear the Zombies play " Odyssey and Oracle " -- and if Argent 's and Blunstone 's recent tour is any indication , it will be a stunning experience .
I bought the CD of that tour just to see if the pair could still sing .
I was driving in the truck with son Tad , Mr. Indy Rock , and put on " Miracles . "
Blunstone 's voice was older and darker than those ethereal pipes of forty years ago , but he still had the chops .
Then he hit that song 's famous stratospheric last note … I winced in anticipation , but he hit it clean and perfect .
I turned to Tad and said , " And that 's a 60 - year - old man , son . "
" Jeez , " Tad replied , incredulous , " He sounds like he 's nineteen . "
And that got me thinking .
There are two great forces that seem at work today in popular music : technology and medicine .
And at the intersection of the two , remarkable things are happening .
For a long time , I used to look in dismay at the fact that some of the most popular bands around , even for young people , were musicians from my generation .
Did n't kids have the own music ?
I asked , and it was easy to fall into the old trap of believing in the lost paradise of your own you , and to assuming that everything had gone to hell since .
But I 've listened lately to a lot of contemporary music -- and I 'm convinced that the stuff being put out today by musicians as diverse as Wilco , the Shins , Arcade Fire , the Decemberists , Dashboard Confessional , Bright Eyes , the White Stripes , even a rapper like Lupe Fiasco , is as good -- and often better -- as the music of my generation , Rock 's so - called golden age .
So why were the biggest tours of 2007 those of the Police , Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band , and the Eagles -- and that does n't even count the Led Zeppelin reunion -- all of them eligible for AARP membership ?
Surely it is n't just Boomers filling those big halls to wallow in nostalgia .
So why are people still showing up to see these guys , or stripping the Starbuck 's rack of the new Paul McCartney album ?
The obvious answer is that these bands are good .
Really good .
If Jimmy Page , Joe Walsh and Nils Lofgren were great guitarists in 1980 , how good must they be after a quarter century more of practicing and gigging ?
And if Sir Paul , Brian Wilson and Don Henley can still ( pretty much ) hit those high notes , how much richer must their vocals be with decades more wisdom behind them ?
That , I think , is where modern medicine comes in .
Until just the last decade , most singers -- from Satch to Ella to Crosby to Clooney -- began to sound old by age 55 .
Elvis seemed ancient in his forties .
Many had health problems , most had to change their style to match their growing physical limitations .
They sounded different -- short of breadth , limited in range , talking as much as singing -- and as time went on , that made them increasingly obsolete to all but true fans .
But that no longer seems the case : if you do n't manage to overdose or drink yourself to death at a young age , and take reasonable care of yourself in middle age , nowadays you can probably still be performing at a very high level of virtuosity well into your seventh decade -- and longer .
And what time has taken away from you -- like Brian Wilson 's falsetto -- can now be restored on the computer ; meanwhile you 've gained all of the wisdom and experience of those years to add a depth to your music that would have been impossible as a callow youth .
A few years ago I interviewed John Lee Hooker .
He was well into his 80s , but still sartorially resplendent in a sharkskin suit , sunglasses and homburg .
Had he stayed in the Delta , or working in that Detroit automobile plant , he would have been a very decrepit old man .
Instead , he handed me his newest CD , recorded with Carlos Santana .
B.B. King , despite his diabetes and the need to perform while sitting down , is still robust at an age when Muddy Waters was long in the grave .
Johnny Cash 's last recordings are among his greatest .
And who believes that Keith Richards would still be alive without modern science ?
Like the rest of us , musicians are living longer , they 're taking better care of themselves -- and when they do n't , modern medicine can often correct their mistakes .
So can recording engineers .
Add to that the rise of MP3 players and shared music files , which makes old music now seem indistinguishable from new ; after a digital clean - up , Love 's " Alone Again Or " sounds like a new release , while Amy Winehouse could be a rediscovered singer from the 1940s .
And suddenly age seems a minor factor .
So , it 's not only unsurprising , but actually welcome news , that the Stones have a new concert film coming out directed by Martin Scorsese , that Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks are teaming up once again on a new concept album , and Steve Miller is back in the studio .
But wo n't this crowd out the younger generations of musicians ?
Not in the age of iTunes and YouTube .
And , in the long run this can only be good news for younger musicians .
I wo n't live long enough to see it ( or maybe I will … ) , but it 'll be fun in thirty years for Tad and his generation to take their kids to see Robert Pollard in a long white beard leading a reunited Guided by Voices through a 200 - song medley , or Eddy Vedder looking just like Neil Young today , or a group of anonymous old senior citizens taking the stage as the reformed Pavement .
And I 'll bet they 'll all sound better than ever .

The State Department has interceded in a congressional investigation of Blackwater USA , the private security firm accused of killing Iraqi civilians last week , ordering the company not to disclose information about its Iraq operations without approval from the Bush administration , according to documents revealed Tuesday .
In a letter sent to a senior Blackwater executive Thursday , a State Department contracting official ordered the company “ to make no disclosure of the documents or information ” about its work in Iraq without permission .
The letter and other documents were released Tuesday by Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) , whose House committee has launched wide - ranging investigations into contractor abuses and corruption in Iraq .
The State Department order and other steps it has taken to limit congressional access to information have set up a confrontation between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Waxman , who has repeatedly accused the State Department of impeding his inquiries .
Advertisement
In his own letter to Rice on Tuesday , Waxman called her department ’s latest efforts to withhold information from the committee “ extraordinary ” and “ unusual . ”
“ Congress has the constitutional prerogative to examine the impacts of corruption within the Iraqi ministries and the activities of Blackwater , ” Waxman wrote .
“ You are wrong to interfere with the committee ’s inquiry . ”
In response to Waxman ’s letter , Kiazan Moneypenny , a senior contracting officer in the State Department ’s office of acquisition management , appeared to soften the department ’s stand , saying later Tuesday that it would allow Blackwater to hand over unclassified documents .
Classified documents still would be subject to State Department review .
The committee has accused the administration of using secrecy designations to keep bad news about Iraq out of the hands of Congress .

The firm ’s contract
The State Department ’s order to Blackwater last week cited a provision in the North Carolina security firm ’s contract that makes all records produced by the company in Iraq property of the U.S. government , and prohibits the company from releasing documents without State Department approval .
Waxman had sought information about Blackwater ’s contract with the State Department , under which it provides nearly 1,000 armed guards to protect U.S. diplomats when they travel outside Baghdad ’s Green Zone .

The request was part of a probe into a Sept. 16 incident in which at least 11 Iraqis were killed after Blackwater employees protecting a U.S. Embassy convoy opened fire .
The incident enraged the Iraqi government , which accused the firm of routinely shooting civilians with impunity .
L. Paul Bremer III , the former U.S. administrator for Iraq , granted contractors immunity from prosecution in an order he signed the day before handing over sovereignty in June 2004 .
A preliminary Iraqi investigation said the shootings occurred without provocation ; Blackwater and the State Department said the convoy was ambushed and the guards opened fire after being attacked .

Hearing scheduled
Waxman has scheduled a Blackwater hearing for next Tuesday , but Blackwater ’s attorneys warned the committee that the State Department ’s letter may complicate company executives ’ testimony .
“ In the fluid setting of a congressional hearing it may become difficult , if not impossible , for Blackwater personnel to meet the terms of ” the State Department finding , wrote Stephen M. Ryan , an attorney advising Blackwater in the congressional investigation .

“ This contractual direction from the [ State Department ] is unambiguous . ”
A company spokeswoman said Tuesday that Blackwater interpreted the State Department ’s apparent shift Tuesday as permission to release documents sought by Waxman .
The State Department has repeatedly defended Blackwater in the aftermath of the Sept. 16 incident .
After a brief ban on diplomatic travel outside the Green Zone , department officials have resumed trips under Blackwater guard and have said that the company ’s status has not changed .
In his letter to Rice , Waxman also objected to a move by the department to bar its officials from speaking with committee investigators about corruption inside the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .

An e-mail received by the committee Monday night indicated that the State Department was treating information about corruption as classified , suggesting it might undermine bilateral relations .
“ The scope of this prohibition is breathtaking , ” Waxman wrote .
“ On its face , it means that unless the committee agrees to keep the information secret from the public . . . the committee cannot obtain information about whether Mr. Maliki himself has been involved in corruption or has intervened to block corruption investigations . ”
Waxman said that previous official reports of corruption within Iraqi ministries were treated as “ sensitive but unclassified . ”
The State Department retroactively classified the reports after his committee requested them , Waxman said .

Will Copper - Stealing Meth Heads Jack Up the Price of Your Almonds ?
In today ’s New York Times , Jennifer Steinhauer writes about California farmers whose irrigation systems are being stripped of their copper wiring , presumably by methamphetamine addicts who sell the metal in the recycling market :
Theft of scrap metal , mostly copper , has vexed many areas of American life and industry for the last 18 months , fueled largely by record - level prices for copper resulting from a building boom in Asia . …
Thieves have stripped the wires out of phone lines , pulled plaques off cemetery plots , raided air - conditioning systems in schools and yanked catalytic converters from cars , all to be resold to scrap metal recyclers . …
But perhaps no group has been as been as consistently singled out as California farmers .
The article is uniformly interesting , even though there seems to be little hard evidence that a ) it ’s really meth heads who are primarily doing the stealing ; and b ) that farmers are really the hardest - hit group of victims .
But it does make sense that farms are more vulnerable to this kind of theft than , say , construction sites , which probably have a lot more security on average .
So if the price of almonds , tomatoes , melons , and pistachios starts to climb in the coming months , remember : it was the Chinese building boom that fueled the demand for copper that led the meth addicts ( maybe ) to cripple the irrigation systems that damaged the crops that drove down the supply , which led to higher prices in the supermarket .
Or , the shorter version : when in doubt , blame the Chinese .
The next time you 're invited to a party but afraid to go , try approaching this : shyness may affect up to 40 percent of the population , but it does n't have to be a life sentence .
People can overcome their shyness with preparation followed by slowly engaging themselves in new social situations , according to psychologists .
Perhaps it comes as no surprise that one of the world 's foremost experts in shyness , Bernardo Carducci , has battled with shyness himself .
" I had lots of friends , but I had no dates , " Carducci , the director of the Indiana University Southeast Shyness Research Institute , said of his youth .
Shyness is " something that I work at . "
Recipes for shyness
Carducci says that despite beliefs to the contrary , shyness is not completely hardwired .
This is because shyness requires a sense of self — which develops only after about 18 months of age .
It involves feelings of excessive self - consciousness , negative self - evaluation and negative self - preoccupation , he explained .
" Shy people operate as if thy have a mirror in front of them all the time , " he told LiveScience .
Genes do , however , seem to play a role .
About 15 percent of babies are born with what is called an " inhibited temperament " — meaning that they react stressfully to new experiences .
They might cower at the sound of a bursting balloon , for instance .
And if one identical twin is shy , the other also is likely to be shy , said Jonathan Cheek , a psychologist at Wellesley College in Massachusetts .
" This does not mean that shyness is predetermined by inheritance , or that it cannot be overcome , " Cheek said , " but simply that some people are born more susceptible to becoming shy than are others . "
A shy disposition
In a nutshell , shy people want to be outgoing and friendly , but can't seem to figure out how to do it , Carducci said .
They are also slow to " warm up " in new social situations , partly because they are so self - conscious .
" They 'll go to a social function , but if they 're not comfortable within 10 minutes , they 'll turn and they 'll run , " Carducci said .
Finally , shy people tend to have what Carducci calls a " limited comfort zone . "
They may be social and have friends , but they tend to do the same things over and over again with the same small circle of people , rather than exposing themselves to new social situations .
Carducci points out , however , that shyness is not related to self - esteem .
People can be confident in certain aspects of their lives — they may be able to give presentations in front of hundreds of people — but the thought of making small talk with a stranger might make them extremely anxious .
Do n't be shy of a cure
There are a number of approaches to overcoming their shyness .
One is through relaxation training .
People might try imagining themselves in different social situations while taking slow , deep breaths to keep calm , said Cheek , the Wellesley psychologist .
They can also work to slowly expand their comfort zone , Carducci said .
He suggested volunteering as a good way to do this .
" When you volunteer , [ people ] do n't really care your level of skill ; they 're just after your time , so there 's no critical self - evaluation , " he explained .
It 's also important to overcome shyness one step at a time , according to both psychologists .
For instance , " if a shy man wants to ask a woman he sees at work out on a date , his first goal might be to have a brief conversation with her about some work - related topic , " Cheek said .
Before doing so , he should practice the conversation with a friend or a counselor , Cheek said .
Then the second time the shy guy speaks to the woman , he could talk about something a bit more personal , until eventually , he feels comfortable asking her out on a date .
People should also realize that " they need not take all the responsibility for any failure they might encounter , " Cheek said .
" Sometimes another person is unresponsive for reasons that have nothing to do with the shy person . "

We all have a finite amount of time to live , and within that mortal countdown we devote some fraction towards our work .
Even for the most career - focused , your life will be filled by many things beyond work : supporting your family , children , exercise , being a mentor and a mentee , hobbies , and so the list goes on .
This is the sign of a rich life , but one side - effect is that time to do your work will become increasingly scarce as you get deeper into your career .
The world 's largest telescope starts using its complex structure of mirrors today to scour the outer reaches of the universe for planets similar to our own and to seek clues to help explain the origins of life .
Set on a mountain on an Atlantic island , far enough from human habitation to get a clear view of the night sky , the Great Canary Telescope carries with it the hopes of scientists who believe clues to understanding our world can be found in as yet unseen parts of the universe .
The telescope will , in effect , peer back in time as it picks up light emitted long ago in other parts of the universe .
A powerful array of 36 separate mirrors form a single mirror that is 10.4 metres ( 34ft ) wide , 4 % larger than the Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
The GTC 's powerful eye will penetrate dense , cold molecular " clouds " to watch stars being born and will seek out the most distant galaxies and quasars .
" The GTC will be able to see the weakest and most distant celestial objects in the universe , " said a spokesman for the telescope 's owners , who include the Spanish government and the regional government of the Canary Islands .
" It will be able to capture the birth of new stars , study in greater depth the characteristics of black holes and decipher the chemical compounds that appeared after the Big Bang .
One of its most emblematic objectives is to find planets similar to our own in other stellar systems . "
The telescope is set on a peak 2,400 metres above the Canary island of La Palma , sitting on a " sea of clouds " , with the skies above it kept clear by the Atlantic trade winds .
Although battered by winds and , on occasions , snow and ice , the peak , known as the Roque de Los Muchachos , is one of the best spots for gazing at the night sky .
The quality of the skies above the Canary Islands is protected , and has drawn 62 astronomy institutes to the islands .
Construction of the € 130 m ( £ 88 m ) telescope has taken seven years , hampered by poor weather and the fact that each delicately engineered piece has to be driven up a winding road to the peak .
The GTC will stand on its own , bucking a trend for building telescopes in groups to multiply viewing strength .
" The GTC will be the biggest telescope in the world , " said the project manager , Pedro Alvarez .
" It will observe things that are so small , or so very far off , that only a small amount of light reaches us .
It will also see closer objects that either do not emit their own light or emit very little light .
You need the biggest possible light - collecting surface to be able to see them . "
A steel protective shell and " indestructible " concrete bunker protect the new telescope from the elements .

Wiley S. Drake , a Buena Park pastor and a former national leader of the Southern Baptist Convention , called on his followers to pray for the deaths of two leaders of Americans United for Separation of Church and State .
The request was in response to the liberal group ’s urging the IRS on Tuesday to investigate Drake ’s church ’s nonprofit status because Drake endorsed former Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee for president on church letterhead and during a church - affiliated Internet radio show .
Drake said Wednesday he was “ simply doing what God told me to do ” by targeting Americans United officials Joe Conn and Jeremy Leaming , whom he calls the “ enemies of God . ”
“ God says to pray imprecatory prayer against people who attack God ’s church , ” he said .
“ The Bible says that if anybody attacks God ’s people , David said this is what will happen to them .
. . .
Children will become orphans and wives will become widows . ”

Imprecatory prayers are alternately defined as praying for someone ’s misfortune , or an appeal to God for justice .
“ Let his days be few ; and let another take his office , ” the prayer reads .
“ Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow . ”
Conn said he was “ startled ” at Drake ’s reaction to the complaint against Drake ’s First Southern Baptist Church of Buena Park .
“ We expected him to try to defend his actions , ” Conn said .
“ Instead he goes on spiritual blitzkrieg against us , praying for our destruction .
He completely glossed over the fact that his actions are clearly a violation of federal tax law . ”

Drake is a long - time Orange County evangelical preacher who frequently captures the spotlight .
In the 1990s , he protested “ Gay Day ” at Disneyland and a 2 Live Crew concert as obscene , and also fought Buena Park city officials who tried to stop him from sheltering homeless people on church grounds .
He gained national prominence in 2006 , serving a year - long term as the second vice president of the 42,000 - church Southern Baptist Convention .
In 2006 , Drake received a stern warning from the group ’s top lawyer for creating a Southern Baptist Convention letterhead and using it to endorse Republican Dick Mountjoy of California in his unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate .
Drake confirmed Wednesday that he endorsed Huckabee for president Aug. 11 in a news release on church letterhead , and on his radio show Aug. 13 .
But he said those statements should not jeopardize the church ’s nonprofit status .

“ I said I personally endorse Mike Huckabee , ” he said .
“ And yes , I used my letterhead .
I use it to pay my bills , write my mother , that ’s who I am .
I am a spokesman for the church , but I was speaking personally .
I did encourage my fellow Southern Baptists and fellow Christians to ask God what they could do for Mike Huckabee .
And whatever God told them to do , that ’s what they should do . ”
As tax - exempt organizations , churches are barred from campaigning for candidates .
The IRS has previously investigated churches for perceived political activity .
A sermon before the 2004 presidential election by a former rector at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena prompted an IRS probe that is unresolved .
IRS officials declined to comment Wednesday regarding Americans United ’s complaint against the First Southern Baptist Church .
Drake said he was not concerned about a possible investigation by the federal agency .
“ I have never have been worried about the IRS , ” he said .
“ They do n’t scare me .
I do n’t give a rip about the IRS .
I do n’t believe in the separation of church and state and I believe the IRS should stay out of church business . ”

Drake said he endorsed Huckabee because of his religious qualifications .
“ Mike Huckabee is a born - again Christian , ” Drake said , “ And I believe in the final countdown for him , he will do what God told him to do .
He is a God-fearing man and he ’d fear God more than his constituents and more than the Constitution . ”

Using Google Analytics to subvert privacy
Marcin decided to take the day off with pay and allow me to share with you a guest blog post .
Thanks , Marcin !
Hello , my name is Andre and I 'm a blogoholic .
On with the post !
With the popularity of MySpace also came the desire to track others who look at one 's profile .
MySpace trackers came in mass , and much of the world was introduced to web analytics .
Around the same time , Google made a purchase that would affect the webiverse forever .
The availability of Google Analytics allows anyone to track almost any information on any visitors to their content .
Free up to 5 M entries per day , with sampling also available as an option ( plus this goes unlimited if combined with a Google Adwords account ) - GA is a simple way for any web administrator to get statistics on their eyeballs .
But what problems does GA introduce for privacy ?
Can it be abused ?
How will regular users protect their identities and personal information in light of such a Big Brother move ?
How bad is this problem ?
I became interested in GA after seeing it pop-up in my NoScript alert boxes constantly , on almost every website that I visit .
I also see it in CookieSafe ( I 've disabled cookies globally , i.e. all 1st and 3rd party cookies ) .
In this way , GA can't track my activity .
Or can it ?
One thing I learned recently is that anyone can download urchin.js ( the Javascript code that activates GA ) and host it on their own website .
< src= " https://www.tssci-security.com/localurchin.js " type =" text / javascript " > </ script > < script type=" text / javascript " ></ script > _uacct = " UA - 12345 -0 " ; urchinTracker ( ) ; </ script >
By forcing users to use Javascript ( and 1st party cookies ) to be able to login to your website , you can then throw your localurchin.js file into your web pages after login .
I often turn on Javascript when I have to login to a particular website so this would even catch the most careful of users .
Worse , GA can be configured with their custom segmentation framework .
This allows one of the GA cookies , __utmv , to be filled with any data that the web administrator wants .
In this example , using __utmSetVar ( ) and HTML forms - the web administrator can store username , email address , and the user 's real name :
function setSegment ( f ) { var s1 = f.username.options[f.username.selectedIndex].value ; var s2 = f.email.options[f.email.selectedIndex].value ; var s3 = f.realname.options[f.realname.selectedIndex].value ; __utmSetVar(s1 + ':' + s2 + ':' + s3 ) ; return true ; }
< form onSubmit= " javascript:setSegment(this.form ) ; " >
User Name : < input name = " username " type = " text " />
Email : < input name = " email " type = " text " />
Full Name : < input name = " realname " type = " text " /> < input type =" submit " /> </ form >
This code is certainly against the privacy policies of Google .
In order to maintain some sanity and comply with industry standards in privacy , Google has restricted these cookies to a default of 6 months lifetime .
I 'm not sure , but it appears that one can modify the _ucto value before starting _urchintracker ( ) and set _ucto to something higher than 6 months ( the default value , 15768000 , is measured in seconds ) .
Certain obfuscation practices such as rot13 , base64 , or even encryption of these fields could allow storage in the GA system .
What will Google 's policymakers do to prevent this from happening ?
Other interesting fields could also be stored , such as the actual HTTP referrer fields .
You 'll likely want to turn these on in your logs as well .
Here 's how ( in Apache httpd.conf format ) : LogFormat " %h %l %u %t \ " %r\ " %>s %b \ " %{ Accept}i\ " \ " %{ Accept - Encoding}i\ " \ " %{ Host}i\ " \ " %{Connection}i\ " \ " %{ Referer}i\ " \ " %{ User - Agent}i\ " " combined LogFormat " %h %l %u %t \ " %r\ " %>s % b " common LogFormat " % {Referer}i -> %U " referer
I 'm not exactly sure how to prevent this kind of abusive behavior ( besides to not use Google ) .
I try to be cautious about how I use the web , but this could make it very easy for global abuse .
It can put a lot of power into the wrong hands , so to say .
What is Google going to do about it ?
Not much because they stand to benefit from it most ( ever looked at your google.com cookies ? ) .
A few weeks ago , Marcin posted a blog about safe browsing .
One of the best ways to prevent GA from tracking you is to prevent all cookies using a toolset like CookieSafe ( Marcin mentions CS Lite ) and block all cookies globally , allowing only those sites that you implicitly trust .
Using the Firefox Web developer toolbar wth Information -> View Javascript , you can look for potential localurchin.js code insertions .
Javascript obfuscation can make this more complicated , but fortunately there are some writeups that cover decoding javascript .
By browsing with safety in mind , you can prevent your web activities from being tracked and your personal information stored along with your daily ( and not so daily ) web routines .
It 's trivial to add support of click tracking and multi-site click tracking using GA .
Most of the material and code from this post was taken from a new " short cut " book appropriately called Google Analytics .

Certainly this was the case with my grandfather , among whose effects , after he died in 1980 , we were shocked to find a cache of desperate letters from an older brother in Poland , written throughout 1939 , begging for money , affidavits for visas , anything to save him and his family — or indeed , save any or all of his four teenage daughters , girls around Anne Frank ’s age .
That my grandfather never mentioned this correspondence to us was an indication of the shattering guilt he must have felt at not having been able to help his family .
It was a feeling shared by many Jews in America after the war , who are likely to have kept such feelings similarly hidden from their children and grandchildren .
As with any genre , such letters had their characteristic tropes .
There ’s the uneasy opening , hovering between an emphasis on the writer ’s desperate situation and an awkward acknowledgment that his relationship to the addressee is perhaps not of recent vintage .
To an old college friend Otto Frank wrote , “ I would not ask if conditions here would not force me to do all I can in time to be able to avoid worse ... Perhaps you remember that we have two girls . ”
A similarly agonizing tension colors the letters of my great - uncle , Samuel Jäger .
“ You ’ll be wondering ... why I ’m writing to you after so many years , ” one of them begins , although he soon gives the reason in this and many other letters : “ From reading the papers you know a little about what the Jews are going through here , but what you know is just one one - hundredth of it . ”
There is , too , the painful appeal for money .
Otto Frank , we learn from the new documents , needed a $ 5,000 deposit to obtain a visa .
“ You are the only person I know that I can ask , ” he wrote his college friend .
“ Would it be possible for you to give a deposit in my favor ? ”
Virtually the same stiff entreaty echoes eerily through my great - uncle ’s letter to a rich cousin : “ Many families have already emigrated to America provided that their families there put down a $ 5,000 deposit ... perhaps you could manage to advance me the deposit . ”
My relative added , with a poignant naïveté , that his next letter would be addressed to Franklin Roosevelt himself — a futility that the more sophisticated , better - connected Otto Frank knew enough to spare himself .
Above all , such letters demonstrate movingly the overriding preoccupation that nothing was as important as saving the children .
“ It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for , ” Otto Frank wrote .
“ If only the world were open and I ’d been able to send a child to America or Palestine , it would be easier , ” my great - uncle mourned as he started losing hope .
Even after seven decades , such expressions of personal tenderness by people in the process of being overwhelmed by the tsunamis of history cannot fail to move us .
Expressions of the personal in the face of seemingly impersonal forces — reminders that each of the millions who were lost was , indeed , a recognizable person — are what made Anne Frank and her family famous in the first place .
Now , as the voices of those who would deny or diminish the Holocaust grow louder with each passing year , drowning out the fading chorus of the witnesses and survivors , the equally human voice of her father , audible once more , will similarly draw the world ’s attention to parts of the drama that took place an ocean away from the secret annex : in particular , to the appalling failure by the United States to do more for would - be immigrants .
( Among other things , Frank ’s letters are a concrete reminder of the crushing diplomatic obstacles facing would - be immigrants , a fatal Catch - 22 that even American diplomats at the time were shamed by . )

Shakespeare 's plays are being rewritten as comic strips for pupils who find his poetry boring , it emerged today .
Thousands of teenagers are to study cartoon versions of famous plays such as Macbeth which reduce finely - crafted passages to snappy phrases .
The publishers hope the comics - illustrated by artists who have worked on the Spiderman series - will inspire disaffected readers with a love of the Bard 's plays .

But the Queen 's English Society warned that " dumbed down " versions could backfire by allowing pupils to avoid tackling the language and themes of the originals .
The firm behind the initiative , Classical Comics , will launch its first comic book plays next term .
They are targeted at older primary pupils and teenagers and have already won the backing of the National Association for the Teaching of English .
Three versions of each play will be produced to help teachers cater to children of differing literacy abilities , .
The first uses Shakespeare 's own words , the second translates them into plain English while the third is a " quick text " version and uses as few words as possible .
In Henry V , the king 's rallying call to his troops - " once more unto the breach , dear friends " - is one of the Bard 's most unforgettable lines .
Yet in the " quick text " version , the phrase is followed by " take a deep breath and fight " and " get a fierce look in your eyes " .
Lady Macbeth 's call to her wavering husband " But screw your courage to the sticking place , And we 'll not fail " is changed to " We 're not fail . "

The firm hopes to print 10,000 copies of each version of its first comic play , Henry V .
Macbeth should be ready next year and there are also plans in the pipeline for Romeo and Juliet , as well as classic novels including Jane Eyre and Great Expectations .
The firm hopes eventually to publish comic strip versions of all Shakespeare 's plays .
But there were warnings the trened for simplifying literature could be fuelling the growth of howlers and colloquialisms in students ' exam papers .
Examiners have complained students discuss Shakespeare 's plays as if they were TV soap operas and pepper their essays with conversational cliches and references to popular culture .
Dr Bernard Lamb , chairman of the London branch of the Queen 's English Society , said : " Pupils may just enjoy the cartoons and not connect it with Shakespeare and they wo n't be much of a contribution to education .
" I am sure they are already well - versed in cartoon characters and comic strips , so it would be good for them to get away from theat and study something a bit more serious .
" A lot of the beauty of Shakespeare is in the language more than the plot .
" There is probably limited use for such things , for example with lower streams who may show some interest in simplified cartoon versions but I would certainly not want to see these generally introduced . "
Dr Lamb added : " There is so much dumbing down all round .
Students are unaware of what language is appropriate in different circumstances .
I have had students in degree exams using ' eight ' for ' ate ' . "

But Clive Bryant , chairman of Classical Comics , insisted the shortened versions of his plays would give youngster a " leg up " to enjoying the originals .
" We want to make Shakespeare as energetic and colourful as Spiderman " he told the Times Educational Supplement .
" Teachers tell us they are desperate for something exciting to use in the classroom , but if you ask kids about Shakespeare the word they usually come back with is ' boring ' .
" We 're trying to break down the barriers so they can get interested . "
Ian McNeilly , director of the National Association for the Teaching of English , said : " This is a fun way of getting into the stories .
" Plays are not meant to be read , but to be seen .
The illustrations in these books are an easy way of following what is going on .
" The genius of Shakespeare is in the language , but for some students understanding it can be a struggle .
It will be useful for teachers to have three different versions of the text . "
He added : " It is a nine - month project for the artists - it is a big commitment . "

Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2007 ]
LOOK OVER THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FOLLOWING TWO HOUSES AND SEE IF YOU CAN TELL WHICH BELONGS TO AN ENVIRONMENTALIST .
HOUSE # 1 : A 20 - room mansion ( not including 8 bathrooms ) heated by natural gas .
Add on a pool ( and a pool house ) and a separate guest house all heated by gas .
In ONE MONTH ALONE this mansion consumes more energy than the average American household in an ENTIRE YEAR .
The average bill for electricity and
natural gas runs over $ 2,400.00 per month .
In natural gas alone ( which last time we checked was a fossil fuel ) , this property consumes more than 20 times the national average for an American home .
This house is not in a northern or Midwestern “ snow belt , ” either .
It ’s in the South .
HOUSE # 2 : Designed by an architecture professor at a leading national university , this house incorporates every “ green ” feature current home construction can provide .
The house contains only 4,000 square feet ( 4 bedrooms ) and is nestled on arid high prairie in the American southwest .
A central closet in the house holds geothermal heat pumps drawing ground water through pipes sunk 300 feet into the ground .
The water ( usually 67 degrees F. )
heats the house in winter and cools it in summer .
The system uses no fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas , and it consumes 25 % of the electricity required for a conventional heating / cooling system .
Rainwater
from the roof is collected and funneled into a 25,000 gallon underground cistern .
Wastewater from showers , sinks and toilets goes into underground purifying tanks and then into the cistern .
The collected water then irrigates the land surrounding the house .
Flowers and shrubs native to the area blend the property into the surrounding rural landscape .
HOUSE # 1 ( 20 room energy guzzling mansion ) is outside of Nashville , Tennessee .
It is the abode of that renowned environmentalist ( and filmmaker ) Al Gore.
HOUSE # 2 ( model eco-friendly house ) is on a ranch near Crawford , Texas .
Also known as “ the Texas White House , ” it is the private residence of the President of the United States , George W. Bush .
So whose house is gentler on the environment ?
Yet another story you WON ’T hear on CNN , CBS , ABC , NBC , MSNBC or read about in the New York Times or the Washington Post .
Indeed , for Mr. Gore , it ’s truly “ an inconvenient truth . ”
Origins :
This e-mail comparison between the homes of President George W. Bush and former vice - president Al Gore began circulating on the Internet in March 2007 ( shortly after the latter ’s film on the global warming issue , An Inconvenient Truth , won an Academy Award as Best Documentary ) .
Short and sweet , there ’s a fair bit of truth to the e-mail : Al Gore ’s Nashville mansion is something of the energy - gobbler the e-mail depicts , while President Bush ’s Crawford ranch is more the model of responsible resource use the juxtaposition portrays it to be .
According to the Associated Press , the Gore ’s 10,000 square foot Belle Meade residence consumes electricity at a rate of about 12 times the average for a typical house in Nashville ( 191,000 kwh versus 15,600 kwh ) .
While there are mitigating factors ( further discussed in our article about the Gore household ’s energy use ) , this is still a surprising number , given that the residence is approximately four times the size of the average new American home .
The Prairie Chapel Ranch ranch home owned by George W. Bush in Crawford , Texas , was designed by Austin architect David Heymann , an associate dean for undergraduate programs at the University of Texas School of Architecture .
As the Chicago Tribune described the house in a 2001 article :
The 4,000 - square - foot house is a model of environmental rectitude .
Geothermal heat pumps located in a central closet circulate water through pipes buried 300 feet deep in the ground where the temperature is a constant 67 degrees ; the water heats the house in the winter and cools it in the summer .
Systems such as the one in this “ eco-friendly ” dwelling use about 25 % of the electricity that traditional heating and cooling systems utilize .
A 25,000 - gallon underground cistern collects rainwater gathered from roof runs ; wastewater from sinks , toilets and showers goes into underground purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern .
The water from the cistern is used to irrigate the landscaping surrounding the four - bedroom home .
Plants and flowers native to the high prairie area blend the structure into the surrounding ecosystem .
Other news articles published in 2001 - 02 provided expanded descriptions of the ranch house :
“ By marketplace standards , the house is startlingly small , ” says David Heymann , the architect of the 4,000 - square - foot home .
Constructed from a local limestone , the house has eight rooms in a long , narrow design to take advantage of views and breezes .
A porch stretches across the back and both ends of the house , widening at one end into a covered patio off the living room .
The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch .
When it rains , it ’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet .
Under a gravel border around the house , a concrete gutter channels the water into a 25,000 - gallon cistern for irrigation .
In hot weather , a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area .
Wastewater from showers , sinks and toilets goes into purifying tanks underground — one tank for water from showers and bathroom sinks , which is so - called “ gray water , ” and one tank for “ black water ” from the kitchen sink and toilets .
The purified water is funneled to the cistern with the rainwater .
It is used to irrigate flower gardens , newly planted trees and a larger flower and herb garden behind the two - bedroom guesthouse .
Water for the house comes from a well .
The Bushes installed a geothermal heating and cooling system , which uses about 25 % of the electricity that traditional heating and air - conditioning systems consume .
Several holes were drilled 300 feet deep , where the temperature is a constant 67 degrees .
Pipes connected to a heat pump inside the house circulate water into the ground , then back up and through the house , heating it in winter and cooling it in summer .
The water for the outdoor pool is heated with the same system , which proved so efficient that initial plans to install solar energy panels were cancelled .
The features are environment - friendly , but the reason for them was practical — to save money and to save water , which is scarce in this dry , hot part of Texas .
A second look at the then - circulating e-mail in June 2009 revealed that many of the material facts of the claim were then out - of - date :
The e-mail has become dated , however .
The now - former president Bush has moved into a new home in Preston Hollow , Texas , that is about 8,000 square feet – double the size of his Crawford ranch .
[ Gore spokesperson Kalee ]
Kreider also told us in an e-mail that the Gores have made several eco-friendly changes to their home , which is now LEED certified .
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council , this means that Gores ’ home has earned credits in five categories : “ sustainable sites , water efficiency , energy and atmosphere , materials and resources and indoor environmental quality . ” …
Kreider also noted that , contrary to what was claimed in the original e-mail , the Gores ’ residence “ does not have a guest house . ”
We did n’t ask for the Gores ’ electric bills , so we ca n’t say how much efficiency improvement the family has accomplished .
But the e-mail was on target in 2007 ; it ’s out of date now .
( NOTE :
The floor plans shown at the web site westernwhitehouse.org are not accurate reproductions of the size and layout Bush ’s Prairie Chapel Ranch house .
They are elements of a parody . )
In the United States , opposition to the teaching of evolution in public schools has largely been fueled by the religious right , particularly Protestant fundamentalism .
Now another voice is entering the debate , in dramatic fashion .
It is the voice of Adnan Oktar of Turkey , who , under the name Harun Yahya , has produced numerous books , videos and DVDs on science and faith , in particular what he calls the “ deceit ” inherent in the theory of evolution .
One of his books , “ Atlas of Creation , ” is turning up , unsolicited , in mailboxes of scientists around the country and members of Congress , and at science museums in places like Queens and Bemidji , Minn .
At 11 x 17 inches and 12 pounds , with a bright red cover and almost 800 glossy pages , most of them lavishly illustrated , “ Atlas of Creation ” is probably the largest and most beautiful creationist challenge yet to Darwin ’s theory , which Mr. Yahya calls a feeble and perverted ideology contradicted by the Koran .
In bowing to Scripture , Mr. Yahya resembles some fundamentalist creationists in the United States .
But he is not among those who assert that Earth is only a few thousand years old .
The principal argument of “ Atlas of Creation , ” advanced in page after page of stunning photographs of fossil plants , insects and animals , is that creatures living today are just like creatures that lived in the fossil past .
Ergo , Mr. Yahya writes , evolution must be impossible , illusory , a lie , a deception or “ a theory in crisis . ”
Philosophy Models of Collapse : Ingenuity , Complexity , and Feedback By Ryan McGreal
Published January 17 , 2007
In his remarkable book The Ingenuity Gap , Thomas Homer - Dixon argues that as societies confront crises involving complex systems , they need the right kinds of ingenuity at the right times to solve those crises .
The danger , in Homer - Dixon 's opinion , is that our problems are growing ever more complex and the right kinds of ingenuity might not continue to be available .
Converging crises could overwhelm our capacity to respond appropriately .
By contrast , Joseph Tainter argues in The Collapse of Complex Societies that such an event should be understood more specifically ; he argues that societies respond to crises by adding complexity , and that complexity is subject to the law of diminishing returns .
Eventually , the marginal returns on added complexity turn negative , and since the society only knows how to add complexity in response to its problems , it starts to collapse under its own weight .
Diminishing Returns in Health Care Spending
Over the past several decades , real spending on health care per capita and as a share of GDP has increased steadily in the United States , but the rate of life expenctancy growth to health expenditures has been falling steadily and is now close to zero .
That is , life expectancy is still growing ( for now ) , but much more slowly than spending .
For the sake of this example , I borrowed a measure from Joseph Tainter and defined health care productivity as combined life expectancy divided by real ( inflation - adjusted ) per capita health care spending , plotting it from 1970 to 2003 ( I chose this period based on the fact that health care spending data were readily available ) .
Per Capita US Health Care Spending Productivity by Year , 1970 - 2003 ( Data sources : US National Center for Health Statistics for life expectancy , and OECD Health Data 2006 for health care spending )
As you can see , the impact that increased health care spending has had on increased life expectancy has fallen steadily .
In other words , additional spending on health care is subject to the law of diminishing returns .
Many health experts predict that the North American lifestyle of low physical activity and copious amounts of processed fatty , sugary , salty foods will soon result in life expectancy at birth falling for the first time - a negative return on the complexity of our food production , transportation , and entertainment systems .
Measuring Complexity
While Homer - Dixon 's book is qualitative and multi-disciplinary , drawing examples from a number of fields to illustrate his arguments , Tainter 's book is more quantitative , positing a way to measure social complexity for the purpose of analysis .
Just as Homer - Dixon believes it may be possible for society to produce ingenuity quickly enough and appropriately enough to stay ahead of its problems , Tainter believes technical innovations or discoveries of new energy sources can raise basic productivity enough to offset the cost of more complexity .
As long as the supply of energy and ideas grows faster than the level of complexity , then the society can still grow and fluorish .
For example , the Green Revolution of the 1960s and ' 70s was based on discoveries that allowed farmers to increase crop yields dramatically by supplementing - and ultimately replacing - organic processes with hydrocarbon inputs in the form of natural gas - based fertilizers , petroleum - based pesticides , petroleum - powered mechanical harvesters , food processing , and so on .
However , the sheer rate of hydrocarbon energy required to produce food energy is staggering in its inefficiency .
Richard Manning notes that it takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to produce one calorie of food energy .
When hydrocarbon production goes into decline , the effect on industrial farming will be devastating .
Similarly , sometimes an innovation can dramatically improve the productivity of the available energy .
The government - imposed regulations that followed the 1973 OPEC oil crisis , for another example , provoked significant improvements in fuel economy , and today the most fuel efficient cars are several times more economical than the most bloated SUVs .
( Nevertheless , thanks to loopholes in the regulations , a company like Ford has the same average fleet economy today that it had in 1908 . )
Feedback Systems
Still , both writers seem to agree that the right ideas at the right time can forestall disaster - perhaps indefinitely .
However , Jane Jacobs counters this cautious optimism with her last book Dark Age Ahead , in which she argues that the organized systems of feedback and response in our society - families , universities , the scientific establishment , governments , and professional bodies - are becoming too overburdened , corrupt , incompetent , and arrogant to do their job of stabilizing society against upsets .
Essentially , Jacobs agrees with Homer - Dixon and Tainter , but focuses on the role that mechanisms of awareness and decision - making play in a society 's survival or collapse .
She writes that societies fail when " confronted with such radical jolts in circumstances that their institutions cannot adapt adequately , become irrelevant , and are dropped . "
I would be misleading the reader if I failed to point out that Jacobs ' book is also ultimately hopeful : not only in the sense that she believes our stabilizing institutions can be reformed or replaced ( Homer - Dixon calls this ability to reinvent our institutions " social ingenuity " as opposed to " technical ingenuity " ) , but also in the larger sense that in the long continuity of humanity , dark ages come and go and the dark age that lies in wait for us is no different .
Tainter actually goes a step further , noting archaeological evidence from late Roman times that suggests nutrition actually improved after the empire collapsed and local wealth was no longer being siphoned off to prop up the central hierarchy .
This is in keeping with the thesis of Albert Bates in his recent book The Post - Petroleum Survival Guide and Cookbook ( read the RTH review ) that a radical de-complexifying of our hypertrophied , globalized society would improve quality of life for those individuals and communities prepared for the transition .

Here 's more from Donald Kagan , former Dean of Yale and father of Fred and Robert and father - in - law to Kimberly , in an article in the Yale Daily News :
[ Kagan 's ] keynote address centered on the importance of patriotism and national unity , and Kagan decried those who support withdrawing troops from Iraq in the near future .
Referencing a lecture he gave shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11 , he said Americans have a “ moral responsibility ” to support the government .
“ The war [ in Iraq ] is not lost , ” Kagan said .
“ [ Yet ] opponents have rushed to declare America defeated " ...
Sept. 11 has been designated “ Patriot Day , ” and Kagan opened his speech by saying he intended to focus on the concept of patriotism .
Citing America ’s role in World War II , the fall of the Soviet Union , the conflict in the Balkans and the removal of Saddam Hussein , Kagan painted an image of the United States as a force for freedom in the world .
“ America has been a beacon of liberty to the world since its creation , ” Kagan said .
As an advocate for freedom , the U.S. has earned its share of enemies , so Kagan said it has a special need for domestic unity and patriotism .
“ Few countries have been subjected to as much questioning … as our own , ” Kagan said , “ There should be a presupposition in favor of patriotism . ”
Americans who have questioned the United States ’ involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are unpatriotic , Kagan said , and are undermining the country ’s efforts to win the wars ...
That operation moved everything from AK - 47s , armored vehicles and plastic explosives to boots and Army uniforms , according to officials who were involved in it .
Her former colleagues recall Colonel Selph as a courageous officer who was willing to take substantial personal risks to carry out her mission and was unfailingly loyal to General Petraeus and his directives to move quickly in setting up the logistics operation .
“ She was kind of like the Pony Express of the Iraqi security forces , ” said Victoria Wayne , who was then deputy director of logistics for the overall Iraqi reconstruction program .
Still , Colonel Selph also ran into serious problems with a company she oversaw that failed to live up to a contract it had signed to carry out part of that logistics mission .
It is not clear exactly what Colonel Selph is being investigated for .
Colonel Selph , reached by telephone twice on Monday , said she would speak to reporters later but did not answer further messages left for her .
The enormous expenditures of American and Iraqi money on the Iraq reconstruction program , at least $ 40 billion over all , have been criticized for reasons that go well beyond the corruption cases that have been uncovered so far .
Weak oversight , poor planning and seemingly endless security problems have contributed to many of the program ’s failures .
The investigation into contracts for matériel to Iraqi soldiers and police officers is part of an even larger series of criminal cases .
As of Aug. 23 , there were a total of 73 criminal investigations related to contract fraud in Iraq , Kuwait and Afghanistan , Col. Dan Baggio , an Army spokesman said Monday .
Twenty civilians and military personnel have been charged in federal court as a result of the inquiries , he said .
The inquiries involve contracts valued at more than $ 5 billion , and Colonel Baggio said the charges so far involve more than $ 15 million in bribes .
Just last week , an Army major , his wife and his sister were indicted on charges that they accepted up to $ 9.6 million in bribes for Defense Department contracts in Iraq and Kuwait .
Allawi is contesting next month 's parliamentary elections
Such abuses are as bad today as they were under Saddam Hussein , Mr Allawi told Britain 's Observer newspaper .
His comments come two weeks after 170 detainees were found at an interior ministry centre , some allegedly suffering from abuse and starvation .
Iraq 's president dismissed Mr Allawi 's allegations , saying his government did not accept the torture of prisoners .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says Mr Allawi 's remarks come as Iraq prepares for parliamentary elections next month , which he hopes could see him return as prime minister .
His comments are likely to heat up the election debate and will go down well within the Sunni community , our correspondent adds .
' Contagious '
" People are doing the same as ( in ) Saddam Hussein 's time and worse , " Mr Allawi told the newspaper .
Iraq is the centrepiece of this region .
If things go wrong , neither Europe nor the United States will be safe
Iyad Allawi
" It is an appropriate comparison .
People are remembering the days of Saddam .
" These were the precise reasons that we fought Saddam Hussein , and now we are seeing the same things . "
Militias are operating within the Shia - led government , torturing and killing in secret bunkers , he said .
Mr Allawi - who was displaced earlier this year by Shia factions - said the militias had infiltrated the police , and warned that their influence could spread throughout the government .
Mr Allawi said that if urgent action was not taken " the disease infecting [ the interior ministry ] will become contagious and spread to all ministries and structures of Iraq 's government " .
He also warned of the danger of Iraq disintegrating in chaos .
" Iraq is the centrepiece of this region , " he said .
" If things go wrong , neither Europe nor the United States will be safe . "
Mr Allawi was Iraq 's first interim prime minister , but he failed to win January 's election which brought the current Prime Minister , Ibrahim al - Jaafari , to power .
He has since formed a coalition to run in next month 's parliamentary elections .
“ They ’re pulling themselves out of the market to regroup , ” is what one of my mortgage broker buddies told me on the phone this morning when I asked how in the heck Wells Fargo could raise rates on a 30 - year jumbo fixed rate mortgage from 6 7/8 % to 8 % overnight .
A jumbo is anything over $ 417,000 , and given today ’s home prices , that ’s going to hit an awful lot of borrowers .
So , since Bank of America , BB&T , Sovereign and others are still at the old rate , no borrower in their right mind would go to Wells Fargo .
My buddy says no biggee , Wells Fargo can afford to shut down its mortgage division for a while until all this shakes out .
Well , I think it ’s a biggee .
Then he tells me he got an email this morning from Vertice , which is part of Wachovia , saying :
Based on current market conditions , investor appetite and liquidity for Alt - A features , including higher LTV / CLTV products and reduced documentation types , have all but disappeared .
In response , Vertice is announcing the temporary suspension of a number of programs effective immediately .
This means they ’re pretty much not doing Alt - A loans anymore ( these are the loans somewhere between prime and subprime -- the “ low - doc ” or “ no - doc ” loans with no income verification ) .
There ’s just no liquidity for Alt - A .
The CDO ’s are not being packaged and sold anymore because there ’s no market for them , so forget it .
Just got a call from another mortgage broker buddy ( I know , I need to get a life ) .
She called from the Hamptons to tell me that yesterday , she was doing a million dollar 30 - year fixed for a client , and the spread she got on possible rates was 6 7/8 to 8 ¼ ( !!)
“ Can you believe that ??? ” she said .
Unfortunately , I can .
More to come .
Update : I want to clarify a few things .
When I use a quote from a mortgage broker saying Wells is pulling itself out of the market , that ’s the broker ’s opinion of what that 8 % means , not an official statement from the company .
Now , as I said on TV , but which I did n’t clarify on the blog is that the 8 % rate is for loans coming through brokers , ie broker - originated .
If you go directly to Wells Fargo , you will likely get a better rate .
Update # 2 : So just for fun , I ran a search on a jumbo 30 - year fixed rate mortgage today , for $ 500,000 , with 20 % down on my imaginary home , no points on the mortgage .
Here 's what I found :
Wells Fargo : 8 %
Countrywide : 7.39 %
Bank of America : 7.94 %
BB&T : 6.88 %

Michael Moore Destroys Wolf Blitzer Live On CNN !
Posted by Pile ( 45197 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ News Media ]
[ Activists ]
It 's been three years since Michael Moore appeared on CNN , and he took full advantage of appearing LIVE in front of Wolf Blitzer to respond to the network's hit piece on his movie " Sicko " and call out CNN for their irresponsible journalism on the Iraq war and more .
This is one clip you must see .
First , here 's the hit piece on " Sicko " done by CNN leading up to Michael Moore 's ass - kicking ( Conveniently removed from Youtube - here 's another version ) :
Now the main course ..
Michael Moore 's counter from his web site :
DR . SANJAY GUPTA , CNN : " ( Moore says ) the United States slipped to number 37 in the world 's health care systems .
It 's true .
...
Moore brings a group of patients , including 9/11 workers , to Cuba and marvels at their free treatment and quality of care .
But hold on - that WHO list puts Cuba 's health care system even lower than the United States , coming in at # 39 . "
THE TRUTH :
* " But hold on ? " ' SiCKO ' clearly shows the WHO list , with the United States at number # 37 , and Cuba at # 39 .
Right up on the screen in big five - foot letters .
It 's even in the trailer !
CNN should have its reporter see his eye doctor .
The movie is n't hiding from this fact .
Just the opposite .
* The fact that the healthcare system in an impoverished nation crippled by our decades - old blockade ( including medical supplies and drugs ) ranks so closely to ours is more an indictment of the American system than the Cuban system .
* Although Cuba ranks lower overall than the United States , it still has a lower infant mortality rate and longer life span .
( see below )
* And unlike the United States , Cuba offers healthcare to absolutely everyone .
In an independent Gallup poll conducted in Cuba , " a near unanimous 96 percent of respondents say that health care in Cuba is accessible to everyone . "
( " Cubans Show Little Satisfaction with Opportunities and Individual Freedom Rare Independent Survey Finds Large Majorities Are Still Proud of Island 's Health Care and Education , " January 10 , 2007 .
http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brlatinamericara/
300.php?nid=&id=&pnt=300&lb=brla )
CNN : " Moore asserts that the American health care system spends $ 7,000 per person on health .
Cuba spends $ 25 dollars per person .
Not true .
But not too far off .
The United States spends $ 6,096 per person , versus $ 229 per person in Cuba . "
THE TRUTH :
* According to our own government – the Department of Health and Human Services ' National Health Expenditures Projections – the United States will spend $ 7,092 per capita on health in 2006 and $ 7,498 in 2007 .
( Department of Health and Human Services Center for Medicare and Medicaid Expenditures , National Health Expenditures Projections 2006 - 2016 .
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/proj2006.pdf)
* As for Cuba – Dr. Gupta and CNN need to watch ' SiCKO ' first before commenting on it .
' SiCKO ' says Cuba spends $ 251 per person on health care , not $ 25 , as Gupta reports .
And the BBC reports that Cuba 's per capita health expenditure is …
$ 251 !
( Keeping Cuba Healthy , BBC , Aug. 1 2006 .
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5232628.stm
)
This is confirmed by the United Nations Human Development Report , 2006 .
Yup , Cuba spends $ 251 per person on health care .
( http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/statistics/indicators/52.html).
As Gupta points out , the World Health Organization does calculate Cuba 's per capita health expenditure at $ 229 per person .
We chose to use the UN numbers , a minor difference - and $ 229 is a lot closer to $ 251 than $ 25 .
CNN : In fact , Americans live just a little bit longer than Cubans on average .

THE TRUTH :
* True , but even when the WHO took patient satisfaction into account in its comprehensive review of the world 's health systems , we still came in at # 37 .

* Patients may be satisfied in America , but not everyone gets to be a patient .
47 million are uninsured and are rarely patients - until it 's too late .
In the rest of the Western world , everyone and anyone can be a patient because everyone is covered .
( And do n't face exclusions for pre-existing conditions , co-pays , deductibles , and costly monthly premiums ) .
* It 's not that other countries are unhappy with their health care – for example , " 70 to 80 percent of Canadians find their waiting times acceptable . "

CNN : Americans have shorter wait times than everyone but Germans when seeking non-emergency elective procedures , like hip replacement , cataract surgery , or knee repair .
THE TRUTH :
* This is n't the whole truth .
CNN pulled out a statistic about elective procedures .
Of the six countries surveyed in that study ( United States , Canada , New Zealand , UK , Germany , Australia ) only Canada had longer waiting times than America for sick adults waiting to schedule a doctor 's appointment for a medical problem .
81 % of patients in New Zealand got a same or next - day appointment for a non-routine visit , 71 % in Britain , 69 % in Germany , 66 % in Australia , 47 % in the U.S. , and 36 % in Canada .

* " Gerard Anderson , a Johns Hopkins health policy professor who has spent his career examining the world 's healthcare , said there are delays , but not as many as conservatives state .
In Canada , the United Kingdom and France , ' three percent of hospital discharges had delays in treatment , ' Anderson told The Miami Herald .
' That 's a relatively small number , and they 're all elective surgeries , such as hip and knee replacement . '
( John Dorschner , " ' SiCKO ' film is set to spark debate ; Reformers are gearing up for ' Sicko , ' the first major movie to examine America 's often maligned healthcare system , " Miami Herald , June 29 , 2007 . )
* One way America is able to achieve decent waiting times is that it leaves 47 million people out of the health care system entirely , unlike any other Western country .
When you remove 47 million people from the line , your wait should be shorter .
So why is the U.S. second to last in wait times ?
* And there are even more Americans who keep themselves out of the system because of cost - in the United States , 24 percent of the population did not get medical care due to cost .
That number is 5 percent in Canada , and 3 percent in the UK .

In the United Kingdom , only 11.5 percent of the population has supplementary insurance , but it does n't take the place of NHS insurance .

Message lost under Moore 's huge Ego .
Posted by TM on 2007-07-10 08:31:38
That was the most softball so - called " hit - piece " that I have ever seen .
Did any of you even watch it ?
It said : Moore might be a little shaky on a few minor facts ( which is true , because some statistics will always be questioned , depending upon which studies you trust ) but overall he is right that the U.S. health care system needs a major overhaul .
Moore 's
Ego is so out of control that he gets offended and goes on a nonsensical tirade involving his perceived slighting over Farenheit 911 not being universally accepted and preached far and wide by CNN .
It 's too bad Moore lets his own bloated sense of worth and huge Ego get in the way of his message .... if he really cared more about getting a better health care system here in the U.S. he would have spent the ten minutes promoting his movie and talking about how we can get a better health care system in place , rather than lashing out to salve his bruised ego .

He does a great job putting people in a state of shock and / or having them be offended .

Posted by sam charles on 2007-07- 10 09:12:47
If Moore had spent 10 minutes promoting his film ..... it would say that Moore can be bought .
I think Moore has more integrity than that .
It was n't his ego that was dammaged , he seemed like he is just sick of the kind of " news " we are getting these days .
( And I think he has every right ) Sometimes the business of News becomes .... business BEFORE news .
and Sometimes .... that sucks for us the people .
Still a " hit piece "
Posted by Pile on 2007-07-10 10:11:26
I think the fact that the hit piece was so soft is testimonial to the fact that the facts of " Sicko " are hard to disprove .
About the only thing you can do , as evidenced in the report , is cite some slightly different statistics , from an even more dubious source , or as was the case in F911 , just find someone in one of the countries that Moore visited who disagrees with what he said .
I would n't call that " fact checking " the movies ' claims , but this is what CNN did , and along those lines , it most certainly is a " hit piece " - add that to the fact that the commercials running at the time on CNN were primarily pharmaceutical and oil and gas companies .
This is part of this new propaganda tactic of trying to " balance " stories with bogus contrary information .
Like doing a story about the holocaust and bringing on the one guy in the entire area who is stupid enough to try to claim it did n't happen .
That 's not " balanced journalism " .
It 's irresponsible and that 's exactly what CNN did .
They put together than piece with the intent of discrediting parts of Moore 's movie .
There was virtually no substantive rejection of Moore 's claims yet the tone of the piece suggested otherwise .
Even if it was " soft " it was still an attempt to discredit the movie .
I think most of Moore 's ire was the result of looking at what 's happened in Iraq , and how he exposed the issue long before MSM like CNN started acknowledging it , and he 's right .. it is people like Wolf Blitzer 's fault .
He has a right to be angry , as do we all .
We 've spent $ 12 Billion over there and we can't even take care of New Orleans !
It 's disgraceful .

Posted by MAD DOUG on 2007-07-10 19:48:05
Can anyone honestly explain to me why they consider a system to be bad that does not demand payment at the point of service ?
Why is a system so repugnant that cares for the sick according to their illness and not their financial standing , but instead is paid for by a small tax based on the income of every healthy citizen ?
Why is so horrible that if one is faced with a calamitous life threatening illness one is freed from the financial worry of the cost ?
What is so good about the US health care system that drives countless numbers of seriously sick people bankrupt because of the cost of sickness ?
What is so good about US health care that rations health resources by high at the point of service costs which leaves 47 million US citizens outside the system ?
I have lived for many years in two countries with universal health care , they were not perfect because they are always under attack by the seekers of profit , I have also lived for many years in a country without universal health care and I know which of these three countries I would rather be if I became seriously ill !

Unfortunately , the answers in life are rarely very easy .
I can honestly say that this is a far more complex issue than people give it credit for .
People are motivated by different things .
Sometimes good , sometimes bad .
In general , the want to live without troubles is an excellent motivator , and money alleviates troubles .
Most people will be motivated , to some degree or another , by money .
A very special few people are motivated by the want to help others .
A ' free ' system does n't pay it 's doctors as much as a ' for profit ' system does , as a / general / rule .
So , the free system is relying on a smaller number of people to support it , as unfortunate as that is .
But this speaks nothing of skill .
A person of true skill , someone who will push a field to it 's limit ... these are also rare .
And unfortunately , being rare , they 're more than likely to be motivated by money than they are by / just / helping people .
So , whichever location pays more will have the more skilled workers , in general .
This is true of the medical industry , too .
This is actually the basis of the ' free market ' , capitalism at work .
The free market works on a simple principal ... survival of the fittest .
If you 're inadequate at your job , you wo n't be doing your job for long .
It encourages the strong to take up the mantle by offering great rewards .
It 's a somewhat cruel system , but out of it , we manage to get some very good , intelligent workers .
Unfortunately , a free system does n't work as well as we'd often like it to .
The taxes required to maintain it stifle off our cash flow , hurting the economy .
Government ends up having to control it , and the government has proved to not be the best at controlling things in the past .
Michael himself said that Medicare was good ... / but / most of it's control has been handed over to private companies .
There are benefits to both systems .
Our current free system breeds people of exceptional skill in very specialized fields , allowing us to create quite a few medical breakthroughs .
And there are quite a few pharmaceutical companies creating stuff over here , because there 's more money to be had here than in countries where they 're unable to make any money , because they 're not allowed to charge very much .
A system which ignores money is fortunate enough to be able to take care of anybody , but the staff will be limited due to lower pay .. and if you pay them more , then taxes need to increase to do so , further stifling the cash flow of everyone .
There are many sides to this , and it 's unfortunately rare for anybody to pay much attention to the fine details / and / have it show up on the news .
People want to see something more extreme , something that 's easy to get behind , or easy to debunk , not something that forces you to ask hard questions , or leave you without a clear answer .
Admit it
Posted by Anonymous on 2007-07 - 12 10:44:28
No matter what crazy arguments and facts either side will provide everyone must agree that the American healthcare system is not the best in the world , let alone perfect .
Thus , my point is : until the U.S. will have a perfect system ( which coincidentally will be never ) , they should accept criticism to improve on what they have .
Whether the criticism comes from Micheal Moore or Jesus himself is irrelevant .
Moores " Sicko " points out some major blemishes in American health care .
Now it 's the government 's job to eradicate the problems , which from the look of things , they will not do .

Either side of any debate or issue can find facts that have no real credibility .
Unless you go and read these ' journals ' that both sides have used , you 'll never really know what is the truth about anything .
I do n't watch CNN / FOX or any of Micheal Moore 's Movies because everyone has to much of a bias to really present a good argument .
I think it 's sad that most of the above posts are in support of this weird -o .
I do have to admit that Micheal Moore is very good at twisting the facts to make himself look like a poor soul that nevers gets to speak on TV .

I believe moore to be a lot more moderate than he presents himself .
But he 's decided to argue his points in such an extreme manner to get noticed and get the other sides of the arguement across .
If he were a lot more reasonable and sat quietly in his chair politely answering the questions Blitzer chose to ask he would n't get the airtime , and that 's what he wants to get his message in the public eye , so he does it by acting so extreme .
I would n't buy fully into his arguements , i know he has flaws in them , but his overall messages are worth getting across .

He says some things that are very true , but at the same time his decision to attack Wolf Blitzen made me sympathize with the victim .
This is conjecture , but it 's possible that Blitzen allowed him to continue to speak aggressively for that express reason , to discredit Moore and gain sympathy as a Gandhi - like image .
Also , ( sorry , but I just finished a Statistics course and I'm a little proud of myself ) nothing is certain in statistics .
Every study will get a slightly different result , just because you can't test everyone in a population .
For someone so brave to go on live on a top news agency to defend his views , there are things he could still do to earn more support .

The real truth is : you 'll be killed in Cuba if you rebel and claim the government provides poor health care .
All " surveys " are fixed to make the government look wonderful .
Therefore , their poll records are about worthy enough to wipe your ass on ( a strange similarity shared by Michael Moore 's script for " Sicko " ) ... that 's why it 's rated so " high " in the first place ... anyone who believes in this garbage does n't deserve our health care treatment , much less Cuba's ...
Free market ?
Posted by Waiting to see on 2007-07 - 13 06:34:20
What does a Free Market have to do with DECENT Health care ?
America is all about making money these days
No one can deny that .
I 've seen the same services that my parents had increase in cost well beyond the rate of inflation .
Even people in the medical profession will tell you that the rising cost of health care in America is out of hand and approaching being ridiculous .
Michal Moore did not tell any lies and he did not scue the facts .
The truth is there for anyone to look at .
Insurance companies are a business and they are here to make money at all cost we all know this as well .
Just look at the auto Insurance companies .
When the state governments made it mandatory to have insurance on your vehicle my rates nearly tripled with in 6 months and I have a good driving record .
If this kind of coverage is so important why not just sell it with the car ?
I agree that making money is important to everyone but to say that is the only reason for innovation and productivity is a ridiculous comment .
MOST people in America are in jobs that do not pay by productivity but instead by the hour and they do a very good job in most cases .
In many cases these days you do n't see companies trying to make a living or just make money they are trying to make a killing .
Nothing aloud to run wild is ever a good thing , it leaves too much room for abuse .
Because there is so much money to be made in the medical field these days you are attracting profiteers instead of the people who are really best suited to that type of work .
So come on people we all know we would be better off with some kind of public health care rather than what we have .
The only people opposed to this type of service are the ones with a vested interest in keeping things the way they are and I can guarantee you that it is not your best interest they have in mind .

Why do you think a person would risk their life , and the lives of friends and family to get away from Cuba if it 's so wonderful ?

What you dingbats ( i.e. Proud Patriot , elephant never 4gets , et al ) need to realize is that the topic of Sicko is HEALTH CARE and HEALTH CARE only .
So Cuba disallows free speech .
Boohoo !
The point of the movie ( which you would know if you saw it ) is n't about government but about HEALTH CARE .
The scene in Cuba includes prices of medications that are far less cheaper than what we pay .
On that situation alone , how is it that a pharmaceutical company charges an American $ 120 for a medicine whereas in Cuba you can get it for PENNIES ?
Sure we have capitalism here but let 's talk when you get laid off , ca n't afford COBRA and depend on 7 different medications to keep you alive .
Secondly , " I can't help but wonder why all of you that think the health care in other countries is so awesome do n't go live in those countries . "
My response , is duh .
Believe me , the very same people would move to France to get better care if they could AFFORD the move .
What can a couple do if the husband is laid off and laden with medical problems as is his wife , who has cancer ?
" No one is forcing you to stay in this country , " Proud Patriot says .
I 'd like to see Proud Patriot be in that same situation .
I wonder what it 's like to die from cancer , untreated .
Maybe you can tell me .
But once again , the point is that our government spends useless amounts of money on private jets for our politicians and allows our people to be charged outrageous rates whom we will pay because we are desperate to sew on a finger we lost .
Or , we decided to take the luxury route by giving birth at a hospital .
Sure !
Ok !
We need to examine the frivolous expenditures that goes unnoticed ( for example , California politician are befuddled over the missing thousands of public vehicles - HELLO !
How do you lose even 1000 vehicles ?!) and move those funds into things that help the people .
I mean , is n't that the point of government ?
To organize and protect people ?
By the way , I used to work in the health care industry .
There was a plethora of claims that sat on my desk that were rejected from payment .
It turns out that the claim department tracked how many claims processors got through in an hour and were paid bonuses for being " efficient . "

Moore does n't have to pander to pussies with his films , there are more than enough courageous , intelligent people who understand that outrage is warranted under outrageous conditions .
He does n't have to insure his statistics are perfect because statistics is an imperfect " science " and social statistics are rarely tight numbers .
Finally , he does n't have to solve the problems , he only has to highlight them .
Problem solving is not the job of the media , although Moore has suggested many more solutions than have the people who are paid to solve social problems .
Consider this .

An improved approach to gene therapy may one day treat some of the nearly 200 inherited forms of blindness , scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis recently suggested .
In a paper published online by Public Library of Science One , researchers take initial steps toward filling a gap in the toolkit for treating blindness by identifying DNA elements that control when and where genes linked to blindness are turned on .
" In its most basic form , gene therapy requires three components , " explains Joseph Corbo , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of pathology and immunology and senior author of the paper .
" You need to identify the gene that 's mutated in patients and obtain a healthy copy of that gene ; you need an agent to deliver the healthy gene to a patient 's cells , which is usually a weakened virus ; and then you also need additional DNA elements that turn on the healthy gene in the right cells and at the right levels . "
Corbo and colleagues used a computational analysis of DNA to look for elements that can turn on genes in the eye 's light - sensing photoreceptor cells .
Their search identified hundreds of potential cis-regulatory elements , which are segments of DNA involved in turning genes on and off .
They confirmed 19 of these elements , more than doubling the number known to scientists .
The newly discovered elements can be used as switches to activate blindness therapies .
" This result is significant because the number of cis-regulatory elements previously available for gene therapy was quite limited , " Corbo explains .
By some estimates , photoreceptors are the most energy - intensive cells in the human body , consuming more power than any other cell type .
Unfortunately , high energy also brings a high degree of volatility .
" If anything goes wrong in these cells , they 're going down the tubes , " Corbo says .
" That 's why there are so many inherited forms of blindness linked to degeneration of photoreceptors . "
Corbo and colleagues began their studies with three genes previously shown to be important to regulation of photoreceptor proteins .
The three genes , known as transcription factors , act by binding to DNA in a way that turns other genes on or off .

" Using a computerized search of DNA , we were able to identify several hundred potential binding sites for these transcription factors , " Corbo explains .
Through a variety of experiments , Corbo 's group confirmed that 19 of the new sites are involved in regulation of photoreceptor genes linked to inherited forms of blindness .
By studying new and previously established sites , they derived some basic rules or " grammar " that seem to govern how the sites work .
" We 've by no means finished defining this grammar - - it 's going to be a major task , " he explains .
" But what we know now has allowed us to create entirely synthetic cis-regulatory elements which function in photoreceptors .
A more complete grammar may even one day allow us to design customized versions of cis-regulatory elements to incorporate into gene therapy vectors for individual patients . "
In addition to further studies of the grammar of regulatory sites active in photoreceptor cells , Corbo and others are currently using the results of the study to design gene therapy vectors for a form of Leber 's congenital amaurosis , an inherited disorder that leaves patients blind from birth .

The House Judiciary Committee last week issued new subpoenas targeting e-mails from Republican National Committee accounts that discuss the firings of at least eight U.S. Attorneys , a political brannigan that has bloomed into a legal showdown between Congress and the White House over executive branch secrecy .
The Bush administration last week asserted executive privilege in rejecting a separate set of Congressional subpoenas that sought information related to the attorney firings .
Sara Taylor , a former Bush aide , refused to answer questions about the matter during a recent Senate hearing .
And former White House counsel Harriet Miers did n't even show up for her scheduled hearing on Thursday .
So Rep. John Conyers ( D - Michigan ) decided to take another tack and subpoena the RNC , which provided outside e-mail accounts where Bush administration employees could discuss political maneuvering free from the oversight required of White House servers .
" The White House has been stonewalling this investigation at every turn , " Conyers said .
" We attempted to negotiate terms with the RNC as well as the White House to secure these documents .
Yet again , the White House has stepped in to prevent the RNC
from turning them over .
So , we hope that the RNC - unlike Ms. Miers [ last week ] - will choose to comply with the legal obligation set out in this subpoena , as opposed to the opinion of the White House . "
The subpoena , which Conyers sent to RNC chairman Robert Duncan , seeks " complete and unredacted versions of any and all documents consisting of any e-mail communication or related meta - data stored on Republican National Committee servers or otherwise in your possession , custody , or control " that relate to the attorney firings .
The deadline to comply is tomorrow .

David Weigel at Reason reports this exchange on the campaign trail :
Just finished my reporting trip with a Rudy Giuliani town hall in New Castle , New Hampshire , a tiny island luxuryville a few miles from Portsmouth .
Don Murphy from Republicans for Compassionate Access , the pro-medical marijuana group , got to ask Rudy a quick question in the mass flesh - press that preceded him leaving the event .
Rough transcription :
MURPHY : You talked about abortion rights and how you trust people to make their own choices .
Do you support the choice of cancer patients to use medical marijuana ?
RUDY : No , I do n’t think a cancer patient should use marijuana .
There are other options .
Coming after a lot of flights of “ the government ca n’t tell you what to do ! ” rhetoric , it was pretty abrupt .
Looking at those things that make one ask " WTF ? "
The world 's biggest , best - loved search engine owes its success to supreme technology and a simple rule :
Do n't be evil .
Now the geek icon is finding that moral compromise is just the cost of doing big business .
Michael Grecco .
In the early days , Google cofounders Sergey Brin ( seated ) and Larry Page did everything themselves .
Life used to be so much easier for Sergey Brin .
In the autumn of 1998 , he and Larry Page unleashed Google with a clear mission : Help computer users find exactly what they want on the Internet .
Newbies flocked to the site , grateful for a simple search engine that was both powerful and intuitive .
More sophisticated techies came to appreciate Google 's computational elegance and its willingness to shun the " portal " model that crammed ecommerce down their throats .
Within months ,
Google became one of the most popular sites on the Web - and not long after that , " Google " became a verb .
Today , Internet users spend about 15 million hours a month on the site .
Google.com logs more than 28 million visitors each month , nearly as many as Yahoo ! and MSN .
Nearly four out of five Internet searches happen on Google or on sites that license its technology .
Google owes its swelling popularity to deft algorithms that quickly divine what 's useful on the Web .
But there 's more to it than that .
At Google , purity matters .
Over the years , Brin and Page have resisted pressure to run banners , opting instead for haiku - like text ads and unintrusive sponsored links .
They 've taken a stand against pop-ups and pop-unders and refused ads from sites they consider to be overly negative .
All the while , they 've stubbornly kept the Google homepage concise and pristine .
On just a faint whisper of a marketing campaign , the company pulled in an estimated $ 70 million last year ( a third from licensing fees and the rest from ads ) .
The Google strategy appeals to every engineer 's sense of The Way It Should Be. Build the best entry in the science fair .
Do not tart it up .
Do not make it more clever than it needs to be .
But a funny thing is happening on the way to Internet adulthood - Google 's awkward teen years .
The company 's growth spurt has spawned a host of daunting questions that no data - retrieval system can easily answer .
Should Google play ball with repressive foreign governments ?
Refuse to link users to " hate " sites ?
Punish marketers who artificially inflate site rankings ?
Fight the Church of Scientology 's attempts to silence critics ?
And what to do about the cache , Google 's archive of previously indexed pages ?
In April , the German national railroad threatened legal action to remove an obsolete site containing sabotage instructions .
Most major companies refer to a detailed code of corporate conduct when considering such policy decisions .
General Electric devotes 15 pages on its Web site to an integrity policy .
Nortel 's site has 34 pages of guidelines .
Google 's code of conduct can be boiled down to a mere three words :
Do n't be evil .
Very Star Wars .
But what does it mean ?
" Evil , " says Google CEO Eric Schmidt , " is what Sergey says is evil . "
Of the Google triumvirate , Schmidt makes sure the company stays on course financially and strategically ;
Page keeps busy in the R&D lab , cranking out new features ; and the 29 - year - old Brin , in his role as Google 's conscience and head policymaker , spends his days gripping the moral tiller - and in so doing , imposes his worldview on everyone else .
That puts Brin at the flashpoint of most of the major Internet - related controversies .
He knows his decisions have far - reaching consequences .
He feels the pressure that attends Google 's growing power .
" I do get fairly stressed , " Brin says .
" I 'd like to feel a little less scrutinized . "
Michael Grecco .
Today at Google , Page works on R&D. Brin ( right ) is the moral compass
Google has succeeded by adhering to one , pure principle : Do good by users .
Now , for the first time in its history , Google is facing rifts between what 's good for users and what 's good for Google .
And Sergey Brin is finding that purity just does n't scale .
II .
Do n't be evil .
Brin has had to refer back to those three words quite a bit over the past year .
Governments , religious bodies , businesses , and individuals are all bearing down on the company , forcing Brin to make decisions that have an effect on the entire Internet .
" Things that would normally be side issues for another company carry the weight of responsibility for us , " Brin says .
In March , lawyers representing the Church of Scientology requested that Google stop linking to a Norwegian anti-Scientology site called Operation Clambake .
The church claimed the site , xenu.net , displayed copyrighted Scientology content and that by providing links to the information , Google was in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Much to the dismay of many First Amendment fans , Google caved , removing the offending pages from its index .
In May , Anita Roddick , the outspoken British founder of the Body Shop , blasted Google in her blog for yanking a text ad for her site .
Google 's explanation : Roddick had called actor John Malkovich a " vomitous worm " in her blog , violating a Google policy against accepting ads for sites that are " anti - " anything .
After Roddick protested , Google offered to reinstate the ad in exchange for a promise from Roddick that she would remove the Malkovich reference from the first page of her site .
When she refused , Brin had a decision to make :
Should he give in and accept Roddick 's money , or stand by his principles ?
He chose his principles .
Three months later , Daniel Brandt , who runs google - watch.org , attacked PageRank , the algorithm at the heart of Google 's vaunted system , accusing the company of being unfair and undemocratic .
Brandt urged the FTC to investigate Google and regulate it as a public utility - as a company that , in effect , controls access to the Internet 's natural resources .
The mainstream press tended to dismiss Brandt as a webmaster spurned by a low Google ranking , but in the online forums and weblogs , many agreed with his assertion .
As far as search engines go , Google has become the only game in town .
Then in the first week of September , Brin found himself pulled into matters of foreign policy .
He received several emails from users telling him that the Chinese government , worried about political dissent in the weeks before the 16th Chinese Party Congress , had shut down access to the site .
" Our Chinese traffic was down by a factor of five , " Brin says .
" We were blocked . "
Brin was no expert on international diplomacy .
So he ordered a half - dozen books about Chinese history , business , and politics on Amazon.com and splurged on overnight shipping .
He consulted with Schmidt , Page , and David Drummond , Google 's general counsel and head of business development , then put in a call to tech industry doyenne Esther Dyson for advice and contacts .
Google has no offices in China , so Brin enlisted go - betweens to get the message to Chinese authorities that Google would be very interested in working out a compromise to restore access .
" We did n't want to do anything rash , " Brin says .
" The situation over there is more complex than I had imagined . "
Four days later , Chinese authorities restored access to the site .
How did that happen ?
For starters , the Chinese government was deluged with outcries from the nation 's 46 million Internet users when access to Google was cut off .
" Internet users in China are an apolitical crowd , " says Xiao Qiang , executive director of New York - based Human Rights In China .
" They tend to be people who are doing well , and they do n't usually voice strong views .
But this stepped into their digital freedom . "
The quick workaround : Chinese authorities tweaked the national firewall , making the new Google China different from the site that was turned off .
Today , Chinese who use Google to search on terms like " falun gong " or " human rights in china " receive a standard - looking results page .
But when they click on any of the results , either their browsers are redirected to a blank or government - approved page , or their computers are blocked from accessing Google for an hour or two .
" They have a new mechanism that can block the results of certain searches , " Brin says .
Did Google help China find or obtain the filtering technology ?
" We did n't make changes to our servers " is all he 'll say .
In late October , a report by two Harvard researchers revealed that Google had begun filtering its own servers to block users in Germany , France , and Switzerland from accessing sites carrying material likely to be judged racist or inflammatory in each country .
Neither Brin nor anyone else at Google will talk about about the preemptive self - censoring moves in Europe .
In the wake of these international incidents , members of Google 's loyal , tech - savvy constituency began to question the company 's motives .
" I am a little on the fence about Google 's latest actions , " wrote Brian Osborne , a staff writer for Geek.com , a news site .
" On one hand , I understand Google 's stance that it must remain in compliance with German and French laws .
Nevertheless , Google is putting itself on a very slippery slope . "
III .
" What is this ? " asks a visitor squinting at the form he must sign before proceeding to the cafeteria at Google 's Mountain View , California , headquarters .
" An NDA ?
To have lunch ? "
The receptionist shrugs .
" This is Google , " she says .
" They 're crazy that way . "
The Googleplex , contrary to almost every written account of the place , is hardly a haven of easygoing geek whimsy .
The cafeteria is adorned with a tie - dyed banner , but the Google employees are n't humming any Dead songs .
Most of them appear deadly serious .
Brin 's second - floor office overlooks a courtyard festooned with empty hammocks .
A book about Enron rests on his coffee table .
Brin 's designation as Google 's policy maven is relatively new .
He , the big thinker , and Page , the mad scientist , complemented each other and shared nearly every role in Google 's early years .
" Larry was always the driver , " says Scott Hassan , who did much of the programming for the original Google .
" A big part of his role was going around and yelling ' Why can't it do this ?
Why is n't this working ? ' "
Brin would sit next to Hassan and watch him write code , pointing out errors and taking an occasional turn at the keyboard .
The frenetic Page looked at all the popular engines at the time and decided they were going about search the wrong way .
By relying on HTML code - meta tags as well as page text - they would bring back all sorts of irrelevant information and open themselves up to massive manipulation by webmasters looking to increase their own rankings .
Brin took Page 's observation and ran with it .
He figured the best way around the problem was to harness the vast repository of human judgments already preserved on the Internet in the form of hyperlinks .
" Most people search for local maximums - like figuring out how to get the best car , the best immediate situation , " Hassan says .
" Sergey is always searching for global maximums . "
By 2001 , Google 's breakneck growth convinced Page and Brin it was time to establish a more rigid structure .
Page handed over the CEO title to Schmidt and became copresident with Brin .
The move freed up Page to focus on developing his knack for product development ( as a child , he crafted a printer out of spare parts and Lego blocks ) .
Brin 's passion for the big picture made him the natural choice to spend time on Google 's growing role in the world .
Which means Brin 's views on politics and policy matter quite a bit .
Not that he 's willing to talk .
He tells me he listens to NPR on his morning drive to work .
I think Democrat and ask about his voter affiliation .
He says he votes across party lines .
Independent ?
He smiles and tells me there 's no easy shortcut toward figuring out how he comes to his decisions about good and evil .
And even if there was , he would n't let me in on it .
If I succeed in figuring out exactly what he considers good and evil , people who do n't care about Google users might start gaming him the way they try to game his search engine .
Born in Moscow and raised in the suburbs of Washington , DC , Brin grew up listening in on conversations at the dinner parties thrown by his father , a math professor , and his mother , a NASA scientist .
Talking about his decisions and the values he holds most dear , Brin chooses his language carefully , but one word he repeatedly comes back to is " useful . "
And while Google 's policy decisions over the past year look a bit haphazard at first glance , they begin to make more sense in a worldview where usefulness is the paramount virtue .
Aside from the indisputable goodness of causing hard - line Communist Party officials to say the word " Google " to one another for a few days , it 's difficult to say on which side of the good - evil line the company 's China resolution falls .
Brin seems at peace with how it all turned out .
" Political searches are not that big a fraction of the searches coming out of China , " he says .
" You want to look at the total value picture that a search engine like Google brings and think of all that it 's used for . "
But Xiao Qiang , the activist , thinks the company should have taken a firmer stand .
" Ultimately , China 's state censorship mechanism will have to submit to this growing demand for freedom from Chinese netizens , " Xiao says .
" It 's important to protect integrity , particularly for an Internet firm . "
On the same day that China blocked access to Google , it also flipped the switch on AltaVista .
AltaVista issued a defiant statement to the media and went on to list several ways to access the site .
Months later , AltaVista is still blocked .
Brin figures that by meeting China halfway , Google remained available - and useful - to visitors and also preserved its advertising revenue there .
" You have to look at the total value picture , " he says .
What about the Scientology mess ?
Did n't Google give in too easily ?
Jennifer Urban , a fellow at Berkeley 's Boalt Hall School of Law and a member of Chilling Effects , an organization formed to document attempts to stifle speech on the Internet , says that from a legal standpoint , Google 's hands were tied .
" To qualify for safe harbor protection from liability , they really have to err on the side of taking down the link , " Urban says .
In fact , Google did n't fold entirely .
After consulting with Brin , Kulpreet Rana , Google 's head of IP , found a way that Google could comply with the law without letting the Scientologists erase their critics from the Internet .
The solution : When Google gets a request to remove a link under the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA Section 512 , it substitutes a link to a form on the Chilling Effects ' site .
The form contains the Web address of the page in question , and anyone still interested in the site can direct their browser to the address .
Does abiding by the letter of a bad and flimsy law absolve Google from charges that it squashed free expression ?
Cindy Cohn , legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , is certain that a vigorous legal challenge would put an end to the steady flow of Section 512 filings
Google receives but admits she does n't expect Google to devote its resources to such a broad fight .
And while some cheered Google 's workaround as evidence of a rebellious bit of payback - a small point scored against the enemies of unfettered speech - the move is another instance of Brin choosing the path of usefulness over a righteous crusade .
IV .
If Brin 's code of good and evil permits the company to negotiate with sovereign governments and allows for some legal meddling from unpopular religions , there is no wiggle room - no gray area whatsoever - when it comes to those who attempt to subvert the power of Google to their own commercial ends .
One thing Brin is sure of :
On the side of evil lies trickery .
I ask Brin to imagine , for a moment , running his company 's evil twin , a sort of anti-Google .
" We would be doing things like having advertising that was n't marked as being paid for .
Stuff that violates the trust of the users , " he says , describing a site that sounds not unlike the pay - for - placement search site Overture .
" Say someone came looking for breast cancer information and did n't know that some listings were paid for with money from drug companies .
We 'd be endangering people 's health . "
The anti-Google might also be more amenable to the growing business of " optimization , " the altering of Web sites so that they rank higher in search engine results .
For a fee , there 's help for a Dallas plumber who 's unhappy that his site is on the 17th page of results when someone types " Dallas plumber " into Google .
An optimizer will tweak the site in such a way that boosts it to , say , the 3rd page of results .
To pull this off with Google , an optimizer needs to understand how the company 's search mechanism works .
Google uses 100 or so closely guarded algorithms to determine its search results .
The best known of the lot is called PageRank , which allocates relevancy to a page according to the number and importance of pages linked to it , the number and importance of pages linked to each of those pages , and so on .
One ploy is to create " link farms , " in which an optimizer gets clients to link to one another , racking up relevancy points .
In general , optimizers make a living by guessing what Google regards as important .
The way Brin sees it , the optimizers are co-opting Google 's bond of trust with its users .
He regards optimizers the way a mother grizzly might regard a hunter jabbing at her cub with a stick .
Every month , when Google updates its index and its mix of algorithms , it rakes a disruptive claw across the optimizers ' systems .
In the industry , the monthly shuffle is known as the Google Dance , and Brin does n't mind letting on that if Google ends up dancing all over the optimizers , so much the better .
" When we change and improve our technology , things get shuffled around , " Brin says , " and sometimes it has a disproportionate effect on optimization sites . "
Consider the case of Bob Massa , a former solid oak dining room furniture salesman who lives in Oklahoma City and runs SearchKing , an optimization company he started in 1997 .
Last summer , Massa received a rare gift from Google in the form of the Google Toolbar , a software program that lets users perform searches without going to Google.com .
More important for Massa , the Toolbar shows the approximate PageRank , on a scale of one to ten , of whatever page a user is visiting .
It was the first time since Brin and Page were in grad school that they 'd shared so much technical information .
After years of watching Google 's every move like an Etruscan high priest trying to augur divine intent from cloud formations , Massa had a piece of the goods .
On August 9 , Massa started selling optimization based on PageRank .
After the Google Dance of September 20 , most of Massa 's customers suddenly found themselves in a heap at the very bottom of Google 's 3 billion site index .
It seems that the improvements Google had made included a severe downgrade of sites with links to SearchKing .
Massa 's customers , needless to say , were very , very unhappy .
" Everyone thinks I 'm the biggest idiot in the world for making Google mad , " Massa said in October .
He filed suit a few weeks later , charging that Google downgraded his customers ' scores in a deliberate attempt to put him out of business .
The suit asks for an injunction forcing Google to restore the scores to pre-Dance levels , and seeks $ 75,000 in damages .
" It 's a classic good versus evil thing , " says Massa , turning Brin 's framework back on Google itself .
" I knew they would n't like it .
I did n't think they 'd go so far as to wipe out all these little people . "
The day Massa 's suit was filed , the reaction from the Slashdot crowd and most other forums was predictably vociferous , with posters stumbling over themselves to craft metaphors painting Massa as a criminal suing his victim .
But gradually , a surprising number of people , while careful not to look as though they were defending Massa , began tagging the search engine as a Google - opoly .
It 's hard to sympathize with a David as parasitic as Massa , but Slashdotters tend to be uneasy with Goliaths of any stripe , especially when their methods are kept secret .
And the real problem with Massa is that he 's simply the termite Brin is able to see .
There are thousands more behind the wall , invisibly boring away at the very structure of Google 's house .
" It 's easy to become overly obsessed with those kinds of things , " Brin admits .
It would make things a lot easier for Brin if the world 's webmasters would just act as though his site did n't matter , but that 's not human nature .
There 's no way around it - as long as Google remains the search engine of choice , the arms race between Google coders and the hordes of optimizers will go on .
V .
As proficient as Google is at revealing information , Brin is adept at keeping key morsels under wraps .
In a way , that makes a lot of sense .
Although the obvious image of Google is one of accumulation , the essence of data retrieval is just the opposite .
Google is about division and subtraction , narrowing down billions of choices before revealing the most promising .
Brin 's world is n't as simple as visible equals good , hidden equals evil .
Google 's effectiveness as a search tool depends largely on how well it's able to shroud the site 's inner workings from the commercial interests that clutter so much of the Internet today .
But here 's the thing :
If Brin thinks his job has become more difficult over the past year , it may soon become near impossible .
In September , at the height of the China controversy , Google legal eagle Drummond spotted an article about the prospect of a Google IPO , which , the story said , might be the spark to ignite the dormant public offerings market .
Drummond forwarded the story with some sardonic comments .
In his office , Brin tries to find the email for me but can't .
He notes the irony in that , and goes on to paraphrase the note : " Oh , OK , now we 're going to reform the Chinese government - and on top of that , we 're going to fix Wall Street . "
Schmidt claims the company is in no rush to go public , but his appointment and the hiring of CFO George Rayes last August were unmistakable steps in that direction .
When the IPO comes , it will bring riches - and more problems .
As a private company , Google has one master : users .
As a public company , there are shareholders to worry about .
And more than happy users , shareholders want ever - greater profits .
Thus far , Brin and Page have succeeded in standing up to pressures that might compromise Google and the user experience .
Google 's influential stand against pop -up ads extends beyond its own domain - the company rejects advertisers whose links take Google users to pages that feature pop-ups .
( AOL followed suit in October , announcing its own pop-up moratorium . )
But when Google becomes a public company , shareholders might force the site to take a more amenable position , if the price is right .
After all , for several years , Yahoo !
refused to accept anything but fast - loading banner ads , claiming that it was looking out for users .
That policy lasted until right about the time that the company 's stock price began to cave .
Such pressure could cause Brin to rethink other policies , like his decision to refuse all alcohol and tobacco advertising .
The fact that Google accepts advertising for adult content sites is an intriguing commentary on Brin 's morality : Cigarettes and booze are evil ; porn is not .
It 's a policy that would become progressively harder to defend were Google to go public .
Then there 's the Google cache to consider .
Today 's users love having access to a warehouse of information that was once published on the Internet but has since disappeared .
Some information goes away for a reason , though .
The cache could get Google in trouble , and Brin & Co. could soon find themselves facing all sorts of libel , defamation , or copyright lawsuits .
Increased competition may also cause Brin to do other things he 's loath to do .
So far , Google has gotten by without much in the way of competition from the other Internet superpowers .
But in May , Yusuf Mehdi , the head of MSN , said he views Google as " more of a competitor than a partner " in the effort to become the default homepage on millions of browsers .
What if , as Google.com solidifies its position as the focal point of the Internet , Yahoo !
and AOL begin to rethink the millions in licensing fees they pay to what has become a top competitor ?
Brin may be forced to make the kind of concessions that he 's thus far reserved for international governments .
The utilitarian manner in which Google has achieved its success has made it a sentimental favorite among the code - parsing set .
Tech - community sites like Slashdot are almost uniformly pro-Google .
Those with the temerity to bring lawsuits against Google ultimately feel the burn of online flames , watching their servers wither under the quasi-zealous wrath of thousands of engineers defending one of their own .
But as Google is forced to make more concessions to realpolitik , its bonds with that idealistic constituency will inevitably continue to fray .
And without any sort of technological lock - in , it would be very easy for Google 's visitors to simply start using other search engines .
Fast Search & Transfer , based in Norway , boasts a 2.1 billion - page index at www.alltheweb.com, and its search engine works as quickly as Google's .
What 's more , it does a complete crawl of the Internet every 7 to 11 days compared with Google 's 28 days .
What if an influential group of politically active netizens makes a rousing case for boycotting Google on the grounds that it is anti-free speech and in cahoots with repressive governments ?
How long can a hugely powerful company that plays its decisions so close to the vest and refuses to justify itself publicly count on the devotion of the average information - hungry Web user ?
It 's inevitable that a company of Google 's size and influence will have to compromise on purity .
There 's a chance that , in five years , Google will end up looking like a slightly cleaner version of what Yahoo ! has become .
There 's also a chance that the site will be able to make a convincing case to investors that long - term user satisfaction trumps short - term profit .
The leadership of the Internet is Sergey Brin 's to lose .
For now , at least , in Google we trust .

How To Beat Carnival Games
Tips to win a knock - off stuffed animal or dusty 2 LiveCrew vanity mirror next time you ’re counting mullets at the fair .
Rope Ladder
The trick to climbing carnival rope ladders is to completely ignore the “ rungs ” and only use the outside ropes to climb on .
While applying equal pressure with your right foot and left arm , move your left foot and right arm uat the same time .
Then do the same thing with the opposite limbs — shimmying yourself up the ladder .
Do not move both hands or both feet at the same time – you will lose your balance .
Ring Toss Game :
Snap your wrist as you throw the ring to achieve the most spin possible , this will stabilize the ring making it easier to land cleanly on your target .
Balloon Dart Throw
The balloons are under - inflated , and the dart tips are dull .
Forget accuracy and throw the dart as hard as you can .
Most people aim for the middle , so the game operators will often hide the “ good prize ” tags behind balloons on the outside edges .
Shoot out the Star :
In this skill game you need to completely remove the red star using a BB gun .
Very hard to beat , even for a good marksman .
The trick is to shoot around the star , rather than trying to shoot out the star itself .
Complete the circle and the center of the paper will fall away taking the red star with it .
Also note that the barrels are often bent , and their marks not accurate .
Within the first few shots it ’s important to gauge just how far off the mark the gun shoots and adjust your aim accordingly .
Basket Toss :
Lean over to get as close to the basket as you are allowed .
Toss the ball gently using some backspin .
Aim for the inside upper lip of the basket .
Guess your weight , age or birth month :
Unless you very over - weight or really do n’t look your age , it ’s best to go with the birth month .
Some carnies still use an old scam for guessing your birth month .
If the carny uses this trick ( not all do ) they will scribble down something like the image on the right .
Does it say Jun , Jul , or Jan ?
The guesser could claim it be whichever one is closest to your birth month .
That wide spread allows the carny to be within 2 months of any month , except one : October .
So if you think you are dealing with a shady operator , always say “ October ” is your birth month .
Coin Toss Game :
The object is to toss a coin onto a plate without the coin bouncing off .
There are a few tricks to increasing the odds of winning this game :
1 . Use a very high arc , with as little spin as possible when tossing the coin .
You can even try tossing the coin right up into the hanging stuffed animals above .
2. Covertly cover the coin with spit before tossing it .
3 . Some people recommend purposely bouncing the coin off one plate in order to make a second bounce land on a plate safely .
Stand the bottle :
You are given a fishing pole with a small ring attached to the end of the line .
Your goal is make a soda bottle ( laying on its side ) stand using this contraption .
The trick is to PUSH the bottle up rather than pull it up .
Milk Bottle
Throw :
The bottles used in this carnival game are often made with leaded glasses making them very heavy .
The secret to winning the milk bottle throw is to aim at the base of the bottom two containers rather then at the intersection of all three bottles .
Test Your Strength :
The goal is to whack the base of this game with a mallet causing a weight shoot up and ring a bell .
The trick is all in accuracy and technique rather than strength .
A few tips :
1. Accuracy is the key , be sure to hit the center of base .
2 . Hold the mallet as far down the handle as possible while still achieving a firm grip .
3 . Hold the mallet over your head , arms completely extended , arch your body backwards .
Give a few slow motion test swings to judge how far you should stand away from the target to hit it dead - center .
Using this method you will achieve the most momentum and still accurately hit the target .
BasketBall Free - Throw
You have a lot going against you in this game .
The ball is over - inflated , the hoop is smaller than regulation size and often an oval shape rather than circular .
The backboard is plywood making it extra bouncy .
So forget about throwing a normal free - throw shot .
The key is to use a high arc .
Do not try to rebound the shot off the backboard — the ball will always bounce too much .
To win this game you must make a perfect swish , no backboard .

“ Coin Toss : Potentially a rigged game .
Attendants “ clean ” plates with silicone spray .
To beat that , toss coins in a rainstorm ( Game will close if attendant is alert )
Plates get sticky .
Skeeball : Good advice below …angle your tosses .
By rubbing the side , the ball will come into the target area from more directly above the holes .
Gauge the speed to adjust depth of toss .
Baseball Radar Game :
You usually get two warmup tosses then one that counts .
Instead if firing hard as you can , throw slow .
On 2n throw try to throw slightly faster .
Guess speed .
On third throw faster .
Cat Rack : Instead of firing the ball at the cats .
Toss each ball using a fine , gentle dart motion .
Aim for the nose of the cat .
For three in a row , choose cats that are side by side . ” – by Newt

“ For anyone interested in the ladder game - the way i do it is to start w/ both legs on a stable rung , both hands 3 rungs up .
lower yourself close to the ladder like you ’re doing a push - up .
Shift all weight onto one leg AND THE OPPOSITE ARM .
Carefully move your free leg and free arm to the next rung , and once they ’re in position quickly shift your weight onto them ( remember to keep low ) .
Always keep a fluid motion making your way up .
it is possible to stop and rest , but only if you have fairly good balance .
i’ve seen people walk straight up w/o hands , but that ’s a feat I ’ve yet to do .
I keep my hands and feet on the outer edges of the rungs .
it ’s the ‘ twist ’ to the ladder that gives it some stability .
keep your leg locked and almost slide it up the rope . ” – by tike

Two FCC commissioners showed up to a Senate hearing yesterday and argued that the US is in dire need of a " national broadband strategy " that would bring universal access and more competition to the increasingly - important broadband market .
Despite the assurances of a Progress & Freedom Foundation senior fellow that US broadband was a robustly competitive market and companies should actually face fewer government regulations , neither Commissioner Copps nor Commissioner Adelstein ( both Democrats , and the only two commissioners who spoke at the hearing ) agreed that things were so simple .
The reason : regulation of the broadband market is currently at a low ebb compared with earlier rules that required line - sharing , yet the US continues to fall behind its international competitors .
Critics have attacked particular studies for perceived methodological flaws ; Copps forcefully made the point , though , that the US has been dropping year - over - year in such surveys , even when the methodology of a particular survey remains the same .
He also pointed out that such data does n't come from a single study .
Instead , a whole host of recent studies has ranked the US no higher than 11 when it comes to broadband penetration .
Report US ranking FTTH Council , " Asia Lead the World in FTTH Penetration " ( July 18 , 2007 ) 11 Robert Atkinson , " The Case for a National Broadband Policy " ( June 2007 ) 12 OECD , " Broadband Statistics to December 2006 " 15 ITU , " Broadband Statistics for 1 January 2006 " 15 ITU United Nations Conf. on Trade and Develop. , " Chapter 3 , the Digital Opportunity Index " 20 Website Optimization , LLC , " US Jumps to 24th in Worldwide Broadband Penetration " ( August 21 , 2007 ) 24
The solution , according to both commissioners , is not some kind of " command and control " economy or a huge new set of federal regulations .
Both commissioners instead talked about the importance of having the FCC gather accurate broadband data ( it currently defines broadband as anything faster than 200 kbps in one direction and gets only ZIP code - level demographic information ) and the need to spur " meaningful competition " through tax credits and other investment subsidies .
" Only rational competition policies can ensure that the US broadband market does not default into a stagnant duopoly , " said Adelstein , " which is a serious concern given that cable and DSL providers now control approximately 96 percent of the residential broadband market . "
One of the tools that the FCC itself can use to make such competition a reality is " open access " rules , and the FCC has applied several of these to parts of the upcoming 700 MHz spectrum auction .
Still , wireless looks several years out from providing truly mainstream broadband access to more than the geekerati and those who fly in business class .
To that end , Copps called for using the Universal Service Fund to help pay for universal broadband service .
" It worked for plain old telephone service and it will work here , " he said .
Adelstein called for a " National Summit on Broadband " at which the federal government and the private sector would come together in peace , love , and understanding to sing " It 's a Small World After All " and give group hugs ( not an exact quote ) .
This is an exact quote , however : " Just as the Pilgrims used the Mayflower to reach the new opportunities in Plymouth Harbor and the 19th - century pioneers relied on stage coaches and railroads to settle the western US , entrepreneurs are using broadband infrastructure to reach beyond their current horizons . "
A national strategy could help spur even more entrepreneurial activity , in Adelstein 's view .
While the rhetoric might be a bit too inflated for its own good , it 's good to see that at least some FCC officials are taking the problem seriously and hope to see the US back at the top of the broadband charts soon .
Copps , Adelstein , and FCC Chairman Kevin Martin ( a Republican ) were the forces behind the recent " open access " requirements , and the auction rules have already shaken up an entire industry .
Whether the open access experiment lives up to the hype remains to be seen .
The market is also making progress of its own toward offering an alternative to the cable / DSL duopoly .
WiMAX is showing signs of living up to its early promise of offering wide - scale wireless broadband , though it will be years before WiMAX is widely available outside urban areas and interstate highways .
Most Americans would welcome a third broadband option , and they wo n't care especially if government rules or uninhibited market forces bring it to them .
Let 's hope that , one way or another , the dream becomes a reality .

This has been said over and over again , but as long as it keeps happening it just has to be said again .
A very common career path in IT “ promotes ” a coder over the years to a program manager with architect responsibilities .
And being an architect they stop writing code themselves .
The thing I see over and over again is that these people keep living in the programming environment in which they grew up .
They did loads of work in VB 6 or classical ASP .
When a new piece of software has to be designed , which quite often is supposed to do something similar to the things they built themselves in their heydays , they grab their old projects to demonstrate what they have in mind .
Right now I ’m facing an ASP.
NET site which has to build dynamic pages on the fly based on dynamic sets of data .
And the lead architect bases his ideas on an ancient asp site he built years ago .
Given the tools of those days it is a well crafted product but in nature it is just plain old asp spitting out html top to bottom .
Given today ’s tools we can write far clearer , more powerful and better maintainable code building an asp.net control tree and leave the rendering of the html to the framework .
But our lead architect does n’t know this framework .
The good thing about my lead is that he is very open minded and eager to learn about today ’s tools .
But it would be so much better if working and coding with them would be part of his work .
How can you be a good architect when you do n’t know your building materials or construction tools ?
The underlying cause of the current global financial crisis is a system in which there ’s little personal responsibility for lending decisions .
Here ’s how it all works ( or , as we now see , how it does n’t work ) .
In the US , some half a million mortgage brokers have been incentivised to “ sell ” mortgages to potential homebuyers .
They do n’t work for the providers of the loans .
They are paid commissions for the volume of mortgages they arrange .
So , of course , they try to arrange as many mortgages as they can , not minding the consequences .
If the customer wants to borrow more than he or she can really afford , then that ’s no problem , thanks to a wonderful innovation called “ stated income , stated assets ” loans .
These allow US homebuyers to give a personal undertaking that their income is a certain level , even if they do n’t provide any proof .
Such loans have been taken out by hundreds of thousands of US citizens who are pay - as - you - earn tax - payers and could therefore have easily provided proof of earnings , had they wanted to do so .
Surprise , surprise : studies have shown “ discrepancies ” between what such borrowers say they earn and what they actually earn , in 95 per cent of these loans .
These mortgages are now colloquially known as “ liars ’ loans ” .
But liars ’ loans are just the extreme manifestation of a US system for generating home loans which is predicated on turning a blind eye to economic reality .
When a borrower has difficulty making repayments on a loan , a mortgage broker would typically encourage them to pay off that loan by taking out a new one for an even greater amount !
These are the infamous “ rolling loans ” which “ gather no losses ” .
When a loan is rolled over , no one need know that defaults loom – at least not for a while .
Wall Street ’s sausage machine
What happens to all these hundreds of billions of dollars in home loans ?
Well the paperwork and administration is usually done by specialist home loans companies , such as New Century Financial ( which went into bankruptcy protection in the spring ) .
Then the debt itself goes into a giant mincing and mixing machine on Wall Street operated by the biggest US investment banks , led by Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch and the like .
They take all this debt and they process it into asset - backed securities , or bonds .
Note that Goldman , Morgan et al have NO CONNECTION with the borrowers and NO IDEA whether an individual borrower is a good risk or a bad risk .
But they have historic data on default rates .
And this data allows them – or so they claim – to assess whether a bond is a good risk or a poor risk , and therefore to price it for consumption by international investors .
What ’s more , verification of the riskiness of a bond is provided , for a fee , by the specialist credit - rating agencies , led by Moody ’s and Standard & Poor ’s ( let ’s for now ignore the obvious conflict - of - interest that as the market for these bonds expands , the rating agencies make bigger profits ) .
There ’s a conspicuous problem here .
An important part of the US home loans market , the sub - prime mortgages provided to those with poor credit histories , is a young market which has grown like topsy .
Or to put it another way , data gathered from past performance of loans in a small market may not be much of a guide to the future performance of a trillion dollar plus market .
But that has n’t stopped the big investment banks citing this questionable data to convert sub - prime loans into bonds that they claim are risk - free and which have a so - called triple - A credit rating .
Here ’s how they do the clever engineering .
For argument 's sake , let ’s say that they estimate that as many as one in two home loans will default and that on average there will be a 40 per cent loss on those defaulting loans .
That , in turn , gives a maximum risk of 20 per cent losses on a portfolio of these loans .
Bad news ?
Not for creative investment bankers .
Out of this portfolio of low - quality loans , they can create supposedly high quality bonds by putting in place covenants which stipulate that the first 20 per cent of losses would be attributed to one bunch of really poisonous bonds , usually called toxic waste , leaving the rest of the bonds almost as safe as US Treasury bonds ( in theory ) .
Before we move on , it ’s probably worth recapping the phoney assumptions made by the investment banks as they create these bonds :
1 ) That historic data on default rates is useful even though the market has exploded in size
2 ) That data of any sort is useful even though the system for originating the loans , with mortgage brokers paid by the volume of loans they make , actually encourages fraud .
So far , so disturbing .
But it gets worse .
Because the demand for toxic waste is n’t as huge as all that ( some purchasers of this poison have suffered horrendous losses ) , investment banks have looked for ways to slice and dice the toxic waste , to create something almost edible .
They ’ve mixed it up with other securities in collateralised debt obligations , which are bonds created out of other bonds – or sometimes they are bonds created out of bonds , that are in turn created out of other bonds ( collateralised debt obligations squared , as if you wanted to know ) .
Even these bonds made of bonds rely to a worrying extent on all that dodgy historic data to determine their risk of default – the credit risk – or the risk that they ’ll be vulnerable to interest - rate changes .
But notice too that once the original sub - prime loan is in a collateralised debt obligation , that loan could be one of perhaps a million different loans all mashed together to form this new bond .
What that means is that the eventual purchaser of the collateralised debt obligation has no more idea what ’s in that bond than a sap eating a Turkey Twizzler knows what he or she is eating .
Little wonder that when there ’s a global scare about what may actually be in these bonds , no one wants to touch them .
That said , the investment banker will argue , on the basis of portfolio theory , if you put one load of toxic waste with another seemingly independent load of toxic waste , then the risk of holding them will fall .
But for that to be true , each bunch of toxic waste would have to be uncorrelated to the other bunch – and that ai n’t necessarily so .
Here ’s the bottom line : for the past few years , Wall Street has operated a giant machine for turning mind - boggling amounts of US home loans – which are hugely vulnerable to losses from fraud and the inescapable cycles in interest rates and housing prices – into supposedly risk - free investments for risk - averse investors in Asia , the Middle East and ( as it turns out ) for Europe ’s big banks .
Now if I worked for Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch or the other big US investment banks , I might be considering my career options at the moment .
It is inconceivable that they will escape unscathed from this debacle .
Whatever the financial cost to these banks , which will not be trivial , there will also be significant damage to their reputations .
Europe ’s shame
But Europe ’s banks are hardly blameless either .
If the underlying cause of the global financial crisis is fraud and greed in the US home loans system – from mortgage broker to investment bank – the trigger of the crisis was chronic folly by big international lending banks , notably some in Europe .
I am talking about banks ’ use of “ conduits ” and “ structured investment vehicles ” ( SIVs ) .
These are special off - balance sheet companies set up by banks for borrowing cheap short - term funds from the money markets in the form of securities known as asset - backed commercial paper .
Now , as their name implies , the commercial paper is secured against asset - backed securities , such as mortgage - backed securities and collateralised debt obligations .
According to Citigroup , European conduits held more than $ 500bn of assets to back commercial paper at the end of March .
But there ’s an intrinsic weakness to this funding : commercial paper of short duration has been sold by banks to finance their purchases of long - dated bonds whose assets include those dodgy sub - prime loans to US homeowners .
It ’s a classic liquidity mismatch , except when there ’s a reliable , active market for such bonds .
To reiterate , European banks have been borrowing money that has to be repaid or rolled - over every 90 days to fund their ownership – direct or indirect – of 30 - year US home loans .
They did this because they received more from the holdings of asset - backed bonds and collateralised debt obligations than they paid out in interest on the commercial paper .
In theory , they made an attractive return .
Here ’s the Catch 22 : such funding schemes only work while the market has confidence in the value of the collateral backing the commercial paper .
When investors start to have qualms about asset - backed bonds and collateralised debt obligations , banks are squeezed in a vice : short - term funding disappears and there is a collapse in the value of the assets they hold .
So what happened over the past fortnight was a highly predictable – except by the big banks – double whammy .
Lenders to banks refused to repurchase commercial paper when it matured .
And the banks that issued that paper faced a funding crisis , because they were unable to sell the collateral or raise new money against it .
Everyone had suddenly woken up to the idea that this allegedly safe collateral of mortgage - backed securities and collateralised debt obligations was the equivalent of a palace built on paper foundations .
That inability of major banks to raise short term finance is why the European Central Bank – and the US Federal Reserve and other central banks – recently pumped tens of billions of pounds of additional liquidity into the banking market at interest rates well below the new market rates ( that had risen sharply ) .
This was subsidised lending by the ECB and the Fed .
They have been bailing out silly behaviour by banks that should have known better .
State - insured banks had no business engaging in such short - sighted financial engineering , which is a million miles from their core banking operations on behalf of Europe ’s consumers and companies .
There is – contra the Economist – a serious moral hazard problem here .
The Bank of England , by contrast , would only lend emergency funds to banks at a punitive interest rate , which seems a more prudent way to be the lender of last resort .
What horrors await
On Friday , in an attempt to shore up the US housing market , and by extension the value of all those crappy mortgage - backed bonds , the Fed signalled that interest rates would come down for all of us sooner rather than later .
But that ’s to treat the symptoms rather than the disease itself .
To avoid a repeat of this kind of crisis , there needs to be a return to lenders taking some responsibility for the loans they make .
Most bankers now think it ’s quaint and absurd that once - upon - a time a bank manager actually managed a loan book and even talked to the individuals to whom he or she lent .
Our brave new world – in which a Parisian or Frankfurt bank does n’t even know whether it ’s exposed to the US housing market through its Turkey Twizzler collateralised debt obligations – is neither healthy or sustainable .
Everyone has a list of things they 'd like to see in a president .
There 's the usual : honesty , charisma , " gravitas , " good looks , moral grounding , faith .
If you 're a Democrat , you tend to tack on other considerations : intelligence , knows how to write prose , has read at least 5 books within the last 5 years without any prodding from Karl Rove , has an American passport and has used said passport to travel to a foreign country ( Canada does n't count ) , and does n't hate gay people and / or want to throw them off cliffs .
Well , I 'm going to add another qualification for 2008 and I think it may actually be among the most important : understands Islam and Muslims .
And you get extra points for actually having lived in a Muslim country .
If you 've studied at a madrasa , even better .
Take a look at this clip from 2002 where Obama explains his opposition to the Iraq war .
I do n't want to set the bar too low , but he clearly grasps the difference between Sunnis , Shias , and Kurds and understands that a war could splinter the country into different ethno- religious factions .
This , for me , is why Barack Obama is such an attractive candidate .
He 's the only candidate who has any " natural " understanding of the region .
He should hype this part of his resume and say it straight - up : " we 're fighting a war on terror , one that is taking place mostly in the Muslim world .
We 're fighting a long and difficult struggle against the forces of Islamic extremism .
At the same time , we 're trying to convince 1.4 billion Muslims that we 're not out to get them .
We need a president who understands this region of the world and who is familiar with the aspirations , fears , and sensibilities of our Muslim friends abroad .
I am that person .
If you grant me your support , I will restore our moral leadership in the eyes of the very people who have come to distrust us most .
I will reach out to the Muslim world like no president before me , and I will begin to rebuild the bridges that my predecessor burned . "
Derive Your Dreams
12:21 06/05/28 うたひめ 先日の記事に書いたように KOKIA にハマりまして、 とりあえず片っ端から聴いてみることにしました。まずは 1st アルバムの 『 songbird 』 から … … ４曲目 の " 白い雪 " ヤバい。超ヤバい。なんだこれ。ツボすぎる。 ベスト盤を聴いたとき感じた揺らぎなく落ち着いた歌唱力的な曲を期待して聴きはじめたら、 予想外の声質の歌が飛び込んできてびっくりしました。もちろん抜群に巧いのに かわりはないんですが、ずっと儚げな、ガラス細工みたいなイメージの、ああ、その、 つまり白い雪みたいな雰囲気の綺麗な声で。その声と奇跡的にマッチしたメロディ。 すごいなあ 。９曲目の " ありがとう … " もベスト盤でのリテイクと比べて同じ印象で、
Amazon のreview で TenderBerry さんという方が近いことを書いておられました。 しかし書いてて自分の語彙のなさが悲しくなってきたよ。 『trip trip』 も買ってあるのであとで聴こうと思います 。
13:17 06/05/23 next / previous たつをさんによる 「 次 」 と「前」の意味と並び順 という調査記事。面白い。 しかしこれ、なんでどのサービスも「次 」
「前」なんていうわっかりにくい言葉を 選んでいるんでしょう。例えば「新しい記事へ 」「古い記事へ 」 って表示すれば紛れがなくてよいと思うんですが…。
「 新しい 」 「 古い 」だと、 " 表示中のページからの相対で " という意味が薄れる気がする？ 矢印や >>
を添えて相対感を補うとか。「より新しい記事」や「 もっと古い記事 」 だと長く感じるのかな。
特に 「次の○○件」みたいな使い方をしたい場合、
「 新しい○○件」にしてしまうと確かにニュアンス違うかもしれない。 これはもう「○○件」とか具体的な件数出すのやめでいいじゃん。ダメ？
あるいは 「 次のページ」ならいいけど「新しいページ」だと
Wiki のページでも新規作成しそうだ 。
「 古い」になんとなくネガティブなイメージがある？
それでも「次 」 「前」よりはマシではないかなあ。 ちなみに、この日記のナビゲーションは上のようなことをしばし考えた結果、
「 一つ過去のページ 」 「一つ未来のページ」に落ち着いています。これはこれで
日本語として斬新すぎて自分でもちょっと笑えるのが最大の問題。
KOKIA 『pearl ～ The Best Collection～ 』 を聴きまくっています。 このアルバムだ と15 曲目の「 ありがとう 」 をBGM…というか効果音に使ってる動画を見かけて、
いい歌だなーと思って購入。調べてみたら有名なflashにも使われてたらしい。知らんかった。
ベスト盤だからというのはあるにしても、自分にとってハズレが一曲もないアルバムというのは
とても珍しい。ほとんどの場合はよくても一、二曲は肌に合わないのがあるもんなんですが、
これは全曲好きです。知るきっかけとなった
" ありがとう … " も勿論いいし、 " Desperado " も…最初聴いたときはオリジナルと比べて
薄い感じ？とか思ったけどこれもいいかと１分で思い直したり…
いいし、 リズミカル な
" So much love with you " も素晴らしい 。
15:29 06/05/17 文字コード＆ベイズ推定 （ブラウザなりテキストエディタなりの）文字コードの自動判別を学習型の
ベイジアンフィルタでやったら便利なのでは、と、さっきふと思ったりしました。
よくある実装は、「ある文字コードだと仮定したときにちゃんと読めるバイト列かどうか判定 」
と「各文字コードごとのバイト値出現頻度表を用意しといて比較」と、あと適当に幾つか
場当たり的なチェックを組み合わせる感じだと思います。 auto_ef や Mozilla はそんな雰囲気 。IE のはどうなんだろう。ちなみに
GreenPad のはもっとずっと手抜き。 実はもっと洗練された判別アルゴリズムがあるのかも。まあいいや。 そういうのと比べると、 「 文字コードに関する静的な知識を持っていなくても、適当に その文字コードの文書をかき集めてきて学習させれば判別エンジンが作れる、ような気がする 」
（" 読み書きはもっとたくさんの対応しているけど、自動判定は
ShiftJIS /EUC-JP/ISO-2022-JP/UTF-8 のみ対応です、他を含めると精度良い判別ができないので "
みたいなことを言わなくて済む、ような気がする。）「いざ判定をミスったときにも、
ユーザーが指示して学習させれば次開くときはその文書（およびそれと似た内容かつ同じ
文字コードの文書）については判定を間違わないようにする、のが簡単そう 」
（自動判別ミスをバグ報告されたりしたときに判定アルゴリズムを手動で改良してみたり、
無理ですごめんなさいと言ったりしなくていい。）（別にミスったときでなくても、
ユーザーの扱う文書の傾向に合わせて学習できたりするかも？）といった辺りが便利かな、と。
精度がどのくらい出るものかはよくわかりませんが…。
書いてて激しく既出な気がしてきたので検索してみると、 mikioさんの開発メモが引っかかりました。言語の自動判別まで含めてのお話ですが、
近いものは色々ありそう…。文字コードの判別だけに特化したらもっと簡単に精度あがったり
しないかな。 Brouwer そういえば先週のサナギさんでブラウワーがネタになっていて笑。 はやりもの ヲタ漫画経験値 やってみました 。
×127 △ 42 ○ 23 ◎8。うへ、全然知らない…。
ちなみに◎は、山名沢湖、鬼頭莫宏、吉崎観音、あずまきよひこ、鳥山明、冨樫義博、 久米田康治、小畑健。なんというか、エニックス系の人が数人しかリストになくて これはきついというか、自分の買う漫画はとてもそっち方面に偏りすぎなことを改めて認識。
21:25 06/05/07 知らないこと ある日記サイトで読んだ文章が記憶に残っています。
中学生のころ、何の時間だったか、先生が黒板に小ぶりな円を描いた。
「 いろんなことをたくさん勉強すれば物知りになって、知らないことやわからないことが少なくなると思いますか」

「 まったく反対です。勉強すればするほど、知らないことやわからないことがどんどん増えていきます」
そこで先生は、黒板の円を指した。 続きは 「 日々是好日 」 ２００４年１０月２０ 日 をどうぞ 。" 無知の知 " 的なよくある話かもしれません。 しかし、印象に残るたとえだと思いました。どこまでスケールするかはともかく、 これを読んで以来、 " 知識 " を漠然と " 円 " としてイメージする癖がついてしまっています。 たらい トラックバック受信のかわりの手動逆リンク集。 くるるさんによる証明 と、 山形さんによるそのメモ 。Moore の方法を ( m2, m1, m3 ) で回すと本質的にほとんど同じになるのかもしれません。「自然数の範囲で 考えれ ばOK 」という観察が - min( x , y,z ) で、あと はmaxで外側の帰納法 → yが大きい場合は自明 → そうでない場合は中でxで内側の帰納法、という形になっているので。 確かに言われてみれば、xの帰納法には上限がありました。 住井さんによ
るMcCarthyの証明の紹介。すみませんScienceDirectにアクセス できるIPアドレスを得にいくのが面倒で手抜きしてました…(汗。ありがとうございます。
DTAK0 ( X, Y , Z ) = DTAK00 ( X - Y , Z-Y ) ここまでは、x-y や z-y 辺りを指標として使うのはありに思えました（nucさんもその方向をイメージして らしたみたい。）が、その先が物凄いですね。もう少しはなんとかなりそうな…確かに、 表現を変えればもっとわかりやすい帰納法だったりするのかもしれません。
21:47 06/05/03 Ruby と D言語 D言語の開発者である Walter Bright 氏への Bitwise誌によるインタビュー に、何度も Ruby が登場してて面白かったのでご紹介。 一部訳出してみます と
Huw : つい先日 、Ruby と D が同時に TIOBE の プログラミング言語 'ト ッ プ20 ' にランクインしました。構文の見た目は、Ruby と
D では随分と違いますが、共通の特徴がいくつもあるのも確かです（例えば、かなり'純粋な'オブジェクト指向、簡潔な構文、GC、モジュールとmixin、クロージャ)。こういった
Ruby と
D の類似には、表面的なもの以上の何かがあるのでしょうか？
Walter Bright : Ruby と
D には、興味深い共通項がたくさんあります 。Ruby は
Perl の reengineering として開発が始まっていて 、Perl は C++ と ある意味でよく似ています（訳注 : D は C++ の reengineering 、という触れ込みの言語）。 Ruby は一人の開発者の、純粋にプログラミング言語が好きだという気持ちから生まれた言語であって、これも
D と同じです 。Ruby も D も、 " プログラマの必要に応えるため " 以外の隠れた開発意図はありません ‐ だから、大企業がバックについて予算を投入したりせずとも、広くプログラマに受け入れられました。おそらく、この二つの言語の間の根本的な違いは、Rubyはインタプリタ系の、動的型の言語であることで、D はネイティブコンパイルの、静的型の言語であることでしょう。 色々突っ込みたい …
D が fairly ' pure ' OOP ?
… ところはありますけど、それは おくとして。私も D の " template を mixin " する設計を見たとき真っ先に 思い出したのが " module を mixin " する Ruby だったりして、近いところはあるなあと いう気はしていました 。
Huw : D は除くとすると、いまどきのプログラミング言語の中で、一番面白い、あるいは一番可能性を秘めていると思うのはどれですか？
Walter Bright : 疑問の余地はないですね。注目すべきは
Ruby です。 だそうですよ。 ちなみにこの紹介を書いた私の隠された意図は 、Rubyを褒めている記事を 引用すること でRubyistの目 をD言語に惹きつけてみるテスト、という下心なのですが、
そんなことをしている暇があったらむしろ自分がRubyを勉強せねば、とつい 数日前に思ったのだった…。
15:47 06/05/02 停止性 いえいえバッチリOKです。 ということで、検索してみました。Boyer&Moore の定理証明 系Nqthmを使った証明 （ Moore , 1979 ） が一発目ですね。その論文自体はちょっと見つからなかったのですが、実際の証明デモの サンプ ル( PDF ) を発見。 三種類のメジャー m1 , m2 , m3 を定義して、 ( m1 ( x , y, z ) , m 2 ( x , y, z ) , m3 ( x , y , z ) ) で超限帰納法してるみたいです。方針はそれしかないとは思ったのですが… m 1 ( x , y,z ) = if x≦y then 0 else 1 m2 ( x , y, z ) = max ( x , y , z ) - min( x , y , z ) m3 ( x , y, z ) = x - min( x , y , z ) 2ω2。これどうやって思いつくんだろう…。Moore 以前にも、 McKarthy が別の（もっと複雑な）順序を入れて証明しているらしい。
TARAI が止まらない そして上記の結果を引用している論文を眺めていたら 、
Tom Bailey , John Cowles , " Knuth 's Generalization of Takeuchi's Tarai Function : Preliminary Report " ( 2000 ) がなかなか面白いです 。Knuthが、たらいまわし関数 のN引数に一般化バージョンを提唱して いるらしく。 t( x [ 1 ] , x [ 2 ] , ... , x [ N ] ) = if x [ 1 ] <= x [ 2 ] then x [ 2 ] else t( t ( x [ 1 ] - 1 , x [ 2 ] , ... , x [ N ] ) , t( x [ 2 ] - 1 , x [ 3 ] , ... , x [ 1 ] ) , t( x [ 3 ] - 1 , x [ 4 ] , ... , x [ 2 ] ) , ... , t( x [ N ] - 1 , x [ 1 ] , ... , x [ N - 1 ] ) ) こういうもの
。N=3の場合がいわゆる竹内/たらい/tak/tarai関数ですね。さて問題。
N>3 のときも、上の等式を満たす関数はそもそも存在するか？
存在するなら、上の式に従ってcall-by-needで計算すると計算は停止するか？ 停止するなら、call-by-valueで計算したときもやはり停止するだろうか？ 1 まず１番目は…昨日向井さんに教えていただいたような、「大小関係に応じて引数の
どれかを返す関数 」 の一般化バージョンになるんじゃないの？と予想できます。 λ ( x [ 1 ] , ... , x [ N ] ) . if x [ 1 ] ≦ x [ 2 ] then x [ 2 ] else if x [ 2 ] ≦x [ 3 ] then x [ 3 ] else ... if x [ N - 1 ] ≦x [ N ] then x [ N ] else x [ 1 ] 実際これは N=3 では正しかったし 、N=4 でも正しい。ところが N=5 では成立しない。 t( 5,3,2,0,1 ) が反例らしいです。これに気づいたKnuthは、↑の関数を一段複雑にしたような
関数を定義して、それが等式を満たすことを…
" 手ではたぶん証明できたと思うが、二度と チェックする気が起きない。誰か計算機で機械証明して欲しい " … という形 でOpen Problemと して記します。しかしそ のKnuthバージョンにも9年後、N=6での反例 が 発見されているとのこと。 2 Knuthは1と同時に、call-by-needなら止まる、という証明も与えていたそうなのですが、
反例が見つかってしまった誤った定式化に基づいていたので、これも一旦白紙に戻って、
Open Problem。 3 call - by - value ではどうか？ N=3 のときは、今日の記事の一番上に上げたような証明で、 止まることが知られている。しかし 、N=4 のとき call - by - value では止まらない という例 が2000 年に示されているそうな。t ( 3,2,1,5 ) が無限ループするそうです。 ...
と、こんな風な絶妙な境界線上に載っている楽しいテーマなんだそうな。
この論文自体は、1.にKnuthバージョンとは別の「今度こそ正しいはず」解を与えて、 2.については、「止まる」というConjectureを主張しているもの。
ACL2 を使って完全な機械証明を与えようとしている途中とのこと。手では証明できている
つもりで何度もチェックしているけれど、Knuthの例もあるから…みたいな雰囲気で。
14:45 06/05/01 たらいまわし関数 またこの話ですすみません。 f( x , y,z ) = if x <= y then y else f( f ( x - 1 , y, z ) , f ( y - 1, z , x ) , f ( z - 1, x , y ) ) この計算は、経験的には、どんな整数３つを引数にしても停止するようです。
で、前からずっと気になっていたのが、これの停止性ってどうやって証明すればいいんだろう？
という疑問。あと、経験的には返値はx,y, zのどれかなんですけど、これもなんでだろう。 fの返値を再度fに与えてるので、両方同時に解かないといけない問題な気はする。 <= と - 1 しかしていないので、初期値のoffsetは停止性には無関係。
なので適当にずらしながら自然数引数の場合だけ考える手があるのかもしれないが、
そうすると引数が普通の順序では単調減少でなくなるので、単純な帰納法にはならない。
うーん？ という感じで、いい考えが思いつきません。 エレガントな証明が知られてそうな予感がすごくするのですが。 追記 なるほど！ でも、例えばちと無理矢理ですが g n = if n <= 0 then 1 else g ( n+1 ) - g ( n - 1 ) この等式は普通のフィボナッチ関数を当てはめると成り立ちますが、 この g は1以上の値を喰わせると停止しません。つまりある等式が
( \x y z -> if x <= y then y else if y <= z then z else x ) を当てはめると成り立つとしても、それがちゃんと停止してこの関数を 計算してくれるかどうかはただちに明らかではないような…。 （前略） …そういう閉鎖的なスタイルは、誰にとっても得がない上に誰にとっても損があるのでは
ないかと。自分は、ACM会員だけ見られるページに論文があればそこにリンクするし、
dat落ちした2chスレにも必要なら言及するし、もし仮に全てのchatのlogやpersonal conversationにURIが振られる日が来たら、そのURIを全て貼り付けながら日記を書くでしょう。

The BBC says its reporter John Sweeney was mistaken to lose his temper with a Scientologist during an interview for Panorama .
How To Aug 24 , 2004 Tricks of the Trade
For every occupation , there is a catalog of secrets only its employees know — such as how waiters with heavy platters know to look straight ahead , and never down .
Armed with a bag of reader mail , we unfurl a whole lot more true insider knowledge .
A while back I read an interview with a children ’s birthday clown .
At one point the interviewer asked , “ What if you ’re dying out there ?
What if the kids are hating it ? ”
And the clown revealed a fascinating trick of the birthday clown trade :
Every year , it seems , there are two or three funny words that invariably crack kids up , and when things are going sour , you can blurt one out and bring the house down .
But a clown ’s got to keep up to date , because the funny words mysteriously change over time .
Where “ booger ” might have killed in 1998 , 2004 demands nothing less than an “ underpants . ”
Curiously , I ’ve noticed an almost identical aspect in the software development trade .
Every year there seems to be a technical whatsit that management recognizes as the sexy - cool new thing but does n’t really understand .
This year , for instance , a programmer can always tack the phrase “ and I ’m thinking of incorporating some XML functionality ” onto a project summary to explain why he ’ll need an extra week , account for a missed deadline , or impress a superior .
In this respect , the gap between software engineers and birthday clowns is almost negligible .
Wondering if there were more of these , I recently asked readers for their “ tricks of the trade , ” and was amazed by the response .
It seems every profession is rich with clever little occupational secrets .
Here are some of the best of what I received .
Actor
Every actor eventually is called upon to act drunk .
Most do this by slurring their speech , stumbling around , and perhaps drooling a bit .
This is what a freshman drama teacher calls “ indicating . ”
A better way to appear drunk is to act very , very sober .
Walk very carefully , and try not to let anyone see that you ’re inebriated .
This is much more subtle and will register on a level the audience wo n’t immediately recognize .
Attorney
Do whatever it takes to fit your contracts onto a single page : Format with single - spacing , use a 10 - or 9 - point font , and reduce the margins to less than an inch .
Most people assume any contract that fits on one page will be simple and straightforward , and even sophisticated negotiators can be charmed by the lack of a staple .
Auto Mechanic
Always put copper grease on the battery terminals after servicing a car .
The performance benefit is negligible , but when customers look under the hood they will immediately see that something ’s changed and thus feel happy to pay you .
Balloon - Twister
When you ’re twisting balloons for children , never tell them what you ’re making .
The majority of the finished products — despite your best attempts — almost always look like a dog , a blastula , or something vaguely phallic .
If you identify what you ’re actually attempting to make , the children will respond to your finished product with , “ That does n’t look like a [ insert animal name ] … ” But if you make the animals and then ask , “ What does it look like to you ? ” the child ’s imagination will take over , turning the blue , four - legged balloon into Blue from Blue ’s Clues , the blastula into a Pokemon , and the phallic object into an elephant .
You ’ll also get bonus points because you were so cool for making exactly what they wanted .
Botanist
When working in the field , stick a strip of duct tape to your pants .
You can take it off while working to quickly remove large masses of ticks , biting ants , and thorns .
If you know the length of each of your fingers as well as your handbreadth in centimeters , you can measure the leaves of most plants without having to pull the ruler out of your backpack .
And when doing botanical work in South America , steer clear of the monkeys :
They will throw sticks at you with surprising accuracy .
Butcher
In Australia , the butchers have a secret language called “ rechtub klat ” that they use to gossip about customers without getting caught .
The code is formed by speaking words backward .
Old - timers could have entire conversations in the language , but these days a core vocabulary of about 20 to 30 essential words are used .
Sometimes , if a word ca n’t really be pronounced backwards , a couple of letters will be traded around ( e.g. , “ tish ” for “ shit ” ) , or the first letter might be pronounced separately ( e.g. , “ bmal ” is pronounced “ beemal ” ) .
The most common words are :
kool , toh lrig
cuf ecaf
on erom feeb / gip / bmal
traf
toor
doog tsub
tish
doog esra
gaf
Nothing is more enjoyable than shouting at the top of your lungs to the other butchers that the difficult customer right in front of you is a “ on doog cuf ecaf . ”
Cardboard Box Flattener
When hitting the sealed bottom of a cardboard box to flatten it , do not punch it with your knuckles like you ’re boxing — that will start to hurt real quick .
Instead , strike it with the bottom of your fist , as if your hand were a gavel .
Cartographer
Mapmakers will often use “ copyright traps , ” bits of information in their maps that are purposefully wrong .
They might label a body of water “ Lake Strongbad , ” for instance , and then examine the next editions of competitors ’ maps to see if the incorrect information makes an appearance .
Clarinetist
Clarinetists in orchestras often need to swap between a clarinet in the key of B - flat and one in the key of A right in the middle of a piece — with only about two seconds to spare .
To do this they must yank the mouthpiece off the instrument they ’re playing , grab the other clarinet from its stand , shove the mouthpiece onto the new clarinet , and drop the other one onto the stand .
Worse , clarinets are black , clarinet stands are black , and this maneuver is usually done in the darkness of a concert hall .
So what many clarinetists do to know which clarinet they ’re holding is place a piece of blue painter ’s tape on the back of one , or use thumb rests of different colors .
And to help aim for the clarinet stand , some paint theirs with glow - in - the - dark paint .
Desktop Support
When desktop support technicians resolve a ticket , they are usually required to document the cause and solution to the problem .
Supervisors see these records , so you have to be professional , but can usually get away with using the acronym “ PEBKAC ” in situations where the user caused the initial problem .
PEBKAC stands for “ Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair . ”
Forester
Never walk behind another person in the woods , because yellow jackets build their nests underground .
The first person in line will disturb the nest when they walk over it , but it ’s the poor suckers trailing behind who catch the wrath of the stirred - up bees .
You can generally tell the more experienced forester in the group because he ’ll be the one in the lead .
The senior forester also will be the one either driving the truck or sitting in the middle seat ; it ’s the guy who ’s riding “ shotgun ” who has to get out to open and close every gate they encounter .
Graphic Designer
If you have a client who is unable to approve a proposed design without putting her stamp on it , just put an obvious error in the proposal : a logo that ’s too large , a font that ’s too small , or a few judiciously seeded typos .
The client requests the change and feels she ’s done her part — and your design , which was perfect all along , sails through to approval .
Jeweler
When setting a semiprecious gem , set a tiny piece of silver or gold foil behind it to make it sparkle .
Also , because most stones are pretty irregular ( being stones and all ) , fill the base of the setting with sawdust so the stone will set evenly .
Juggler
With any routine under seven minutes ( which is almost all of them ) , you only really need one thing : a good closer .
And there are only two things you really need to know about a great closer .
First , it needs to be impressive .
That sounds obvious , but most beginning jugglers think “ difficult ” and “ impressive ” are synonymous .
Your closer must look hard , but there ’s no real reason it has to be hard .
Secondly , you should intentionally blow your closer on the first two tries .
If you get it on the first try it looks too easy , but if you “ miss ” it a few times it looks harder and builds tension .
Landscape Architect
You will often have to create a large presentation for clients , and will spend hours coloring in landscape illustrations with markers .
But if you say the drawings are “ rendered ” rather than “ colored , ” you can charge four times as much .
Lounge Pianist
Never agree to Christmas sing - alongs if there is alcohol involved .
Your singer will only remember the first two lines of his favorite tunes , or you ’ll waste a half - hour on a drawn - out , stumbling , “ 12 Days of Christmas . ”
The singer will be forgiven when he sobers up , but you ’ll look unprofessional .
Massage Therapist
In massage , properly orienting the top sheet over the client is referred to as “ draping . ”
To keep female clients from having their breasts exposed while draping them for an abdominal massage , start with the client face up with the top sheet fully covering her from the neck down .
Now , put a pillowcase over her neck , rumpled up .
Pinching the pillowcase and sheet together , pull both down , with the pillowcase unraveling and trailing the sheet down the client ’s body .
Once the pillowcase has covered the breasts , leave it behind and continue with only the sheet until her abdomen is exposed .
Tuck in pillowcase and sheet , and voila !
Mechanic
If you have to change a light bulb where the glass is broken , you can press a potato into the metal base to unscrew the remains of the bulb from the fixture .
Newspaper Headline Writer
If you ca n’t think of a headline for a story , use one of these three magic verbs : “ weighs , ” “ mulls , ” or “ considers . ”
They ’ll work for pretty much anything from court stories ( “ Hamilton mulls plea deal ” ) to government stories ( “ Governor weighs Paseo extension ” ) to entertainment ( “ Colvin considers new album ” ) to features ( “ Benson mulls those who consider weighing Kasey ’s artwork ” ) .
Nurse
Patients will occasionally pretend to be unconscious .
A surefire way to find them out is to pick up their hand , hold it above their face , and let go .
If they smack themselves , they ’re most likely unconscious ; if not , they ’re faking .
Paramedic
When paramedics arrive at a car crash or similar accident , they very , very rarely announce any casualties at the scene — almost all deceased will be pronounced “ dead on arrival ” at the hospital .
This is because it involves about 10 times more paperwork to announce someone dead right in situ than it does to say they expired in the ambulance on the way to the hospital .
Photographer
When taking family portraits that include a dog , do n’t use the dog ’s name or say “ doggie , doggie ” to get its attention , because it might trot over to you .
Instead , call out “ kitty , kitty , kitty . ”
The dog will perk up and look around for a cat , and you can get a great shot if you time it right .
Piano Salesman
If you see a potential customer eyeing a piano , estimate their age and calculate what year it was when they were 18 years old .
Play a big hit from that year on the piano they ’re looking at .
With a lot of preparation and a little luck , you might play the exact song they were listening to when they lost their virginity , got married , or drove their first car .
The emotional resonance will overcome sales resistance and even open their wallets to a more expensive piano .
Proofreader
If you ’re reading too fast , your brain can “ correct ” typos , preventing you from catching them .
That ’s why it ’s sometimes a good idea to read a page upside - down .
It forces you to pay closer attention to individual words out of context , and you ca n’t race through pages too fast .
Software Tester
Because developers do n’t expect testers to read through their code , doing so is a quick and easy way to find possible bugs .
Look for comments like “ // HACK ” or “ // fix this crap later . ”
Street Performer
In street performance , it ’s possible to make money without really knowing how to play your instrument .
You can pick up a cheap accordion at a thrift store and simply make stuff up on the street corner .
Most people usually wo n’t stick around and listen for long if you are on a sidewalk where there ’s little room to stand , and you can play the same thing over and over and still make money .
Technical Support
When helping someone fix their computer over the phone , and you want them to see if all the cables are plugged in correctly , do n’t ask , “ Have you checked to see if the cable is plugged in ? ” because the customer will always say , “ Of course I did , do you think I ’m a moron ? ”
Instead say , “ Remove the cable , blow the dust out of the connector , and plug it back in . ”
The customer will most likely reply , “ Hey , it ’s working now — I guess that dust really builds up in there ! ”
Waitress
When you realize you have forgotten to submit an order to the kitchen , go to the table and mournfully say , “ Did you just hear that crash ? ”
Nine times out of 10 , the customers not only will say “ yes , ” but actually will believe they just heard a noise of some sort .
You can then sigh sadly , and say , “ Unfortunately , that was the chef dropping your food , ” and then scurry back to the kitchen to hand in the neglected order .
Wedding Coordinator
People ’s fingers swell when they get nervous .
So , when exchanging rings , tell couples to only slide the ring up to the first knuckle and let the other person push it up the rest of the way .
Otherwise you run the risk of the groom breaking his bride ’s finger in the middle of the ceremony .
Iraq ’s prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , is rising a notch in my estimation .
He ’s begun to snap back at his American critics .
Bully for him .
Arrogant American politicians , in calling for his ouster , shed all pretense of any interest in democracy .
Clearly they see themselves as imperial overlords dissatisfied with someone they consider an American stooge .
American generals even now are starting to talk about the need for a dictator , though they do n’t use that term .
Maybe , they are telling journalists , democracy for Iraq was n’t such a good idea after all .
Nevertheless , Maliki is the legitimately chosen head of a legitimately elected government .
It ’s not up to American senators and presidential candidates to decide who should be prime minister of Iraq .
These empty - headed windbags would n’t dream of calling for the ouster of the British prime minister .
That they so readily do so in the case of Iraq simply shows you how they disdain the democracy they claim to support .
In fairness to Maliki , it should be pointed out that the much - publicized hand - over of " sovereignty " to the Iraqi government was and is a sham .
Iraq ’s army has to answer to the Americans , not to the Iraqi government .
Iraq has no intelligence agency .
The intelligence agency was set up and is run by the CIA .
The U.S. is still the occupier of Iraq , and there is relatively little freedom of the Iraqi government to set its own policies .
Add to that the fact that the Iraqi government , regardless of who leads it , is stuck with a country that we " bombed back into the preindustrial age , " to use the boastful phrase of Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf during the first Gulf War .
Then , with our singularly inept attempt at occupation , we fired its government and its army .
If every member of the Iraqi parliament had a genius IQ , they ’d have a hard time digging themselves out of the hole we dug for the country .
The Iraqi fiasco is a black comedy  black because of the tragic loss of life and suffering it has caused , but a comedy nevertheless because of the Three Stooges - type antics of American officials , beginning with President Bush .
The president has misled and continues to mislead the American people in an attempt to rationalize his failed policy .
His pathetically juvenile claim that the terrorists would follow Americans home if the U.S. withdrew from Iraq is laughable .
Al - Qaeda declared war on us long before we did it the enormous favor of invading Iraq , thus both reinforcing al - Qaeda ’s propaganda and providing it with a new recruitment and training ground .
Mr. Bush ’s ill - fated war has not only increased the stock of the world ’s terrorists , but it replaced a Sunni- led government with a Shi’ite - led government that is close to Iran .
You could n’t screw this situation up any worse than if you had let Osama bin Laden plan the invasion .
I have never seen such a stupid administration as this one .
And make no mistake  there is no easy solution or way out of this morass .
Just as so many knowledgeable people , both here and in the Middle East , warned the president beforehand , he has set loose the wild dogs of war , chaos and havoc in a previously stable region and does n’t have any idea at all of how to round them up .
I long ago predicted the end result of this blundering around would be a new dictatorship , because a brutally strong central authority is the only way Iraq ’s feuding factions can be controlled .
This time , however , it likely will be someone allied to Iran .
Iraq ’s misery and difficulties remind me of a quotation from a Turkish officer who said , " The trouble with being an ally of the United States is that you can never tell when it ’s going to decide to stab itself in the back . "
Amen .
The crew members were in a convoy of three cars and two motorbikes , which was reportedly ushered through two checkpoints in Sydney 's APEC security zone .
The convoy was pulled over in Macquarie Street in a block adjacent to the InterContinental Hotel where US President George Bush is staying .
All 11 have been bailed to appear in the Downing Centre Local Court on October 4 .
NSW Police Minister David Campbell denied he was embarrassed by the comedians ' ability to penetrate APEC 's restricted zone - rather , he was pleased the " multi- layered ' ' security had worked .
He said the prank was inappropriate and he " did not see the funny side at all ' ' .
The Chaser 's production team had been specifically warned by police to behave responsibly during the APEC security lockdown , he said .
" [ The police ] said : ' We understand that parody and satire are entertaining and fun , many people watch the program and enjoy it , but please understand the seriousness of this matter and please take caution as you go about making your program . '
" That seems to have been thrown out the window and that , I think , is inappropriate . "
Their motorcade , branded with the Canadian flag , is understood to have passed through at least one police checkpoint in the declared zone .
The vehicle was pulled over near the corner of Bridge and Macquarie streets .
A police statement said the show 's producers were earlier this week urged to consider the ramification of stunts during APEC .
No charges were brought when the team dressed up as a police horse yesterday .
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said that the fact the Chaser team was arrested showed the security system worked .
But he told an APEC news conference : " Whatever you think of the humour of the Chaser ... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way .
" They presumably were , as is the nature of their show , aiming to humiliate a lot of well - known people . "
Chaser team member Chris Taylor told smh.com.au that the motorcade comprised " three cars , a couple of motorbikes , and a lot of crew " .
" It was a motorcade trying to get into the exclusion zone , " he said .
" No particular reason we chose Canada , " said Taylor .
" We just thought they'd be a country who the cops would n't scrutinise too closely , and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade - as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him . "
The vehicles in the motorcade were hired - two were black SUVs imported from the US , and the other was a regular car .
Police superintendent Ken McKay confirmed the arrests had been made using new powers available under the APEC Act .

Top ' Attorneygate ' investigator : No ' blind faith ' for the White House Michael Roston
Published : Thursday July 19 , 2007 Print This Email This
On a 7 - 3 ruling , House Democrats moved rapidly Thursday afternoon to rule that the White House had asserted executive privilege in a manner that was ' not legally valid . '
During the proceedings , a top House Democratic investigator of the firing of nine US Attorneys said that the White House 's latest moves were not consistent with the current system of government in the United States .
Another top Democrat accused the White House of turning over ' inaccurate ' information about Karl Rove 's role in the attorney firings .
The chair of the subcommittee that has authorized subpoenas in the investigation said that the White House was not deserving of ' blind faith . '
" The White House is asking Congress and the American people to simply trust on blind faith that the documents are appropriately being kept secret , " said Rep. Linda Sánchez , Chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law , during an approximately 20 minute hearing .
She added , " Our system of government does not allow the White House to demand this kind of blind faith and secrecy . "
Rep. Sánchez then issued a ruling declaring that the White House 's assertion of executive privilege over documents sought in subpoenas issued to former White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and the Republican National Committee was not legally valid .
The grounds for the ruling largely echoed a similar ruling delivered last week after former White House Counsel Harriet Miers refused to appear before the committee .
Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) , in a prepared opening statement , outlined some of the wrongdoing he saw that required House investigators to continue to pursue subpoenas and other steps .
" We have learned , for example , that the White House was involved in the politicization of the Justice Department , " Conyers stated .
" New Mexico Republican officials complained repeatedly to Karl Rove and his aides about a voter fraud case that they wanted former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias to pursue .
Mr. Iglesias was fired soon after some of these complaints , and one of the complaining Republican officials was suggested as his replacement . "
He went on to warn that " the White House participated in false statements to Congress . "
" Chris Oprison in the Counsel 's office signed off on an inaccurate letter that the Justice Department sent to Congress claiming that Karl Rove did not play a role in the appointment of Tim Griffin to replace Bud Cummins , " he explained .
The committee 's chairman also implied an effort was being taken to obstruct the investigation of the Attorneys ' firings .
" We also have evidence of a concerted effort both by the Justice Department and the White House to hide or downplay the role of White House personnel in this process , " he argued .
In a Tuesday letter sent to Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan , Conyers warned that the party organization may face contempt proceedings if it fails to abide by Rep.
Sánchez 's ruling today .
" If the RNC ... engages in ' unilateral action ' by simply refusing to comply with a House subpoena absent a court order , the refusal to produce the documents called for could subject Mr. Duncan to contempt proceedings , " Rep. Conyers wrote .
A similar warning was issued regarding Bolten .
The subcommittee 's Democrats did not raise the specter of contempt in Thursday 's hearing , but that did n't stop committee Republicans from speaking out against taking such a step in the future .
" These games may be strangely entertaining to lawyers , press hounds , and academics , but they are not parlor games , and they promise no productive ends , " said Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - UT ) , the ranking Republican on the subcommittee .
" On the contrary , they pointlessly threaten to land in jail people who are asserting understandable claims to executive privilege . "
However , Cannon also suggested that any contempt threat would have no power because it would not be upheld by the courts , and would in fact damage Congress 's ability to conduct future investigations .
" We anticipate a court battle which I very much fear we will lose , " he said .
" By we , I mean Congress ... we will perpetually undermine Congress 's prerogatives in overseeing future administrations . "
Harriet Miers also suggested in a Tuesday letter to Rep .
Conyers via her attorney that she had little to fear from the threat of being held in contempt of Congress .
Her attorney argued that the contempt of Congress statute would not apply to her .

I have come to some heartbreaking conclusions this Memorial Day Morning .
These are not spur of the moment reflections , but things I have been meditating on for about a year now .
The conclusions that I have slowly and very reluctantly come to are very heartbreaking to me .
The first conclusion is that I was the darling of the so - called left as long as I limited my protests to George Bush and the Republican Party .
Of course , I was slandered and libeled by the right as a " tool " of the Democratic Party .
This label was to marginalize me and my message .
How could a woman have an original thought , or be working outside of our " two - party " system ?
However , when I started to hold the Democratic Party to the same standards that I held the Republican Party , support for my cause started to erode and the " left " started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used .
I guess no one paid attention to me when I said that the issue of peace and people dying for no reason is not a matter of " right or left " , but " right and wrong . "
I am deemed a radical because I believe that partisan politics should be left to the wayside when hundreds of thousands of people are dying for a war based on lies that is supported by Democrats and Republican alike .
It amazes me that people who are sharp on the issues and can zero in like a laser beam on lies , misrepresentations , and political expediency when it comes to one party refuse to recognize it in their own party .
Blind party loyalty is dangerous whatever side it occurs on .
People of the world look on us Americans as jokes because we allow our political leaders so much murderous latitude and if we do n’t find alternatives to this corrupt " two " party system our Representative Republic will die and be replaced with what we are rapidly descending into with nary a check or balance : a fascist corporate wasteland .
I am demonized because I do n’t see party affiliation or nationality when I look at a person , I see that person ’s heart .
If someone looks , dresses , acts , talks and votes like a Republican , then why do they deserve support just because he / she calls him / herself a Democrat ?
I have also reached the conclusion that if I am doing what I am doing because I am an " attention whore " then I really need to be committed .
I have invested everything I have into trying to bring peace with justice to a country that wants neither .
If an individual wants both , then normally he / she is not willing to do more than walk in a protest march or sit behind his / her computer criticizing others .
I have spent every available cent I got from the money a " grateful " country gave me when they killed my son and every penny that I have received in speaking or book fees since then .
I have sacrificed a 29 year marriage and have traveled for extended periods of time away from Casey ’s brother and sisters and my health has suffered and my hospital bills from last summer ( when I almost died ) are in collection because I have used all my energy trying to stop this country from slaughtering innocent human beings .
I have been called every despicable name that small minds can think of and have had my life threatened many times .
The most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning , however , was that Casey did indeed die for nothing .
His precious lifeblood drained out in a country far away from his family who loves him , killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think .
I have tried every since he died to make his sacrifice meaningful .
Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives .
It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance .
I failed my boy and that hurts the most .
I have also tried to work within a peace movement that often puts personal egos above peace and human life .
This group wo n’t work with that group ; he wo n’t attend an event if she is going to be there ; and why does Cindy Sheehan get all the attention anyway ?
It is hard to work for peace when the very movement that is named after it has so many divisions .
Our brave young men and women in Iraq have been abandoned there indefinitely by their cowardly leaders who move them around like pawns on a chessboard of destruction and the people of Iraq have been doomed to death and fates worse than death by people worried more about elections than people .
However , in five , ten , or fifteen years , our troops will come limping home in another abject defeat and ten or twenty years from then , our children ’s children will be seeing their loved ones die for no reason , because their grandparents also bought into this corrupt system .
George Bush will never be impeached because if the Democrats dig too deeply , they may unearth a few skeletons in their own graves and the system will perpetuate itself in perpetuity .
I am going to take whatever I have left and go home .
I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost .
I will try to maintain and nurture some very positive relationships that I have found in the journey that I was forced into when Casey died and try to repair some of the ones that have fallen apart since I began this single - minded crusade to try and change a paradigm that is now , I am afraid , carved in immovable , unbendable and rigidly mendacious marble .
Camp Casey has served its purpose .
It ’s for sale .
Anyone want to buy five beautiful acres in Crawford , Texas ?
I will consider any reasonable offer .
I hear George Bush will be moving out soon , too ... which makes the property even more valuable .
This is my resignation letter as the " face " of the American anti-war movement .
This is not my " Checkers " moment , because I will never give up trying to help people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the good old US of A , but I am finished working in , or outside of this system .
This system forcefully resists being helped and eats up the people who try to help it .
I am getting out before it totally consumes me or anymore people that I love and the rest of my resources .
Good - bye America ... you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice , I ca n’t make you be that country unless you want it .
It ’s up to you now .

In computer science , separation of concerns ( SoC ) is the process of breaking a program into distinct features that overlap in functionality as little as possible .
A concern is any piece of interest or focus in a program .
SoC is a long standing idea that simply means a large problem is easier to manage if it can be broken down into pieces ; particularly so if the solutions to the sub - problems can be combined to form a solution to the large problem .
The term separation of concerns was probably coined by Edsger W. Dijkstra in his paper
On the role of scientific thought .
Let ’s ask a question about Monopoly ( and Enterprise software ) .
Where do the rules live ?
In a noun- oriented design , the rules are smooshed and smeared across the design , because every single object is responsible for knowing everything about everything that it can ‘ do ’ .
All the verbs are glued to the nouns as methods .

And now I ’m worried : what am I still missing ?
Please let ’s not have a discussion about Turing Equivalence .
Computer Science “ Theory ” tells us “ there ’s no such thing as more powerful . ”
Perhaps we share the belief that In theory , there ’s no difference between theory and practice .
But in practice , there is .
I am not making the claim that I consider memory management or unsealed base classes harmful , but I argue that there exists at least one person who does .
The word “ factor ” has been a little out of vogue in recent times .
But thanks to an excellent post on reddit , it could make a comeback .
So much so that we wo n’t even bother to show what loops looked like in the days of for ( int i = 0 ; i < employeeList.size ( ) ; ++i ) .
Another organization might merge employees and departments , or have each department “ own ” a collection of employees .
This makes our example easier , but now the data does n’t factor well .
Everything we ’ve learned from databases in the last forty years tells us that we often need to find new ways to compose our data .
The relational model factors well .
The network model factors poorly .
I recently re-read the amazing paper Why Functional Programming Matters ( “ Why FP ” ) .
Although I thought that I understood WhyFP when I first read it a few years ago , when I had another look last weekend I suddenly understood that I had missed an important message .
Now obviously ( can you guess from the title ? ) the paper is about the importance of one particular style of programming , functional programming .
And when I first read the paper , I took it at face value : I thought , “ Here are some reasons why functional programming languages matter .
” On re-reading it , I see that the paper contains insights that apply to programming in general .
I do n’t know why this surprises me .
The fact is , programming language design revolves around program design .
A language ’s design reflects the opinions of its creators about the proper design of programs .
In a very real sense , the design of a programming language is a strong expression of the opinions of the designer about good programs .
When I first read WhyFP , I thought the author was expressing an opinion about the design of good programming languages .
Whereas on the second reading , I realized he was expressing an opinion about the design of good programs .
Is this obvious ?
So how do we explain that one reason Java is considered “ better than C++ ” is because it omits manual memory management ?
And one reason many people consider Java “ better than Ruby ” is because you cannot open base classes likein Java ?
So no , it is not obvious .
Why not ?
The key is the word better .
It ’s not the same as the phrase more powerful .
The removal or deliberate omission of these features is an expression about the idea that programs which do not use these features are better than programs which do .
Any feature ( or removal of a feature ) which makes the programs written in the language better makes the language better .
Thus , it is possible to make a language “ better ” by removing features that are considered harmful , if by doing so it makes programs in the language better programs .
In the opinion of the designers of Java , programs that do not useandare safer than those that do .
And the opinion of the designers of Java is that programs that do not modify base classes likeare safer than those that do .
The Java language design emphasizes a certain kind of safety , and to a Java language designer , safer programs are better programs .
“ More powerful ” is a design goal just like “ safer . ”
But yet , what does it mean ?
We understand what a safer language is .
It ’s a language where programs written in the language are safer .
But what is a “ more powerful ” language ?
That programs written in the language are more powerful ?
What does that mean ?
Fewer symbols ( the “ golf ” metric ) ?
Why FP asserts that you cannot make a language more powerful through the removal of features .
To paraphrase an argument from the paper , if removing harmful features was useful by itself , C and C++ programmers would simply have stopped usingandtwenty years ago .
Improving on C/ C++ was not just a matter of removingand , it was also a matter of adding automatic garbage collection .
At the same time , there is room for arguing that some languages are improved by the removal of harmful features .
To understand why they may be improved but not more powerful , we need a more objective definition of what it means for a language to be “ more powerful . ”
Specifically , what quality does a more powerful programming language permit or encourage in programs ?
When we understand what makes a program “ better ” in the mind of a language designer , we can understand the choices behind the language .
Factoring a program is the act of dividing it into units that are composed to produce the working software .
Factoring happens as part of the design .
( Re-factoring is the act of rearranging an existing program to be factored in a different way ) .
If you want to compare this to factoring in number theory , a well designed program has lots of factors , like the number ) .
A Big Ball of Mud is like the number , a prime .
Composition is the construction of programs from smaller programs .
So factoring is to composition as division is to multiplication .
Factoring programs is n’t really like factoring simple divisors .
The most important reason is that programs can be factored in orthogonal ways .
When you break a program into subprograms ( using methods , subroutines , functions , what - have - you ) , that ’s one axis of factoring .
When you break an a modular program up into modules , that ’s another , orthogonal axis of factoring .
Programs that are well - factored are more desirable than programs that are poorly factored .
—Excerpts from the Wikipedia entry on Separation of Concerns Programs that separate their concerns are well - factored .
There ’s a principle of software development , responsibility - driven design .
Each component should have one clear responsibility , and it should have everything it needs to carry out its responsibility .
This is the separation of concerns again .
Each component of a program having one clearly defined responsibility means each concern is addressed in one clearly defined place .
In a game design where you have important information about a rule smeared all over the object hierarchy , you have very poor separation of concerns .
It looks at first like there ’s a clear factoring “ Baltic Avenue has a method called , ” but when you look more closely you realize that every object representing a property is burdened with knowing almost all of the rules of the game .
The concerns are not clearly separated : there ’s no one place to look and understand the behaviour of the game .
Programs that separate their concerns are better programs than those that do not .
And languages that facilitate this kind of program design are better than those that hamper it .
One thing that makes a programming language “ more powerful ” in my opinion is the provision of more ways to factor programs .
Or if you prefer , more axes of composition .
The more different ways you can compose programs out of subprograms , the more powerful a language is .
Do you remember Structured Programming ?
The gist is , you removeand you replace it with well - defined control flow mechanisms : some form of subroutine call and return , some form of selection mechanism like Algol - descendant , and some form of repetition like Common Lisp ’smacro .
Dijkstra ’s view on structured programming was that it promoted the separation of concerns .
The factoring of programs into blocks with well - defined control flow made it easy to understand blocks and rearrange programs in different ways .
Programs with indiscriminate jumps did not factor well ( if at all ) : they were difficult to understand and often could not be rearranged at all .
Structured 68 k ASM programming is straightforward in theory .
You just need a lot of boilerplate , design patterns , and the discipline to stick to your convictions .
But of course , lots of 68 k ASM programming in practice is only partially structured .
Statistically speaking , 68 k ASM is not a structured programming language even though structured programming is possible in 68 k ASM .
Structured Pascal programming is straightforward both in theory and in practice .
Pascal facilitates separation of concerns through structured programming .
So we say that Pascal “ is more powerful than 68 k ASM ” to mean that in practice , programs written in Pascal are more structured than programs written in 68 k ASM because Pascal provides facilities for separating concerns that are missing in 68 k ASM .
Consider this snippet of iterative code :
This is an improvement on older practices .
For one thing , theloops hide the implementation details of iterating overand .
Is this better because you have less to type ?
Yes .
Is it better because you eliminate the fence - post errors associated with loop variables ?
Of course .
But most interestingly , you have the beginnings of a separation of concerns : how to iterate over a single list is separate from what you do in the iteration .
One problem with theloop is that it can only handle one loop at a time .
We have to nest loops to work with two lists at once .
This is patently wrong : there ’s nothing inherently nested about what we ’re trying to do .
We can demonstrate this easily : try calling a colleague on the telephone and explaining what we want as succinctly as possible .
Do you say “ We want a loop inside a loop and inside of that an if , and … ” ?
No , we say , “ We want to count the number of employees that have been with the company longer than their departments have existed . ”
There ’s no discussion of nesting .
In this case , a limitation of our tool has caused our concerns to intermingle again .
The concern of “ How to find the employees that have been with the company longer than their departments have existed ” is intertwined with the concern of “ count them . ”
Let ’s try a different notation that separates the details of how to find from the detail of counting what we ’ve found :
Now we have separated the concern of finding from counting .
And we have hidden the nesting by using theoperator to create a Cartesian product of the two lists .
Now let ’s look at what we used to filter the combined list , .
The difference is more than just semantics , or counting characters , or the alleged pleasure of fooling around with closures .
andfacilitates separating the concerns of how to filter things ( like iterate over them applying a test ) from the concern of what we want to filter .
So languages that make this easy are more powerful than languages that do not .
In the sense that they facilitate additional axes of factoring .
Let ’s look back a few paragraphs .
We have an example of the “ Telephone Test : ” when code very closely resembles how you would explain your solution over the telephone , we often say it is “ very high level . ”
The usual case is that such code expresses a lot more what and a lot less how .
The concern of what has been very clearly separated from the concern of how : you ca n’t even see the how if you do n’t go looking for it .
In general , we think this is a good thing .
But it is n’t free : somewhere else there is a mass of code that supports your brevity .
When that extra mass of code is built into the programming language , or is baked into the standard libraries , it is nearly free and obviously a Very Good Thing .
A language that does n’t just separate the concern of how but does the work for you is very close to “ something for nothing ” in programming .
But sometimes you have to write the how as well as the what .
It is n’t always handed to you .
In that case , it is still valuable , because the resulting program still separates concerns .
It still factors into separate components .
The components can be changed .
I recently separated the concern of describing “ how to generate sample curves for some data mining ” from the concern of “ managing memory when generating the curves . ”
I did so by writing my own lazy evaluation code ( Both the story and the code are on line ) .
Here ’s the key “ what ” code that generates an infinite list of parameters for sample beziér curves :
That ’s it .
Just as I might tell you on the phone : “ Magnitudes ” is a list of numbers between zero and one created by repeatedly dividing the intervals in half , like a binary search .
“ Control Points ” is a list of the Cartesian product of magnitudes with itself , with one magnitude assigned toand the other to .
And so forth .
I will not say that the sum of this code and the code that actually implements infinite lists is shorter than imperative code that would intermingle loops and control structures , entangling what with how .
I will say that it separates the concerns of what and how , and it separates them in a different way thanseparated the concerns of what and how .
The great insight is that better programs separate concerns .
They are factored more purely , and the factors are naturally along the lines of responsibility ( rather than in Jenga piles of ) .
Languages that facilitate better separation of concerns are more powerful in practice than those that do n’t .
WhyFP illustrates this point beautifully with the same examples I just gave : first - class functions and lazy evaluation , both prominent features of modern functional languages like Haskell .
Why FP ’s value is that it expresses an opinion about what makes programs better .
It backs this opinion up with reasons why modern functional programming languages are more powerful than imperative programming languages .
But even if you do n’t plan to try functional programming tomorrow , the lessons about better programs are valuable for your work in any language today .
That ’s why Why Functional Programming Matters matters .

“ An Inconvenient Truth , ” the Davis Guggenheim documentary on global warming starring Al Gore ’s presentation on the subject , provides an accurate , engaging , accessible , thought - provoking and ( at times ) even humorous introduction to one of the most important scientific issues of our time ( see our review of the movie ) .
In some countries , viewing “ An Inconvenient Truth ” has actually become a required part of the science curriculum , and with good justification , we think .
Given that the DVD is currently selling for $ 19.99 through Amazon.com , you ’d think that the National Science Teachers ’ Association ( NSTA ) would jump at the chance to quickly get 50,000 free copies quickly into the hands of their members .
Yet , when Laurie David , one of the producers of the film , made this offer to NSTA last November , it was summarily turned down on the grounds that the NSTA has a 2001 policy against “ product endorsement ” ( as if Laurie David were trying to shop some new deodorant to high school science teachers ) .
What in the world is going on here ?
Before continuing with the history of NSTA ’s bizarre decision , let us provide you with the most important information :
Up to 50,000 US science teachers can receive a free copy of the DVD by filling out a simple request form here .
The deadline for requesting your copy is January 18 , so if you want a copy , take a few minutes to put in your request right away .
Laurie David described her correspondence with the NSTA in a Washington Post Op - Ed , where she notes that an email sent to her by NSTA invoked not only the product endorsement issue , but also a fear that distributing the film would place “ unnecessary risk upon the [ NSTA ] capital campaign , especially certain targeted supporters . ”
David goes on to point out that one of these supporters is in fact ExxonMobil ( whose efforts to spread confusion about climate change are described in a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists . )
Is NSTA for sale ?
Did concern about losing ExxonMobil funding lead to NSTA ’s timidity about accepting the donation of the DVDs ?
The NSTA responds to David ’s charges here , pointing out among other things that they offered to sell David the NSTA ’s commercial mailing list and that the email to her regarding the fundraising issue was unauthorized .
We ourselves find the NSTA ’s defense unconvincing .
While it is impossible for us to know the extent to which ExxonMobil funding has compromised NSTA ’s objectivity on global warming , a perusal of the NSTA web site shows that their teacher resources are rather short on support for teaching about the fundamental science of global warming .
This contrasts strongly with their in - depth support for the teaching of Evolution .
Indeed , the NSTA ’s “ compromise ” of providing a link on their homepage to the independent DVD giveaway strikes us as uncomfortably similar to placing a sticker on a biology textbook disclaiming Evolution as “ Theory , not Fact . ”
Their willingness to link to the giveaway without providing it directly to their members conveys a distinct impression that the film is somehow tainted .
Doing a search on “ Global Warming ” on the NSTA site turns up only a paltry supply of useful educational material .
It is also illuminating to go into their “ recommendations ” section and type in “ global warming . ”
That will turn up this recommended book by Kenneth Green , a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute whose article Clouds of Global - Warming Hysteria in the National Review endorsed Michael Crichton ’s view of global warming and called supporters of climate change action “ One- worlders and other socialist sorts . ”
Needless to say , the NSTA recommendations ( as of today ) did not turn up “ An Inconvenient Truth ” either in its DVD or book form .
Nor did it turn up Revkin ’s book directed at juveniles “ The North Pole Was Here , ” nor any of the other scientifically respectable introductions of which we are aware
Perhaps the NSTA policy has not been compromised by its funding sources , but it will have to work a lot harder to convince us .
The best way it could do that would be to bring their support for teaching about global warming up to the same standards as their support for teaching about Evolution .
Meanwhile , there have been scattered reports of outright censorship of “ An Inconvenient Truth ” in the classroom .
In a widely reported case , one Seattle school district has essentially banned the film .
We have also heard from a science teacher in a populous East Coast state , who was forbidden from showing the film after some parents complained that in fact the earth was “ cooling , not warming . ”
( We have been asked to keep this teacher ’s identity confidential so as to prevent reprisals ) .
Hopefully these are isolated instances .
We are eager to hear from our readers , not only on the issue of censorship of the film , but also with regard to their experiences with teaching about human - caused climate change in the K - 12 classroom ( and the extent to which “ An Inconvenient Truth ” has proved a useful tool ) .
“ Globalization clearly has had impacts on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of humans , ” said Dr. Berenbaum .
“ Should bees be any different ?
Dr. Pettis said that even if the virus is involved , it is likely that more than one factor has to align for a hive to collapse , with another possible influence being poor nutrition .
Most of the colonies that had big losses over last winter were in areas that experienced drought a few months beforehand , and thus a lack of nectar in flowers , he said .
Another factor , he said , could be the stress that comes from the increasingly industrial - style beekeeping operations in the United States , in which truckloads of hives crisscross the country to pollinate California almonds or Florida orchards each season .
But the virus stands out as a top suspect .
While seven viruses and a host of bacteria and parasites were identified in the genetic screening , only the Israeli bee virus , first identified in 2004 , was strongly tied to the samples taken from keepers who reported the collapse disorder .
While it was first identified by scientists in Israel , the virus appears to exist in many parts of the world , said W. Ian Lipkin , one of the authors of the new study and director of the Center for Infection and Immunology of Columbia University .
When the group screened some samples of Chinese imports of a bee product called royal jelly , they found evidence of the virus , as well .
In Israel , it also seems to produce bee symptoms not reported in the United States , including shivering and a pattern of finding dead bees near hives .
Dr. Lipkin , whose focus is human disease , became involved because the quest for a cause for the beehive collapses employed new genetic sifting techniques that he said might also prove useful in investigating human disease outbreaks .
As reported by Nancy Youssef this evening for McClatchy :
WASHINGTON —
In a sign that top commanders are divided over what course to pursue in Iraq , the Pentagon said Wednesday that it wo n't make a single , unified recommendation to President Bush during next month 's strategy assessment , but instead will allow top commanders to make individual presentations .
" Consensus is not the goal of the process , " Geoff Morrell , a Pentagon spokesman , told reporters .
" If there are differences , the president will hear them . "
Military analysts called the move unusual for an institution that ordinarily does not air its differences in public , especially while its troops are deployed in combat .
So much for the Petraeus Report .
That ’s the sound of America ’s largest department collectively throwing its hands up in exasperation , shaking its head , and saying , " You deal with it , tough guy .
We ’re done with your asinine war .
Have fun facing the American public . "
Youssef went on to report :
" The professional military guys are going to the non-professional military guys and saying ' Resolve this , ' " said Jeffrey White , a military analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
" That 's what it sounds like . "
White said it suggests that the military commanders want to be able to distance themselves from Iraq strategy by making it clear that whatever course is followed is the president 's decision , not what commanders agreed on .
That bears repeating :
The military commanders want to be able to distance themselves from Iraq strategy by making it clear that whatever course is followed is the president ’s decision .
This can be translated as : " Here , George .
Hold this . "
Morrell said the commanders will make their presentations to Bush at around the same time that Petraeus appears before Congress to assess progress in Iraq in mid September .
Morrell said that those making presentations to the president would include Marine Gen.
Peter Pace , the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm. William Fallon , the commander of U.S. Central Command , which has responsibility for U.S. military actions in the Middle East , Army Gen. George Casey , the chief of staff of the Army , and Petraeus .
In addition , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates will share his opinion with the president .
They ’re pulling out the rug from beneath Petraeus before he ’s even made his pitch .
This is the Defense Department saying that while Commander Guy may have found one guy to hold the line on the surge , one guy is all he has .
Miers .
Bartlett .
Rove .
Gonzales .
The Defense Department .
Ship .
Sinking .
Commander Guy .
Fresh out of friends .

Later today Mozilla will do something a bit out of the ordinary and release a special " Campus Edition " of their Firefox web browser , just in time for back to school .
Firefox Campus Edition is your typical run -of - the - mill Firefox release bundled with three school friendly add - ons : Zotero , FoxyTunes and StumbleUpon .
Zotero is a research tool that helps you collect , manage and cite your research sources .
FoxyTunes lets you control your media player from within Firefox while the StumbleUpon toolbar helps you discover interesting web content based upon your preferences .
Firefox Campus Edition is n't the first Firefox " edition " of something .
Last month , Mozilla released an eBay Edition .
Now , I can't help but wonder how much money Mozilla stands to make off such partnerships .
Update : Paul Kim has answered my question :
Hey Paul :
There is no money changing hands for the Firefox Campus Edition .
We are looking at ways to introduce Firefox add - ons to people who might never otherwise have tried them , and reached out to a few add - on developers we thought had created interesting functionality on top of Firefox .
Why autoconf , automake and libtool fail
autoconf
config.guess , config.sub
There was no source from which one could get up - to - date version of these scripts , which are used to determine the operating system type .
This often caused pain : asked the openbsd port maintainers about it .
( btw : there is now a canonical source for them , " ftp.gnu.org/gnu/config " ) autoconf takes the wrong approach
The autoconf approach is , in short : check for headers and define some preprocessor variables based on the result .
check for functions and define some preprocessor variables .
replace functions not already found in the installed libraries .
Yes , it works , albeit some details are discouraging , to but it mildly .
No , it does n't work good enough .
This approach has lead to an incredible amount of badly code around the world .
Studying the autoconf documentation one learns what kind of incompatibilities exists .
Using autoconf one can work around them .
But autoconf does n't provide a known working solution of such problems .
Examples : AC_REPLACE_FUNCS , a macro to replace a function not in the systems libraries , leads to the inclusion of rarely used code in the package - which is a recipe for disaster .
On the developers system the function unportable ( ) is available , on another system it is n't ?
Oh well , just compile unportable .c there and link it into the programs ...
Yes , this solves a problem .
But it 's overused , it 's dangerous .
In many cases unportable .c does n't work on the developers system , so she can't test it .
On other cases unportable .c only works correctly on _one_ kind of system , but will be used on others , too .
Yes , the often used packages _have_ been tested almost everywhere .
But what about the lesser often used ?
Keep in mind that there is no central repository of replacement functions anywhere ...
The same is true for AC_CHECK_FUNC ( S ) .
In this case there is n't a replacement source file , but even worse , there 's an #ifdef inside the main sources , unless the programmers are careful to use wrappers , which they often are n't , because compatibility problems are often discovered very late in the testing process ( or even after release ) and people are usually trying to make the smallest possible changes .
This is surely nothing which can be avoided completely , but it 's something which has to be avoided whereever possible .
In both cases you end up with rarely , if ever , used code in your programs .
It 's not dead code , it 's zombie code - one day , somewhere , it will get alive again .
There 's a solution to this problem , but it is completely different from what 's used now : Instead of providing bare workaround autoconf ( or a wrapper around it ) ought to provide an abstraction layer above it , and a central repository for such things .
That way a programmer would n't use opendir , readdir , closedir directly but call they through the wrap_opendir , wrap_readdir and wrap_closedir functions ( i'm aware of the fact that the GNU C library is this kind of wrapper , but it has n't been ported to lots of systems , and you can't rip only a few functions out of it ) .
autoconf macros are inconsistent .
For example : AC_FUNC_FNMATCH
checks whether fnmatch is available and usable , and defines HAVE_FNMATCH in this case .
AC_FUNC_MEMCMP checks for availability and usability of memcmp , and adds memcmp. o to LIBOBJS if that 's not the case .
Other examples exist .
autoconf is not namespace - clean .
autoconf does n't stick to a small set of prefixes for macro names .
For example it defines CLOSEDIR_VOID , STDC_HEADERS , MAJOR_IN_MKDEV , WORDS_BIGENDIAN , in addition to a number of HAVE_somethings .
I really dislike that , and it seems to get worse with every new release .
My absolutely best - loved macro in this regard is AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG , which might define the following symbols : SVR4 , DGUX , UMAX , UMAX4_3 , NLIST_STRUCT , NLIST_NAME_UNION , GETLOADAVG_PRIVILEGED .
autoconf is large I 'm feeling uneasy about the sheer size of autoconf .
I 'm not impressed : autoconf - 2.13.tar.gz has a size of 440 KB .
Add automake to that ( 350 KB for version 1.4 ) .
Does it _really_ have to be that large ?
I do n't think so .
The size has a meaning - for me it means autoconf is very complicated .
It did n't use to be so , back in the " good old days " .
And it accomplished it 's task .
I really do n't see that it can do so much more today ( i do n't mean " so much more for me " ) .
configure is large Even trivial configure scripts amount to 70 KB of size .
Not much ?
Compressed with gzip it 's still 16 KB .
Multiply that by millions of copies and millions of downloads .
No , i do n't object to the size .
It 's perfectly ok if you get something for it .
But you do n't , about one half or more of each configure script can be thrown away without any lossage .
Large parts of it just deal with caching , which would n't be needed if configure was n't so slow .
Other parts of it are the -- help output , which looks so good ... but does n't help usually ( try it and find out what to do , without reading README or INSTALL ) .
Then there is the most bloated command line argument parser i've ever seen in any shell script .
Then there are many , many comments , but they are n't meant to help you seeing what 's going on inside configure , they are the documentation for the macro maintainers ( some might actually prove to be useful , but the vast majority does n't ) .
The configure scripts are the utter horror to read .
There 's a reason for this : configure does n't use any " advanced " feature of the shell .
But i wonder - are shell functions really unportable ?
And if the answer is yes :
Do you really expect anything to work on that system ?
The problem is that a shell that old is unlikely to handle almost anything , for example large here documents .
The configure scripts are the utter horror to debug .
Please just try _once_ to debug 4000 lines of automatically generated shell scripts .
Note the autoconf maintainers :
The road you 're on is going to end soon .
autoconf is badly maintained
Let me clarify this first : I do n't think bad about the developement .
I 'm missing maintainance of the already released versions .
Now , at the end of 2000 , almost two years have passed without a maintainance release of autoconf .
9 months have passed since a security problem has been found ( in the handling of temporary files ) .
There have more bugs been found , of course .
I know that nobody likes to dig in old code , but 2 years are a little bit much .
automake
update all those machines regulary ( i'm not going to really do that , i'd rather stick to what 's installed , but anyway ) i did n't touch a project for , say , 2 years , and then i need to change something and release a new version .
This involves changing the version number in configure .in .
Do n't misunderstand me : i do n't attribute that to automake .
I attribute it to the internal instability of autoconf .
Unfortunately you can't have automake without autoconf .
libtool
One problem with libtool is that releases do n't happen very often .
Libtool rarely is up to date with regards to changes on some operating systems .
Which makes it difficult to use in packages meant to be really portable ( to put it mildly ) .
A libtool script and a number of support files are distributed with every package making use of libtool , which ensures that any user can compile the package without having to install libtool before .
Sounds good ?
But it is n't .
This approach means that you can't replace all old libtool stuff on your system easiely .
It also means that every package you try to compile can have a different version of libtool .
And since alpha versions of libtool are often used it 's not unlikely that you happen to meet one of these versions .
Another problem is the size of the libtool script .
4200 lines ...
summary
I do n't use any of them anymore - autoconf alone does n't give me much i do n't get with a few additional make rules .
I 've added some code to the Factor parser combinator library to allow search and replace using parser combinators .
The idea was to be able to do similar things with parser combinators that regular expressions are commonly used for .
I 've also started adding some simple reusable parsers for numbers , strings , etc .
The search word takes a string and a parser off the stack .
It returns a sequence of all substrings in the original string that successfully parse by the parser .
The result returned in the sequence is actually the result returned by the parser .
For example :
" hello * world * from * factor * " ' bold ' search . => { " world " " factor " } " one 100 two 300 " ' integer ' search . => { 100 300 } " one 100 two 300 " ' integer ' [ 2 * ] < @ search . => { 200 600 }
The search\* word takes a string and a sequence of parsers off the stack .
It returns a sequence of all substrings in the original string that successfully parse by any of the parsers in the sequence .
It is functionally the same as combining parsers with the < |> combinator .
" hello 123 \" world\ " from 456 factor " ' string ' ' integer ' 2 array search * . => { 123 " world " 456 }
The replace word takes a string and parser off the stack .
It returns the original string with all substrings that successfully parse by the parser replaced by the result of that parser .
" Hello * World * " ' bold ' [ " < strong > " swap " </ strong > " 3append ] < @ replace . =>
" Hello < strong > World </ strong > "
The replace\ * word takes a string and sequence of parsers off the stack .
It does a fold , iterating through the sequence applying ' replace ' using the parser and the results of the previous ' replace ' call .
The result is a string with all matching substrings from the parsers in the sequence being replaced by the results of those parsers .
This is a rocket being fired in slow motion .
This is a pretty amazing show if you think about how fast the rocket must have been travelling !
THE DIRTY little secret about American patents is that they are too easy to file , too easy to defend , and too easy to use for nobbling legitimate competition .
The patents exploited last year to extract $ 612 m from Research in Motion , the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail gizmo , would have barely passed muster in another country .
Nor would Vonage , the internet - telephony pioneer , have had to cough up $ 58 m recently for infringing three unbelievably broad patents if they had been filed in Europe or Japan instead of America .
Patent law exists to encourage inventors by granting a monopoly for a limited period ( now 20 years ) in exchange for publishing their work so others can see how it affects their own innovations .
Implicit in the deal is a trade - off between private incentive and public good .
Of late , the balance in America has been tipped too much in the patent - holder 's favour .
In the process , American consumers have paid dearly through their loss of choice .
The country 's competitiveness has also suffered , as one innovative idea after another has been squelched , neutered or withdrawn from the market because of the threat of patent litigation .
One reason for the poor quality of American patents is historical .
While other countries adopted the “ first to file ” principle , the founding fathers based their patent law on the notion of “ first to invent ” .
That may have seemed reasonable to Thomas Jefferson , the first commissioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office .
But it has created a quagmire for challengers seeking to unearth “ prior art ” , all previously known inventions and discoveries , to question dubious patents .
A first - to - file arrangement may punish the lackadaisical , but it makes legal ownership clear - cut .
In so doing , it slashes lawyers ' fees and thwarts predatory litigation by opportunistic “ patent trolls ” .
Another reason for the dodgy nature of many American patents is that courts have adopted a far looser interpretation of what is patentable .
Here , one of the worst offenders has been the US Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit , set up in 1982 to oversee patent law and other legal specialisms , such as government contracts and international trade .
The appeals court has overturned numerous decisions on patents that had been thrown out by district courts as frivolous suits .
It has done so by applying a test for “ non-obviousness ” that is widely considered to be far too lax .
To be patentable , an invention must be not only useful and novel , but also non-obvious to someone who is an expert in the field .
The appeals court considers an invention to be obvious only if it has been foreshadowed by some prior “ teaching , suggestion or motivation ” .
But as many critics point out , when extensions or combinations of existing ideas become obvious , few people bother to write them down .
In a unanimous decision that is being hailed as the most important patent ruling in decades , the Supreme Court early this week swept aside the non-obviousness test used by the appeals court .
In its place , a common - sense standard based on real - world conditions is to be applied to all patent applications that combine ( as most do ) elements of existing inventions .
The case ruled on by the justices concerned an accelerator pedal developed by a Canadian company called KSR .
The pedal could be adjusted for a driver 's height and used an electronic sensor , rather than a mechanical cable , to change the engine speed .
Teleflex , a rival manufacturer , demanded royalties , claiming the device infringed one of its patents .
KSR argued that Teleflex had combined existing elements in an obvious way , and that its patent was therefore invalid .
A district court in Detroit agreed , but the decision was subsequently overturned by the appeals court in Washington , DC .
Under the Supreme Court 's new definition of obviousness , Teleflex would have been lucky to get a patent for the pedal in the first place .
The justices ' opinion has been welcomed by the high - tech community .
It is impossible to build a laptop , mobile phone or video recorder without infringing dozens of the thousands of patents that cover the various components involved .
Computer firms have responded by engaging in a patents arms race and negotiating cross-licensing deals with everyone they expect will be involved .
This is wasteful enough for the Intels , Microsofts and IBMs that can afford such profligate practices .
But it can be life or death for smaller , innovative firms .
When challenging incumbents ' old - fashioned ways , upstarts like Vonage can find themselves forced out of the market by dubious patent litigation rather than actual competition .
The Supreme Court 's ruling this week will make such anti-competitive practices harder to sustain .
Vonage , for one , may be the first of many to seek legal redress from all the shoddy patents endorsed by America 's over - eager courts .
US court hears suit against AT&T ’s collaboration with domestic spying program
By Marge Holland
22 August 2007
On Wednesday , August 15 , a three - judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco heard arguments in the case of Hepting v. AT&T , a class action suit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) in January 2006 .
The suit accuses telecommunications giant AT&T of violating the First and Fourth amendments to the Constitution , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) ( which prohibits spying on Americans unless authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court [ FISC ] ) , telecommunications laws and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act by making available to the National Security Agency ( NSA ) two massive databases that included both the contents of its subscribers ’ communications and detailed transaction records , such as numbers dialed and internet addresses visited .
One of AT&T ’s databases , known as “ Hawkeye , ” contains data detailing nearly every telephone communication on AT&T ’s domestic network since 2001 , according to the Complaint .
The suit also alleges that AT&T allowed the NSA to use the company ’s powerful Daytona database management software to quickly search this and other communication databases .
The suit requests an injunction and damages that could amount to at least $ 21,000 for each affected person .
According to the EFF website , EFF brought a class action suit in the matter to ensure that any injunction against AT&T would apply throughout the country , not simply in the district in which the lawsuit was filed .
The purpose of filing the suit is “ to stop [ AT&T ’s ] illegal conduct and hold AT&T responsible for its illegal collaboration with the government ’s domestic spying program , which has violated the law and damaged the fundamental freedoms of the American public . ”
EFF states that AT&T is being sued because the government ’s illegal spying program would not be possible without AT&T ’s collaboration in violating the privacy of US citizens .
In a sworn statement , former company engineer Mark Klein claims that AT&T illegally provided the government with access to subscriber information through a system of communications hubs along the West Coast .
He described a super - secure room on the sixth floor of a building at 611 Folsom Street in downtown San Francisco where AT&T assembled high - powered equipment for a “ special job ” for the NSA .
He said that very few people were allowed in the room and that both “ a physical key for the cylinder lock and a combination code number to be entered into an electronic keypad on the door ” were required for entry .
He also described in detail the fiber - optic equipment in the room and said he had heard from other company employees that similar operations were being put together in Los Angeles , San Diego and San Jose in California and in Seattle , Washington .
From the day the suit was filed , the US Justice Department and AT&T have done everything they could to get the case dismissed out of hand , even before an examination of the facts to determine the legality or otherwise of the wiretapping was established , on the basis of the “ state secrets privilege . ”
The Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest re : State and Military Secrets as early as April 28 , 2006 , and a Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment on May 12 , 2006 .
Several amicus curiae ( friend of the court ) briefs and declarations were filed by supporters of both sides , including briefs by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Center for Constitutional Rights in support of the plaintiffs , and declarations by none other than John Negroponte , then Director of National Intelligence , and Keith Alexander , Director of the NSA , for the defendants .
Gregory G. Garre , a deputy solicitor general representing the administration , and Michael K. Kellogg , a lawyer for AT&T , claimed in Wednesday ’s hearing that Klein ’s sworn statement was built on speculation and inferences .
Robert D. Fram , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said that , on the contrary , the statement provided more than enough direct evidence to allow the case to go forward .
On July 20 , 2006 , United States District Court Judge Vaughn Walker , a libertarian - leaning judge appointed by the current president ’s father , George H.W. Bush , denied the motions to dismiss the case on the grounds that it would reveal state secrets , since the government had admitted the existence of the program following its revelation in the New York Times in December 2005 .
He added that if AT&T had a legal order to comply , disclosing it would not assist would - be terrorists .
AT&T argued that it should be immune from the suit because “ whatever we did , the government told us to , ” while the government continued to proclaim that allowing the case to go on would harm national security .
Walker rejected this argument , declaring , “ The compromise between liberty and security remains a difficult one .
But dismissing this case at the outset would sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security . ”
The decision was appealed to the Ninth Circuit in November of 2006 .
The three justices on the Ninth Circuit panel , Harry Pregerson ( appointed by President Jimmy Carter ) , M. Margaret McKeown , and Michael Daly Hawkins ( the latter two appointed by President Bill Clinton ) , reportedly appeared highly skeptical and occasionally hostile to the Bush administration ’s central argument , that national security concerns require that the lawsuits be dismissed .
Garre declared that judges must give executive branch determinations “ utmost deference ” in matters of state secrets .
Referring to the assessment of “ intelligence officials , ” he reiterated the canard that any investigation or action delving into the actions of the NSA or AT&T would result in “ exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States . ”
Judge Pregerson , the senior member of the panel , responded , “ What does ‘ ultimate deference ’ mean ?
Bow to it ? ”
The three judges seemed to be frustrated by the government ’s insistence that they must defer to intelligence officials ’ assessments of the need for secrecy and dismiss the lawsuits without deciding whether or not the surveillance was legal .
According to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle August 16 , Judge McKeown paraphrased the government ’s position as , “ We do n’t do it , trust us , and you ca n’t ask about it , ” while Judge Pregerson offered a paraphrase of his own , saying , “ Once the executive declares that certain activity is a state secret , that ’s the end of it ...
The king can do no wrong . ”
The judges also appeared unpersuaded by the argument presented by AT&T lawyer Kellogg that “ The government has said that whatever AT&T is doing with the government is a state secret . ”
The judges expressed their skepticism , wondering why the issue of whether there was domestic spying on Americans without court approval , violating the law , could not be explored .
Judge McKeown noted that Bush has publicly denied that the government intercepts domestic calls without a warrant .
Judge Hawkins suggested that plaintiffs might prove their case without divulging any secrets by showing that the company had provided private information to the government without insisting on a warrant and questioned how such evidence would jeopardize national security .
Judge Pregerson wanted to know whether the Justice Department was asking the judges to “ rubber stamp ” the Bush administration ’s claim that state secrets were at risk in the case .
“ Who decides , ” he asked , “ whether something is a state secret or not ? ”
The hearing in the Ninth Circuit comes at a time when the debate over the unlawful domestic spying program is producing widespread outrage .
At stake is whether the US court system has the power to review the government ’s wiretapping of Americans if that surveillance is conducted in the name of the so - called “ war on terror . ”
The facts that the Democratic Party - controlled Congress has just enacted legislation that gives the government even more powers to conduct warrantless spying , and that there continue to be increasing legal challenges to these programs across the country , are rapidly bringing the issue to a crisis level .
The government is demanding that the courts dismiss lawsuits aimed at shutting down warrantless surveillance and data - mining of Americans ’ calls and emails , despite the evidence in the suits that backs up the claims of illegal surveillance .
Bush administration lawyers have essentially claimed that the courts have no business second - guessing the president when it comes to national security .
There are , according to the San Jose Mercury News , roughly 50 pending lawsuits that the Bush administration has attempted to have thrown out of court on the basis of “ state secrets ” and “ national security , ” a privilege the Bush administration has asserted more than any other administration in history .
Therefore , the ultimate ruling by the Ninth Circuit will have important consequences for these cases , since dismissal of the AT&T case would likely result in the dismissal of the others on similar grounds .
There is no set time frame for a decision in Hepting v. AT&T .
At any rate , the loser in the appeal will probably appeal to a full panel of the Ninth Circuit and from there the case would go to the Supreme Court .
Judging by their support for the administration in the past , it seems fairly predictable how the current right - wing majority will view the argument that decisions made by the executive branch supersede any independent judgment made by the courts .

In Google vs Government , It ’s Not About Child Porn
It ’s interesting to see how many news sources mistakenly report that the current government vs Google case is about child porn .
It ’s not .
If anything , it ’s about children looking at pornography – i.e. webmasters not ensuring their sites are sufficiently blocking minors from viewing harmful content .
Or more specifically , it ’s about a proposed law requiring those sites to restrict access to minors , the Child Online Protection Act , which just did n’t get through in the past , and which the Bush administration now wants to revive ( and for that reason , asked different search engines to hand over search logs and indexed URLs to prove the law is needed ) .
I wrote to the author of the original article at the Mercury News while preparing and editing my first blog post on this , realizing this is n’t about child porn – indeed the error is quick to make , and I was confused too at first – but the Merc ’s error was never corrected .
From there , it spread like wildfire into blogs and mainstream news sources alike .
Following are some of the statements that are making their rounds ( my emphasis ) :

– Slashdot ( itself citing Mercury News )
“ Trolling through two month ’s worth of random results at the world ’s leading search engine , as the government ’s original subpoena requested , presumably would give Justice Department investigators a good read on what percentage of those searches were for child porn . ”

reholli I have to comment a little more about this .
Some of the moderators and regular supporters of 2 K in this forum express such rabid , extreme points of view in their attempts to remain loyal to 2 K that they abandon any attempt to apply reason and logic to the discussions .
Even when legitimate issues are raised , the attempt is always made to defend an untenable position and divert the point being made away from the actual issue to something different .
Only the official spokespeople from 2 K seem at times to be able to reply reasonably on the issues , e.g. 2 K Elizabeth 's following statement :

Check the reference to being able to install and play simultaneously on 2 different systems .
I like this game , have nothing against 2 K , have only minor issues in the overall scheme of things with respect to the game 's activation and installation issues , but I 'm rapidly becoming fed - up with the knee - jerk responses of so many .

Because in the home computing environment especially , software is usually oriented towards a family using a single machine .
Even if you think about most productivity application software packages , multiple users do n't need multiple licenses .
My wife and son do n't need a seperate license to run Microsoft Word under their logins on my computer , or a seperated license for Windows XP , and that 's as it should be .
If your brother still lives at home , a part of the immediate family , the current model usually allows him to play for free .
The gaming world appears to be becoming more restrictive , however .
Continue voicing opinions like yours , and it will become even more so ... Today 01:16 PMsendittomeQuote : Originally Posted by 2 K Tech JT View Post

Did not think to happen so fast , but your statement is even more ridicilous .
So you also have to buy 2 ore more licences of Windows , ... the same weird logic .
Not bought for one machine but one user .
So in case your brother wants to use your computer with his profile --> buy 2nd licence .
Come on .... When does it stop ?
You don`t want to be taken serious with statements like this , do you ?

Seperate activations for different users on the same system is definitely frustrating .
However , if they were enforcing the EULA to the letter , only a single user on one machine could use the game .
Be happy !

Yes , activations are done per user on a machine .
However you do have a full 5 activations and can request more if you need to at any time .

Residents of San Francisco give their views on climate change
In pictures
After a week - long battle , firefighters have finally subdued the worst blaze to hit California 's Lake Tahoe region in a century .
But to Linda Adams , who heads California 's Environmental Protection Agency , it is only a sign of things to come .
" We can expect a lot more of this .
More fires , more drought .
This is global warming , " says Ms Adams .
While the administration of President George W Bush has been accused of wilfully ignoring climate change , the State of California has already taken unilateral action .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has charged Ms Adams with implementing what she calls " the most comprehensive law in the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions " .
She is referring to Assembly Bill 32 ( AB32 ) , or the Global Warming Solutions Act , passed last year by California 's Democratic - led assembly , with the backing of the governor , a Republican .
Trading emissions
The legislation obliges California to cut emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020 .
Work has begun on quantifying the level of emissions , after which a cap will be enforced , and industries will be able to buy and sell permits allowing a certain amount of pollution .
CALIFORNIA ACTS ON CLIMATE 2002 law on vehicle emissions cuts copied by 10 other states 2006 law AB32 demands cut in emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 $ 3bn programme to install solar panels on a million roofs
Power generators must source 20 % from renewable sources by 2010 Power firms rewarded if customers decrease energy use State suing six car makers for damage to climate
But Ms Adams says it will be better , using a " unique " combination of incentives , regulation and market forces .
" We 're using probably all the tools in the toolbox to address the problem , " she says .
She recently visited Europe to examine its system .
Many acknowledge it is far from perfect .
The price of carbon credits dropped to virtually nothing after the EU handed them out far too generously , critics say .
" Europe will admit that in their trial period the market collapsed - we went to find out why , to avoid the same mistakes , " she says .
Applying pressure
While California 's law has yet to be implemented fully , it is already being used as a template for nationwide action that American environmentalists hope will turn their country from a laggard on climate change , to a leader .
Fabian Nunez , the speaker of California 's state parliament , says that was exactly the intention .
The Democrats are leading a push for greater use of ethanol
" The intent for us when we passed AB32 was not only our commitment to California ; there is a sense of state activism .
" When you look around and see that our president has essentially turned a blind eye to the issue of climate change , it raises a lot of concerns .
So we wanted to help put the pressure on the federal government , and we think that 's worked quite well thus far . "
Indeed , the dominoes have started falling across the country .
Washington converts
Nine north - eastern states have committed to their own carbon trading scheme , and more than 400 mayors have pledged their cities to reduce emissions .
A lot of countries have resentment towards the US because we 've turned a blind eye to global warming
Fabian Nunez
speaker of California 's state parliament
The speaker of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , has pulled together a raft of different measures , being considered by 11 different congressional committees , under the banner of " energy independence " .
Many of the measures - which include new energy efficiency standards for appliances , increased use of ethanol to power vehicles , and long - term financial incentives for renewable power - tie in with President Bush 's call to reduce America 's dependence on foreign oil .
But they are also explicitly presented as a way of combating climate change , in language - " requiring federal government operations to be carbon - neutral by 2050 " , for instance - that could not have emerged from the White House or the previous Republican - led Congress .
Senator Barbara Boxer has taken over the Environment and Public Works Committee from Republican James Inhofe , who memorably declared global warming to be " the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people " .
She has approved efforts by two senators to produce a bill , along the lines of California 's AB32 law , which would introduce a greenhouse gas emissions cap and trade system nationwide .
It is expected within months .
President Bush has recently changed tack on climate change , saying in May that he wanted America to be part of a global deal , and inviting the world 's heaviest emitters for talks .
The move was welcomed by some , including Britain 's leader at the time , Tony Blair , as a significant change of attitude .
Environmentalists , however , said it was a " delaying tactic " , and that the US would only make a real impact on climate change when there was a change at the top .
Election issue ?
That is why next year 's presidential election is being eyed keenly and apprehensively .
Although climate change has not been a dominant theme of the early presidential campaign , many of the candidates , whether Democrat or Republican , have indicated they will go further on climate change than the current president .
Speaker Nunez sees the 2008 election as a watershed not only for global warming but for America 's reputation in the world .
" A lot of countries have resentment towards the US because we 've turned a blind eye to global warming , " he says .
" And for us to not act , for us to play a wait - and - see strategy , is not only an incorrect way but it sends a message of arrogance to the rest of the world .
" I believe that the next president of this country will indeed take a leadership role on this issue . "
Americans earned a smaller average income in 2005 than in 2000 , the fifth consecutive year that they had to make ends meet with less money than at the peak of the last economic expansion , new government data shows .
While incomes have been on the rise since 2002 , the average income in 2005 was $ 55,238 , still nearly 1 percent less than the $ 55,714 in 2000 , after adjusting for inflation , analysis of new tax statistics show .
The combined income of all Americans in 2005 was slightly larger than it was in 2000 , but because more people were dividing up the national income pie , the average remained smaller .
Total adjusted gross income in 2005 was $ 7.43 trillion , up 3.1 percent from 2000 and 5.8 percent from 2004 .
Total income listed on tax returns grew every year after World War II , with a single one - year exception , until 2001 , making the five - year period of lower average incomes and four years of lower total incomes a new experience for the majority of Americans born since 1945 .
On May 4 , Elizabeth Harper walked with her boss into Dennis Kucinich 's Capitol Hill office for a meeting and immediately noticed three things .
In the reception area , she saw a visiting nun in white robes .
In his inner office sat a shelf bearing an illustration depicting " light consciousness " and a bust of Gandhi .
She studied the lean and intense congressman and felt an attraction .
" Now this is an interesting man , " she thought .
Dennis had also closely observed Elizabeth , a statuesque Englishwoman with waist - length red hair .
" I saw her eyes go to the light consciousness picture , then to the Gandhi bust , then to me , " he says .
" It was like one , two , three .
That 's when I knew . "
Within an hour , he called his friend , actress Mimi Kennedy , best known for playing Dharma 's mother on " Dharma & Greg . "
" I met her , " Dennis said .
Kennedy knew exactly what he meant .
She gave a little yelp of joy .
Elizabeth and Dennis , by most laws of logic and logistics , should never have met .
She grew up in the 1980s in the tiny English village of North Ockendon , in a cottage where Pea Lane meets Dennis Lane .
At Maytree Cottage , she planted flowers , listened to her mother read stories by the wood stove in the winter , and with her younger sister tended stray animals .
Dennis grew up in the 1950s .
Sometimes , he and his six siblings and parents lived in the family car .
When his mother became ill , the children stayed at the Parmadale Home for Children for months at a time .
Elizabeth went to an academically competitive secondary school in nearby Upminster .
She and her classmates occasionally traveled Europe .
Always the tallest in her class , she was one of the school 's best players of net - ball , a game similar to volleyball .
Dennis , always the shortest boy in his class , went to high school at St. John Cantius in Cleveland 's Tremont neighborhood .
He worked several jobs to pay his tuition .
And despite his 4 - foot - 9 stature and weight of 97 pounds , he toughed it out on the football team as third - string quarterback .
In 1996 , Dennis , the once - marginalized boy mayor of Cleveland , continued his political comeback and was elected to U.S. Congress .
That same year , Elizabeth graduated from high school and took a plane to Agra , India - site of the Taj Mahal - where she had signed up to volunteer at one of Mother Teresa 's homes for India 's poorest children .
They really should n't have met , these two people , with oceans and three decades between them .
But they did share some things : a desire to work for peace , concern for the environment , a strong spirituality girded by Eastern traditions and - the thing that brought Elizabeth to his office last spring - a belief that monetary reform can offer a solution to poverty .
Well - educated woman lived among the poor
Elizabeth arrived in the United States in April , one month before meeting Dennis .
She spent part of her first month visiting an Austin , Texas , death - row prisoner with whom she had corresponded .
It was her second trip to this country and she was well - traveled and highly educated .
After earning her bachelor 's and master 's degrees at the University of Kent , she spent 16 months in a rural Tanzanian village , where she lived in a concrete - block , tin-roofed house , and worked as an advocate for regional development .
" It was there , and in India , that I learned that people who our society thinks have nothing , and who live in the poorest conditions , still find so much joy in life , " she says .
After she left Tanzania , she volunteered with a British Red Cross refugee unit ; earned a certificate in peace studies from Coventry University ; and got a job as a fund - raiser for a seafarer 's charity in London .
Often , her volunteer work took her to the House of Lords .
That was where she heard financial analyst Stephen Zarlenga speak about monetary reform .
She was impressed and soon was hired to become Zarlenga 's assistant at the Chicago - based American Monetary Institute .
It was that work that took her and Zarlenga to Dennis ' office .
At MacLaine 's house , they discovered each other
While Dennis was sure of his attraction at their initial meeting , he did n't know how Elizabeth felt .
Several nights later , in his Washington office , he sat at his desk and thought about her .
" Basically , I asked for a sign , " he says .
Seconds later , ping !
went his computer , alerting him to an e-mail .
It was from Elizabeth .
The first line read , " This has no connection to work . "
Dennis was ecstatic .
She was forwarding an e-mail from one of her friends that related to the peace legislation he had proposed as a presidential candidate .
He noticed her signature quote at the end : " Knowing love I shall allow all things to come and go , to be as supple as the wind and take everything that comes with great courage .
My heart is as open as the sky . "
This gave Dennis hope .
The two e-mailed each other regularly .
While the e-mails were businesslike , each of them had a deeper agenda :
They were attracted to one another .
A couple of weeks after their first meeting , while she was in Arizona with her boss for more meetings , she wrote Dennis an e-mail telling him where she was .
" Really ?
I 'm going to be in New Mexico tomorrow , " Dennis wrote back .
Elizabeth responded , " So will we ! "
Several hours later , Elizabeth went shopping before leaving for New Mexico .
She bought an opal ring - her birthstone .
For reasons she can't explain , she decided to call it her " Dennis ring . "
Elizabeth and her boss met Dennis in Albuquerque , where the congressman invited them to lunch the next day at his friend Shirley MacLaine 's house in Santa Fe .
While she was at MacLaine 's , Elizabeth 's phone rang .
It was her mother , calling from England .
" Mum , you 'll never guess who I 'm having lunch with - Shirley MacLaine ! "
Elizabeth put the actress on the phone .
Julia Massey had read MacLaine 's memoir , " Out on a Limb . "
After reading that book in the 1980s , Massey , who had worked as a secretary in London , decided to train to become a healer .
She learned how to provide alternative therapies like massage and aromatherapy to clients with health problems .
Eventually , she built a healing center called The Sanctuary next to the family cottage .
" I changed my life - my whole career - because of your book , " she told MacLaine .
Later at lunch , the actress , a longtime friend of Dennis , invited Elizabeth and Zarlenga to stay overnight .
" Dennis and I stayed up , sitting by the fire , talking until half past 6 in the morning , " Elizabeth recalls .
They professed their love for each other ; within a few days they decided to marry .
" We realized our life vision was the same , our outlook was the same , " Elizabeth says .
" It was a leap of faith , but based on a deep knowing . "
That Sunday , driving out of Santa Fe with her boss , Elizabeth looked down at the ring she had bought in Arizona .
For the first time , she noticed how the stone was inlaid in silver .
The design of the silver was two capital Ks , back to back .

Difference in age not a problem
Several days later , Elizabeth talked to her father , Graham Harper , who lives in Coventry , England .
" I 've met the man of my dreams , " she told him .
Her father had a few questions .
What 's his name , where does he live , what does he do ?
Then :
How old is he ?
" He 's just a bit older than you , " Elizabeth told her 56 - year - old father .
Her dad paused .
" So long as you know what you are doing , " he told her .
A few weeks later , Elizabeth called her father again to say she wanted to get married .
" You can 't , " he said .
" He has n't asked me yet . "
So Dennis got on the phone with his future father - in - law .
" And once I spoke with him and he told me how fond he was of Elizabeth , it was fine , " Harper says .
" Elizabeth is my best friend , and she 's got a very good head on her shoulders . "
Elizabeth 's mother was a bit concerned about her daughter 's plan .
An American politician ?
In England , people mostly hear about America 's conservative political figures .
She could n't imagine Elizabeth with such a man .
" But then I went to Dennis 's Web site and I realized he was so much like Elizabeth , " Massey says .
" It just seemed heaven - sent . "
She , too , found the age difference - Elizabeth 's 27 years to Dennis 's 58 - insignificant .
" This is about a meeting of souls . "
Of course , the age difference has garnered them attention .
" People who see us together understand - they see our connection , " Elizabeth says .
" And it 's not like I 'm some ditsy young thing and he 's an old fogey .
He has the wisdom of an ancient and the energy of youth . "
Dennis says , " I 've never seen myself as time - bound .
When you make a connection on a soul level , age is not important . "
As for having a family - Elizabeth says she would like children some day - Dennis says , " There 's no problem there . "
In early July , Elizabeth visited Dennis in Cleveland .
On July 5 , the two went to the Cleveland Orchestra concert at Public Square , and he showed her around downtown .
She loved the view from the Mall next to the convention center , with the graceful peace memorial fountain on the south end and the lake on the north .
" This is the place I want to get married , " she told Dennis .
They set the date for August so family members could travel from England .
Among the group of 17 family and friends were attendants who symbolized Elizabeth 's international travels .
Besides her sister , Verity , there was Elizabeth Jane Dunn , a native of Ireland ; Davinder Marway , whom Elizabeth met in India ; and Stellar Obeo Mamotto , a friend she met in Tanzania ( and for whom Elizabeth found a scholarship to a college in England ) .
Before they arrived , Elizabeth chose a dress for each bridesmaid .
She already had her dress .
A few years earlier , while shopping in London with girlfriends , she found a regal ivory gown with a chiffon train that flowed off the shoulders .
It fit perfectly , off the rack .
She stored the dress inside a trunk that her great - great - grandfather had carried to World War I .
All her mother had to do was send the dress to Cleveland .
Julia Massey and Graham Harper both say they found Cleveland beautiful , and came to adore Dennis .
Harper said he was amazed at how , when he traveled with Dennis throughout the city and suburbs , strangers would approach and thank him for his work .
" At first I was skeptical , but then I realized he could n't afford to pay that many people , " Harper says jovially .
Time is spent working with Dennis
These days , Elizabeth still does some work with the American Monetary Institute .
She 's also adding her personal touches to the couple 's West Side home .
Inspired by Dennis ' vegan diet , she has become a vegan as well , eschewing all animal products , including dairy .
" Dennis and I go to loads of community events , so I am getting to know my new home city and the people within it , " says Elizabeth .
When Elizabeth arrived in the spring , she expected to spend six months in the United States and then return to England .
She only brought summery clothes with her .
" I was n't prepared to be living here , so I 'm taking it slowly , exploring my new life , " she says .
She does n't plan to look for other employment .
" I could n't see there being any job of greater importance than working with Dennis - we have such a partnership .
I travel with him , and we spend the majority of our time in each other 's company . "
A sign in a sign from his campaign
Dennis ' bachelorhood became part of his run for president last year , with a contest held to find him a mate .
The dates did n't pan out , but something unusual happened in the spring of 2004 , a year before he met Elizabeth .
A group of supporters he visited in Brooklyn , N.Y. , painted an 8 - foot - long banner , heralding " Dennis Kucinich , the Peace Candidate . "
The detailed painting had a series of figures , people of all races and ethnicities forming an even row , from one side of the banner to the other .
Dennis put the banner away , and forgot about it until a few weeks ago .
Then he took it out of the box and unfurled it to show Elizabeth .
Stunned , he said , " Wow . "
In the middle of the row of painted figures , standing head and shoulders above all of them , is a woman in a white gown , with long red hair .

Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
This week marked Robert Mugabe 's 27th year in power in Zimbabwe .
Here , CNN Africa correspondent Jeff Koinange shares his perspective on Mugabe 's reign .
DAR ES SALAAM , Tanzania ( CNN ) --
I was 14 years old in 1980 and vividly recall that historic day on April 18 when the southern African nation of Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe .
I remember the British flag being lowered and the Zimbabwean one being raised .
To me , it seemed there was n't a dry eye in the crowd at Rufaru Stadium in the country 's newly named capital , Harare , previously known as Salisbury .
Rhodesia was named after the British financier - turned - philanthropist , Cecil Rhodes , and was a bastion of white settler rule with commercial farms , producing everything from tobacco to maize .
Africa 's latest independent republic rightfully boasted the title : southern Africa 's bread basket .
( Audio slide show : ' The man who ruined prosperous nation ' )
Among the guests at the stadium that night was reggae superstar , Bob Marley and the Wailers .
Zimbabweans went wild as Marley took to the stage , belting out his song " Zimbabwe . "
Watching these events unfolding on my black and white TV in not - too - distant Kenya , I thought what a great feat this nation had just accomplished .
Also impressive for me that night was the man speaking at the podium , the bespectacled , articulate , smartly dressed and newly elected prime minister of independent Zimbabwe : Robert Gabriel Mugabe .
His speech was like nothing I 'd ever heard .
His diction , impeccable -- his command of the English language , inspirational .
Mugabe was the toast of his nation that night , and the envy of millions across Africa .
In the minds of most , he could do no wrong having inherited a stable economy , a solid infrastructure and an agriculturally rich nation .
How wrong they turned out to be .
Mugabe cuts off ' nose to spite face '
Less than three decades later , Mugabe continues in power at the age of 83 years old despite squandering the post - independence inheritance .
In 2000 , he ordered the invasion of commercially owned white farms -- what critics say was a huge mistake .
Those farmers who did n't get killed or injured fled the country in droves .
The world cried foul -- in particular , Zimbabwe 's former colonial power , Britain .
The United States chipped in as well , and imposed sanctions on the government .
Mugabe 's answer was to tighten his grip on power .
I was in Zimbabwe for those first farm invasions in April 2000 .
What I saw was a country in a state of self - strangulation .
One of the white farmers being forced off his farm told me : " Mugabe 's about to cut off his nose to spite his face . "
At least 12 white farmers were killed in the next few months .
Months later , the confiscated farms ended up in the hands of Mugabe 's close allies .
Few of them had experience farming and the land quickly deteriorated to the point of lying barren .
Mugabe also clamped down on just about everything and everyone he felt was a threat , from lawyers to doctors to teachers and nurses .
He even went after the churches .
I continued to cover Zimbabwe 's downward spiral , from the presidential elections in 2002 that saw Mugabe defeat his opponent , Morgan Tsvangirai .
It was an election that was seen by international monitors as largely flawed .
I returned again for the 2005 parliamentary elections in which the opposition lost badly , leading to deep divisions .
Mugabe laughed off the win saying , " No one can beat me , not now , not ever . "
Some of our reports infuriated him and it was just a matter of time when Mugabe would turn on us .
In 2003 , he expelled most Western broadcasters from reporting within Zimbabwe .
" We consider the CNN and the BBC as enemy agents , " was what Zimbabwe 's ambassador to the United States , Machivenyika Mapuranga , said as he was being interviewed live on CNN recently .
' Millionaires go to bed hungry '
Zimbabweans have been fleeing their country across the border into South Africa in large numbers .
The United Nations estimates there are now more than three million Zimbabwe exiles in South Africa alone .
That 's about one - fourth of Zimbabwe 's population .
Many more have fled to Europe , Australia , the United States and Canada .
What Zimbabweans are leaving behind is a country spiraling out of control .
Inflation is the highest in the world -- at more than 1,700 percent .
The country 's currency -- the Zimbabwe dollar -- is being printed so fast that Morgan Tsvangirai , the country 's opposition leader , declared , " Zimbabwe is the only nation in the world where millionaires go to bed hungry . "
Eight out of 10 Zimbabweans are out of work , according to the CIA fact book , which profiles the countries of the world .
Many can't afford to send their children to school and life expectancy due to the onslaught of HIV - AIDS , as well as the current economic woes , is among the lowest in the world .
( Read about Zimbabweans so desperate for food they eat rats )
Add to all this what happened just weeks ago : the battered , bruised and bloodied images of opposition members who'd been savagely attacked while in police custody .
Mugabe had managed with this single incident to turn his splintering opposition into global heroes .
Whatever Mugabe 's intentions had been , these pictures , Africa watchers say , had shown a gross miscalculation on his part and a possible sign he may be starting to lose his grip .
Mugabe has not backed down , saying police have the " right to bash " protesters .
Is this the ' end game ' ?
Some in Zimbabwe see these latest events as the beginning of the end for the long - time leader .
" I hope these are pangs of birth for a new Zimbabwe and that this dictator must be brought down , brought down by peoples ' power , " said Pius Ncube , one of Mugabe 's most outspoken critics , who is the Archbishop of the southern Zimbabwe city of Bulawayo .
However , not every one believes this will happen .
Sekai Holland , a 64 - year - old mother of two children and grandmother of 10 , was among the opposition leaders who were badly beaten .
" I really think that for people to assume that this is the end game is quite silly -- unless efforts are done to ensure that Mugabe understands and accepts that , " she said .
Any efforts to that end would have to come from other presidents in Africa , she said .
" Unless that can be done , there is really no end game here .
He will continue to abuse until I do n't know , Zimbabwe is sitting down because right now we are on our knees . "
Africa analysts say the future of Zimbabwe -- with or without Mugabe -- is crucial due to the possible spillover effect across Africa .
" Zimbabwe is on the skids , " said political analyst Moeletsi Mbeki .
" The only positive thing is that there is a bottom to the skids . "
That bottom could be what some experts fear most -- that Zimbabwe , which literally means " House of Stone , " could come crumbling down to its foundations .

Q From Edward Teague :
What is the origin of the term big cheese as in “ He ’s a big cheese in the rugby world ” ?
A The big cheese is the most influential or important person in a group , though it has often been used in a derogatory way to refer to somebody self - important .
These days , it ’s more than likely to appear as a joking reference to a real cheese , since its slang use is rare and definitely outdated .
There ’s no shortage of expressions invoking cheese : one may be cheesed off ( miserable , annoyed , fed up ) , or something may be cheesy ( cheap , unpleasant or blatantly inauthentic ) .
These refer to the unhappy habit of ripe cheese making its presence known to anyone within sniffing distance .
But big cheese has a quite different origin , based on the only positive slang sense of cheese that seems ever to have existed .
This was first recorded in London in the nineteenth century , in forms like he ’s the cheese , it ’s quite the cheese , just the cheese , or simply the cheese , with the sense of a thing that was “ good , first - rate in quality , genuine , pleasant or advantageous ” as John Camden Hotten defined it in his Slang Dictionary in 1859 .
Cries Rigmaree , rubbing her hands , “ that will please —
My ‘ Conjuring cap ’ — it ’s the thing ; — it ’s ‘ the cheese ! ’ ”
The Ingoldsby Legends , by R H Barham , 1840 .
The Revered Richard Barham wrote the legends partly in verse , partly in prose , under the pretence that the antiquarian Thomas Ingoldsby of Tappington Everard in Kent was presenting old documents he had found .
The resulting comic and grotesque retellings of medieval legends and tales of crime , witchcraft and the supernatural were first published in the magazine Bentley ’s Miscellany from 1837 on .
They remained highly popular thoughout the second half of the century — an edition of 1881 sold 60,000 copies on its first day .
Explanations of its origins were often ingenious rather than satisfying :
Just the Cheese .
This phrase is only some ten or twelve years old .
Its origin was this : — Some desperate witty fellows , by way of giving a comic turn to the phrase “ C’est une autre chose , ” used to translate it , ‘ That is another cheese ; ’ and after awhile these words became “ household words , ” and when anything positive or specific was intended to be pointed out , “ That ’s the cheese ” became adopted , which is nearly synonymous with “ Just the cheese . ”
Notes and Queries , 23 July 1853 .
The expression is rather older than the writer ’s “ ten or twelve years ” , since the supposed French connection was floated as its origin in the London Guide in 1818 .
The French phrase means “ that ’s another thing ” .
As it happens , another writer in the same journal a month earlier had given what we now accept as the true origin .
Though it seems certain that it had nothing to do with a literal big cheese , Americans often offer one as its origin .
This was the Mammoth Cheese that was created for president Thomas Jefferson by the staunchly Republican citizens of Cheshire , a community in western Massachusetts that , like its English county namesake , was famous for its cheese .
A Baptist preacher named John Leland conceived the idea of making a vast cheese from one day ’s output of the local cows .
It turned out to be more than four feet in diameter and weighed 1,235 pounds ( 561 kg ) .
It arrived at the executive mansion ( not yet called the White House ) on New Year ’s Day 1802 and stayed on display for two years ; it is said that slices of it were still being served to guests in 1805 .
In one episode of the US television series The West Wing appeared Big Block of Cheese Day , in which White House staffers met fringe groups that would not otherwise get a hearing ; this refers to a later presentation of an even bigger cheese to Andrew Jackson in 1837 ; it ’s said that he invited passers - by into the White House to sample it .
Notwithstanding this suggested American connection , the most probable source is the Persian or Hindi word chiz , meaning a thing .
The expression used to be common among Anglo - Indians , e.g. , “ My new Arab is the real chiz ” ; “ These cheroots are the real chiz , ” i.e. the real thing .
The word may have been an Anglo - Indian importation , and it is difficult otherwise to account for it .
Hobson - Jobson , The Anglo - Indian Dictionary , by Sir Henry Yule and Arthur C Burnell , 1886 .
Sir Henry was primarily a historical geographer of central Asia and an expert in medieval travel writing .
This huge work was therefore something of a sideline , which he completed after Burnell ’s death in 1882 .
Its unique view of the everyday language of British officers in colonial India is so important to scholars that it has proved to be his principal legacy .
An expression with the same meaning that predated the real chiz was indeed the real thing , so it ’s probable that Anglo - Indians changed thing to chiz as a bilingual joke .
Once returnees from India started to use it in Britain , hearers naturally enough converted the unfamiliar foreign chiz into something more recognisable , and it became cheese .
The phrase big cheese developed from it in early twentieth - century America :
Roosevelt looks like the big cheese .
He stands at the head of every preempted party and if the greatest care is not exercised a vote will be cast for him regardless of whether it is the intention or not .
Daily Independent , Monessen , Pennsylvania , 30 October , 1912 .
It followed on several other American phrases containing big to describe a person of more than common importance , many with animal or vegetable associations — big bug , big potato , big fish and big toad , which may be echoes of the British English bigwig of the eighteenth century .
More recent examples are big shot , big enchilada and big banana .
Like the others , big cheese was by no means always complimentary and often had derisive undertones , no doubt helped along by the influence of other slang meanings of cheese .
The waters near the Siberian shore -- when free of ice -- are too shallow for giant cargo ships , and the infrastructure needed for navigation has deteriorated .
But a study conducted from 1993 to 1999 by researchers from Russia , Norway and Japan found that a route once sustained by Soviet diktat could also be viable for private enterprise .
There is , of course , a third Arctic shipping route besides the Arctic Bridge and the Northern Sea Route : the Northwest Passage .
It would be the last of the three main routes to succumb to the thaw .
But some Canadian officials , eyeing what will happen in 20 years , say it is all the more justification for investing in the rebirth of Churchill .
" We 're gearing up for the future , " said Mr. Lemieux , the Manitoba transportation minister .
" We look to be the gateway , the logistical hub of the world for circumpolar navigation . "
A lucky winner would be Pat Broe , the American who bought the Port of Churchill in 1997 almost as an afterthought , for a token $ 10 Canadian .
Looking to expand his railroad company , OmniTrax , he had already paid $ 11 million for 810 miles of denationalized tracks in Manitoba .
He acquired the port at auction , figuring he would rather own it than have someone else use it as a " toll booth " for his railroad .
Mr. Broe , a private man , declined to be interviewed for this article .
Since his acquisitions , OmniTrax estimates it has spent $ 50 million modernizing the port to accommodate big ships carrying exports like grain and farm machinery to Murmansk , and incoming Russian products , including fertilizer and steel .
By some hopeful estimates , Churchill 's shipping season could eventually grow to 8 or even 10 months a year , compared with the current 4 .
Michael J. Ogborn , OmniTrax 's managing director , said he could see a future for Churchill when " the activity at the port will be as busy as an anthill , with machines , people , freight and ships at dock . "
For now , though , there is a problem .
While the port has continued to ship grain to Europe and North Africa , it is still waiting for its ship to come in -- any ship from Russia , to demonstrate the advantages of the Arctic Bridge .

It is time to think about the " unthinkable .

The Bush Administration has both the inclination and the power to cancel the 2008 election .
The GOP strategy for another electoral theft in 2008 has taken clear shape , though we must assume there is much more we do n't know .
But we must also assume that if it appears to Team Bush / Cheney / Rove that the GOP will lose the 2008 election anyway ( as it lost in Ohio 2006 ) we cannot ignore the possibility that they would simply cancel the election .
Those who think this crew will quietly walk away from power are simply not paying attention .
The real question is not how or when they might do it .
It 's how , realistically , we can stop them .
In Florida 2000 , Team Bush had a game plan involving a handful of tactics .
With Jeb Bush in the governor 's mansion , the GOP used a combination of disenfranchisement , intimidation , faulty ballots , electronic voting fraud , a rigged vote count and an aborted recount , courtesy of the US Supreme Court .
A compliant Democrat ( Al Gore ) allowed the coup to be completed .
In Ohio 2004 , the arsenal of dirty tricks exploded .
Based in Columbus , we have documented more than a hundred different tactics used to steal the 20 electoral votes that gave Bush a second term .
More are still surfacing .
As a result of the King - Lincoln - Bronzeville federal lawsuit ( in which we are plaintiff and attorney ) we have now been informed that 56 of the 88 counties in Ohio violated federal law by destroying election records , thus preventing a definitive historical recount .
As in 2000 , a compliant Democrat ( John Kerry ) allowed the coup to proceed .
For 2008 we expect the list of vote theft maneuvers to escalate yet again .
We are already witnessing a coordinated nationwide drive to destroy voter registration organizations and to disenfranchise millions of minority , poor and young voters .
This carefully choreographed campaign is complemented by the widespread use of electronic voting machines .
As reported by the Government Accountability Office , Princeton University , the Brennan Center , the Carter - Baker Commission , US Rep . John Conyers ( D - MI ) and others , these machines can be easily used to flip an election .
They were integral to stealing both the 2000 and 2004 elections .
Efforts to make their source codes transparent , or to require a usable paper trail on a federal level , have thus far failed .
A discriminatory Voter ID requirement may also serve as the gateway to a national identification card .
Overall , the GOP will have at its command even more weapons of election theft in 2008 than it did in Ohio 2004 , which jumped exponentially from Florida 2000 .
The Rovian GOP is nothing if not tightly organized to do this with ruthless efficiency .
Expect everything that was used these past two presidential elections to surface again in 2008 in far more states , with far more efficiency , and many new dirty tricks added in .
But in Ohio 2006 , the GOP learned a hard lesson .
Its candidate for governor was J. Kenneth Blackwell .
The Secretary of State was the essential on - the - ground operative in the theft of Ohio 2004 .
When he announced for governor , many Ohioans joked that " Ken Blackwell will never lose an election where he counts the votes .
" But lose he did …. along with the GOP candidates for Secretary of State , Attorney - General and US Senate .
By our calculations , despite massive grassroots scrutiny , the Republicans stole in excess of 6 % of the Ohio vote in 2006 .
But they still lost .
Why ?
Because they were so massively unpopular that even a 6 % bump could n't save them .
Outgoing Governor Bob Taft , who pled guilty to four misdemeanors while in office , left town with a 7 % approval rating ( that 's not a typo ) .
Blackwell entered the last week of the campaign down 30 % in some polls .
So while the GOP still had control of the electoral machinery here in 2006 , the public tide against them was simply too great to hold back , even through the advanced art and science of modern Rovian election theft .
In traditional electoral terms , that may also be the case in 2008 .
Should things proceed as they are now , it 's hard to imagine any Republican candidate going into the election within striking distance .
The potential variations are many , but the graffiti on the wall is clear .
What 's also clear is that this administration has a deep , profound and uncompromised contempt for democracy , for the rule of law , and for the US Constitution .
When George W. Bush went on the record ( twice ) as saying he has nothing against dictatorship , as long as he can be dictator , it was a clear and present policy statement .
Who really believes this crew will walk quietly away from power ?
They have the motivation , the money and the method for doing away with the electoral process altogether .
So why would n't they ?
The groundwork for dismissal of both the legislative and judicial branch has been carefully laid .
The litany is well - known , but worth a very partial listing :
The continuation of the drug war , and the Patriot Act , Homeland Security Act and other dictatorial laws prompted by the 9/11/2001 terror attacks , have decimated the Bill of Rights , and shredded the traditional American right to due process of law , freedom from official surveillance , arbitrary violence , and far more .
The current Attorney - General , Alberto Gonzales , has not backed away from his announcement to Congress that the Constitution does not guarantee habeas corpus .
The administration continues to act on the assumption that it can arrest anyone at any time and hold them without notification or trial for as long as it wants .
The establishment of the Homeland Security Agency has given it additional hardware to decimate the basic human rights of our citizenry .
Under the guise of dealing with the " immigration problem , " large concentration camps are under construction around the US .
The administration has endorsed and is exercising its " right " to employ torture , contrary to the Eighth Amendment and to a wide range of international treaties , which Gonzales has labeled " quaint .
" With more than 200 " signing statements " the administration acts on its belief that the " unitary executive " trumps the power of the legislative branch in any instance it chooses .
This belief has been further enforced with the administration 's use of a wide range of precedent - setting arguments to keep its functionaries from testifying before Congress .
There is much more .
In all instances , the 109th Congress --- and the public --- have rolled over without significant resistance .
Most crucial now are Presidential Directive # 51 , Executive Orders # 13303 , # 13315 , #13350 , #13364 , #13422 , #13438 , and more , by which Bush has granted himself an immense arsenal of powers for which the term " dictatorial " is a modest understatement .
The Founders established our government with checks and balances .
But executive orders have accumulated important precedent .
The Emancipation Proclamation by which Lincoln declared an end to slavery in the South , was issued under the " military necessity " of adding blacks to the Union Army , a step without which the North might not have won the Civil War.
Franklin Roosevelt 's Executive Order # 8802 established the Fair Employment Practices Commission .
Harry Truman 's Executive Order # 9981 desegregated the military .
Most to the point , FDR 's Executive Order # 9066 ordered the forcible internment of 100,000 people of Japanese descent into the now infamous concentration camps of World War II .
There is also precedent for a president overriding the Supreme Court .
In the 1830s Chief Justice John Marshall enshrined the right of the Cherokee Nation to sovereignty over its ancestral land in the Appalachian Mountains .
But President Andrew Jackson scorned the decision .
Some 14,000 native Americans were moved at gunpoint to Oklahoma .
More than 3,000 died along the way .
All this will be relevant should Team Bush envision a defeat in the 2008 election and decide to call it off .
It 's well established that Richard Nixon --- mentor to Karl Rove and Dick Cheney --- commissioned the Huston Plan , which detailed how to cancel the 1972 election .
Today we must ask : who would stop this administration from taking dictatorial power in the instance of a " national emergency " such as a terror attack at a nuclear power plant or something similar ?
Nothing in the behavior of this Congress indicates that it is capable of significant resistance .
Impeachment seems beyond it .
Nor does it seem Congress would actually remove Bush if it did put him on trial .
Short of that , Bush clearly does not view anything Congress might do as a meaningful impediment .
After all , how many divisions does the Congress command ?
The Supreme Court , as currently constituted , would almost certainly rubber stamp a Bush coup .
If not , like Jackson , he could ignore it as easily as he would ignore Congress .
What does that leave ?
There is much idle speculation now about what the armed forces would do .
We also hear loose talk about " 90 million gun owners . " From the public side , the only conceivable counter - force might be a national strike or an effective long - term campaign of general non-cooperation .
But we can certainly assume the mainstream media will give lock - step support to whatever the regime says and does .
It 's also a given that those likely to lead the resistance will immediately land in those new prisons being built by Halliburton et. al .
So how do we cope with the harsh realities of such a Bush / Cheney / Rove dictatorial coup ?
We may have about a year to prepare .
Every possible scenario needs to be discussed in excruciating detail .
For only one thing is certain : denial will do nothing .

( CNN ) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs , who is awaiting trial in southern Utah , was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases , authorities said Thursday .
Polygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor .
A grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002 , according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith .
On Thursday , another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest .
Those offenses took place in Colorado City , Arizona , in 2003 , according to the indictment .
Both indictments state that Jeffs , leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( FLDS ) , committed the offenses " as an accomplice . "
According to Arizona law , sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison .
Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison .
" The cases involve two separate victims , " Smith said in the statement .
" Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved . "
Jeffs , 51 , is awaiting trial in Washington County , Utah , on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14 - year - old girl to her 19 - year - old cousin .
The trial initially was set to begin in April , but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year , and a new date has not been set .
At the time , Shumate said the delay was due to " recent information in the case , " but he did not elaborate .
The judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage , but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection .
Utah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry , and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man , and because Jeffs insisted she stay married , he is an accomplice to rape .
During his preliminary hearing in December , Jeffs ' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and , if it was , whether the sex was consensual .
The girl , identified only as Jane Doe , testified at the preliminary hearing that she was " so scared " during the forced wedding .
" The whole time I was crying , " she said .
" I wanted to die . "
The rape as an accomplice charge is a first - degree felony in Utah , carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison .
Jeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages , along with an additional charge of conspiracy .
Those charges , from 2005 , were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah .
Jeffs was captured August 28 , 2006 , in a traffic stop near Las Vegas , Nevada .
At the time , he had been on the FBI 's 10 Most Wanted List for months .
The FLDS freely practices polygamy in the towns of Hildale , Utah , and Colorado City , Arizona , which straddle the state line .
The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas , South Dakota , Nevada , British Columbia and Mexico .
The offshoot sect broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , based in Salt Lake City , Utah , over the practice of polygamy .
The Mormon church , which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago , has no ties to Jeffs ' group .

Antarctica is home to the largest body of ice on Earth .
Prior to approximately 10 years ago , no one thought that life could exist beneath the Antarctic ice sheets , which can be more than two miles thick in places , because conditions were believed to be too extreme .
However , Brent Christner , assistant professor of biological sciences at LSU , has spent a great deal of time in one of the world 's most hostile environments conducting research that proves otherwise .
Christner 's discoveries of viable microbes in ancient ice cores and subglacial environments coupled with the realization that large quantities of liquid water exist beneath the Antarctic ice sheet have changed the way biologists view life in Antarctica .
" More than 150 lakes have been discovered underneath nearly two - and - a - half miles of ice in Antactica , " said Christner , " and most of these bodies of water have likely been covered by ice for at least 15 million years .
The environmental conditions in the deep cold biosphere are unlike anything on the Earth 's surface and this represents one of the most extreme habitats for life on the planet . "
A time frame of up to one million years is required for microbes in the atmosphere to be transported through the ice sheet and enter an Antarctic subglacial lake .
Even though cells are preserved in the ice , the question of how the DNA of these organisms remains unscathed over such long periods of apparent metabolic inactivity still remains .
According to Christner , there are two possible explanations of how these microbes could survive frozen for millenia .
Firstly , the microbes may be dormant in the ice and possess " very effective repair mechanisms that are initiated when the cells are introduced to a growth situation , " he said .
Given enough time , dormant cells -- without active DNA repair mechanisms -- would eventually incur a lethal level of radiation - induced damage from natural background sources in the ice .
Alternatively , Christner suggests that the microbes may stay metabolically active while entrapped in the ice , giving them the ability to repair damage as it occurs .
" If this is the case , these microbes may be essentially immortal when frozen -- that is , if a continuous energy supply was available , " he said .
Christner 's current laboratory research has shown that glacier microbes are capable of metabolic activity when frozen down to - 20 degrees Celcius .
" Our experiments have revealed the potential for microbes to metabolize under frozen conditions , but we still lack the ' smoking gun ' which proves this occurs in nature .
We are now taking what we learned in the lab at LSU and using it to design experiments that address this question in real Antarctic ice samples , " he said .
In collaboration with research colleagues from Montana State University , Christner and two members of his laboratory will deploy to Antarctica in October 2007 .
Shawn Doyle , LSU senior and microbiology major , will accompany Christner , staying through January 2008 .
" I interviewed students based on their academic record and experiences , " said Christner .
" We 're looking for more than a lab rat , because , as you might imagine , Antarctica presents various challenges for doing science . "
He is currently looking for a Ph.D. student to join the research team and conduct field work during the 2008 - 09 Antarctic season .
" The implication of our research is that the large ice sheets of Antarctica , which make up 70 percent of the planet 's fresh water reserves , may represent active biomes , substantially expanding the known boundaries for life on Earth , " said Christner .
" Terrestrial glacier environments provide analogues to address questions relevant to the search for past or present microbial life in extraterrestrial ice on planets and moons in our solar system .
Based on what we now know about the tenacity of life in Earth 's deep cold biosphere , microbial life surviving and persisting in ice on Mars or Europa is not that much of a stretch . "
Top GOP senator calls on Bush to start bringing troops home by Christmas David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 23 , 2007

On his return from a trip to Iraq , a top Republican senator called on President Bush to take the " first step " in a withdrawal from Iraq start bringing US troops homes before Christmas .
Sen. John Warner ( R - VA ) , formerly Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee during Republicans recent control of the Senate and now the most senior Republican on the committee , said a troop drawdown would be the best way to show the Iraqi government that US troops will not be there to provide security forever .
There is " no clearer form of that , than if the president were to announce on the 15th ( of September ) that in consultation with our senior military commanders , he 's decided to initiate the first step in a withdrawal of our forces , " Warner said .
Warner had just spent two days in Iraq with Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ( D - MI ) .
" I say to the president , respectfully .
Pick any number you wish , " Warner said .
" You do not want to lose the momentum , but certainly in 160,000 plus ( troops in Iraq ) , say 5,000 could begin to redeploy and be home to their families and loved ones no later than Christmas of this year .
That 's the first step . "
Warner said Bush , not Congress should decide the details of the drawdown , but he encouraged the president to establish a timetable for withdrawal .
" Let the president establish the timetable of withdrawal , not the Congress , " Warner said .
The Virginia Republican has grown increasingly critical of the war in Iraq in recent months .
Last month , Warner teamed with fellow Republican Richard Lugar to draft a plan calling on President Bush to narrow the mission of US troops in Iraq .
Warner 's eighth term expires next year , and he has so far not announced whether he will fight to keep his Senate seat .
Political observers suspect he may be planning to leave the Senate when his term expires , and reports that his political fundraising committee brought in only $ 500 in the first quarter of this year have only fueled retirement rumors .
The following video is from MSNBC's News Live , broadcast on August 23 .
Transcript of Warner press conference : # SEN .
WARNER : Good afternoon , everybody .
I have a bit of a raspy throat from hot air and dust .
Let 's get a little water going here before I get started .
So if you 'll bear with me .
Are we about ready ?
Thank you very much for joining .
Senator Levin and I finished a -- basically a four - day codel to the region .
( To staff ) Have we got some water here ?
Because this is a dry -- thank you -- a dry throat .
Senator Levin and I finished a four - day visit to the region .
I took a day in advance and went into Kuwait to study the base which will facilitate such redeployments as they may and when they occur , and also to consult with our embassy team and intelligence establishment in that country .
Senator Levin then joined me and we went into Iraq .
I must say our time was so short .
We 're only allowed , codels , to spend one night , so we put as much as we could into each and every day .
And we got up at 3:30 in the morning after flying most of the night to get into the region and start .
I felt that every consideration was accorded us by the administration , especially an excellent team we have on the ground in there , military leadership , General Petraeus , General Odierno .
Ambassador Crocker is a man I 've known very well through the years .
He 's a superb diplomat .
Those of you who may have been around in the buildup to the Iraq operation recall that the Senate leadership every morning at 8:00 would have a briefing up in S - 407 , and I at that time , as -- on the -- senior man on the Armed Services Committee , would conduct those briefings , and Crocker was the State Department representative .
And Colonel Canio ( sp ) , who 's here , was the representative from the Department of Defense .
Anyway , so much for that history .
The NIE came out today , and incidentally , you may recall that in the amendment that Senator Lugar and I put forward -- it 's not become law -- but we required in that amendment that an NIE be filed in this time frame .
And I 'm very appreciative of it .
I feel in general that the key judgments -- and I hope that you 've had copies of this -- the key judgments in there track very closely the findings that Senator Levin and I made and set forth in our joint statement .
Now , Senator Levin and I have worked together for some 29 years on the committee .
Curiously , I 've been chairman three times ; he 's been chairman three times .
Obviously some of those periods were short .
But -- we have strong philosophical differences , but we do work together as a team and have worked effectively .
So at the end of these four days , we sat down and put together in this report those items on which we could agree , and recognizing that there were aspects of this trip in which we had varied opinions .
For example , in the last paragraph of our report -- and I 'd like to read to you such one paragraph -- " We believe that the recent high - level meetings among Iraqi political leaders could be the last chance for this government to solve the Iraqi political crisis .
And should it fail , we believe the Iraqi Council of Representatives and the Iraqi people need to judge the government of Iraq 's record and determine what actions should be taken -- consistent with the Iraqi constitution -- to form a true unity government to meet those responsibilities . "
I stand by that statement .
Carefully crafted -- I wrote it , and I specifically put in there " consistent with the constitution . "
That statement was one that I think most of us had thought about before the trip to Iraq , and indeed much of what I say today is a culmination , yes , of the trip but of thoughts and ideas that I 've been sort of assembling in my mind for some time .
The NIE itself said that the Iraqi government is precarious , in their judgment , for the next six to 12 months .
As Senator Levin left early the next morning -- he proceeded on into very important visits he had in Israel , and I proceeded to the United States -- he told me he was going to have a press conference , and he did , and he made the statement to the effect that he hopes the parliament will vote the Maliki government out of office .
We discussed that earlier in the evening .
I said that I could not go that far , freely understanding that there was a basis of fact and opinion which had been given to us both here in CONUS before we left and on this trip , which laid a foundation for his remarks .
But I felt at this time I had the following obligations .
One , that I had offered an amendment in the Senate which got 54 votes , did not become law , but nevertheless , with the help of Robert Byrd , our senior member of the Senate , we got that amendment almost verbatim , almost not a word changed , into the appropriation bill .
And that 's the amendment that created the Jones Commission .
I met with General Jones earlier today .
He 's going to complete his work and have it before the Senate very early in September ; and laid down the benchmarks , and specifically , called on Petraeus , Crocker to come before the Congress and the United States and relevant committees and the president to make a report on the 15th .
Now , for that reason , I felt that I did not want to go quite the last step that he did and in no way do I criticize him .
The second reason I did n't go is rather an interesting one .
The final night in Iraq the president of Iraq , President Talabani , gave us a small dinner attended by Levin and myself , Crocker , and the deputy prime minister and our United States ambassador .
Somewhat to our surprise in the course of that evening he produced several documents , and he raised them up and he said , " Here are documents which I hope will be approved by the Group of 5 " -- now , that 's Prime Minister Maliki , the president , Talabani , the two vice presidents and Barzani .
They had been meeting , and they were going to meet again in the coming days to determine whether or not these documents , which purportedly represents resolution of issues like de-Ba'athification , the carbon laws , that is the energy , oil monies distribution , and a series of other very important benchmarks .
So I felt given that hope , faint as it may be , I felt we should n't -- I should n't go the step with regard to Maliki that Senator Levin took .
Today in my consultations at the White House , and I 've since been advised twice since I 've returned , that those documents which we saw are being , as we speak this afternoon , considered again by the Group of Five , and that it could well be that they would be acted upon in some degree of formality by segments of the Iraqi government , hopefully the legislature but indeed the funnel by which matters proceed up to the legislature , prior to September 15th .
So there 's a flicker of hope of some of the important issues , which reflect reconciliation between Sunni and Shi'a and Kurd , could be achieved by the 15th .
Now back to Iraq itself , the security situation again , as said by the NIE -- it 's measurable but uneven , and I agree with that .
And as I said , our findings pretty well parallel what was done by the NIE .
I mentioned the superb team .
Also we had several trips out into the field with our military , our tactical commanders , the troops .
And I 've had a privilege through much of my lifetime to be associated with the U.S. military .
And I tell you , I 've never seen finer , more dedicated individuals than those in uniform today in our armed forces , and particularly those in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Iraqi forces , somewhat to my surprise , we got very favorable reports .
Again , measurable improvement , particularly , for example , in the Baghdad operation .
As you recall , the president on January 10th said our forces will work with the Iraqi forces .
He even used the words that they will take the point .
Well , to some degree they have taken the point .
And their losses , their casualties number three times as many as we have the misfortune to lose ourselves .
We did learn another disturbing thing , and that came from General Petraeus .
Constantly , General Petraeus and others in his command are urging and moving forward with the Iraqi training and encouraging them to take an even larger role .
But surprisingly , they 're not receiving the arms that they need , the equipment that they need to perform those responsibilities jointly with our forces .
And that was brought to the attention of Secretary of Defense Gates when he preceded us by a week or so .
And General Petraeus said , go back , senators , and help the Department of Defense and the Department of State to expedite the Foreign Military Sales program by which the Iraqi government , in as early as January this year , put over a billion and a half dollars in a bank in the United States and entrusted to the Department of Defense to negotiate contracts with U.S. suppliers of armaments and to facilitate the rapid transportation of those supplies to the forces in Iraq .
Well , the process just had stalled out , and Secretary Gates asked Secretary England to take personal responsibility , and yesterday Secretary England 's team came over and briefed me , and there are corrective measures being taken at this time .
But it was distressing to learn that here in our own federal system was an impediment to the Iraqi forces as they begin to take on greater responsibility , an impediment in the form of the shortage of the basic things like rightful ammunition and body protection and the rest .
I want to now go to another section in here and talk about President Bush 's speech on the 10th of January .
President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki in a sense formed a partnership .
I remember that chapter ever so well , because I had come back just months before from Iraq and said things were going sideways , and that remark of mine , coupled with remarks similar in text to other -- from other colleagues , really urged the administration to do a top - to - bottom reassessment of the strategy , and the rest is history .
That was done , and on the 10th , the president made his announcement .
Now , the surge was four parts .
It was a security part , which we largely to perform together with Iraqi forces ; it was an Iraqi political part , and that was a pledge by Maliki and his -- and the partnership to go forward with reconciliation measures ; a regional part , which is -- had some progress on our part -- we 've had two meetings now with the neighboring nations ; and an economic part .
But I want to address that Iraqi commitment that they made with our president on January 10th , because I really firmly believe the Iraqi government , under the leadership of President -- Prime Minister Maliki , have let our troops down .
Our troops , fighting with the Iraqi forces , delivered on that commitment .
And the NIE confirmed that the Iraqi government continues to struggle in trying to meet any of those commitments , and that struggle , in accordance with the NIE , could exist for the next 10 or 12 months .
Now , what 's the future course of action ?
( Pause . )
We have the reports , as drawn up in the law , for Crocker and Petraeus , General Jones , the GAO , chairman of the Joint Chiefs and others to present to the president and the Congress their own findings and recommendations .
Then the president will make his statement , but I want to call your attention to the following .
The president said in that statement on the 10th , " If members of Congress have improvements " -- I judge that to be suggestions -- " that can be made , we will consider them and possibly make them . "
Well , I have a recommendation today , and I do it with a deep sense of humility and respect .
Yesterday the president said -- in a question , I think , to Congress , he said , " Will the elected leaders in Washington pull the rug out from under our troops as they are gaining momentum ? "
Now they are gaining momentum .
Certainly I 've indicated , measured the momentum in Baghdad , Anbar province , up in the Mosul area , where we visited , and in other areas .
And I can assure the president that this senator in this recommendation that I have for him is not in any way trying to pull the rug out from under the troops , troops that I 've had an association with , privileged -- and learned from over a half - century of my life .
I also firmly believe that the goals the president has set in terms of the vital nature of this area -- i.e. , Iraq -- not only to the region but to the security interests and the economic interests of this country , I support the president in that .
I do n't for a minute advocate any rapid pullout or any other type of action of that nature .
My record is consistent .
While I have given some criticism by way of this previous January 10th announcement , successfully ( sic ) thereafter I have supported the president and voted against any timetable for withdrawal .
But I come and bring your attention again to the January 10th statement .
The president said the following , a quote out of the January 10th : " I made it clear to Prime Minister Maliki and the Iraqi other leaders that America 's commitment is not open - ended . "
And the president has continued to make similar statements to that effect .
On July 12th the president said , " The Iraqis do not want U.S. troops patrolling their cities forever , any more than the American people want them doing that . "
It seems to me that we 've got to look at those statements .
And I conclude with one attributed to Ambassador Crocker which appeared yesterday in the press .
Crocker called the political progress in Iraq , quote , " extremely disappointing , " and warned that the U.S. support for the Maliki government did not come with a blank check .
Now those are powerful statements of yesterday and in the past but , it seems to me , the time has come to put some meaningful teeth into those comments , to back them up with some clear , decisive action , to show that we mean business when those statements and others like it have been made .
And so therefore I make a recommendation to the president .
I respectfully say to them , in his consultation with the military here in the coming weeks -- actually that consultation is going along quite steadily .
Excuse me , bit of a cold .
That consultation is ongoing .
Take into consideration the need to send a sharp and clear message throughout the region , to the United States and one that people can understand it .
I think no clearer form of that than if the president were to announce on the 15th that in consultation with our senior military commanders , he 's decided to initiate the first step in a withdrawal of armed forces .
I say to the president respectfully , pick whatever number you wish .
You do not want to lose the momentum but certainly in 160,000 - plus , say , 5,000 could begin to redeploy and be home to their families and loved ones no later than Christmas of this year .
That 's the first step .
Let the president establish the timetable of withdrawal , not the Congress .
Under the constitution as commander - in - chief , he has that authority .
He need not lay out a totality of a timetable .
I would advise against it .
Take each step at a time , then make an evaluation of the impact of that step that it did not lessen the momentum , did not lessen the ability of our forces to continue to supply a greater degree -- provide a greater degree of security , be it Baghdad or where else we can do it , and to determine what is the reaction of the neighboring countries in the region .
Perhaps they 've all been sitting there waiting to see what we would do .
And given the NIE , which says , " Mr. President , it 's up to 12 months before we can expect any particular degree of reconciliation , " we simply cannot as a nation stand and put our troops at continuous risk of loss of life and limb without beginning to take some decisive action which will get everybody 's attention .
That simple announcement of a ( single ? ) redeployment of some several thousand individuals under the military tradition first come , first serve in Iraq , first to depart -- got to be careful how those selections -- they can pick them from various units to put together a group and send them back -- then evaluate , re-evaluate how successful it has been .
Then , perhaps , at the president 's discretion select a second date and time for a contingent to be redeployed .
Now , in my humble judgment , that 'll get everybody 's attention , the attention which is not being given to us at this time .
I got on the airplane and I picked up the Jordan Times , and it just -- this is the type of thing that 's written in periodicals , and each and every one of you have read it .
And they say in the Jordan Times , the Iraqis hold the key to any U.S. withdrawals .
That 's got to be dispelled .
Our president holds the key to any U.S. withdrawals , and I think a step , as I 've outlined , will make that eminently clear .
And from that point , we 'll just have to evaluate each and every decision the president makes with regard to further withdrawals .
Ladies and gentlemen , I 'll take your questions .
Q Senator Warner -- SEN .
WARNER : Yeah ?
Q
Have you expressed -- SEN .
WARNER : All right .
I 'm going to try -- I 'll just sort of go from the right .
Yes ?
Q
Have you expressed those views to the president personally ?
( Off mike . ) SEN .
WARNER : I have not had that opportunity .
I did spend an hour - plus at the White House this morning with senior advisers .
I likewise have been in telephonic communication with senior advisers once I left Iraq .
Q But Senator Warner -- SEN .
WARNER : Yes ?
Q -- General Petraeus and other senior generals have already said that the surge cannot continue beyond April .
The troop -- the manpower levels are not there .
Are you suggesting there should be a deployment of another unit beyond the troops involved in the surge or troops that are already scheduled to redeploy back to the U.S. ?
SEN .
WARNER : Well , I 'll leave to the Department of Defense to determine how they compose the first redeployment .
I said those individuals that have been in Iraq the longest -- it seems to me they 're the most eligible .
I do not suggest they pick a unit and bring it back .
It 's just the fact that we will start an orderly , carefully planned , thought - out redeployment .
We 'll start with the first step -- take each step and evaluate it , another step and evaluate it .
What 's the response of the bordering nations ?
Will this get their attention to begin to step up and take on more of the responsibility ?
Will other nations in the world begin to think , " Aha , the United States means what it says , as the president says on January 10th ; we did n't come to stay . "
So I think it sends a strong signal .
Yes , sir ?
Q Senator , you 've made this as a recommendation to the president .
SEN .
WARNER : That 's correct .
Q Back in January you recommended that the surge be done in small steps , so we could see if it works .
SEN .
WARNER : Correct . Q
The president chose not to take your advice .
If he does n't take your advice this time , should the Congress step in and force certain steps ?
SEN .
WARNER : It -- the last -- I 'd -- the Constitution is very explicit as to the president 's authority , as to Congress 's authority .
In reality , we have but one tool , and that is to terminate funding .
And having served in the Pentagon for five years during Vietnam and witnessed what the Congress did , I do not want to see a repeat of that .
This is an opportunity to show the president is going to take the initiative ; the president will set his timetable ; the president , in consultation with military advisers , makes the decision if a deployment such as I recommend is feasible , and any subsequent redeployments after that .
Yes ?
Q Senator Warner , I have a twofold question , and it has to do with the -- ( off mike ) -- pretty supportive of the Iraq Study Group recommendations .
SEN .
WARNER : Yeah .
Q
You talked about , in the Warner - Lugar amendment , a change of mission from combat to support .
Are you at all advocating today a change in the mission in any way , not just the numbers -- SEN .
WARNER : To an extent , this type of action could result in a change of mission .
I 'd draw your attention to the NIE , which cautioned in its -- I think it 's the last finding -- that we would have to be very careful as to the timing of any strategy by which we would go to some of the basic elements of the Baker - Hamilton report .
So at this point , I -- this does not embrace that .
But it seems to me that we could take what we call a strategic overview posture .
In other words , in no way are we going to flick a switch and the lights are off and our troops are going to be pulled out of there .
No , I think it has to be done very carefully , thoughtfully , planned out and orderly .
But we also -- the forces that are left there would -- could be used where the commanders feel they could make a difference if a security situation were to arise .
And most specifically , I think that this sort of strategy has in the future got to focus on what we do best .
And our forces are well - trained in issues of border security , we have a lot of equipment that can make those borders , I think , more secure , and to begin to eliminate the ever - increasing , really , threats from Iran in infiltrating people and armaments in , and to some extent the increasing threats of Syria in allowing people to come in and join the al Qaeda .
So I think there will be a change of strategy if we move in that direction and focus more on what we know how to do best and let the Iraqi security forces handle the domestic insurgency .
Q Senator ?
SEN .
WARNER : Yes ?
Q ( Off mike ) -- SEN .
WARNER : What 's that ?
Q ( Off mike ) -- the NIE , then , negates any Warner - Lugar -- SEN .
WARNER : Well , I do n't know that it negates it .
If you look at the NIE , it talks specifically about the timing of that .
Now remember , in Warner - Lugar we just said give a plan , put it in place and show us before December .
So it seems to me that gives sufficient time to make an evaluation .
Yes , sir ?
Q Senator Warner , I just wanted get clear on one thing , and then I have another question .
SEN .
WARNER : Yeah .
Q
When you went to the White House today -- ( off mike ) ?
SEN .
WARNER : I 'm very careful about the opportunities I have to go to the White House ; I , frankly , just do n't comment .
Q Okay .
SEN .
WARNER : Thank you .
Q
My other question is , how can you reaffirm to the president and the American people , when the president says he does n't want moves to pull the rug out , in his words -- SEN .
WARNER : That 's correct .
Q
He would not do that .
Do you put more -- do you put the onus squarely on Minister Maliki -- ( off mike ) -- his inability for the government to -- ( off mike ) ?
SEN .
WARNER : Whoa , back up .
I said , as a preamble , I thought through this very carefully .
I do not consider this recommendation to the president to be tantamount to any pulling the rug out under the troops .
I would n't be a party to that .
As to the Maliki situation , I made it very clear .
No disrespect to my colleague Senator Levin , but I decided not to go as far as he had .
But I did say , just draw the attention to the last paragraph , the provisions in their own constitution by which the people of Iraq through their elected representatives can make changes in their government .
That 's all .
Yes .
Q Senator , with regards to your experience during the Vietnam War when you were in the Nixon administration -- SEN .
WARNER : Yeah .
Q
Do you think the president 's parallel yesterday -- ( off mike ) -- Killing Fields -- ( off mike ) -- Vietnam aftermath -- is that accurate ?
And does it help us at all ?
SEN .
WARNER : I looked at it ; I read it very carefully .
I was there for five years , four months and three days .
Privileged to be undersecretary , secretary of the Navy , and made a number of trips to Vietnam and the region .
I feel that there are no parallels really .
It 's a different type of situation we were in , a country many , many miles away , a country that really did not pose a threat to the internal security of the United States as these conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq do .
But the president was correct to observe the really sad way in which we finally departed that country .
I was privileged to work with Secretary Laird , and as a matter of fact , Secretary of Defense Laird talked to me today .
And he said -- kind of somewhat concerned about the chapter of history and to make sure it 's accurate because he gave months of his career to it .
In terms of the way we terminated , we do not want , and I think that was the president 's point , a repeat of that disorderly withdrawal in this conflict .
And I guarantee you , as I 've come to know the president , he would not permit any withdrawal program to become disorderly .
It 'll always be carefully thought - out and planned together with superb military advisor team and the secretary of Defense he has in place now .
Q Senator ?
SEN .
WARNER : Yes ? Q
Two questions .
First , have you talked to any Republican colleagues about your recommendation , and do you feel you have support from them for it ?
And second , what makes you think that sending this kind of signal would really jump - start the Maliki government to some kind of political reconciliation ?
SEN .
WARNER : Number one , I take total responsibility of this .
I did not consult with my colleagues .
Secondly , when I see an NIE which corroborates my own judgment , that political reconciliation has not taken place -- the Maliki government has let down the U.S. forces and to extend his own Iraqi forces , which have fought bravely to restore a measured improvement in the security in Baghdad -- I say to myself , what will it take to get his attention , the attention of the Iraqi people , the attention of the bordering countries to come in and take a more active role in bringing about a reconciliation between the three basic divisions , ethnic divisions in that country .
And wherever we went , people talk about " your withdrawal . "
Wherever we went , people would talk about the withdrawal and the schedule .
Well , it does n't exist , because the administration , I think very consciously , has said that 's not an option on the table .
But we 're coming up to this summit of all of these converging reports , and I say to the president , with great respect , consider that you initiate the withdrawal , and no longer -- I would hope that there would be calls from the Congress and attempts to do it -- if we can see in your actions a building of confidence that you 're taking in consideration a phased withdrawal , which you and you alone established , together with your military commanders , and do it a step at a time , very carefully , evaluating each redeployment , its impact on the ability of our forces to continue to perform a role .
But I 'm hopeful that this could lead to more emphasis on the Iraqi forces taking the major responsibility as it relates to the internal insurgency in that country .
Q
Sir , are you saying that the president should do this because if he does n't , the Congress will do it with him ?
SEN .
WARNER : I 'm not putting this thing out as a threat , my friend .
I simply -- he invited on January 10th suggestions from members .
I am putting forward respectfully this suggestion .
In the back .
Q
We hear a lot about -- ( off mike ) -- SEN .
WARNER : Beg pardon ?
Q
We hear a lot about Iran training extremists inside its border .
In parts of the NIE that you mentioned , they focused on Iran meddling in Iraq .
I would like to ask what 's your assessment on -- SEN .
WARNER : I 'm missing a word or two .
" I would like to ask " -- Q
I would like to ask you what is the likelihood of a U.S. attack on Iran in order to stop Iran -- SEN .
WARNER : In no way today do I want to deal with that issue .
Our security apparatus in this ( country ? ) , from the president on down through the secretaries of State and Defense , take those matters into consideration .
I 've always been of the assumption that this nation will be protected , our security interests would be protected , and that this president and his security team will take such actions as to protect us .
And I do n't take anything off the table .
Yes ?
Q Chairman Warner , you mentioned that -- ( off mike ) -- SEN .
WARNER : Beg pardon ?
Q
You mentioned that this suggestion is an attempt to put more of the responsibility on the Iraqi armed forces , but the NIE stated that -- ( off mike ) -- six to 12 months that the Iraqi security forces wo n't be able to conduct major operations independent of the coalition .
And now if this suggestion is taken on , are you , in a sense , pulling the rug out from under the Iraqi troops there when they 're not quite ready ?
SEN .
WARNER : It 's not that intention .
As I said , take 5,000 .
Now , 5,000 is not going to be a destabilizing number of armed forces .
That 's not going to be destabilizing .
It 's not going to in any way denigrate the ability for us to continue to train and work with the Iraqi forces .
But it will send a very clear signal to support what the president said on January 10th -- we 're not there to stay forever -- and what Ambassador Crocker said yesterday -- we 're not giving you a blank check .
I just feel those statements , it 's time to come and put a good , strong , clear bite on them .
Yes ?
Q Can I just clarify one thing ?
You 're not setting a specific date for this to begin .
SEN .
WARNER : I just said first redeployment , hopefully , where the troops would get home by Christmas .
Q Right .
SEN .
WARNER : Now , that 's a great symbolism -- Q
You 're not saying -- SEN .
WARNER : Beg pardon ?
Q
You 're not saying it should start at a specific time .
SEN .
WARNER : No , it 's up to the president .
Q
And is this going to find its way into some sort of resolution or sense of the Senate ?
SEN .
WARNER : I could n't -- I can't answer that .
In other words , I 'm not in any way saying what my next step would be , except I 've tried to work and be respectful of the Office of the Presidency in this situation .
And after the full report by the president on September 15th , I , like , I think , almost all of our colleagues feel we 're free to voice our own -- our own opinions with regard to what he does on that date .
And I wo n't try and chart the future .
I think we should wait until the reports made by those individuals and the president .
Yes , sir ?
Q
For those who support the president 's war policy at this point , do you worry that your new position now could cost you support from some Republicans back home ?
SEN .
WARNER : I -- you know me well .
You cover me .
For those here in this room -- your two colleagues here -- I 'm not concerning about the political aspects of this .
I think the American people just want strong , decisive leadership , both from the president and the executive branch and the Congress .
This , I say with a sense of humility , is one way that I can show leadership that I 'd like to bring to this very important time , when all these options are being considered .
Q Senator , from your discussions with the Iraqi leaders , do you get any sense that withdrawal of , say , 5,000 or 10,000 would really get their -- I mean , 180,000 minus 5,000 still leaves an awful lot of troops there .
Would that really get their attention ?
SEN .
WARNER : Well , I did not discuss it with them .
But I simply say to you , that headline that the president -- when he said , we do n't want to patrol the streets ; Iraqi people do n't want to do it ; we do n't want to do it .
When he said these things , this is what we meant .
There will come that time when we have decided to begin an orderly , I repeat , orderly and carefully planned withdrawal .
And , say , 5,000 , whatever number the president takes , will send a signal but it will not in my judgment change materially any of the military situations now emplaced in the immediate future .
All right , who wants to wrap it up ?
Start with you .
You can wrap it up .
Q
If the Iraqi government did not respond to that withdrawal of 5,000 troops , then you said that the president should set a second date , is that right ?
SEN .
WARNER : No , I did n't say that .
I said -- no , no , I said , do the first withdrawal ; make an evaluation .
Let 's wait until that time comes .
I do n't want to speculate .
Thank you all .
Yes , all right .
Q
The senior intelligence officials , this morning when they were briefing on the NIE , they said there 's no direct evidence that the Iranians are actually directly involved in the attacks inside the Iraqi border .
They said , they 're sending in weapons , but there 's no evidence -- ( off mike ) -- doing anything within the border .
Did General Petraeus give you any different sense ?
SEN .
WARNER : I 'd have to reflect on hours of conversation with many .
I would n't attribute it to any specific person like Petraeus or others .
But I felt that we had received information to the effect that Iran is in some way not only allowing -- I 'll put that down -- allowing weapons which are devastating to our troops -- these shaped charges -- to come in , but it 's likely that there 's some measure of infiltration of other people .
I feel that one of the problems here is with the Maliki government is that they just cannot help but be so sectarian .
This is not a unified government .
We 've got to get away from this sectarian business , and I think the Iranians are doing everything they can to foster the sectarian interests from the viewpoint of the Shi'a to the disadvantage of the Sunni .
Thank you all very much .
Q ( Off mike ) -- Prime Minister Maliki ? SEN .
WARNER : I 'm not going to get into anything like that , no .
Thank you .
Q Senator , before you leave , could we just ask a -- ( inaudible ) -- question about -- SEN .
WARNER : Yeah .
Q -- given your own observations from your trip , given the NIE , where do you see Iraq in , say , five or 10 years from now , as a free Iraq -- ( off mike ) -- SEN .
WARNER : Well , I -- all I can say -- and I reiterate and I concur in the president 's observation and indeed many others -- that the future of Iraq is absolutely a matter that will affect our own national security and national interests and the interests of the bordering countries in the region and indeed many other countries .
And therefore , it would be my hope that together with our efforts and our enormous sacrifices to date and such further sacrifices as we must make not to let this country simply implode .
Q
Are you optimistic or pessimistic ?
SEN .
WARNER : You know , I do n't have either .
I just say we 've got to take some decisive steps .
I 've given an idea at what I think is a decisive step , and more ( than ) ( a ) consequential and decisive step , it is a very decisive signal that these statements that have been made by our president and Ambassador Crocker have a meaning in them .
Q Senator Warner ?
STAFF : Thank you .
SEN .
WARNER : Thank you very much .
Q Senator Warner , one more question ?
SEN .
WARNER : Nope , I 'm -- my old voice -- ( inaudible ) . #

~ GO Placidly amid the noise and haste , and remember what peace there may be in silence .
As far as possible without surrender , be on good terms with all persons .
Speak your truth quietly and clearly ; and listen to others , even the dull and ignorant ; they , too , have their story .
~ Avoid loud and aggressive persons , they are vexations to the spirit .
If you compare yourself to others , you may become vain and bitter ; for there will always better as well as worse than yourself .
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans .
~ Keep interested in your own career , however humble ; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time .
Exercise caution in your business affairs ; for the world is full of trickery .
But do not let this blind you to what virtue there is ; many persons strive for high ideas ; and everywhere life is full of heroism .
Be yourself .
Especially do not feign affection .
Neither be cynical about love ; for in the face of aridity and disenchantment it perennial as the grass .
~ Take kindly the counsel of the years , gracefully surrendering the things of youth .
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune .
But go not distress yourself with imaginings .
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness .
Beyond a wholesome discipline , be gentle with yourself .
~ You are a child of the universe , no less than the trees and the stars , you have a right to be here .
And whether or not it is clear to you , no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should .
Therefore be at peace with God , whatever you conceive
Him to be , and whatever your labors and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul .
~ With all its sham , drudgery and broken dreams , it is still a beautiful world .
Be cheerful .
Strive to be happy .

Desiderata in Life
Max Ehrmann early 20th Century American poet
MIT scientists and colleagues have found a way to create in the lab large amounts of cancer stem cells , or cells that can initiate tumors .
The work , reported in the August 13 issue of Cancer Cell , could be a boon to researchers who study these elusive cells .
Labs could easily grow them for use in experiments .
The findings also contradict an assumption about the trajectory of cancer cells .
According to current cancer models , any normal cell can evolve toward a malignant state through a series of alterations , including mutations .
Given the right alterations , any cell could eventually acquire the ability to invade other tissues .
But the new study suggests that some normal cells are more prone to become tumor - initiating and have a higher potential to metastasize , or spread to other tissues .
According to the researchers involved in the current work , in some ways certain tumors resemble bee colonies .
Each cancer cell in the tumor plays a specific role , and just a fraction of the cells serve as " queens , " possessing the unique ability to maintain themselves in an unspecialized state and seed new tumors .
These cells can also divide and produce the " worker " cells that form the bulk of the tumor .
These " queens " are cancer stem cells , and they are the cells recently created by MIT biology professor and Whitehead Institute Member Robert Weinberg and colleagues .
They did so by isolating and transforming a particular population of cells from human breast tissue .
After being injected with just 100 of these transformed cells , mice developed tumors that metastasized .
" The operational definition of a cancer stem cell is the ability to initiate a tumor , so these are cancer stem cells , " said Weinberg .
Tan Ince did n't set out to engineer these potent cells .
As a postdoctoral researcher in Weinberg 's lab and gynecologic pathologist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , he was simply trying to create breast cancer models that look like real human tumors under the microscope and behave like those seen in many patients .
Now an independent investigator at Brigham and Women 's and instructor at Harvard Medical School , Ince developed a recipe for a new chemically defined culture medium and managed to grow a different type of human breast cell that ordinarily dies in culture .
He transformed it into a cancer cell by inserting specific genes through a standard procedure .
The engineered cells proved to be extremely powerful .
When Ince injected more than 100,000 of them into a mouse with a compromised immune system , it quickly developed massive , deadly tumors .
In initial experiments , a few tissue slices revealed a primary tumor structure that resembled that of cancer patients with metastases .
He repeated the experiment in other mice , reducing the number of cells in the injection to as few as 100 .
The cancer cells continued to seed tumors and those tumors metastasized .
In sharp contrast , scientists must inject about one million cells to get a tumor when working with the cancer cell lines routinely used in the laboratory .
The study also offers clues about the trajectory of cancer cells .
A normal cell is thought to evolve progressively toward a malignant state through a series of genetic mutations .
The early alterations confer uncontrolled growth , while later alterations enable the cell to migrate and invade other tissues .
The new study suggests , however , that some normal cells are more prone to become tumor - initiating cells and have a higher metastatic potential when they become cancer cells than other normal cells .
The culture medium Ince created favors the growth of the human breast cells with high tumor - making and metastatic potential while the standard culture medium favors cells with low tumor - making potential .
Although the two types are only slightly different , the cells behave completely differently after acquiring the same mutations .
Ince confirmed this behavioral difference by taking a single human breast tissue sample , splitting it in two and growing the cells in the two culture mediums , which select for different cells .
Next , he transformed the two populations with the same tumor - initiating genes , injected them in mice and watched the result .
The cells that were grown in the new culture medium were 10,000 times more potent as tumor initiators and were the only ones able to metastasize .
Thus genes that were previously thought to only initiate tumors initiated metastasis , which is the main cause of cancer mortality in the clinic .
Ince 's and Weinberg 's colleagues on this work are Andrea Richardson , George Bell , Maki Saitoh , Samuel Godar , and James Iglehart .
This research is funded by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .

THE LIBERTARIAN ENTERPRISE
Number 145 , October 29 , 2001
War and Death
Exclusive to TLE
Born in liberty 19 April 1775 ; Died 9 July 1868
A recent issue of The Libertarian Enterprise included the following dateline : " October 22 , 2001 ... I Hear America Dying . "
Sorry , guys .
That is n't the sound of America dying .
That 's decompositional gas built up in the lungs , being released as one jackbooted thug after another treads on the body .
America as a concept of free people living in harmony is alive and well .
As a constitutionally limited republic suitable for governing a free people , the USA is dead .
It is now suffering the indignities of the descendants of the maniacs who killed it .
In recognizing the significance of the United States , it is appropriate to find words for the tombstone .
I 'd like to put forward an argument for birth date and death date .
During the course of this argument , the body of this essay will constitute an obituary , which should help in the grieving process .
At the end , a brief epitaph .
Born in Liberty
The birth of the USA as a country has as much to do with events on 19 April 1775 as it does with any other time .
On that date , in battles at Lexington and Concord , the Sons of Liberty and their friends opposed with deadly force the attempt by British troops to seize their weapons .
A few months later , the Continental Congress declared the independence which was already the subject of open warfare .
In 1781 , the British forces under Cornwallis , cut off on land by French , US and militia troops , and cut off on the sea by French and US navy vessels , surrendered .
The date of 19 October 1781 , when Cornwallis accepted terms and surrendered , is less meritorious , since additional battles at sea took place for some time thereafter .
The Treaty of Paris in 1783 provided formal recognition of the new country .
The dark forces opposed to liberty saw within the nascent country a huge territory , a potentially powerful government , endless opportunities for wealth without working including special privileges and government contract fraud , and a certain tendency by an athletic minority to gung ho enthusiasm .
They wanted to rule it , but to do so , its traditions of individual freedom had to be eviscerated .
They did n't take long to get started .
Shay Leads Revolutionary War Veterans
In 1786 , in the beautiful Berkshires of Western Massachusetts , where I 've spent many happy days , trouble was brewing .
High taxes , high litigation fees , and unreasonable state legislation were driving farmers and tradesmen into poverty .
The men who fought nobly and valiantly in the War of the Revolution were no longer content with their situation .
Daniel Shays led them in armed insurrection .
His revolt was brutally suppressed .
However , it was a contributing factor in the demise of the Articles of Confederation , the first constitutional government of the USA .
In 1787 , a new constitution was proposed .
It gave the national government many powers avoided by the revolutionaries in framing the Articles of Confederation .
There were national powers of taxation , eminent domain , and significant monetary power .
With a bill of rights to secure all powers not granted to the federal government to the states or people , and to identify and guarantee important individual liberties , the new constitution was ratified over the warnings of patriots like Patrick Henry , who feared its consolidating features .
Congress Opens a Bank
Though this new constitution made no provision for a national bank , Congress acted to create one .
The First Bank of the United States opened for business in 1791 , with two million of its $ 10 million in capital subscribed by the USA federal government ( paid in from customs duties collected ) .
For amusement , the Bank then lent the USA government $ 2 million .
Much of the rest of the funding of the bank was subscribed by foreign investors , especially in Britain .
Shortly thereafter , the Whiskey Rebellion was undertaken by more Western farmers , tired of paying high taxes .
( Surely the abandonment of the Articles of Confederation , which promised a " perpetual union " but were in fact seceded from by all thirteen original states before they acceded to the new constitution , should have provided the strong central government necessary to prevent such rebellions ?
Apparently not . )
That rebellion was also brutally suppressed .
The Warfare State
In Parque Aguirre , a small plaza shaded by palms , two dozen pensioners form a semi-circle and perform a series of stretches and gentle exercises , responding to the commands of a spry septuagenarian .
Two blocks away , in a small shabby office , two doctors receive a steady stream of phone calls and visitors , mostly minor queries , but a few people are directed to the nearby Joaquín Albarrán clinic for blood tests , X - rays and prescriptions .
Serious cases are referred to Calixto García hospital , an antiquated complex , in which Julio Hernandez , 43 , lies in a narrow bed hooked to two intravenous drips after intestinal surgery .
His skin is waxy and orange because the hospital lacks vitamins but he will survive that , and the surgery has gone well .
" They say I 'll be up and out by tomorrow , " he says .
This snapshot of Havana shows a healthcare system that is extensive , accessible and , at times , ropey .
What is unique is the blend of third world conditions with a progressive ethos and first world results .
Michael Moore 's documentary , Sicko , holds up Cuba as a model .
Whether it is a consultation , dentures or open heart surgery , citizens are entitled to free treatment .
As a result this impoverished Caribbean island has better health indicators than its much wealthier neighbour 90 miles across the Florida straits .
" There 's a reason Cubans live on average longer than we do , " Moore told Time magazine .
" I 'm not trumpeting [ Fidel ] Castro or his regime .
I just want to say to fellow Americans , ' C'mon , we 're the United States .
If they can do this , we can do it . ' "
Other outsiders such as Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general , a House of Commons select committee , and an array of non-governmental organisations have also lauded Cuban healthcare .
Even some senior US officials , between bouts of Castro - bashing , have ceded some plaudits .
" Health and education are the revolution 's pillars of legitimacy so the government has to make them work , " says a senior western diplomat in Havana .
" If they do n't it loses all its moral authority .
My sense is that the health system is quite good . "
But how good , exactly ?
And how does Cuba do it given such limited means ?
Neither question is easy to answer .
The communist government is not transparent , some statistics are questionable and citizens have reason to muffle complaints lest they be jailed as political dissidents .
According to the World Health Organisation a Cuban man can expect to live to 75 and a woman to 79 .
The probability of a child dying aged under five is five per 1,000 live births .
That is better than the US and on a par with the UK .
Yet these world - class results are delivered by a shoestring annual per capita health expenditure of $ 260 ( £ 130 ) - less than a 10th of Britain 's $ 3,065 and a fraction of America 's $ 6,543 .
There is no mystery about Cuba 's core strategy : prevention .
From promoting exercise , hygiene and regular check - ups , the system is geared towards averting illnesses and treating them before they become advanced and costly .
This is on display in the neighbourhood of Vedado .
By 8.30 am the pensioners of Parque Aguirre are assembled and following the lead of Carmelina Díaz , 76 , and raising arms , swivelling hips and marching on the spot .
Averting illness
Mrs Díaz learned these techniques " for those in their third age " at the national sports institute .
A volunteer , she has led these sessions five days a week for 21 years and keeps note of attendance in a leather - bound copybook .
" It 's not just physical , it 's also social , we arrange outings to the theatre , the beach , " she says .
A star participant is Lilia García Fernández , 81 , who uses a cane to circle the park three times before the class .
She has seven ailments , including diabetes , rheumatism and arthritis , but remains relatively fit .
Asked when she last visited a hospital she pauses .
" Ooh , I do n't know , more than five or six years ago , " she says .
Whether they want to or not millions of Cubans are forced to exercise because cars and public transport are so scarce .
" For me it 's [ five miles ] walking every day , " said Leandro Munoca , 64 .
As a member of the 120 Club , which promotes longevity , he does not resent the exercise .
Cubans are stereotypically lean but the malnourished era dating from the end of Soviet subsidies in the 1990s is giving way to a passion for fried , greasy carbohydrates .
Fish and vegetables remain scarce .
The result is 30 % of adults being overweight , according to government figures .
A healthy eating campaign is planned .
Other prevention strategies take the form of adverts promoting self - examinations for signs of cancer and ulcers , and tips on fighting the mosquitoes which spread dengue fever .
The health ministry , unopposed by cowed churches , sponsors radio and television dramas urging safer sex .
" Without a condom , forget it , " a teenage character tells her boyfriend .
Posters in the " polyclinics " , a new generation of walk - in centres which are just one step below hospitals in range of care but much cheaper to run , cast disease prevention as a patriotic duty .
Just as George Bush is made to look sinister in posters with hooded eyes , microbes are depicted as mini-ogres seeking to undermine the revolution .
Often pharmacies lack basics such as aspirin but in recent months they have been reasonably stocked .
In addition the state promotes alternative medicine , such as Chinese herbal remedies , which are cheaper than western drugs .
Simple , free access to GPs is a bedrock of healthcare .
There are estimated to be 14,000 family doctors for the 11.2 million population , a ratio of one GP per 785 people .
Include all the other doctors in hospitals and colleges and the ratio falls to 175 .
" We are told to encourage them to contact us .
And they do , all the time , day and night , " says one GP , somewhat ruefully .
Everyone is supposed to be visited at home at least once a year , often without warning , so the GP can scrutinise a patient 's lifestyle .
Cuban doctors have a reputation for dedication .
With an average monthly salary of just $ 20 they cannot be accused of entering the profession for money .
One neurosurgeon spoke of hitchhiking to work and operating on an empty stomach .
Idealism
But for all the system 's impressive results and tinge of idealism few of those who use it have a romantic view .
It is routine for patients to offer a regalito , a little present such as cash or a scarce product , such as shampoo .
Most , but not all , can scrabble enough pesos together for these under - the - table payments , a common practice across the economy .
" It 's not a bribe , it 's recognition that doctors are as hard up as the rest of us , " said Georgina , a 42 - year - old writer .
Even so , the better the regalito the better the service .
It means some patients are more equal than others .
A deal with Venezuela which sends more than 20,000 Cuban medical staff to South America in exchange for cheap oil has pumped money into the system .
But the deal has put the system under strain .
Not only are there fewer doctors on the island , thousands of Bolivian and Venezuelan patients are being flown in , at Venezuelan government expense , and allegedly jumping the queue .
Many Cubans grumble about delays and being tended by foreign medical students .
Foreign patients who pay in hard currency , including Europeans and Americans , get stellar treatment .
Camilo Cienfuegos , a 200 - room hospital cum hotel solely for foreigners , for example , has cable television , air - conditioning , minibars , gourmet chefs and receptionists who drip gold jewellery .
It 's a world away from the cracked floors , bare shelves and unshaved staff in grubby T - shirts at the Cuban - only clinic opposite .
José Ramón Balaguer , the health minister , cited Moore 's documentary , which features three Americans treated in Havana , as evidence of the " humane principles of Cuban society " and its willingness to treat anyone .
The pragmatic rationale is that the profits are ploughed back into care for ordinary Cubans .
Calixto García hospital , now undergoing renovation , shows what a lottery that can be .
In wards such as Salon Fortun cigarette butts litter corridors , beds lack mattresses and there is no running water .
" God , yuk , " said one elderly man , recoiling from some blocked toilets .
Other patients are luckier .
Felix Armenteros , 77 , a retired tobacco seller awaiting prostrate surgery in another ward , has no complaints .
" A special bus brought me here for free .
A decent bed , a proper bathroom , great . "
Cuban healthcare is no utopia .
At times it is ragged and harsh .
But the virtues are no myth .
People live as long as they do because the system , overall , works .
To be poor and sick in Cuba is tough , but it is not to be forgotten .
Explainer : How the NHS compares
The trouble with the NHS , some say , is that it is not a national health service but a national sickness service .
The focus is not on keeping us well , but keeping us alive .
Hospital intensive care units take priority in the public mind over diet and exercise campaigns .
Cuba is admired by public health experts in Britain and around the world for putting the horse before the cart .
Unable to afford too many hi-tech operating theatres , it focuses its efforts on keeping its people well and picking up illness early - when it 's easier and cheaper to treat .
So vaccination for children is all - important - and Cuba has exported its homegrown meningitis B vaccine to the rest of Latin America .
In the 1970s , Cuba worked hard on building up good care for women through pregnancy and childbirth , and for their babies , which brought the maternal and child mortality rates down to levels common in more affluent countries .
But even more impressive is the ratio of doctors - not surgeons but all - round generalist GPs - to patients .
Cuba has about one doctor for every 175 people .
In Britain we have about one to 435 .
Every Cuban will have a medical centre nearby where there is a surgery with a GP and a nurse .
It makes seeking medical help easy and therefore diagnosis and treatment rapid .
One of the factors behind the relatively poor prognosis for women with breast cancer living in deprived areas of the UK is that they do not go to see a doctor early enough .
In Cuba , on the other hand , it can be hard to avoid your GP .
Public health doctors from Britain visit Cuba to see how it manages a life expectancy for both men and women which is hardly different from ours .
And the NHS , if not exactly influenced by Cuba , is certainly moving in its direction .
Not only is public health taking a bigger role - the fight against smoking and obesity is now very visible - but GP surgeries are expanding to embrace nurse practitioners and visiting consultants in addition to doctors and health visitors .
Increasingly , the trend here is towards polyclinics , where a range of treatments , including minor surgery , can be had without the need for a trip to hospital .

Maybe Earth is n't doomed after all ...
At least one planet seems to have survived being engulfed by its star .
NPG
Planets circling close to their star — such as Earth around the Sun — are n't necessarily doomed to being swallowed up by that star , according to a new observation .
Stars such as our own expand into 'red giants ' in their old age , engulfing nearby planets .
Now a planet has been sighted circling close to V 391 Pegasi , a star that has gone through the red - giant phase to become what is known as a hot B - type subdwarf .
The planet , it seems , survived this process .
Stars similar to our own Sun eventually burn up all the hydrogen in their core , causing the star to contract .
After this , the outer layers of hydrogen fall into the hot helium core and start to fuse , making the core hotter than before .
This is followed by a huge expansion of the hot star — the radius grows by up to 100 times .
Anything caught in this expansion would be engulfed by the star and vaporized , all its material blended in with the star's .
This is the fate that some theorists predict Earth will meet in 5 billion or so years .
But the planet found by Roberto Silvotti at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Naples , Italy , turns this gloomy prediction on its head .
Star bright
Silvotti studied an unusual star , which helped his team to spot the planet .
V 391 Pegasi , which has a very thin outer layer of hydrogen and a helium core that fuses to form carbon , pulsates regularly ( every few minutes ) .
Any change in gravitational pull around the star , caused for example by a circling planet , can easily be spotted as a change in these otherwise regular pulses .
ADVERTISEMENT
The planet that Silvotti found by using this technique , V 391 Peg b , is 1.7 astronomical units away from V 391 Pegasi .
This is just within the 2 astronomical units thought to be too close for comfort for planets near red giants ( one astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun ) .
The planet orbits the star roughly once every 3.2 years and is also one of the oldest planets known , Silvetti says in his paper published today in Nature1 .
Its discovery is exciting , says Matt Burleigh , an astronomer from the University of Leicester , UK .
" This is the first time a planet has been found around a star that has evolved so far , " he says .
Burleigh is looking for planets around white dwarfs — stars further on still in their evolution than red giants , and Silvotti's research gives Burleigh hope that he will be successful .
" This work suggests that planets should be there around white dwarfs , " he says .
Final destiny
The destiny of Earth is still a matter for debate .
Silvotti predicts that when the Sun becomes a red giant , Earth 's orbit will be about one - and - a - half times its present radius , comparable to the distance of V 391 Peg b from its star .
But the two situations are n't directly comperable .
The mass of the planets are very different from each other , for example .
And the expansion of the stars will be different too .
Our Sun is expected to go through the red giant stage to a white dwarf rather than a hot subdwarf , for example .
All these differences mean our home 's existence is still under threat , says Burleigh .
" We lie right on the borderline between survival and being engulfed by the Sun 's expanding atmosphere when it becomes a giant , " he estimates .
And after the Sun becomes a hot white dwarf the Earth will be bombarded by intense X-ray and UV radiation — enough to sterilise the Earth 's surface , says Burleigh .
" If our planet survives , it will probably be a barren rock , unfortunately . "

Research Box Title
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatory have found a lopsided debris disk around a young star known as HD 15115 .
As seen from Earth , the edge - on disk resembles a needle sticking out from the star .
Astronomers think the disk 's odd imbalanced look is caused by dust following a highly elliptical orbit about the star .
The lopsided disk may have been caused by the gravity of planets sweeping up debris in the disk or by the gravity of a nearby star .
The observations were made by Paul Kalas , James Graham , and Michael P. Fitzgerald , all from the University of California at Berkeley .
Their paper appeared in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
" The lopsided disk presents a host of new challenges for theorists , " said Kalas .
Debris disks are produced by dust from collisions among protoplanetary bodies , which are the building blocks of planets .
These dusty disks can be affected by planets nearer to the star , much as Jupiter 's gravity affects asteroids in the asteroid belt .
This discovery is consistent with models for planetary upheavals in our own solar system , where Neptune may have originally formed between Saturn and Uranus .
Neptune was eventually kicked out to its present location by a gravitational dance between Saturn and Jupiter before their orbits stabilized .
" Therefore , we speculate that if such a planetary upheaval were occurring around HD 15115 at the present time , it could explain the highly asymmetric disk , " Kalas said .
This might happen through a powerful gravitational interaction between planets that kicks one or more planets into highly elliptical orbits , or even ejects them into interstellar space .
When the planet 's orbit becomes elliptical through a violent upheaval , the rest of the disk can be disturbed into an elliptical shape , according to Kalas .
Kalas also is studying whether the gravity of a star known as HIP 12545 , located about 10 light - years from HD 15115 , may have created the disk 's lopsided shape due to a close encounter in the past .
Dusty disks are known to exist around at least 100 stars , but because of the difficulty in observing material within the glare of a star , less than a dozen have been studied closely .
HD 15115 and HIP 12545 are among nearly 30 stars that belong to the Beta Pictoris Moving Group .
Moving groups are expanded clusters of stars believed to have a common birthplace and age that are traveling loosely together through space .
The dusty disk around HD 15115 was first inferred by observations at infrared wavelengths in 2000 and its existence confirmed in 2006 when the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) resolved the disk in reflected light for the first time .
The disk was investigated further using Keck adaptive optics in 2006 and 2007 .
" The disk was seen in the HST data , but its appearance was so extraordinary we could not be certain that it was real .
It took follow - up observations at Keck to confirm that it was a real disk , " Kalas said .
I know Carl Sagan said the opposite , but he was clearly wrong .
Suppose that a priori X has probability p of being true .
We now look for evidence for X of a certain type .
Suppose that there is a probablity q that we find this evidence if X is true and probability q ' that we find this evidence if X is false .
We will assume p < 1 ( otherwise we would n't bother looking for evidence ) and that q>q ' ( otherwise it could n't be said that the evidence we 're looking for is evidence for X ) .
So we have four possibilities :
X is true and we find evidence for X : probability pq
X is true and we do n't find evidence for X : probability p ( 1- q )
X is false and we find evidence for X : probability ( 1 - p ) q '
X is false and we do n't find evidence for X : probability ( 1 - p ) ( 1 - q ' )
Under the hypotheses above , the conditional probability that X is true given that we failed to find the evidence is p ( 1 - q ) / ( p( q ' - q ) +1 - q ' ) .
Use Bayes ' Theorem .
Some elementary rearrangement shows this is always less than p given the above hypotheses .
It does n't matter if we are unable to assign an a priori probability , this holds whatever value p has as long as it's less than 1 .
And if we do n't know that q>q ' then we should n't be in the business of looking for evidence .
If the experiment we 're doing is any good then q'=0 but as I have shown , the result holds even if we relax this condition .
So clearly failing to find evidence for X should lower our estimate of the probability that X is true .
I wonder what made Sagan say this .
I think that maybe he meant to say " absence of evidence is not proof of absence " .
The theorem shows that under the original hypotheses the conditional probability is never 1 , and so while we have evidence of absence , we do n't have a proof .
But if we can look for enough independent types of evidence it 's quite possible for the conditional probability to get close to 1 .
Update :
The first paragraph was badly written and so I 've edited it slightly .
The main argument is unchanged .
The argument stands or falls regardless of what Sagan actually said , but read the comments below on some context for this quotation .

Codex Alimentarius - The Sinister Truth Behind Operation Cure - All
( From an original article by Ruth James ) What 's really behind Operation Cure - All ?
Is it just the FDA and FTC taking their power too far ?
Or is there a deeper , more sinister purpose to this campaign ?
Who are Codex Alimentarius ?
How could a country that prides itself in its freedom of speech , freedom of choice , and freedom of information be facing such severe restrictions in health freedom and dietary supplements ?
Have n't the people made their will known ?
Did n't our government pass the Dietary Supplement Health & Education
Act of 1994 to insure our right to health supplements ?
Indeed , our government did .
But the FDA and FTC have found ways to get around that .
The laws put in place to protect us are being ignored .
And what 's worse is that those laws are about to be superseded , if the powers that be have their way .
OPERATION CURE ALL IS JUST ONE MEANS TO AN END
You see , Operation Cure - All is just a tactic , a vehicle , in a much bigger overall plan .
It is a result of " Codex Alimentarius " ( meaning food code ) -- a set of regulations that aim to outlaw any health information in connection with vitamins and limit free access to natural therapies on a worldwide scale .
WHAT'S BEHIND CODEX ALMENTARIUS ?
Behind the Codex Alimentarius Commission is the United Nations and the World Health Organization working in conjunction with the multinational pharmaceutical cartel and international banks .
Its initial efforts in the US with the FDA were defeated , so it found another ally in the FTC .
Now Codex , with the FTC and the pharmaceutical cartel behind it , it threatens to become a trade issue , using the campaign of Operation Cure - All to advance its goals .
Codex began simply enough when the U.N. authorized the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization to develop a universal food code .
Their purpose was to ' harmonize ' regulations for dietary supplements worldwide and set international safety standards for the purposes of increased trade .
Pharmaceutical interests stepped in and began exerting their influence .
Instead of focusing on food safety , Codex is using its power to promote worldwide restrictions on vitamins and food supplements , severely limiting their availability and dosages .
REAL GOALS OF CODEX
This is to bring about international ' harmonization . '
While global harmony sounds benign , is that the real purpose of this plan ?
While the stated goal of Codex is to establish unilateral regulations for dietary supplements in every country , the actual goal is to outlaw health products and information on vitamins and dietary supplements , except those under their direct control .
These regulations would supersede United States domestic laws without the American people 's voice or vote in the matter .
HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE ?
Americans gasp at the thought .
It goes against everything America stands for .
Many believe this can't be possible .
The truth is , it 's not only possible , it 's required by the Codex Alimentarius agreement .
In fact , under the terms of the Uruguay Round of GATT , which created the World Trade Organization , the United States agreed to harmonize its domestic laws to the international standards .
This includes standards for dietary supplements being developed by the United Nation 's Codex Alimentarius Commission 's Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Use .
The Uruguay Round Agreements carry explicit language clearly indicating that the U.S. must harmonize to international standards : " Members are fully responsible under this Agreement for the observance of all provisions .... members shall formulate and implement positive measures and mechanisms in support of the observance of the provisions .... by other than central government bodies . "
[ WTO TBT Agreement at Article 3.5 ] "
In other words , the federal government must NOT ONLY CHANGE FEDERAL LAW , but must ALSO require state and local governments to change their laws as well to be in accordance with international law .
Not only that , but Codex Alimentarius is now enforceable through the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
If a country disagrees with or refuses to follow Codex standards , the WTO applies pressure by withdrawing trade privileges and imposing crippling trade sanctions .
Congress has already bowed to this pressure several times and so have the governments of many countries .
While the exemption clause ( USC 3512 ( a ) ( 1 ) and ( a ) ( 2 ) was created to supposedly protect our laws from harmonization to international standards , it has proven to be totally ineffective .
The United States has already lost seven trade disputes despite the exemption clause .
Due to the enormous pressures put on them by lobbyists from multinational corporations ( who contribute millions to congressional campaigns ) , Congress bowed to pressure and changed U.S. laws .
It appears our government ( as well as al others ) is being manipulated one way or another to serve the goals of the UN , the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization .
Food control equals people control -- and population control .
Is this beginning to sound like world government and one - world order ?
Could this be the real goal behind Codex Alimentarius ?
The United States , Canada , the Europeans , Japan , most of Asia , and South America have already signed agreements pledging total harmonization of their laws including food and drug laws to these international standards in the future .
WHAT CODEX WILL BRING
What can we expect under Codex ?
To give you an idea , here are some important points : Dietary supplements could not be sold for preventive ( prophylactic ) or therapeutic use .
Potencies would be limited to extremely low dosages .
Only the drug companies and the big phytopharmaceutical companies would have the right to produce and sell the higher potency products ( at inflated prices ) .
Prescriptions would be required for anything above the extremely low doses allowed ( such as 35 mg. on niacin ) .
Common foods such as garlic and peppermint would be classified as drugs or a third category ( neither food nor drugs ) that only big pharmaceutical companies could regulate and sell .
Any food with any therapeutic effect can be considered a drug , even benign everyday substances like water .
Codex regulations for dietary supplements would become binding ( escape clauses would be eliminated ) .
All new dietary supplements would be banned unless they go through Codex testing and approval .
Genetically altered food would be sold worldwide without labeling .
According to John Hammell , a legislative advocate and the founder of International Advocates for Health Freedom ( IAHF ) , here is what we have to look forward to : " If Codex Alimentarius has its way , then herbs , vitamins , minerals , homeopathic remedies , amino acids and other natural remedies you have taken for granted most of your life will be gone .
The name of the game for Codex Alimentarius is to shift all remedies into the prescription category so they can be controlled exclusively by the medical monopoly and its bosses , the major pharmaceutical firms .
Predictably , this scenario has been denied by both the Canadian Health Food Association and the Health Protection Branch of Canada ( HPB ) .
The Codex Alimentarius proposals already exist as law in Norway and Germany where the entire health food industry has literally been taken over by the drug companies .
In these countries , vitamin C above 200 mg is illegal as is vitamin E above 45 IU , vitamin B1 over 2.4 mg and so on .
Shering - Plough , the Norway pharmaceutical giant , now controls an Echinacea tincture , which is being sold there as an over the counter drug at grossly inflated prices .
The same is true of ginkgo and many other herbs , and only one government controlled pharmacy has the right to import supplements as medicines which they can sell to health food stores , convenience stores or pharmacies . "
It is now a criminal offence in parts of Europe to sell herbs as foods .
An agreement called EEC6565 equates selling herbs as foods to selling other illegal drugs .
Action is being taken to accelerate other European countries into ' harmonization ' as well .
Paul Hellyer in his book , " The Evil Empire , " states : " Codex Alimentarius is supported by international banks and multinational corporations including some in Canada , and is in reality a bill of rights for these banks and the corporations they control .
It will hand over our sovereign rights concerning who may or may not invest in our countries to an unelected world organization run by big business .
The treaty would make it impossible for Canadian legislators either federal or provincial to alter or improve environmental standards for fear of being sued by multinational corporations whether operating in Canada or not .
This will create a world without borders ruled by a virtual dictatorship of the world 's most powerful central banks and multinational companies .
This world is an absolute certainty if we all sit on our hands and do nothing . "
This is the future the FDA and FTC are striving to bring us via Codex harmonization .
Is this a future we are going to willingly accept or prevent ?
WHY TARGET THE INTERNET ?
It is no accident that the FDA and FTC are targeting Internet health sites through Operation Cure - All .
We are standing in the doorway of an unprecedented revolution -- the information revolution brought about by the Internet .
Now all people everywhere have the ability to learn about anything that interests them with just a few clicks .
History has shown that informed , educated people change civilizations -- they change the flow of thought and they change the flow of money .
They can even change the direction of a country .
When similar transitions have happened in the past , the powers that existed did not give up willingly .
The Catholic Church fiercely protected its practice of selling ' indulgences ' as a forgiveness of sin .
When the practice was abolished , the Catholic Church lost a great deal of power and money .
When the printing press was invented , books were banned and printers were imprisoned by the authorities , who feared an educated public could not be governed .
In the same way , the medical monopoly ( and the UN ) now fears that a public educated in health and privy to the shortcomings of modern medicine could not be controlled .
Loss of control means loss of revenue and loss of power .
And they are doing everything they can to stop progress so they can contain their losses and strengthen their power .
The printing press changed the world .
Can you imagine what life would be like today if the book banners had their way ?
But because the printing press won out , society progressed and freedom was embraced .
The Internet is changing the world in an equally significant way .
While the entire Internet can hardly be suppressed , the pharma - cartels and their backers are looking to protect their interests by restricting as much information as they can on the Internet .
Will we , the people , win out again -- or will the UN and the World Health Organization agenda and the pharmaceutical cartel change the course of history and take us back to the " dark ages " of medicine ?
WHAT CAN WE DO ?
Step number one is learn as much as possible about this issue .

CTM Comment : Codex is of course the single most virulent assault on human freedoms in recent times .
The desire to control of vitamins , minerals , herbs and other nutritional factors has ironically come about as a result of the inability of orthodox medicine to destroy the practice of the public practicing health without drugs .
Now government and the chemical industry will seek to control and profit from that which was available directly to the public in times gone by .
Overturning the Codex by a mass public backlash is CTM ’s sworn goal .
This can be accomplished only with large numbers of the public all committed to this endeavor .
As the above article states , the Internet itself has been able to grant access to information freely to anyone seeking it , and this has destabilized the flow of money and profits to institutions which have traditionally believed their highly lucrative monopolies to be safe .
There can be no more pressing reason to join the Campaign for Truth in Medicine for FREE than to assist us in pressuring for the scrapping of Codex .

Legendary UK actor , writer , director and Mac enthusiast Stephen Fry has published an in - depth report contrasting some of the UK's leading smartphones , including the iPhone .
Fry slams the iPhone for only supporting server - side applications , pointing out that closed environments are n't the future for the technology industry .
He also criticises Apple for insisting iPhone owners purchase and download ringtones for their devices , is n't impressed with the Mail app , and is anxious for a 3G version of the iPhone because EDGE support in the UK is extremely limited .
Fry is a self - confessed Mac addict , and has been since the beginning - he purchased the second Mac ever shipped into the UK , with the first being acquired by his friend , the late author , Douglas Adams .
The actor has n't let his predilection for Apple sully his attempt to be objective .
Instead he sets the challenge for manufacturers : " All the big guns want an iPhone killer .
Even I , mad for all things Apple as I am , want an iPhone killer .
I want smart digital devices to be as good as mankind ’s ingenuity can make them .
I want us eternally to strive to improve and surprise .
Bring on the iPhone killers .
Bring them on , " he writes .
Fry takes a look at the iPhone , the HTC Touch , the Nokia E90 and the Sony Ericsson P1i .
He offers objective praise and constructive criticisms for each of these devices , including Apple's .
Fry has been using such devices for many years , and can marshall more insight and knowledge of the sector than all but the most experienced mobile - device journalists .
As such , the extensive report offers some valuable insights into the development of the smartphone industry .
Of the iPhone , Fry concludes : " Everything else in the iPhone lives up to , even surpasses the hype .
Another triumph for Jonathan Ive and his design team , Apple has made a wholly desirable and beautiful object .
Only a cross and silly person would pretend to be unimpressed or make claims of parity about their O2 xda Trion or similar lumpen beast . "

Home Pico Lisp : A Case for Minimalist Interpreters ?
Pico Lisp : A Radical Approach to Application Development describes a minimalist Lisp interpreter which has been used to build real applications for ~ 20 years .
If you ignore the tendency toward self - aggrandizing , there 's some food for thought here .
Pico Lisp only has native support for symbols , integers , and lists ( no arrays , no structures ) , and is implemented as a straightfoward interpreter .
Yet in the benchmarks ( usual disclaimers here ) , Pico Lisp fares well against a compiled Lisp .
Is there a case to be made for ultra lean and mean interpreters as a viable alternative to compilers ?

Lord Malloch Brown wants a more impartial foreign policy
Lord Malloch Brown told the Daily Telegraph it was time for a more " impartial " foreign policy and to build relationships with European leaders .
Some analysts may consider the Foreign Office minister 's remarks evidence of Labour distancing itself from the US .
Earlier , Downing Street denied another minister had criticised the US .
International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander warned in a speech against unilateralism and called for an " internationalist approach " to global problems .
New links
Lord Malloch Brown 's newspaper interview was his first since being appointed Foreign Office minister .
You need to build coalitions that are lateral , which go beyond the bilateral blinkers of the normal partners
Lord Malloch Brown
He used to be deputy secretary general at the United Nations and is a known critic of the Iraq war .
" It is very unlikely that the Brown - Bush relationship is going to go through the baptism of fire and therefore be joined together at the hip like the Blair - Bush relationship was , " he was reported as saying .
" That was a relationship born of being war leaders together .
" There was an emotional intensity of being war leaders with much of the world against them .
That is enough to put you on your knees and get you praying together . "
He went on to speak of forging new links with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , as well as with leaders in India and China .
" You need to build coalitions that are lateral , which go beyond the bilateral blinkers of the normal partners , " he added .
" My hope is that foreign policy will become much more impartial . "
' Get a grip '
His remarks come the day after Mr Alexander was accused of " coded criticism " of the policies of President George W Bush in a speech he made in the US .
When asked if his comments amounted to criticising the US , Gordon Brown 's spokesman said that view " was not shared " by the PM .
Mr Brown , himself , told BBC Radio Five Live that he would continue to work , as Tony Blair did , " very closely with the American administration " .
Meanwhile , Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has called on Mr Brown to " get a grip " .
" What is at issue is not the relationship with the US but the nature of that relationship , " he said .
" Under Tony Blair the relationship was so subordinate as to appear subservient .
Britain needs to be America 's candid friend not its client . "
Starfish Robot Stretching Video
I just had to pass along this cool video showing the remarkable Starfish robot created by Josh Bongard , Victor Zykov , and Hod Lipson .
Towards the end of the video , the robot conceptualizes itself , determining its own structure using sensors built into each joint .
Then , it thinks of different ways that it might move - walk - from place to place .
Starfish can also sense damage to any of its legs or joints , and then compensate .

Most people in synthetic biology are engineers who have invaded genetics .
They have brought with them a vocabulary derived from circuit design and software development that they seek to impose on the softer substance of biology .
They talk of modules — meaning networks of genes assembled to perform some standard function — and of “ booting up ” a cell with new DNA - based instructions , much the way someone gets a computer going .
The first practical applications of synthetic biology may not be so far off .
“ The real killer app for this field has become bioenergy , ” Dr. Collins says .
Under the stimulus of high gas prices , synthetic biologists are re-engineering microbes to generate the components of natural gas and petroleum .
Whether this can be done economically remains to be seen .
But one company , LS9 of San Carlos , Calif. , says it is close to that goal .
Its re-engineered microbe “ produces hydrocarbons that look , smell and function ” very similarly to those in petroleum , said Stephen del Cardayre , the company ’s vice president for research .
Synthetic biologists are well aware that , like any new technology , theirs can be used for good or ill , and they have encouraged open discussion of possible risks at their annual meetings .
One possible danger is bioterrorism .
According to a report in Science , Blue Heron Biotechnology , a DNA synthesis company , has already received requests , which it rejected , for DNA sequences encoding a plant toxin and part of the smallpox virus .
Synthetic biologists hope that self - regulation will head off government supervision that could be expected to come in a field that has such potential for mischief .
Evolution continually refines its creations by means of the naturally occurring mutations in DNA that are the raw material of natural selection .
This propensity to innovate may not be so welcome to synthetic biologists , who seek stable systems .
But they hope to spot mutations with error - detection algorithms and then go back to the original cells .
“ You can think of it as a re-boot , ” said Ron Weiss , a synthetic biologist at Princeton .
Even if the mutation problem can be squelched , it remains to be seen how far synthetic biologists can wrest evolution ’s strange system to entirely different purposes and whether the human organism is one they will propose to debug and upgrade .
Instead , let us consider what the bottom shelf does to writers who still care , sometimes passionately , about the short story .
What happens when he or she realizes that his or her audience is shrinking almost daily ?
Well , if the writer is worth his or her salt , he or she continues on nevertheless , because it ’s what God or genetics ( possibly they are the same ) has decreed , or out of sheer stubbornness , or maybe because it ’s such a kick to spin tales .
Possibly a combination .
And all that ’s good .
What ’s not so good is that writers write for whatever audience is left .
In too many cases , that audience happens to consist of other writers and would - be writers who are reading the various literary magazines ( and The New Yorker , of course , the holy grail of the young fiction writer ) not to be entertained but to get an idea of what sells there .
And this kind of reading is n’t real reading , the kind where you just ca n’t wait to find out what happens next ( think “ Youth , ” by Joseph Conrad , or “ Big Blonde , ” by Dorothy Parker ) .
It ’s more like copping - a- feel reading .
There ’s something yucky about it .
Last year , I read scores of stories that felt ... not quite dead on the page , I wo n’t go that far , but airless , somehow , and self - referring .
These stories felt show - offy rather than entertaining , self - important rather than interesting , guarded and self - conscious rather than gloriously open , and worst of all , written for editors and teachers rather than for readers .
The chief reason for all this , I think , is that bottom shelf .
It ’s tough for writers to write ( and editors to edit ) when faced with a shrinking audience .
Once , in the days of the old Saturday Evening Post , short fiction was a stadium act ; now it can barely fill a coffeehouse and often performs in the company of nothing more than an acoustic guitar and a mouth organ .
If the stories felt airless , why not ?
When circulation falters , the air in the room gets stale .
And yet .
I read plenty of great stories this year .
There is n’t a single one in this book that did n’t delight me , that did n’t make me want to crow , “ Oh , man , you gotta read this ! ”
I think of such disparate stories as Karen Russell ’s “ St. Lucy ’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves , ” John Barth ’s “ Toga Party ” and “ Wake , ” by Beverly Jensen , now deceased , and I think — marvel , really — they paid me to read these !
Are you kiddin’ me ???
Talent can’t help itself ; it roars along in fair weather or foul , not sparing the fireworks .
It gets emotional .
It struts its stuff .
If these stories have anything in common , it ’s that sense of emotional involvement , of flipped - out amazement .
I look for stories that care about my feelings as well as my intellect , and when I find one that is all - out emotionally assaultive — like “ Sans Farine , ” by Jim Shepard — I grab that baby and hold on tight .
Do I want something that appeals to my critical nose ?
Maybe later ( and , I admit it , maybe never ) .
What I want to start with is something that comes at me full - bore , like a big , hot meteor screaming down from the Kansas sky .
I want the ancient pleasure that probably goes back to the cave : to be blown clean out of myself for a while , as violently as a fighter pilot who pushes the eject button in his F - 111 .
I certainly do n’t want some fraidy - cat ’s writing school imitation of Faulkner , or some stream - of - consciousness about what Bob Dylan once called “ the true meaning of a pear . ”
So — American short story alive ?
Check .
American short story well ?
Sorry , no , ca n’t say so .
Current condition stable , but apt to deteriorate in the years ahead .
Measures to be taken ?
I would suggest you start by reading this year ’s “ Best American Short Stories . ”
They show how vital short stories can be when they are done with heart , mind and soul by people who care about them and think they still matter .
They do still matter , and here they are , liberated from the bottom shelf .
Washington outing blogger says ' a few more ' to come John Byrne

Post omits Congressman Raw Story outed Move over , Larry Craig .
The " most feared man " on Capitol Hill promises he 's going to release the names of a few more closeted Republicans in the months to come .
In a Tuesday profile of Washington outing blogger Mike Rogers by Jose Antonio Vargas , the 43 - year - old activist says he plans to release the names of " a few more " closeted Congressmembers on his blog , blogACTIVE .
The onetime fundraiser outed Larry Craig on his blog last October .
Following his post , the Idaho Statesman dispatched a reporter to this story -- a piece which remained canned until revelations that Craig was arrested for lewd conduct in a Minneapolis airport bathroom appeared in August .
Larry Craig was n't " the first on my list , " Rogers told the Post .
" And the Idaho senator , who announced his resignation Saturday , ' wo n't be the last . ' "
Years before outing gay members of Congress became fashionable , Rogers was hot on the trail .
RAW STORY joined Rogers in reporting on closeted gay members of Congress and senior officials who preached an anti-gay agenda in public but lived another life in private .
In 2004 , following up on a blog post , RAW STORY joined Rogers in reporting on California Republican David Dreier , who , according to associates and a former challenger , lived with his male chief of staff .
Follow - up stories further revealed that Dreier paid his chief of staff from both his committee and office funds at a higher rate than similarly experienced aides .
The report , which drew attention from the LA Daily News and Hustler , failed to draw attention from the mainstream press .
At the time , an editor from the LA Times declared the piece a non-story in a conversation with RAW STORY and this reporter .
Two Congressmen omitted The Washington Post omitted Rogers ' work on Dreier .
Dreier has vehemently denied allegations of his homosexuality .
After being handpicked by erstwhile House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R - TX ) as his temporary successor , Dreier mysteriously vanished from the short list after a piece on RAW STORY revealing earlier reports that he previously lived with his chief of staff .
The Post also left out Rep. Jim McCrery ( R - LA ) , who Rogers blogged about in October 2004 .
In addition , the article makes no mention of the outing of former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman , an architect of President George W. Bush 's victory in 2000 , or the former Chief Financial Officer and Director of Administration for the Republican National Committee Jay Banning .
This site reported on both .
Mehlman denied allegations of his homosexuality ; Banning said co-workers knew he was gay .
' I just like to get together with a guy '
Two months before , Rogers had targeted then - Virginia congressman Ed Schrock after a source supplied audio recordings of Schrock calling a gay phone sex line .
On the recording , Schrock described what type of man he was looking for , including his endowment .
" Uh , hi , I weigh 200 pounds , I 'm 6 ' 4 " ( inaudible ) blond hair .... very muscular , very buffed up , uh , very tanned , uh , I just like to get together a guy from time to time , just to , just to play , " the erstwhile representative remarked .
" I 'd like him to be in very good shape , flat stomach , good chest , good arms , well hung , cut , uh , just get naked , play , and see what happens , nothing real heavy duty , but just , fun time , go down on him , he can go down on me , and just take it from there ... hope to hear from you .
Bye . " RAW STORY was the first to publish the transcript .
Rogers says he targeted Schrock because of his voting record on gay rights and a comment he made to the Virginian - Pilot in 2000 , speaking of gays in the military .
" You 're in the showers with them , you 're in the bunk room with them , you 're in staterooms with them , " he marked .
Schrock bowed out of his reelection race .
Rogers also blogged about ex-congressman Mark Foley months before instant messages of him soliciting congressional pages surfaced on the Web .
The Florida Republican had voted various times against gay rights .
" I write about closeted people whose records are anti-gay , " Rogers told the Post .
" If you 're a closeted Democrat or Republican and you do n't bash gays or vote against gay rights to gain political points , I wo n't out you . "
According to Vargas '
Post profile , " Rogers came out in his early 20s and has spent the bulk of his life working for gay organizations .
A native of the New York metropolitan area , he 's lived in the District for more than a decade .
Although his blog is n't his main source of income -- he was a fundraising consultant and currently runs Page One News Media , a gay - oriented online company -- the Web site has become more than a full - time job .
He 's a student of the gay rights movement and considers Larry Kramer , the writer and AIDS activist , and Franklin E. Kameny , the lifelong Washington firebrand , as models . "

This article presents a high performance approach to string handling and a low level C library .
Tools , game engines , and games can benefit from safe , fast string handling .
Many string libraries are based on C's standard functions .
While the standard C string functions are sometimes adequate , they are often unsafe , slow , or not suited to multi- threaded programming .
Often , they thwart safe , clean , efficient problem solving .
Many high level string libraries build on C's standard approach and inherit these problems .
This article presents a new , low - level library to address and overcome these issues .
In addition , the code for the string library has also been made available here for download .
Strings are a derived data type used to organize sets of characters .
Applications of all kinds , including word processors , text editors , programming tools , and games make extensive use of strings .
Most games use strings for messages , player information , configuration , scripting , and internal identification of resources .
A string is an array of characters .
The most popular approach to string handling dates back to the creation of the C language .
[ 1 ]
This approach uses a pointer to the first character in the string and a zero to signal the end of the string .
If the first character in string is a zero , then the string is said to be empty .
A non-empty string can be a single a single character such as “ A ” , a word like “ hello ” , a whole sentence , or even an entire file .
Standard double quotes are used to demarcate a string and single quotes are used for individual characters .
string characters in the string and the zero- terminator string length
0
0 " A " ' A ' 0
1 " hello " ' h ' 'e ' 'l ' 'l ' ' o ' 0
5 " set x 3.14 " ' s ' 'e ' 't ' ' ' ' x ' ' ' ' 3 ' '. ' ' 1 ' ' 4 ' 0 10
Chracter Types
The new library defines and uses the type ' chr ' for a character .
The library can be rebuilt for any power - of - two character size .
Terminating Strings
The new library supports standard zero - terminated C strings and is designed to co-exist with all existing code .
The biggest difference between the new library and the standard C library is the addition of an optional pointer - terminator parameter to the string handling routines .
The pointer - terminator is a pointer to one character past the last valid character in the string .
That is , it is a pointer to the zero- terminator , or where the zero - terminator would be if it were present .
There are significant benefits to supporting pointer - terminated strings .
One benefit is that pointer - terminated strings allow you to safely define words in a shared buffer without modifying the buffer .
For example , if you are scanning a buffer and find a single word that you would like to operate on as an individual string , you have two options with C's standard routines :
Either temporarily poke a zero into the buffer to end the word , or copy the word into a second buffer .
Modifying the buffer is sometimes not possible and usually not desirable .
Copying the word to a second buffer will typically involve memory allocation and freeing and always increase processing time .
Both options are undesirable .
With pointer - terminated strings , you avoid these problems by passing pointers to the start and end of the word .
Pointer - terminated strings also allow the programmer to find the length of a string by subtracting the starting pointer from the pointer - terminator .
Furthermore , routines that scan backwards through strings are simplified when the end of the string is known .
Forced Zero-Termination
One rule the new library follows is that buffer building functions always add or force a zero- terminator into the buffer .
This helps simplify the handing of buffer overflow issues by truncating strings that do not fit entirely into the destination buffer .
This also makes it easier to integrate the new library with existing code .
Pointer - Termination Parameters
There are potential drawbacks to using pointer - terminated strings .
One drawback is that you often do n't have a pointer to the end of the string , and to get that pointer , you have to scan the string yourself .
To address this drawback , the pointer - terminator may always be passed as a null pointer .
When the pointer - terminator is passed as a null pointer , the routine treats the string as a standard zero - terminated string .
Another slight drawback is the performance hit incurred when passing null pointer - terminators .
To address this , many of the routines have multiple versions , some of which do not take a pointer - terminator and rely on the string being zero- terminated .
James McCarthy did not think the breast surgery was necessary
James McCarthy told wife Kerry : " Do n't do it .
I like you as you are " , as he dragged her from a ward at the City of London 's St Bartholomew 's Hospital .
She had pleaded with hospital staff to help her and thought her husband may kill her , the Old Bailey heard .
McCarthy , 27 , of Canning Town , east London , pleaded guilty to kidnapping Mrs McCarthy on 9 February .
Black eye
Defending counsel Michael Gomulka said : " This defendant did not want his wife to undergo an augmentation operation .
" He did not think it was necessary .
He was also worried about the surgery itself .
" He went to the hospital to talk her out of having the operation .
When she refused he reacted in the way he did . "
I saw him pick her bag up and he told her : ' I like you as you are .
I will kill you now '
Hospital worker Lola Ali
Kate Bex , prosecuting , said Mrs McCarthy had arrived for her surgery with a black eye .
Mrs McCarthy , who now goes by the name Kerry Joy , explained the situation to hospital worker Lola Ali , saying her husband had a knife .
" He was clearly in some state of agitation and shouted at Miss Joy , " Miss Bex said .
The court heard Miss Ali told police : " I saw him pick her bag up and he told her : ' I like you as you are .
I will kill you now ' . "
McCarthy was arrested by police and later , in a prepared statement , denied threatening his wife .
" I pleaded with her not to have a breast augmentation , " he said .
" We had a further chat and she agreed not to have it done . "
The couple had been married for a year and had a nine - month - old child .
McCarthy had a history of violence towards two previous partners and Mrs McCarthy from as far back as 1999 , though the complaints had often not been pursued by the women .
The New York Times reports that according to new government data , " Americans earned a smaller average income in 2005 than in 2000 , the fifth consecutive year that they had to make ends meet with less money than at the peak of the last economic expansion . "
As most workers ' wages stagnate , however , the folks in the top two tenths of one percent of income earners are doing quite well .
According to the White House 's official statement , in fact , this divergence between the vast majority of Americans and the wealthiest two tenths of one percent " is not a very interesting story . "
To them , it is just an annoying distraction from their bigger goal of manipulating the labor market through immigration and globalization policies specifically designed to drive wages down even further .
Here is the excerpt :
" Growth in total incomes was concentrated among those making more than $ 1 million .
The number of such taxpayers grew by more than 26 percent ... These individuals , who constitute less than a quarter of 1 percent of all taxpayers , reaped almost 47 percent of the total income gains in 2005 , compared with 2000 .
People with incomes of more than a million dollars also received 62 percent of the savings from the reduced tax rates on long - term capital gains and dividends that President Bush signed into law in 2003 ...
The nearly 90 percent of Americans who make less than $ 100,000 a year saved on average $ 318 each on their investments .
They collected 5.3 percent of the total savings from reduced tax rates on investment income ... Tony Fratto , a White House spokesman , said the fact that nearly all of the growth in incomes was among those in the upper reaches of the income ladder and that the majority of investment tax breaks went to those making more than $ 1 million 'is not a very interesting story .
' " ( emphasis added )
What 's particularly nauseating about the White House 's class warfare is that it is being waged at the very same time the Bush administration is claiming a supposed shortage of workers means it 's AOK to ignore how the H - 1B program is being abused to drive down wages .
They are also using this labor shortage claim to justify a push to enact a so - called " guest worker " program that deliberately creates a subclass of easily exploitable indentured servants with no basic labor or human rights ( notice that the White House is n't pushing for more legal immigration because legal immigration would give new workers minimum economic rights ) .
Supposedly , our country needs to ignore H - 1B abuses and create this " guest worker " subclass because we just do n't have enough workers to do the jobs that need to be done in this country .
Except , as none other than Businessweek confirms , that narrative is what I 've previously termed The Great Labor Shortage Lie - and a lie directly connected to the problem of stagnating wages .
Here 's the analysis - again , it 's from Businessweek quoting Merril Lynch , not exactly two pillars of radical leftist thinking :
" A North American economist at Merrill Lynch , he is one of a number of economists who say the concerns about too few workers are vastly overblown .
Rosenberg recently studied the issue and put out a report entitled Is There a Labor Shortage ?
If employers are having trouble filling jobs , " perhaps they 're not looking hard enough , " he says .
The issue may not be the number of workers , but rather the level of pay .
Economists like Rosenberg argue that in a market economy , there 's really no such thing as a true shortage .
If you want more of something , you can pay more and have it .
When employers say that there 's a worker shortage , what they really mean is they can't get enough workers at the price they want to pay , the argument goes .
' While it makes for nice cocktail conversation , the data are n't saying there is an acute labor shortage in this country , " Rosenberg says ... According to the basic laws of economics , the tighter the supply of labor , the more it should cost .
So if the economy were operating with full or near - full employment , we would be seeing an ' explosion in labor compensation , ' he says .
The price of labor , however , is hardly surging .
In fact , key indicators of employee costs show they are tracking or trailing inflation . "
You may recall that in a speech to the AFL - CIO last year , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) tried to deny these basic rules of the labor market by implying that American workers are lazy .
Specifically , he claimed that even if corporations raised wages , Americans would n't want agricultural work because Americans " canâ €™t do it , my friends . "
The White House may say that this economic persecution of America 's middle class " is not a very interesting story " but most Americans find it more than just interesting - they find it a cause for outrage .
The booing at that AFL - CIO meeting is a good example .
It came because American workers understand that what we are now getting from politicians of both parties on on immigration and globalization is shenanigans - shenanigans aimed at making sure the laws of supply and demand work not to address the inequalities laid out in today 's New York Times , but only to help Big Money interests that buy public policy in Washington .
Just consider the bait - and - switch quality to all this .
We are told that when there is a short supply of a good or service that is in demand , the market dictates that the price for that good or service rises ( as just one example , we hear this justification all the time when it comes to the supply of oil and the price of gas ) .
This results in higher profits for the corporations producing the good or service .
But we are simultaneously told that if there is a short supply of labor that is in demand , the market should not raise the price ( aka. wages ) for that labor ( which would , of course , lessen the wealth disparity in America ) .
No , instead we are told that we should rig the labor market by flooding it with a supply of workers who will exist under a legal framework that makes them more easily exploitable than other workers ( ie . they can't form unions to demand better wages / working conditions without fearing their employer will deport them ) .
This is the governing ethos of economic / globalization policymaking in Washington .
Couple it with tax policies that target most of their rewards to the handful of Gordon Gekkos who run Wall Street , and what you have is a pretty open , pretty vicious economic war being waged on America 's middle class .

On the proof of the supposed evilness of girls
T. Komplexify
Weizguyy Institute of Smart Axes
Abstract
In this article , we discuss the classic proof that girls are evil .
The author will briefly discuss the origins of the problem and review the classic proof .
The author then indicates a mathematical flaw in the argument , invalidating the statement .
The article concludes with a revised and corrected statement of the result .
I. Introduction
I recently received an email discussing the differences between men and women from various mathematical and engineering points - of - view .
Most of it was extremely funny , and sooner or later all shall certainly appear within the mathematico - humorist community , properly researched , and appended with standard references in the literature .
However , one portion of the email included a mathematical " proof " of the fact that girls are evil .
This proof is doubtless familiar to many readers , having circulated a few times in mathematicians ' inboxes .
However , for those readers unfamiliar with this well - known proof , we present it now .
II .
Statement and classical proof of result
Theorem .
Girls are evil .
Proof .
It is axiomic in all cultures that girls require both time and money , and any man with either a deficiency in available " quality time " or " disposable income " knows that this a joint - proportion , whence
Similarly , it is has been proved that " time is money " [ 1 ] , whence
Substitution yields
We also know that " money is the root of all evil " [ 2 ] , whence
Substituting again yields
Squaring on the right - hand side of the equation yields
establishing the result .
Q.E.D .
III .
Identifying and resolving the flaw
The above " proof , " so - called , is widely known to mathematicians , leading to the widespread belief that girls are evil .
It will therefore come as a surprise to find that the proof above is flawed , and indeed , the result is incorrect .
There is a subtle flaw in the above argument that seems to have escaped most diligent readers for quite some time .
In the interest of correcting this mis-truth , which has improperly vilified girls as being evil , we present now the correct statement and its proof .
Theorem ( Corrected ) .
Girls are absolute evil .
Proof .
Arguing as above allows us to conclude
However , let us more intently examine the consequences of money being the root of all evil .
A moment 's thought shows that it is incorrect to conclude that
To see this , recall that evil is a inherently negative concept [ 3 ] .
We cannot take square roots of negative quantities in the real world , lest we are will to assume that money is imaginary .
( Graduate students in particular may choose to investigate this concept further [ 4 ] . )
Thus , we are therefore forced to conclude that
Substituting again yields
Squaring on the right - hand side of the equation yields
establishing that girls are absolutely evil .
Q.E.D .
IV .
Conclusion
We sincerely hope this clears things up .

REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
TIRANA ( Reuters ) - Reports that U.S. President George W. Bush had his wristwatch stolen while shaking hands with Albanians on his weekend visit are false , Albanian police and the U.S. embassy said on Tuesday .
“ The story is untrue and the president did not lose his watch , ” a spokesman for the embassy in Tirana said .
Some newspapers , television stations and websites carried reports that Bush ’s watch vanished on Sunday when he was greeted by ecstatic crowds in Fushe Kruje , outside the capital Tirana .
“ It is not true , ” said Albania ’s police director , Ahmet Prenci .
Photographs showed Bush , surrounded by five bodyguards , putting his hands behind his back so one of the bodyguards could remove his watch .
As we have previously reported , the first official Firefox 3 beta release was tentatively scheduled for late July .
The beta has now been pushed back due to performance regressions and the need for extra front - end development time , and the roadmap has been altered to reflect a new release plan .
According to Mike Schroepfer , Mozilla 's vice president of engineering , the developers intend to issue a new pre-beta milestone release every six weeks until the program achieves beta status .
" We are driven by quality , not time .
We want to Firefox 3 to be something that we are all proud of , " said Schroepfer in a statement .
" The Firefox front - end has had significantly less development time than the platform and has yet to have the opportunity to innovate on top of infrastructure built for places , password manager , and others .
So we 'd like to give them until M8 to continue to develop user - visible features on top of the core infrastructure . "
A release is still scheduled for the end of the month , but it will be referred to as Alpha 7 and will not meet Mozilla 's requirements for the beta designation .
According to the revised roadmap , the Alpha 7 release will coincide with the Gecko feature freeze .
Gecko 1.9 , a long - awaited update to the HTML rendering engine used in Firefox , uses the Cairo rendering engine and features greatly improved reflow code which makes it possible for Firefox to pass the Acid2 test .
The Alpha 7 release will also include finalized versions of new APIs developed for offline web applications .
The next release after Alpha 7 , which is currently labeled Milestone 8 , is expected to ship in mid-September .
In order to meet the standards for a beta release established in the new roadmap , a milestone build has to be feature complete and stable enough for regular daily use with no significant site rendering regressions relative to the prior version .
What happens when Mozilla starts releasing betas ?
According to Schroepfer , betas will be released regularly until benchmarks show that performance is comparable or superior to Firefox 2 with Gecko 1.8 .
After that release candidates will be used to resolve last minute bugs before the release .
Firefox 3 is going to be a very significant release , and a lot of work has gone into improvements under the hood so far .
These delays are hardly surprising and should n't be perceived as a cause for concern .
The new roadmap looks like a realistic adjustment to the complexity of the Firefox 3 development process , and it reflects a very clear emphasis on polish and performance .
OTTAWA , Sept. 21 — Elene Fromanger saw little evidence of the Canadian dollar ’s new might when she went shopping for health care books on Friday afternoon .
All of them were marked with separate prices for Canada and the United States .
With the Canadian dollar now at par with the United States currency , no calculator was needed to discover that Ms. Fromanger paid $ 18 more before sales tax than an American shopper would have for the same three books .
“ It ’s ridiculous , ” she said outside a downtown Ottawa bookstore .
“ They still charge more , but the dollar has been going up for two years .
I find it inexcusable . ”
Canadians may now be wealthier in global terms , but the even exchange rate with the United States dollar now makes it immediately obvious that they also pay more than Americans for many goods .

World Most Americans disapprove of Bush 's commutation of ex-aide : poll + - 08:18 , July 07 , 2007
Related News Bush spares Cheney 's ex-chief of staff from serving jail term Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Most Americans and nearly half of all Republicans disapprove of U.S. President George W. Bush 's commutation of the prison sentence of a former White House aide , according to a CNN poll out on Friday .
Fully 64 percent of all Americans said they disapproved of Bush 's July 2 decision to spare Lewis " Scooter " Libby , former chief - of - staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , from serving 30 months in prison , the survey found .
Broken down by party affiliation , 76 percent of Democrats , 47 percent of Republicans , and 80 percent of Independents said they disapproved .
Meanwhile , 84 percent of the respondents said they oppose a full presidential pardon for Libby , which Bush did not rule out .
Broken down by party , 82 percent of Democrats , 70 percent of Republicans , and 97 percent of Independents oppose a pardon .
The poll , conducted on July 3 - 5 , interviewed 1,100 adults and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Libby was convicted March 6 of lying to investigators probing the 2003 leak of CIA official Valerie Plame 's identity .
He was sentenced to 30 months in jail June 5 .
But Bush commuted his jail term July 2 and did n't rule out a pardon in the future .

Family Guy skewers Bush , Cheney ' in a galaxy far , far away '
David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Monday September 24 , 2007
Print This Email This
Seth MacFarlane 's animated sit-com Family Guy , which airs on the Fox network , revved up its sixth season on Sunday by taking aim at a familiar target : George Bush .
However , the sequences which skewered Bush , Cheney , and fellow Republicans were set " a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . "
Writing for the blog , The Largest Minority , Manila Ryce observes , " The opening sequence of this Star Wars Special shows the evil Star Destroyer with a Bush / Cheney bumper sticker on the back as it chases Princess Leias ship .
A fairly simple , but effective gag . "
Presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) recently referred to Cheney as Darth Vader , as reported by Politico 's Ben Smith .
Smith wrote , " ' Vice President [ Dick ]
Cheney came up to see the Republicans yesterday .
You can always tell when the Republicans are getting restless , because the Vice Presidents motorcade pulls into the Capitol , and Darth Vader emerges , ' Hillary Clinton said just now ( video ) at a $ 100 - a- head fundraiser at town hall near New York 's Times Square , referring to Cheney 's efforts shore up Republican congressional support for the Iraq war . "
Another clip from the show , as noted at The Largest Minority , featured " C - 3PO and Skywalker listening to right - wing talk radio . "
" A voice which sounds amazingly like Rush Limbaugh bitches about the ' liberal galactic media , ' says that global warming is a myth created by said media , and attributes the promotion of Lando Calrissian to affirmative action , " Ryce writes .
" The third clip rounds out the episode with Stewie making a crack about rising gas prices .
True to their bumper sticker , and despite their technological advances , the Empire is evidently still reliant on fossil fuels . "
As RAW STORY previously reported , a prior Family Guy episode poked fun at President Bush by showing his Crawford , Texas ranch house being guarded by his vice president , Dick Cheney , who was shown napping on a rocking chair with a rifle clutched to his chest .
The following video is from Fox 's Family Guy , broadcast on September 23 .
State bureaucrats have converged in Washington DC for a two - day conference on REAL ID compliance .
Panels cover such topics as how to get the required funding , how to meet the Act 's deadlines , and how to share data across states .
One session in particular caught the eye of Jim Harper , director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute ( Full disclosure : I 'm an adjunct scholar at Cato ) .
It 's a panel discussion called " Bringing your public onboard for smoothing legislative changes . "
The summary states that " every State DMV needs to find a way to educate their public so that they can ensure the legislature changes necessary to become Real ID compliant . "
The panel will also " examine how much of your ( i.e. , the DMV's ) budget a public relations exercise is worth . "
Such a " public relations exercise " would presumably be conducted at taxpayer expense .
The conference is sponsored by Digimarc , Viisage , NXP , and JPMorganChase , all of whom sell the sort of high - tech identification equipment that states will need to comply with the REAL ID Act .
In effect , the conference provides a forum for vendors to lobby state bureaucrats to support REAL ID implementation and to encourage them to go back to their states and lobby their legislators for " necessary " legislative changes .
And presumably , most of the bureaucrats are attending the conference at the expense of their state 's taxpayers .
Vendors are doubtless alarmed at the growing backlash among state legislatures against the REAL ID Act .
More than a dozen states have now enacted legislation or resolutions opposing the REAL ID Act , and a majority of state legislatures have considered such legislation .
The conference 's other panels are n't likely to soothe privacy advocates ' concerns .
For example , a Monday morning panel on implementation costs confirms fears that the national database mandated by the Real ID
Act will likely be used for a lot more than tracking down terrorists .
Raymond Scheppach , executive director of the National Governors Association , discussed additional uses for the database , including " finding fathers who are n't paying their child support " and " providing extra security for retailers using credit cards . "
That will certainly be convenient for credit card companies and social workers , but having so much information in one place could be a serious privacy threat if identity thieves ever got access .
Notably absent from the conference are any panels debating whether states should participate in the REAL ID program in the first place .
Although some panels did focus on strategies for making the ID system more secure , there did not appear to be any speakers warning attendees that the very existence of uniform national standards and a comprehensive database are likely to make the system less secure .
Just as defense contractors thrived during the heyday of the military - industrial complex , vendors of identification equipment have prospered in the wake of the September 11 attacks .
While some of the recent spending has doubtless been justified , we should worry when vendors start lobbying for new identification schemes with serious privacy problems and little or no security benefits .
Lobbying activities like this week 's conference are one reason that the REAL ID train keeps rolling despite serious doubts among both voters and security experts about the program 's benefits .
Correction :
This story was based on information provided on the conference website .
However , Ars has been contacted by a representative of the National Governor 's Association who says that , contrary to the description found on the conference agenda , Raymond Scheppach did not discuss using the REAL ID database for enforcing child support or authenticating credit card transactions .
She said that the National Governor 's Association does not advocate using the database for these purposes .
Mr. Murray has said no retreat mining — a method of coal recovery — was being done at Crandall Canyon when the collapse occurred .
Kirsti Loveland said her husband and other miners who escaped alive on Thursday night were angry and frustrated by the conditions of the rescue effort .
She said that her husband , who works at another mine owned by Murray Energy , was told he had to work on the rescue effort although he felt it was too dangerous , and that he has been earning less than he does during his shifts at the mine where he normally works .
“ He is angry and very emotional , ” Ms. Loveland said of her husband , whom she would not identify because she feared he would lose his job .
Murray Energy ’s general counsel , Mike McKown , denied that miners were obligated to work on the rescue effort .
“ They are all volunteers , ” Mr. McKown said .
“ They are happy to help , They are a brotherhood of miners . ”
He also said there was no disparity in wages between rescue and mining jobs .
At Crandall Canyon , rescue workers and mining safety experts met today to discuss whether a horizontal rescue tunnel similar to that which collapsed Thursday night could be safely resumed .
Gestures of charity and kindness toward the mine victims ’ families have come in from around the country .
A family from the Indiana town where several miners died days after the Crandall County mine collapse sent six hand - knit dolls , three with darker skin representing the Mexican men who are among those trapped , along with a note about shared agony , to the families of all six .
A couple in Price held raised held a car wash that raised more $ 1,000 for the families of the victims , part of the more than $ 25,000 that Mayor Hilary Gordon of Huntington estimated has been raised so far .

After yesterday ’s post on the browser scripting revolution , detailing the new projects being built on top of Tamarin , a number of questions came up concerning the choice of Tamarin instead of other virtual machines .
Two engines came up , in particular : The Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) – which is already able to run Jython and JRuby , and Mono – which is able to run IronPython and IronRuby .
I ’ll defer to the words of Mike Shaver and Brendan Eich to explain the reasons as to why , though in a nutshell :
The non-technical reasons for choosing Tamarin are over intellectual property and licensing issues and the technical issues are related to compilation speed , file size , and memory footprint .
Mike Shaver :
Here are a few , at least as I see them : * Optimized to run JavaScript and sibling languages , which is our most important language target by a vast margin .
* Licensed appropriately .
* About 1/25 the size , I think ( 200 KB for Tamarin , 5 MB for Mono as described by Miguel elsewhere )
* In my coarse measurements , significantly smaller memory footprint .
I was once quite a supporter of getting Mono into our world , including writing a prototype XPCOM binding for it , but I did n’t see a path to getting the important factors ( performance , licensing , footprint in code and memory ) resolved , and I do n’t think it ’s much closer today .
Nobody in Mono - land was interested enough to contribute to that , which is another counterpoint with Tamarin I suppose , where we have very active contributions from Adobe and others to help us get it in the state we need for it to be a suitable basis for building our whole app on .
It ’s not like we did n’t look hard at Mono , and in the case of many of us lobby hard for licensing and patent concerns to be swept aside .
Tamarin is a very good fit for us in a large number of ways , unfortunately including a number of ways in which Mono is not .
Brendan Eich :
Freshness Warning

It 's possible that the information you read below is n't current and the links no longer work .
I was talking to Jesper about the dotted CSS borders trick and the subject of rounded corners in CSS came up so I showed him my method .
There are other ways that I ’ve seen it done , but the other methods always require lots of complex HTML and CSS .
I figure that lots of nested divs are n’t much better than using a table , so my way does n’t require much in the way of HTML or CSS .
Here ’s how I do it .
Create four images for your corners .
Most graphics programs have a tool that will create rounded - off squares .
I ’ll be using this square here …
… and I ’m going to cut off the corners to get my four images :
In the spot where I want the box to show up , I create a container div to hold the box , a div for the top row and a div for the bottom row .
Between the top and bottom rows , I add my content .
In the top and bottom row divs , I add the left corner image and set the inline style to read display : none ; .
This makes the image invisible unless I make it visible through the stylesheet .
That way , I can hide the effect from incompatible browsers by not showing them the stylesheet .
< div class= " roundcont " > < div class=" roundtop " > < img src=" tl.gif " alt= " " width = " 15 " height = " 15 " class = " corner " style = " display : none " /> </div> < p > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipisicing elit , sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua .

The CSS sets the width and background color of the container object and the color of the text inside .
The margins on interior paragraphs are set so that the text does n’t sit right up against the edge of the box .
Then the top and bottom divs are given a background image that contains the right corner images and the left corner images from the HTML code are enabled .
.roundcont { width : 250 px ; background - color : # f90 ; color : # fff ; } .roundcont p { margin : 0 10 px ; } .roundtop { background : url ( tr.gif ) no -repeat top right ; } .roundbottom { background : url ( br.gif ) no -repeat top right ; } img.corner { width : 15 px ; height : 15 px ; border : none ; display : block ! important ; }
Here ’s how it looks when it ’s all put together .

The only thing changed is the width of the roundcont class .

REUTERS / Carlos Barria
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A 20 - year - old soldier who paid someone to shoot him in the leg to avoid being redeployed to Iraq will serve one year in jail , prosecutors said on Tuesday .
Jonathan Aponte spent his first tour of duty in Iraq as a supply clerk on a military base and was never involved in combat , the Bronx District Attorney ’s office said .
Aponte was shot in the knee on July 9 .
Prosecutors allege that Aponte and his then - wife paid a Bronx man , Felix Padilla , 24 , $ 500 to shoot him .
Aponte then told police that he had been wounded during a robbery .
Aponte had also allegedly fabricated stories about his time in Iraq , including telling a grand jury he had witnessed a soldier ’s suicide and come under fire in combat .
But Bronx Assistant District Attorney James Cudden said none of this was true .
In a plea agreement reached with prosecutors , he admitted that he had arranged the shooting to avoid further military service in Iraq and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of falsely reporting an incident .
In exchange , he will not face perjury charges , which could have carried a four - year jail term , the DA ’s office said .
Charges against Aponte ’s ex-wife , Alexandra Gonzalez , and Padilla are still pending .
An image of the needy person with his finger extended as a hanger was placed in fitting rooms .
Last week , U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) grilled White House budget director nominee Jim Nussle at Nussle 's Senate confirmation hearing .
The interchange , which you can watch here , was absolutely extraordinary .
Sanders forced Nussle to go on record admitting that at a time the White House is trying to prevent better - funding children 's health care programs , he supports giving the members of Wal - Mart 's Walton family alone a tax break worth more than $ 30 billion .
Now , just today , the Associated Press reports that Sanders is using his filibuster power to block Nussle 's nomination , putting his entire confirmation in jeopardy .
The question now is whether Harry Reid will support the filibuster or buckle to the White House .

For those still wondering why President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney sent our young men and women into Iraq , the secret is now “ largely ” out .
No , not from the lips of former secretary of state Colin Powell .
It appears we shall have to wait until the disgraced general / diplomat draws nearer to meeting his maker before he gets concerned over anything more than the “ blot ” that Iraq has put on his reputation .
Rather , the uncommon candor comes from a highly respected Republican doyen , economist Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006 , whom the president has praised for his “ wise policies and prudent judgment . ”
Sadly for Bush and Cheney , Greenspan decided to put prudence aside in his new book , The Age of Turbulence , and answer the most neuralgic issue of our times — why the United States invaded Iraq .
Greenspan writes :
“ I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . ”
Everyone knows ?
Would that it were so .
But it ’s hardly everyone .
Sometimes I think it ’s hardly anyone .
There are so many , still , who “ ca n’t handle the truth , ” and that is all too understandable .
I have found it a wrenching experience to be forced to conclude that the America I love would deliberately launch what the Nuremburg Tribunal called the “ supreme international crime ” — a war of aggression — largely for oil .
For those who are able to overcome the very common , instinctive denial , for those who can handle the truth , it really helps to turn off the Sunday football games early enough to catch up on what ’s going on .
60 Minutes
On January 11 , 2004 , viewers of CBS ’ 60 Minutes saw another of Bush ’s senior economic advisers , former treasury secretary Paul O’Neill discussing The Price of Loyalty , his memoir about his two years inside the Bush administration .
O’Neill , a plain speaker , likened the president ’s behavior at cabinet meetings to that of “ a blind man in a roomful of deaf people . ”
How does he manage ?
Cheney and “ a praetorian guard that encircled the president ” help Bush make decisions off - line , blocking contrary views .
Cheney has a Rumsfeldian knack for aphorisms that do n’t parse in the real world — like “ deficits do n’t matter . ”
To his credit , O’Neill picked a fight with that and ended up being fired personally by Cheney .
In his book , Greenspan heaps scorn on that same Cheneyesque insight .
O’Neill made no bones about his befuddlement over the president ’s diffident disengagement from discussions on policy — except , that is , for Bush ’s remarks betraying a pep-rally - cheerleader fixation with removing Saddam Hussein and occupying Iraq .
Why Iraq ?
“ Largely Oil ”
O’Neill began to understand better after Bush ’s inauguration when the discussion among his top advisers abruptly moved to how to divvy up Iraq ’s oil wealth .
Just days into the job , President Bush created the Cheney energy task force with the stated aim of developing “ a national energy policy designed to help the private sector . ”
Typically , Cheney has been able to keep secret its deliberations and even the names of its members .
But a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit forced the Commerce Department to turn over task force documents , including a map of Iraqi oilfields , pipelines , refineries , terminals , and potential areas for exploration ; a Pentagon chart “ Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield Contracts ; ” and another chart detailing Iraqi oil and gas projects — all dated March 2001 .
On the 60 Minutes , program on December 15 , 2002 , Steve Croft asked then - defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld , “ What do you say to people who think this [ the coming invasion of Iraq ] is about oil ? ” Rumsfeld replied :
“ Nonsense .
It just is n’t .
There — there — there are certain ............. things like that , myths that are floating around .
I ’m glad you asked .
I — it has nothing to do with oil , literally nothing to do with oil . ”

Access .
Citizens abroad often face long waits before they can get to see a specialist or undergo elective surgery .
Americans typically get prompter attention , although Germany does better .
The real barriers here are the costs facing low - income people without insurance or with skimpy coverage .
But even Americans with above - average incomes find it more difficult than their counterparts abroad to get care on nights or weekends without going to an emergency room , and many report having to wait six days or more for an appointment with their own doctors .
Fairness .
The United States ranks dead last on almost all measures of equity because we have the greatest disparity in the quality of care given to richer and poorer citizens .
Americans with below - average incomes are much less likely than their counterparts in other industrialized nations to see a doctor when sick , to fill prescriptions or to get needed tests and follow - up care .
Healthy lives .
We have known for years that America has a high infant mortality rate , so it is no surprise that we rank last among 23 nations by that yardstick .
But the problem is much broader .
We rank near the bottom in healthy life expectancy at age 60 , and 15th among 19 countries in deaths from a wide range of illnesses that would not have been fatal if treated with timely and effective care .
The good news is that we have done a better job than other industrialized nations in reducing smoking .
The bad news is that our obesity epidemic is the worst in the world .
Quality .
In a comparison with five other countries , the Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States first in providing the “ right care ” for a given condition as defined by standard clinical guidelines and gave it especially high marks for preventive care , like Pap smears and mammograms to detect early - stage cancers , and blood tests and cholesterol checks for hypertensive patients .
But we scored poorly in coordinating the care of chronically ill patients , in protecting the safety of patients , and in meeting their needs and preferences , which drove our overall quality rating down to last place .
American doctors and hospitals kill patients through surgical and medical mistakes more often than their counterparts in other industrialized nations .
Life and death .
In a comparison of five countries , the United States had the best survival rate for breast cancer , second best for cervical cancer and childhood leukemia , worst for kidney transplants , and almost - worst for liver transplants and colorectal cancer .
In an eight - country comparison , the United States ranked last in years of potential life lost to circulatory diseases , respiratory diseases and diabetes and had the second highest death rate from bronchitis , asthma and emphysema .
Although several factors can affect these results , it seems likely that the quality of care delivered was a significant contributor .

Really cool splash .
If there was n't that 1 this pic would have been top rated pic on dpc ... it would have 8,6555 avg ... unbelievable
Hi Rackat , I would love to use this image on my business card and letterhead ( properly credited of course ) .
Is it available for this purpose ?
i have never seen scores like that , looks like you received more 8,9 , and 10's for one photo than anyone .
WOW !!
So rich and colourful .. wonderul picture !!

Well , it is n't real obvious whether 1 or 10 is the highest rated score , now is it ?
Perhaps they meant to score it a 10 .
For a long time looking through other photos I wondered whether a 1 or 10 was the high score .
The problem comes from the fact that " we 're # 1 " makes sense and the fact that 1 is at the highest ( on your computer screen ) or " top " rated spot , which you would tend to think of as the highest mark from its position as well .
Why is n't there an indication anywhere by the owners of this website of what 's high and low ?
It should be made plainly obvious with a legend or key right beside all ratings , wherever they appear .
BEAUTIFUL .
I love it !
Remarkable !!
What idiot could possibly have rated this a ' 1 ' out of 10 ?
Unique , beautiful , and well done .
Fantastic .
That 's beautiful !
I love it .
This gives me the feeling new toys like marbled rubber balls and new coloured pencils and paint sets and Christmas wrapping papers and story books gave me as a child long ago .
Well the droplet is a .. little to the left of center <
No just kidding !
This is Most Wonderful - Wm. oh ... p.s. yelo is rely Deep Man !
I LOVE this pic !
I am sad when I watch this photo .
All is unavoidable .
A drop has fallen .
I till not rise back .
That bounce up , " action and reaction " , when caught as a slice in in the dimension of time , is a hopeless attempt to escape from inevitability .
The tiny column of water will fall down and then push up a similar hope .
Temporary .
Sad ...
Colours are sharp and crude .
Nothing subtle .
Almost like black and white , only multidimensional .
This is why it is so BEAUTIFUL .
So CRUEL !!!
Stuff thoughts .
Any FEELINGS ?
OK , OK , it is beautiful .
But I still have not a foggiest idea what the author thinks .
ANYTHING ?
hehe
SPECTACULAR !
I love water shots and color shots !
The best of both right here !
Oh wow thats amazing .
its just simply a beautiful picture !!
So many peopel try to do the whole " splash " photo , but i've never seen one so well done before !
Its deffinetly a fav
This picture is so sick !
Its really quite amazing because it apears that time is standing still and that you 're staring at glass ... but its not ... its water .
I love it
This is a very pretty pic !
Very nice job !
I LOVE this pic
heck yes
im so suprised that prints were never made available !!
444,000 + views !
Im sure they 'd make a hefty profit on this picture lol , i know id buy one .
This is such an awesome picture .
I would love to be able to hang this in my room somewhere .
Nicely done

It 's really enjoyable to stare at for a long time .
But one thing has me confused ..
Shutter 1/40 ?
How do you get such a clear picture with such a low shutter speed ?
Come to think of it , everybody seems to be able to do that but me .
That water must 've been splashing awfully sowly to get such a clear shot of the splash .
Whatever the case , I 'm impressed .
Definitely a favourite .
A nice fast flash could have done the trick .

So clear , vivid and crisp !
The water has so much thickness to it , it almost seems like crystal clear paint featuring random blotches of paint !
I love this picture .

" Luck is when preparation meets opportunity " I , like many others , would appreciate learning something about the technique you used ?
Thanks for adding color to our lives !

My highest rated shot for this challenge ...
Congratulations Rackat and I agree with PTL 's comments earlier you are just getting better with each challenge !!!
It 's hard for me to believe that a member would be so callous as to score anything that was sincerely attempted a 1 much less give something as nice as this a 1 .
Good luck in the upcoming challenges .
PS ... I would love to see a tutorial on this shot .
I love this type of photography and would love to be able to reproduce this stop action .

Kate , you are amazing !
Congratulations !
Again !
I do n't know who gave you the 1 ( i'm not a member , so it was n't me ) but I wonder if that person would have given you the same critique as mine :) ) ... and mean it !
Kate , I personal congrats on this fabulous photo .
I think it would be worth doing a ' How To ' for this one .

congrats on a great photo and a great score :) i wonder where that nasty single vote of 1 came from ... ugh ...
Keep up the great work :)

... from Critique Club ...
Hi Rackat ... ain't I lucky .. they assigned your photo to me ..ha
FIRST IMPRESSION :
Horrible shot ... what were you thinking ????
COMPOSITION :
Totally off .
It would have worked much better if it were upside down ... and reversed horizontaly .
TECHNICAL :
Focus is toooo sharp .
Lightin is poor , cause the dark parts are dark ... and the light parts are light .
DOF is hard to tell , so I wo n't comment on that .
ARTISTIC :
Completely boring to look at .
There is no dynamic to your photo , it 's flat , uninteresting .
Oh , and it does NOT meet the challenge ... there 's nothing ' Free ' about this ' Study '
OVERALL :
I am very disappointed in you , Rackat .
I enjoyed most of your work , but this is just plain horrible .
I expect better next time .
Best of luck in the future .
Do n't hesitate to PM me if you have any questions about this critique .
Cheers ... zadore .
... and now the serious part :)
I do n't have to repeat what everyone has already mentioned about this photo .
I hope some day to create a piece of art as great as this .
CONGRATULATIONS FROM THE CRITIQUE CLUB !!! :)
Photographer found comment helpful .
I tip my hat to you , ma'am .
Excellent work , and I 'm still totally jealous .
And please ignore any horrible rumors about me wanting to kick your bootie .
They 're lies !!
All lies !!!
LOL
Rob :)
Look at that score breakdown !
I 've never seen such a lack of low numbers !
Well deserved score !
Lots of WOW factor in this one .
Kate , this is by far my favorite of the week and it rated 10 from me .
Please tell us more about it .
Your work is inspiring .
Congrats on a truly inspiring shot .
I echo the question of details on this shot .
While you 're at it , perhaps you could give us a few on your profile as well .
After all you are the hottest thing going here besides possibly Jacko .
Six top twenties in a row and FIVEof those have been top 10 !
Way to go , I am in awe !
Congrats !
Incredible shot ... one of my all time dpc favorites :)
nice work .
looks like a render . :)
This is the best entry I`ve seen in a long time .
Could you please give us a bit of details on how you did the shot .
Is 1/40 sec really all that was needed ?
Congrats !
You da woman :)
Thanks for all the nice comments and for taking the time to do so !
You are all very kind and helpful , and I really do appreciate it a lot !
~ Kate
Congrats !!!
I think this is tangible ..
Luv it !
Comments Made During the Challenge
This is just a pleasure to look at .
This is my highest rated photo in the members ' challenge , congratulations .
The colors are to die for .
I have no idea how to improve on this shot , this is not typically my favorite type of art , but I can't help but smile when I look at this .
Good Luck , I think this will do well for you in the challenge .
- 10 Gotcha
Circus psychotropics !
Fabulous !
A great capture !
this is just gorgeous !
im trying so hard to figure out what the bottom is made of ... whatever it is , it makes this one of the best of these shots i have ever seen !
the clarity of the drops and even the ripples is perfect .
i wonder what it would have looked like with the drop a little less centered and backed up towards the left ?
no matter , tho , i love it !
very nice work !
Fabulous !
Totally !
Now that is cool !
Excellent color work .
This could be a tutorial on how to effectively include all the primary colors in an image , and the stopped motion is beautiful .

Excellent work , I love the focus on the drop in front .
THis is a beautiful picture !!
What a shot you got !!
I love the bright colors !!
The only thing i'd like is to see a little more of the ripples on the bottom .
I love the frame also .
I just looked again at this and noticed a distracting shadow on the right center , still a 10
amazing .
I think this one should win and will be surprised if it does n't .
It has definite visual appeal in the composition , and is taken as well as a photo can be .
I 'm sure someone will grumble about the rule of 3rds or something like that .
This is super .
This is my odds on favorite though - Inspzil
This is , of course , something we 've seen before , but this is a very well done attempt !
Great colors !
Gosh , this is soooo colorful !
Very nicely stopped action .
The colorful background both confuses and adds interest to this ( usually great , but cliche ) shot .
I really like this and your addition really makes this photo much more unique and very , very striking !
9 Swash
Very good work , technically .
The colours below the surface were a great idea .
I just feel a bit cold looking at this though , because I 've seen so many water drop photos before .
For what it is , it 's very good , and deserves a high rating , and originality is n't everything , but it does n't grab me on an emotional level I 'm afraid .
Love this - I 'll be anxious to read the details !
10
Omigosh ! , this is awesome !
The first thing to strike me , as you might expect , is the vibrancy of the colors .
Upon closer study I am captivated by the circles suggesting movement and the drop .
Very , very nice work .
You should be proud of this and this may be the winner !
10
Very nice and colourful very greative .
absoluterly beautiful
Great stopped motion shot this ( you could have entered it in both challenges this week ; o ) .
I 'm curious as to whether the colours on this are part of the bowl , or whether they are actually in the water itself .
I have seen this been made before and this one is very good too .
The water is perfect but I ´m not so happy about the background .
Everything is perfect except the colours in the water .
But it ´s me - I ´m not so fond of strong colours . ( 7 )
very nice !
The detail here is excellent .
My personal preference on this would have been less centered , but this is a great shot ... good work :) - 10 - setzler
very nice .
Unique , beautiful , and well done .
Fantastic .
ahh haa !
great thing my girlfriend is here .. she figured it out !
it is a colored bowl !
very good idea and great capture of the water splash !
Perfect !
Great stop action , I absolutely LOVE the colors in this .
This picture is really neat .
The only thing I think would have improved it , was if you had not had the photo centereed ... maybe to the right corner would have been nice ?
Just personal preference .
Solid 9 !
Wow , amazing stuff .
The colors are great , the only problem I have is the lighting -- it should 've been more uniform so less shadows appeared .
Very cool .
It 'll be interesting to see how you created the background .
Very cool shot , would love to know how you accomplished it .
The colors are wonderful , and I love the clarity of the droplets .
10 . lhall ( PS - not crazy about the white border .
JMO . )
This photo will win ! ( probably ) .
OOOOOOOOOOooooooo ... and I though by blue drop was goooood . ;o )
The colors are great in this and makes it a really ineresting stop-motion .
Without the colors , this would be a fairly typical , been - there , done - that stop motion .
Your lighting is perfect , not hot spots to speak of .
Great job !
I simply love it .
Colors , focus , clarity , angle and framing / cropping .
Everything .
You 've done a great job with this .
I guess I do have one tiny nit pick , which is probably difficult to avoid , but the reflection of the water " tower " in the bottom center of the photo is a little out of place there .
Not distracting , but odd .
possibley cloned out outside of the challenge ?
I could look at this shot for a very long time .
Good luck in the challenge .
I did vote this a 9 but came back and decided to give you a 10 .
I love the colors !
The lighting is great .
The water looks so smooth .
The focus is perfect .
Very creative .
Good luck , but I am sure you do n't need it . ;)
GREAT shot .
All of the colors captured in the drop are wonderful , it was a great idea and was executed very , very well .
The bottom of the shot is maybe a tad dark , but it does n't detract from the overall effect .
10 !
Awesome shot .
The only flaws in the shot are dust specs or something of the like .
The most noticable one is the white spec on the orange blotch on the right .
Outstanding picture though , nearly flawless .
Very cool !
Is this different color oils on the water to create the effect ?
Or something under the water ?
Either way this shot = 10
Fantastic , amazing colour and capture !
Is it the bowl that has this pattern on it ?
Good Luck , but I think you dont need it with this picture !!
Really beautiful !
Clarity and color are superb !
nice variation on the drip .
good clarity and color .
good choice on border .
Wow !
you took a cliche shot and turned into something breath taking .
Good job .
My first 10 this week !
Good luck in the challenge .
Jacko
excellent photo ... love the colors .
I 've seen the water droplets many many times , but you managed to make it unique !
Interesting twist to an old theme .
Good clean shot .
Smoooooooth .
Love this , great colors , light , action , dof , focus .
Wonderful work .
Nice use of color to make this an original shot .
The way , a single instance is captured in this image is exceptional ; and the way it is returned back into the mosaic of time , through your use of coloured background , is even more astounding !
The saturation is perfect , and the clarity is excellent .
A very fine example of what it means to be a photographer , congratulations !
And the winner is .
Congrats on catching this perfect shot.10
Gorgeous detail and a great capture !!
This would have been sooooo excellent for the motion challenge as well .
This is as good as it gets .
Well done great photo
This is truly quite magnificent ...
The is by far my favourite photo in this challenge .
To be honest , this concept has been done many times , but not so such an excellent standard as this .
I love the array of colours you have used , and it just looks fantastic !
My only 10 vote this week !
Very cool shot .
Colors are great and the stop motion very nice .
I see some shadows that I do n't quite like , but it is a nice shot .
This is amazing !
I can not wait to find out how you did it .
My absolute fav from both challenges ... great stopped motion and incredible color .
10 ( only cuz i can't do 11 ) Lisa
Beautiful drop and color .
I 've done a few of these but can't seem to get the color up into the water .
And my angle shows the sink behine the drop and not the water .
I hope you have details and camera settings in your info on this .
Nice !!!!
=10 Siiizzzam
This is awesome I love all the different colors in this and you 've got the detail perfect .
I 've been trying this too for a while and am almost bored with doing it .
But you give it life .
Very good .
Very pretty , cool photo
Just when you think that water drop photos are old hat , a dime a dozen , along comes one that makes you sit and stare .
Amazing !
Wow !
Beautiful !
The color , the lighting , the contrast , the focus , wow !

Five reporters must testify about their law enforcement sources in a former Army scientist ’s lawsuit against the Justice Department , a federal judge in Washington ruled yesterday .
The suit , filed by Steven J. Hatfill , a bioterrorism expert , contends that the government violated the federal Privacy Act by providing journalists with information about him in the F.B.I. ’s investigation of the deadly anthrax mailings in 2001 .
The reporters  Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman of Newsweek ; Allan Lengel of The Washington Post ; Toni Locy , formerly of USA Today ; and James Stewart , formerly of CBS News  have acknowledged receiving information from the Justice Department and the F.B.I. about Dr. Hatfill , the judge , Reggie B. Walton , wrote in his decision yesterday .
But they have refused to name their sources .
Judge Walton , of the Federal District Court in Washington , said Dr. Hatfill was entitled to the sources ’ names because “ the information sought is clearly central to his Privacy Act claims . ”

Introducing the first broadcast of " This is the News " ( September 1947 )
It seems to me that any action that arbitrarily limits the citizen 's access to sight , sound and print , upon which opinion can be based , is , in the true sense of the phrase , un-American .
In response to the House Un- American Activities Committee 's ban on radio recording and television cameras from public hearings ( 1 February 1949 ) , quoted in The New York Times
Is it not possible that an unruly head of hair , an infectious smile , eyes that seem remarkable for the depths of their sincerity , a cultivated air of authority , may attract huge television audiences regardless of the violence that may be done to truth or objectivity ?
As quoted in The Saturday Evening Post ( December 1949 )
If we confuse dissent with disloyalty — if we deny the right of the individual to be wrong , unpopular , eccentric or unorthodox — if we deny the essence of racial equality then hundreds of millions in Asia and Africa who are shopping about for a new allegiance will conclude that we are concerned to defend a myth and our present privileged status .

Broadcast from Buchenwald ( 1945 ) [ edit ]
I have reported what I saw and heard , but only part of it .
For most of it I have no words .
If I 've offended you by this rather mild account of Buchenwald , I 'm not in the least sorry .
CBS radio broadcast from Buchenwald ( 15 April 1945 ) ; audio and transcript
As I walked down to the end of the barracks , there was applause from the men too weak to get out of bed .
It sounded like the hand clapping of babies ; they were so weak .
We went to the hospital ; it was full .
The doctor told me that two hundred had died the day before .
I asked the cause of death ; he shrugged and said , " Tuberculosis , starvation , fatigue , and there are many who have no desire to live . "
It appeared that most of the men and boys had died of starvation ; they had not been executed .
But the manner of death seemed unimportant .
Murder had been done at Buchenwald .
God alone knows how many men and boys have died there during the last twelve years .
I pray you to believe what I have said about Buchenwald .
I have reported what I saw and heard , but only part of it .
For most of it I have no words .
If I 've offended you by this rather mild account of Buchenwald , I 'm not in the least sorry .
Full transcript and audio recording at This I Believe .
This I Believe — by that name , we present the personal philosophies of thoughtful men and women in all walks of life .
In this brief space , a banker or a butcher , a painter or a social worker , people of all kinds who need have nothing more in common than integrity , a real honesty , will write about the rules they live by , the things they have found to be the basic values in their lives .
We hardly need to be reminded that we are living in an age of confusion — a lot of us have traded in our beliefs for bitterness and cynicism or for a heavy package of despair , or even a quivering portion of hysteria .
Opinions can be picked up cheap in the market place while such commodities as courage and fortitude and faith are in alarmingly short supply .
There is a mental fear , which provokes others of us to see the images of witches in a neighbor ’s yard and stampedes us to burn down this house .
And there is a creeping fear of doubt , doubt of what we have been taught , of the validity of so many things we had long since taken for granted to be durable and unchanging .
It has become more difficult than ever to distinguish black from white , good from evil , right from wrong .
Except for those who think in terms of pious platitudes or dogma or narrow prejudice ( and those thoughts we are n’t interested in ) , people do n’t speak their beliefs easily , or publicly .
Perhaps we should warn you that there is one thing you wo n’t read , and that is a pat answer for the problems of life .
We do n’t pretend to make this a spiritual or psychological patent - medicine chest where one can come and get a pill of wisdom , to be swallowed like an aspirin , to banish the headaches of our times .
This reporter ’s beliefs are in a state of flux .
It would be easier to enumerate the items I do not believe in , than the other way around .
And yet in talking to people , in listening to them , I have come to realize that I do n’t have a monopoly on the world ’s problems .
Others have their share , often far bigger than mine .
This has helped me to see my own in truer perspective : and in learning how others have faced their problems — this has given me fresh ideas about how to tackle mine .
Speech to his staff ( 1954 ) [ edit ]
No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices .
Widely quoted comments from a speech to his staff before the broadcast of the See It Now program on Joe McCarthy ( 9 March 1954 ) ;
As quoted in " Edward R. Murrow and the Time of His Time " by Joseph Wershba
All I can hope to teach my son is to tell the truth and fear no man .
No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices .
If none of us ever read a book that was " dangerous , " had a friend who was " different , " or joined an organization that advocated " change , " we would all be just the kind of people Joe McCarthy wants .
The only thing that counts is the right to know , to speak , to think — that , and the sanctity of the courts .
Otherwise it 's not America .
See It Now ( 1954 ) [ edit ]
We can deny our heritage and our history , but we cannot escape responsibility for the result ... We proclaim ourselves , as indeed we are , the defenders of freedom , wherever it continues to exist in the world , but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home .
No one familiar with the history of this country can deny that congressional committees are useful .
It is necessary to investigate before legislating , but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly .
His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind as between the internal and the external threats of communism .
We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty .
We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law .
We will not walk in fear , one of another .
We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason , if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine , and remember that we are not descended from fearful men — not from men who feared to write , to speak , to associate and to defend causes that were , for the moment , unpopular .
This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy 's methods to keep silent , or for those who approve .
We can deny our heritage and our history , but we cannot escape responsibility for the result .
There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities .
As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age .
We proclaim ourselves , as indeed we are , the defenders of freedom , wherever it continues to exist in the world , but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home .
The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad , and given considerable comfort to our enemies .
And whose fault is that ?
Not really his .
He did n't create this situation of fear ; he merely exploited it — and rather successfully .
Cassius was right .
" The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . "

Last week , Senator McCarthy appeared on this program to correct any errors he might have thought we made in our report of March ninth .
Since he made no reference to any statements of fact that we made , we must conclude that he found no errors of fact .
He proved again , that anyone who exposes him , anyone who does not share his hysterical disregard for decency and human dignity and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution , must be either a Communist or a ' fellow traveler ' .

RTNDA Convention Speech ( 1958 ) [ edit ]
This just might do nobody any good .
At the end of this discourse a few people may accuse this reporter of fouling his own comfortable nest , and your organization may be accused of having given hospitality to heretical and even dangerous thoughts .
But the elaborate structure of networks , advertising agencies and sponsors will not be shaken or altered .
It is my desire , if not my duty , to try to talk to you journeymen with some candor about what is happening to radio and television .
I have no technical advice or counsel to offer those of you who labor in this vineyard , the one that produces words and pictures .
You will , I am sure , forgive me for not telling you that instruments with which you work are miraculous , that your responsibility is unprecedented or that your aspirations are frequently frustrated .
It is not necessary to remind you of the fact that your voice , amplified to the degree where it reaches from one end of the country to the other , does not confer upon you greater wisdom than when your voice reached only from one end of the bar to the other .
All of these things you know .
A variant of part of this statement is often quoted : Just because your voice reaches halfway around the world does n't mean you are wiser than when it reached only to the end of the bar .
I have no feud , either with my employers , any sponsors , or with the professional critics of radio and television .
But I am seized with an abiding fear regarding what these two instruments are doing to our society , our culture and our heritage .
Our history will be what we make it .
And if there are any historians about fifty or a hundred years from now , and there should be preserved the kinescopes for one week of all three networks , they will there find recorded in black and white , or perhaps color , evidence of decadence , escapism and insulation from the realities of the world in which we live .
During the daily peak viewing periods , television in the main insulates us from the realities of the world in which we live .
If this state of affairs continues , we may alter an advertising slogan to read : LOOK NOW AND PAY LATER .
For surely we shall pay for using this most powerful instrument of communication to insulate the citizenry from the hard and demanding realities which must be faced if we are to survive .
I mean the word survive literally .
I have reason to know , as do many of you , that when the evidence on a controversial subject is fairly and calmly presented , the public recognizes it for what it is -- an effort to illuminate rather than to agitate .
If radio news is to be regarded as a commodity , only acceptable when saleable , and only when packaged to fit the advertising appropriation of a sponsor , then I do n't care what you call it — I say it is n't news .
One of the basic troubles with radio and television news is that both instruments have grown up as an incompatible combination of show business , advertising and news .
Each of the three is a rather bizarre and demanding profession .
And when you get all three under one roof , the dust never settles .
The top management of the networks with a few notable exceptions , has been trained in advertising , research , sales or show business .
But by the nature of the corporate structure , they also make the final and crucial decisions having to do with news and public affairs .
Frequently they have neither the time nor the competence to do this .
I have said , and I believe , that potentially we have in this country a free enterprise system of radio and television which is superior to any other .
But to achieve its promise , it must be both free and enterprising .
There is no suggestion here that networks or individual stations should operate as philanthropies .
But I can find nothing in the Bill of Rights or in the Communications
Act which says that they must increase their net profits each year , lest the Republic collapse .
I am frightened by the imbalance , the constant striving to reach the largest possible audience for everything ; by the absence of a sustained study of the state of the nation .
Do not be deluded into believing that the titular heads of the networks control what appears on their networks .
They all have better taste .
All are responsible to stockholders , and in my experience all are honorable men .
But they must schedule what they can sell in the public market .
The sponsor of an hour 's television program is not buying merely the six minutes devoted to commercial message .
He is determining , within broad limits , the sum total of the impact of the entire hour .
If he always , invariably , reaches for the largest possible audience , then this process of insulation , of escape from reality , will continue to be massively financed , and its apologist will continue to make winsome speeches about giving the public what it wants , or " letting the public decide . "
If we go on as we are , we are protecting the mind of the American public from any real contact with the menacing world that squeezes in upon us .
We are engaged in a great experiment to discover whether a free public opinion can devise and direct methods of managing the affairs of the nation .
We may fail .
But we are handicapping ourselves needlessly .
Just once in a while let us exalt the importance of ideas and information .
We are currently wealthy , fat , comfortable and complacent .
We have currently a built - in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information .
Our mass media reflect this .
But unless we get up off our fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main is being used to distract , delude , amuse and insulate us , then television and those who finance it , those who look at it and those who work at it , may see a totally different picture too late .
We are to a large extent an imitative society .
This instrument can teach , it can illuminate ; yes , and even it can inspire .
But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends .
Otherwise it 's nothing but wires and lights in a box .
There is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance , intolerance and indifference .
This weapon of television could be useful .
Stonewall Jackson , who knew something about the use of weapons , is reported to have said , " When war comes , you must draw the sword and throw away the scabbard . "
The trouble with television is that it is rusting in the scabbard during a battle for survival .
... if what I say is responsible , I alone am responsible for the saying of it ...

Good Night , and Good Luck
After seeing the photos of fortune cookies in a dumpster , Boing Boing reader " 555 " sent this photo of watermelons in a dumpster .
This reminds me of the photos we posted in March about a food bank dump in a California desert .
This bill was a precursor to the American Bill of Rights , and set out strict limits on the Royal Family 's legal prerogatives such as a prohibition against arbitrary suspension of Parliament 's laws .
More importantly , it limited the right to raise money through taxation to Parliament .
The English elite had just succeeded in ousting the Catholic King James , who had offended the protestant Church of England by aggressively promoting the Roman Catholic religion , in spite of laws that Parliament had passed .
William III ( of Orange , pictured below ) and his wife Mary were crowned King and Queen of England ( Mary was actually the daughter of the deposed King James II ) in Westminster Abbey on April 11 , 1689 .
As part of their oaths , the new King William III and Queen Mary were required to swear that they would obey the laws of Parliament , a significant move from the rule of man to rule of law .
At this time , the Bill of Rights was read to both William and Mary .
" We thankfully accept what you have offered us , " William replied , agreeing to be subject to law and to be guided in his actions by the decisions of Parliament .
The Bill was formally passed through Parliament after the coronation .
On December 16 , 1689 , the King and Queen gave it Royal Assent which represented the end of the concept of divine right of kings ( see an image of the 1689 statute in the Law Gallery ) .
The Bill of Rights was designed to control the power of kings and queens and to make them subject to laws passed by Parliament .
This concession by the royal family has been called the " bloodless revolution " or the " glorious revolution . "
It was certainly an era for a more tolerant royal prerogative .
William , for example , did not seek to oppress the supporters of the deposed and Catholic King James II , even as James tried as best he could to rally the Catholic forces within England , Scotland and Ireland against King William III .
The Bill of Rights was one of three very important laws made at this time .
The other two were the 1689 Toleration Act ( which promoted religious toleration ) and the 1694 Triennial Act , which prevented the King from dissolving Parliament at his will and held that general elections had to be held every three years .
The 1689 Bill of Rights
WHEREAS THE LORDS SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL , AND COMMONS , ASSEMBLED AT WESTMINSTER , LAWFULLY , FULLY , AND FREELY REPRESENTING ALL THE ESTATES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS REALM , DID UPON THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY , IN 1689 , PRESENT UNTO THEIR MAJESTIES THEN CALLED AND KNOWN BY THE NAMES AND STYLE OF WILLIAM AND MARY , PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF ORANGE , BEING PRESENT IN THEIR PROPER PERSONS , A CERTAIN DECLARATION IN WRITING , MADE BY THE SAID LORDS AND COMMONS , IN THE WORDS FOLLOWING :
Whereas the late King James II , by the assistance of divers evil counselors , judges , and ministers employed by him , did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion , and the laws and liberties of this kingdom .
By assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws , and the execution of laws , without consent of parliament .
By committing and prosecuting divers worthy prelates , for humbly petitioning to be excused concurring to the said assumed power .
By issuing and causing to be executed a commission under the great seal for erecting a court called , The Court of Commissioners for ecclesiastical causes .
By levying money for and to the use of the Crown , by pretence of prerogative , for other time , and in other manner , than the same was granted by parliament .
By raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace , without consent of Parliament , and quartering soldiers contrary to law .
By causing several good subjects , being protestants , to be disarmed , at the same time when papists were both armed and employed , contrary to law .
By violating the freedom of election of members to serve in Parliament .
By prosecutions in the Court of King 's Bench , for matters and causes cognizable only in Parliament ; and by divers other arbitrary and illegal courses .
And whereas of late years , partial , corrupt , and unqualified persons have been returned and served on juries in trials and particularly divers jurors in trials for high treason , which were not freeholders .
And excessive bail hath been required of persons committed in criminal cases , to elude the benefit of the laws made for the liberty of the subject .
And excessive fines have been imposed ; and illegal and cruel punishments inflicted .
And several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures , before any conviction or judgment against the persons , upon whom the same were to be levied .
All of which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and statutes , and freedom of this realm .
And whereas the said late King James II having abdicated the government , and the throne being thereby vacant , his highness the Prince of Orange ( whom it hath pleased Almighty God to make the glorious instrument of delivering this kingdom from popery and arbitrary power ) did ( by the advice of the lords spiritual and temporal , and divers principal persons of the Commons ) cause letters to be written to the lords spiritual and temporal , being protestants ; and other letters to the several counties , cities , universities , boroughs , and cinque - ports , for the choosing of such persons to represent them , as were of right to be sent to Parliament , to meet and sit at Westminster upon the 22 January , 1689 in order to make such an establishment , as that their religion , laws , and liberties might not again be in danger of being subverted ; upon which letters , elections have been accordingly made .
And thereupon the said Lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , pursuant to their respective letters and elections , being now assembled in a full and free representative of this nation , taking into their most serious consideration the best means for attaining the ends aforesaid ; do in the first place ( as their ancestors in like cases have usually done ) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties , declare :
That the pretended power of suspending of laws , or the execution of laws , by regal authority , without consent of Parliament , is illegal .
That the pretended power of dispensing with laws , or the executions of laws , by Regal authority , as it hath been assumed and exercised of late , is illegal .
That the commission for erecting the late Court of Commissioners for ecclesiastical causes , and all other commissions and courts of like nature are illegal and pernicious .
That levying money for or to the use of the Crown , by pretence of prerogative , without grant of Parliament , for longer time , or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted , is illegal .
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the King , and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal .
That the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace , unless it be with consent of Parliament , is against law .
That the subjects which are Protestants , may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions , and as allowed by law .
That election of members of Parliament ought to be free .
That the freedom of speech , and debates or proceedings in Parliament , ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament .
That excessive bail ought not to be required , nor excessive fines imposed ; nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .
That jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned , and jurors which pass upon men in trials of high treason ought to be freeholders .
That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before conviction , are illegal and void .
And that for redress of all grievances , and for the amending , strengthening and preserving of the laws , parliaments ought to be held frequently .
And they do claim , demand , and insist upon all and singular the premisses , as their undoubted rights and liberties ; and that no declarations , judgments , doings , or proceedings , to the prejudice of the people in any of the said premisses , ought in any wise to be drawn hereafter into consequence or example ; to which demand of their rights they are particularly encouraged by the declaration of this Highness the Prince of Orange , as being the only means for obtaining a full redress and remedy therein .
Having therefore an entire confidence , That his said Highness the Prince of Orange will perfect the deliverance so far advanced by him , and will still preserve them from the violation of their rights , which they have here asserted , and from all other attempts upon their religion , rights , and liberties , the said lords spiritual and temporal , and Commons , assembled at Westminster , do resolve , That William and Mary prince and princess of Orange , be , and be declared , King and Queen of England , France and Ireland , and the dominions thereunto belonging , to hold the crown and royal dignity of the said kingdoms ( duhaime.org note : bolded text show in image of original , pictured ) and dominions to them the said prince and princess during their lives , and the life of the survivor of them ; and that the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in , and executed by the said prince of Orange , in the names of the said prince and princess , during their joint lives ; and after their deceases , the said crown and royal dignity of the said kingdoms and dominions to be to the heirs of the body of the said princess ; and for default of such issue to the princess Anne of Denmark and the heirs of her body ; and for default of such issue to the heirs of the said prince of Orange .
And the lords spiritual and temporal , and commons , do pray the said prince and princess to accept the same accordingly .
And that the oaths hereafter mentioned be taken by all persons of whom the oaths of allegiance and supremacy might be required by law , instead of them ; and that the said oaths of allegiance and supremacy may be abrogated .
" I , A.B. do sincerely promise and swear , That I will be faithful , and bear true allegiance , to their Majesties , King William and Queen Mary : So help me God . "
" I , A.B. do swear , That I from my heart abhor , detest , and abjure as impious and heretical , that damnable doctrine and position , That princes excommunicated or deprived by the pope , or any authority of the see of Rome , may be deposed or murdered by their subjects , or any other whatsoever .
And I do declare , That no foreign prince , person , prelate , state , or potentate hath , or ought to have any jurisdiction , power , superiority , pre-eminence , or authority , ecclesiastical or spiritual , within this realm , So help me God . "

An unlikely revolutionary , Carne Ross was once a rising star in the British Foreign Office ( the equivalent of the U.S. State Department ) , where , among other postings , he worked as a speechwriter for the Foreign Secretary and later as the Middle East expert assigned to the U.K. ’s delegation to the U.N. Security Council .
It was during his time at the U.N. that he became disillusioned with the current state of diplomacy , an experience that forms the basis for his recent book , Independent Diplomat : Dispatches from an Unaccountable Elite .
During the run-up to the Iraq War , Ross was in the unique position to see the official intelligence about Iraq ’s supposed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction .
What he learned was disturbing : there was no concrete evidence that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear , biological , or chemical weapons programs .
This fact , however , did not seem to figure into the policy - making decisions that made the U.S. - led invasion all but inevitable .
In 2004 , Ross testified as much to the Butler Inquiry , a British parliamentary investigation into the misuse of pre-war intelligence .
His comments were not well received by the British government , which invoked the U.K. ’s Official Secrets
Act to suppress the transcript of his testimony .
Ross resigned from the Foreign Office in 2004 and went on to found Independent Diplomat , the world ’s first private diplomatic organization , which instructs representatives from underserved and underrepresented countries in how to make their voices heard .
Mother Jones spoke with Ross on July 19 .
Mother Jones :
You have written that your critical view of how diplomacy is practiced was formed over time .
But was there a moment when it all began to crystallize for you ?
Carne Ross :
The key experience for me was my time as a British diplomat at the U.N. Security Council in New York .
In some ways , that was more important than the Iraq war .
What I saw on the Security Council — the way that international law is made and the way that the needs of suffering people are often ignored — was what led to my conclusions about diplomacy .
After that job , I took a secondment to the UN mission in Kosovo , partly as a way of testing out the U.N. as a possible future career for me .
In June 2004 , I testified to a British government inquiry on the use of intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
It was an experience that crystallized my anxieties over the Iraq War , and shortly afterwards I resigned from the British Foreign Office .
MJ : If you had access to information indicating that claims about Iraq ’s WMD were not true , why did n’t you resign earlier ?
There were U.S. diplomats who resigned in the run-up to the war .
Did it ever cross your mind to do so ?
CR : Yes , it did .
I drafted many letters of resignation during that period which I did n’t send .
There were two reasons for this .
One was doubt .
One of the problems with the Iraq intelligence issue was that there was no official who could claim he knew the absolute totality of the information available .
It was not impossible to me that there was new information ; in retrospect , this turned out not to be the case .
I had also spent many years working against the Saddam government , so I was not totally hostile to the idea of it being removed , including by force .
I was ambivalent about the war .
But above all , I was afraid of what would happen to me if I were to resign — afraid in terms of my own professional future , but also afraid of the public battering I would doubtless receive .
That was probably the most important reason .
I ’m not proud to confess it , but it ’s the truth .
MJ : Were there others that you knew or were aware of either at the U.N. or the foreign office who expressed similar feelings , maybe in private conversations you had with them ?
CR : Well , I was quite isolated in New York , because I was away from most of my British colleagues in the government who were in London .
But I was aware of quite a number of officials who had doubts .
I suppose the most important of them was a guy called David Kelly , who was a British weapons scientist who later committed suicide after being outed as the source of a BBC story that the government had exaggerated its account of Iraqi WMD .
MJ : If people in your office had private doubts , but nothing was done at an official level , does n’t that signal that something is amiss ?
CR : Well , I think you ’re right .
I think something is seriously amiss .
There is nothing more serious than the decision to go to war , and I think both the U.S. and U.K. governments mishandled that decision in a very serious way .
There are very , very few people who are qualified to say this , but I ’m one of them , because I worked on it .
The policy was not straightforward ; it was quite complicated and technical .
This was one of the reasons why senior officials and executive decision - makers did not address it properly .
This is a systematic problem , a systemic problem of policy - making .
MJ : You ’re suggesting that the complicated nature of modern diplomacy is one of the primary factors contributing to its failure ?
CR : Yes .
With regard to Iraq policy , the complexity and the long - term and uncertain nature of sanctions enforcement meant that it did n’t have the binary clarity of military invasion or not .
That may have meant that it got less attention than it deserved as a policy option .
I have to say , though , that this is not the only explanation .
I think that decision - makers deliberately ignored available alternatives .
There was , for whatever reason , a very clear and deliberate decision to go to war come what may .
MJ : When you decided to leave the British government and go into private practice , how did your colleagues react ?
CR : It was mixed .
Some were hostile , though few to my face .
Some commended me for my bravery , though none dared do so in public .
Some said to me they would have done the same if they had worked as closely on the issue as I had , in other words making an excuse for themselves that they had not resigned .
Many simply patronized me and said they hoped I would survive my unbearable exit from the comforts of the British Foreign Office .
MJ : You ’ve characterized diplomats as an “ unaccountable global elite . ”
But you ’ve also accused the rest of us of being irresponsible for ceding power too readily to invisible people working behind the scenes .
What do you suggest we do about it ?
CR : Perhaps my book is a little too scathing .
It is driven by a lot of anger and anxiety about the way things are .
But I do think that globally we are far too deferential to diplomats and politicians to make decisions of enormous import on our behalf .
I find it staggering that we ’re not more critical and demanding of scrutiny of these decision - makers .
These are decisions about things of the utmost importance , from war to climate change to terrorism to migration , and there is a great tendency to accept the assurances of the diplomatic and political establishments that they have these problems in their grip when I think the evidence suggests that they do not .
MJ : You have gone so far as to recommend that we do away with professional diplomats entirely .
CR : This is something Trotsky would call a transitional demand .
You do n’t realistically expect it to be fulfilled , but in making it you hope to change the system towards fulfillment of that ideal .
I do n’t for one second think that we face the imminent end of the state - based diplomatic system .
However , I think that system is deeply , deeply flawed .
Above all because it allows this practice called “ diplomacy , ” which is permitted to operate by rules that are amoral and largely free from scrutiny .
It ’s a practice in which small groups of people make enormously important decisions on the basis of fairly arbitrary criteria .
I know this from my own experience .
This is not an external critique .
I as a policymaker on the Middle East and on other issues contributed to decisions about policy that were arbitrary and premised on an invented calculus of what we thought was important .
This is not the manner in which policy should be made .
There should be much more open participation and democratic accountability .
MJ : You write in your book : “ Diplomacy should take a more eclectic approach to information , and allow discussion and examination of emotion and non-measurable elements of reality , or at least acknowledge this deficit in its calculations . ”
What do you mean by that ?
CR :
The basic idea is that not everything that is important to us can be put into prescriptive , numeric , or empirical terms .
Arguably , the most important things cannot be .
It is harder to make a decision about a situation when you are far removed from that situation , which is invariably the case with diplomacy .
Somehow , we have to account for this deficit when making decisions about other places .
One way to address it would be to allow those most affected by a given policy to speak to the decision - makers , which happens all too infrequently .
Above all , we have in contemporary culture and politics placed a great reliance on empirical information to convey the quote - unquote “ truth ” of a situation when no amount of empirical information can convey the whole truth .
All description is inevitably reductionist .
I suppose it can be easily encapsulated in what happened in our decision - making about sanctions on Iraq .
Without doubt , sanctions helped contribute to considerable human suffering in Iraq , and I think had we been more aware of that reality and more conscious of that reality , able to feel that reality , then we as decision - makers drafting resolutions in New York about sanctions in Iraq would have made different decisions .
Our decisions were ultimately inhumane because they failed to take full account of the reality of the Iraqi people .
MJ : Another thing you focus on in your book is the language that diplomats use in the course of doing their work .
You call it a “ reduction of reality . ”
I wonder , though , how does Independent Diplomat deviate from this norm ?
If you ’re representing clients within the existing system , do n’t you have to play by those rules if you want to be heard ?
CR : Of course we have to play by the rules of the existing game .
Until the rules are changed we have no choice .
Our work is to explain the rules of the game to our clients who are often intimidated or excluded or just do n’t understand the way that it ’s played .
That ’s the value and the contribution that Independent Diplomat can make , but there ’s no doubt that my long - term ambition is to see the system changed .
Quite how that will happen I do n’t know .
It ’s not in my hands .
However , I think that the mere existence Independent Diplomat indicates that the system as it is currently constituted is not fair and it is not working effectively .
MJ : How many clients do you have at the moment ?
CR : We have five now : Kosovo , Croatia , Turkish Cyprus , Somaliland , and the Polisario movement of the Western Sahara .
MJ : I realize it ’s early in the game , but can you point to any obvious successes you ’ve had with your clients , or alternatively , the biggest challenges you face in working with them ?
CR :
The biggest challenge is simply the way that the powerful defend what they think are their interests .
Powerful countries tend to try and control decision - making little realizing that in the long - run by excluding people they will inevitably face problems and their decisions will not be sustainable .
You ca n’t change the nature of power .
I do think we make a difference for our clients , though , not least because we ’ve enabled them to understand the system from the perspective of people who were very much inside the box .
We are experienced former diplomats who ’ve usually worked for powerful countries .
It ’s kind of like gamekeeper turned poacher , and I think we make a difference for our clients in that respect .
MJ : Are there any governments you would not work for ?
CR : Yes , there are many governments we would not work for .
We will only help those who are committed to democracy , human rights , and international law .
MJ : Would you ever work for a country that was engaged in a shooting war ?
CR : It wholly depends .
We do n’t necessarily rule out helping people engaged in conflict .
Our work is primarily focused on conflict areas because we believe that conflict or tension can be reduced if people have access to good diplomacy .
If they ’re able to articulate their needs in the world ’s diplomatic system , that in itself contributes to a reduction in tension .
MJ : When I learned of Independent Diplomat , one of the parallels that immediately occurred to me was the privatization in military services .
It seemed like just another in the long list of things that have traditionally been the sole domain of nation states , but which are now increasingly in the hands of private industry .
Is there any cause for concern here , and how do you see yourself fitting within that framework ?
CR : I do think that there is a proliferation of private groups involved in not only diplomacy but also military operations : the sorts of things that governments used to preserve just for themselves .
I would make a very clear distinction between Independent Diplomat and the private military industry in that we operate along very clear ethical criteria .
We only help the disadvantaged .
But , of course , there could easily be another private diplomatic organization that did not operate by those criteria , that merely worked for the highest bidder .
Indeed , there are commercial companies out there — PR companies , law firms — that will effectively do diplomacy for money .
They will help clients draft treaties , they will help them improve their PR image , things like that , without regard to the ethical record of their clients .
I do n’t celebrate this development , but I think it is the way things are going .
I personally would like to see a lot more activity by individuals and NGOs to try and break through the walls of traditional diplomacy .
I do n’t think in my experience that governments have done a particularly good job , and I ’m not sure that I regard it as wholly a bad thing that they are losing some of their sovereignty in this area .
MJ : What specifically are the services that you provide ?
I got the impression from your book that you would prefer people from these underrepresented areas to represent themselves .
Are you generally instructing them in the mechanics of how to do that : writing speeches , negotiating strategies , working with the media ?
Or are you involved with setting their policy goals ?
CR : No , we believe very strongly that the goals of policy are for them to decide .
We merely help advise them on how to reach those goals .
We ’re not one of these NGOs that go around telling our clients what they should want .
What we do is explain the often obscure architecture of international diplomacy , giving them advice about how to engage with that architecture , how to craft their message , whom to lobby , what messages to develop , what techniques to use — practical and strategic advice .
MJ : You spent the first part of your career with the British government , enjoying the perks of your association with a powerful country and the benefits of a system that was structured to enhance and maintain that power .
What has it been like for you personally to sit on the other side of the table ?
CR : Well , the first couple of years were very hard .
I felt lost without my identity as a British diplomat .
But now I find it very enjoyable , if extremely challenging , working on behalf of our clients .
The best thing about it is learning about the way they see the world which is invariably very different from the way I used to see the world as a British diplomat .
That ’s always refreshing .
And there is a degree of candor and honesty in these relationships that I never enjoyed as a British diplomat .
Being a British diplomat , you were always treated as a British diplomat .
People said to you things that they wanted the British government to hear .
Now I have a much more intimate and open relationship with the countries we work with , which is very rewarding .
All that said , it is still really difficult working with relatively less powerful countries and governments .
The sorts of things that you could do as a British official — like take your concerns to Washington or to the U.N. Security Council — are simply not an option to the vast majority of other countries ’ governments and peoples .
So , you have to think of something else .
There ’s a constant challenge to be creative , to make the most of what little power our clients have .
MJ : How hopeful are you that this “ diplomatic deficit ” can be closed ?
CR : In terms of information and the transparency of the system , I ’m very optimistic .
I think the system is becoming more transparent .
There are more NGOs opening up the system , providing information about it .
The Internet has provided a lot of high - quality information that was hitherto hard to get hold of , although you still have to know where to look .
In that sense , I think things are better .
Also , I think globally there is a less deferential culture towards political elites than there used to be .
But in terms of changing the architecture , the fundamental sort of underlying system of power , I ’m not optimistic at all .
I think those who have power use it in an extremely shortsighted and often foolish way , which exacerbates rather than solves our problems .
I ’m not confident that newer , younger generations of leaders will learn these lessons .
I do n’t believe automatically in progress .
I think each generation may bring its own stupidities and prejudices .
MJ : Well , on that hopeful note …
CR : It ’s not a very optimistic note on which to end .
I do find encouragement in things like Live 8 and LiveEarth and things like that .
On the other hand , I think these things are often easy for politicians to exploit or ignore , and those politicians often work on very narrow and self - interested criteria of decision - making .
Rare is the politician or leader who has a truly global perspective .
The truth is , we have global problems , and our politicians are national and short - term .
Until that basic equation alters , I think we will continue to have problems .
Couric on CBS ' Face the Nation : I saw what the U.S. Military wanted me to see
Today , Katie Couric reported from Iraq on her impressions of conditions , along with Gen. David Petraeus ' take , of the situation on the ground in Baghdad .
According to Couric , Petraeus believes that an upward trend can be seen in President Bush 's " surge , " and that he will use successes in Fallujah and Ramadi as examples , despite less promising results in other parts of Baghdad and in northern Iraq , of why current US troop levels should be maintained .
Couric was given a tour of the Allawi market as a sign that things in Iraq are improving , though she concedes that her account of " normal signs of life " and lack of blood and bullets , compared to a January offensive that occurred at that location , are " what the U.S. military wants me to see . "
The following video was broadcast on CBS ' Face the Nation on September 2 .

There are two inter-related data sets that illustrate this problem .
The first comes from the Treasury Department :
09/30/2006 $ 8,506,973,899,215.23
09/30/2005 $ 7,932,709,661,723.50
09/30/2004 $ 7,379,052,696,330.32
09/30/2003 $ 6,783,231,062,743.62
09/30/2002 $ 6,228,235,965,597.16
09/30/2001 $ 5,807,463,412,200.06
Total Debt Outstanding : $ 9,016,288,006,279.21
From the and of fiscal 2001 to the current total debt we have a total increase of about 3.2 trillion dollars in total debt outstanding .
Also notice the total amount of debt outstanding has been increasing at a high rate per year for the last 5 years .
This indicates the deficit – despite claims to the contrary -- is nowhere near under control .
Basically , somewhere in the US budget structure there is a serious problem that needs to be addressed now .
The second data set is a long - term chart of the dollar .
Notice the dollar is currently trading near its lowest level in over 35 years .
This tells us a very simple fact : foreigners are losing confidence in the dollar ’s value .
This makes the dollar extremely vulnerable to a random economic event .
The combined reality of these two data sets is simple .
Either we start to realistically deal with the deficit now , or the deficit will start to deal with us .
And frankly , it ’s best for us to deal with it .
If random economic events make us deal with it , it ’s going to hurt a whole lot more .
The bottom line is Bush has already made it impossible for the next president to do anything accept raise taxes and cut spending .
That of course makes electoral victory beyond 4 years from now extremely difficult .
Allen ( in his backyard in Ojai , California ) says his goal is to be free from thinking about anything he has to do . *

The invention of the minute hand is often attributed to the great Swiss clock maker Joost Bürgi , whose work in the late 16th century coincided with a burst of technical innovation in clock making that would eventually bring whole new opportunities for guilt and shame .
Along with all your other problems , you could now be late .
" There 's a big owie out there , " says David Allen , who specializes in curing the psychic pain caused by the pressure of time .
Allen 's work has become the touchstone of the life - hacking movement , a loosely knit network of psychological self - experimenters who share tips about how small changes in human behavior can bring big rewards in happiness .
Allen 's book Getting Things Done : The Art of Stress - Free Productivity has steadily climbed the best - seller lists since its release in 2001 , but the best evidence of its influence is not the 600,000 copies in print but rather the endless network of spinoffs , how - to guides , software versions , and online commentaries by readers who interpret , criticize , and extend his theories .
Allen 's approach is not inspirational .
Instead , it is detailed and dry .
But within his advice about how to label a file folder or how many minutes to allot to an incoming email there is a spiritual promise .
He says there is a state of blessed calm available to those who have taken careful measure of their habits and made all the changes suggested by reason .
Nirvana comes by routine steps , as an algorithm drives a machine .
Allen is not a dramatic presenter .
A fit , sandy - haired , soft - spoken man who only recently traded his glasses for contacts , he can be funny and wry , but his normal mode is discursive .
" Our inspirational factor is a wink , " he explains one night over dinner in a small restaurant in Chicago .
" We say , ‘ Buy a labeler for your files and you will transform your life , ' wink . "
Allen is in Chicago to give one of his daylong seminars , for which several hundred people will pay nearly $ 600 each for help putting GTD , as his method is known , into practice .
Many readers of Getting Things Done apply one or two of the book 's tricks , like the process Allen recommends for emptying an overstuffed email inbox , and then they stall .
Some of them come to seminars like this .
Allen himself is unsure if it helps .
He realizes that his system can be difficult and that he 's often accused of going overboard with elaborate schemes .
He responds with a shrug .
" Look , the workings of an automatic transmission are more complicated than a manual transmission , " he says .
" To simplify a complex event , you need a complex system . "
While the instructions in Getting Things Done are baroque , the underlying ideas can be summarized in an axiom and three rules :
THE AXIOM
Humans have a problem with stuff .
Allen defines stuff as anything we want or need to do .
A tax form has the same status as a marriage proposal ; a book to write is no different than a grocery list .
It 's all stuff .
THE RULES
1. Collect and describe all the stuff .
Everything must be inventoried without distinction or prejudice .
Errands , emails , a problem with a friend :
It all must be noted for processing .
Small objects , such as an invitation or a receipt , go into a pile .
Everything else can be represented with a few words on a piece of paper ( " find keys , " " change jobs " ) .
Once the stuff is collected , processing begins .
Anything that requires two minutes or less is handled on the spot .
The remainder is governed by the second rule .
2 . All stuff must be handled in a precise way .
Allen offers dozens of clever tricks for classifying , labeling , and retrieving stuff .
Expert users of GTD never leave old emails cluttering their inbox , for instance .
Nor do they have to rifle through a bunch of paper to see if there 's anything crucial they 've left undone .
Emails to be answered are in a separate folder from emails that merely have to be read ; there 's a file for every colleague and friend ; stuff that must be done has been identified and placed on one of several kinds of to - do lists .
Allen calls his to - do lists next - action lists , which are subject to the third rule .
3 . Items on next - action lists should be described as concretely as possible .
Breaking down stuff into physical actions , Allen says , is the key to getting things done .
The system Allen describes can be made of anything : ink on paper , data in a computer , magnets on a board .
The important thing is not the materials but the way the parts connect .
In essence , Getting Things Done : The Art of Stress - Free Productivity is a flowchart for stuff , and the book 's most important page contains no paragraphs .
It is just a diagram , with more than 20 nodes and arrows showing how to process our thoughts .
The very complexity of Allen 's method — its relentless , small - scale cleverness — is doubtless one of the things that recommends it to the many technical people among his fans .
But there 's something else at work .
Allen is remaking the self - help tradition for the information age .
The contrast with earlier schemes is instructive .
The two most influential self - organization gurus of the 1980s and 1990s were Stephen R. Covey and Hyrum W. Smith .
Covey is the author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People ; Smith is the founder of the company that created the Franklin Day Planner .
( The two men merged their companies in 1997 . )
While Covey and Smith each offer many practical tips , they both start with philosophical reflection .
" Begin with the end in mind , " writes Covey in 7 Habits , advising us to craft a mission statement that captures the fundamental purpose of our life .
Smith , in The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management , reminds us that Ben Franklin " first identified his governing values , then he made a concerted effort to live his life , day in , day out , according to these values . "
This emphasis on values , and more generally on the spiritual meaning of life , is the common thread through the genre , back to the original American self - help entrepreneur .
Allen has almost nothing to say on these topics .
He likes to describe his system as a " bottom up " approach , by which he means that life 's values emerge from its tiniest component actions , rather than a top - down approach that starts with deep thought .
He compares the person working at a desk with a person walking through the forest .
There is a surfeit of things that one could possibly pay attention to , and the primary task is to pick out , from the surrounding environment , those signals that require processing .
" Any email could be either a snake in the grass or a berry , " he says .
" Which is it ? "
To resolve this question by reference to one 's highest purpose would be inefficient .
When it comes to processing incoming signals , Allen recommends sorting by the most immediate criteria :
How long will it take , what is your location , what devices do you have at hand , what other people are present ?
These direct , contextual cues do not demand any profound insight .
Tasks can be assessed extremely rapidly and executed without friction .
Where earlier gurus tried to help their followers make their deep personal commitments explicit and easily accessible to memory , Allen is selling a kind of technology - enabled forgetting .
The life - hackers like it because it stimulates their ingenuity .
They have optimized versions for the iPhone , for Entourage , and for sets of manila folders .
Once self - management has been broken down into a set of routines , it can be implemented in any number of high tech or low tech systems .
Allen says his goal is to be free from worrying about anything he has to do .
His techniques allow him the pleasure of having , much of the time , nothing on his mind .
" People are afraid of the void , afraid of negative space , " he says .
" But having nothing on your mind is one of the most awesome experiences . "
The only thing Allen was allowed to have in his possession at Napa State Hospital was a spoon .
" One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest was pretty accurate , " he says of the time he spent as a mental patient , " and Napa was one of the good hospitals . "
Allen arrived in California in 1968 to start a PhD program in American history at UC Berkeley .
At 22 , he was adventurous , well - traveled , a bit immature .
He got married shortly after enrolling , and he remembers himself as rather too hungry for approval .
" I had a motorcycle , but not the coolest one , " he says .
" I took drugs , but I was n't the most outrageous .
I got along with everybody . "
These were dangerous years for young men unsure of their authenticity , and one day at a party Allen sat down next to a charismatic liar named Michael Bookbinder .
He 'd been a Formula One racer and also a paratrooper .
He played flamenco guitar and knew karate .
His costume included silk shirts with huge collars and puffy sleeves " in the manner of a gay buccaneer , " as an acquaintance later recalled .
He wore pancake makeup .
He was a heroin user .
Bookbinder and Allen became close .
Bookbinder taught him karate , and soon Allen was using heroin , too .
He left his marriage , abandoned his academic training , and eventually found himself out on the street , practically penniless , " crucified psychically , " as he would later put it , " absolutely at the bottom physically , emotionally , mentally , and spiritually . "
Worried about the radical change in his behavior , some of Allen 's friends had him committed in 1971 .
At the mental hospital , Allen received stark lessons in simulated obedience .
He learned to hide his psychiatric medication under his tongue instead of refusing it or spitting it out , and he studied what the medical staff seemed to want of him , so that they would pronounce him cured .
" I made a decision to institute a high state of cooperation with the world again , " he says .
After a brief period of hospitalization , he was released .
Teaching karate to earn money , Allen struggled to pull his life together .
One day , a student told him of receiving assistance from a spiritual master who balanced her aura .
Allen sought him out .
" In 10 seconds I knew he had something to teach , " Allen says .
" And in 35 years I have n't yet gotten to the end of it . "
The man who put him on a new path was then at the inflection point in a long and varied spiritual enterprise .
Roger Hinkins was born during the Depression in a poor mining town in central Utah .
By the early ' 70s he had been introduced to Eckankar by its founder , Paul Twitchell , learned esoteric philosophy from a correspondence course , changed his name to Sri John - Roger , started a series of spiritual seminars , and given up his work as a high school teacher to found a church called the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness .
The movement 's theology holds that John - Roger is the Mystical Traveler , a benevolent consciousness guiding mankind , who in the past has appeared as Jesus , St. Francis of Assisi , and Abraham Lincoln , among others .
Some of the devotees lived in a Los Angeles mansion called the Purple Rose Ashram of the New Age .
Allen was , and still is , a minister in the church .
When Allen met him , John - Roger earned money by selling transcripts of the Mystical Traveler 's teachings , known as Soul Awareness Discourses .
But in 1977 , as a general reaction against the more colorful elements of the counterculture set in , he explored new directions .
With a devotee named Russell Bishop , John - Roger launched the Insight Seminars , a largely secular program that soon found its way into major US corporations .
Insight was not alone in bringing New Age philosophy into corporate training during the next decade .
By the mid-'80s many corporate employees were being sent to classes and seminars taught by quasi-religious self - improvement groups like Lifespring , Transformational Technologies , and other branches of what was known , collectively , as the human potential movement .
David Allen became an Insight trainer , and by 1983 he was consulting at Lockheed , where he began to filter the powerful techniques of the personal - growth movement through the pragmatic grid of corporate human resources .
Allen gets things done in his personal headquarters , a modest office in the guesthouse behind his home .
Photo : Robyn TwomeyThat the inventor of their favorite system of personal organization has a decades - long devotion to New Age thinking causes fits of squeamishness among GTD fans .
" If indeed GTD was conceived , implemented , and marketed with the intentions of drawing people into the MSIA cult , " wrote one member of the popular productivity forum , 43 folders.com , " how do we , as conscientious individuals , avoid becoming prey within the trap ? "
Allen explains that while he wo n't hide his beliefs , he does n't want his personal faith confused with the message he has for people today .
" The Marriott family supports the Mormon Church , " he points out , but nobody refuses to sleep in their hotels .
Of course , a hotel is not an installed thought process , which is the way Allen describes GTD .
Given that users of his system entwine GTD with their daily habits , it 's only natural that they would wonder about its antecedents .
GTD is pitched to rationalists .
Such people tend to be cautious when considering schemes to change their life .
But in truth , Allen is not running a cult - recruitment program , nor is he merely putting a secular gloss on New Age tradition .
He is reworking this tradition , increasing its utility as he narrows its scope .
In Getting Things Done , the overreaching claims of cultlike programs disappear , leaving mainly the ingenious mental tricks .
In many branches of the New Age and human potential movements , for instance , students are taught to relieve themselves of unwelcome thoughts .
In Werner Erhard 's est and in its descendant , Landmark Forum , mental noise is " a racket . "
Scientology says that the static in our heads is caused by " engrams . "
In GTD the problem is stuff .
At his seminar , Allen asks the audience to try to capture all their stuff by writing a list , and at the end of a few minutes he tells us to look at the list and think about the way it makes us feel .
He guesses that our feelings include a mixture of grief and relief .
The relief , he suggests , comes from the simple fact of making the list .
But where does the grief come from ?
" These items represent agreements you have n't kept with yourself , " Allen says .
" What happens when you break an agreement with yourself is that your self - esteem plummets . "
Allen recommends that we take regular comprehensive inventory of our intentions , which he calls open loops .
Any open loop requiring more than one action is a project , and projects , naturally , go on a list .
The project list is not a reminder of values or deeply held beliefs .
Rather , it is an exhaustive external repository meant to capture every single thing that you may want to do .
The project list must contain everything , otherwise unlisted items will return to our minds at unwelcome moments and cause suffering .
A New Age cliché holds that every intention generates a chain of spiritual effects we ignore at our peril .
This is karma .
In GTD , karma makes the last stage of its journey from a Hindu theory of cosmic justice to a rational tool in the American self - help kit .
Karma is now just an open loop .
One of the very best tricks
Allen recommends involves reworking one of the New Age movement 's most dubious ideas : the theory we can control destiny with our mind .
From Phineas Quimby , the 19th - century mind - cure doctor , down through a powerful line of magical optimists including Mary Baker Eddy , Norman Vincent Peale , and the producers of The Secret , an inflated sense of the power of thought is characteristic .
Werner Erhard 's followers would tell people at est seminars that they had thought themselves into cancer .
Allen 's practical suggestions on how to turn thoughts into reality sharply distinguish him from his predecessors .
His advice is so simple as to appear simpleminded .
He insists that nothing should ever appear on a to - do list that is not a specific , concrete action expressed at the most practical level of detail .
Do not write " set up a meeting , " for instance .
Instead , write " call to set up a meeting . "
" If you just say you are going to set up the meeting , " he says , " then that leaves a question open :
How are you going to do it ?
Are you going to call ?
Are you going to email ?
It 's like having a monkey on your back that wo n't shut up . "
Allen 's voice shifts into a more taunting register .
" How are you going to do it ?
How are you going to do it ?
Somebody shut up the monkey ! "
The difference between issuing an invitation by email and issuing it over the phone seems perversely minuscule .
But in practice , as Allen points out , the question of how to communicate is often freighted with unarticulated anxieties .
His mandate to resolve apparently trivial issues serves as a kind of research tool , bringing to light aspects of work that are otherwise felt only as vague concerns .
And when it is difficult to find a simple physical action that can advance a project , it is a sign that the project may be unrealistic or even impossible .
This is an excellent thing to know in advance .
Allen is careful to attribute credit for his focus on specific action to a business consultant he met in the early ' 80s named Dean Acheson ( no relation to President Truman 's secretary of state ) .
But the emphasis on gaining efficiency through precisely described actions has a legacy almost as long as positive thinking .
In 1906 , the same year the great Yogi Ramacharaka ( aka William Walker Atkinson ) published his seminal work of magical optimism , Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World , Frederick Winslow Taylor took over as president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers .
Taylor , whose book The Principles of Scientific Management introduced the concept of efficiency to a whole generation , was famous for using a stopwatch to time manufacturing tasks as a way of demonstrating how much more productive workers could be .
Workers hated Taylorism , especially when it was implemented through brutal piece - rates and a general reduction of wages .
But Taylor 's emphasis on breaking down everything into small steps , and his prediction that a choreography of work could lead to previously unimaginable efficiency , formed the basis of a hundred years of managerial high hopes .
One of Taylor 's most controversial proposals was that labor and analysis should be strictly divided .
The boss plans , and the hired man executes .
Workers who do n't need to think ahead can go faster , while observant managers benefit from unfettered clarity .
One way to understand Getting Things Done is to see it as Taylorism for knowledge workers , those poor — or privileged — souls who must handle both sides of this equation in the same consciousness .
The boss is nowhere in sight , and yet the demands never cease .
As ever - more complicated communication networks both extend our reach and hem us in , Allen 's strict routines supply exact instructions on how to manage ourselves .
Allen lives in a modest house on an acre of land in Ojai , California .
The oaks are very old , as is the giant Aleppo pine in his front yard .
There is a greenhouse for the orchids his wife , Kathryn , raises , and a shed for the bonsai trees Allen regularly kills while trying to master the craft .
He enjoys learning bonsai , because it takes years to fully understand the consequences of his actions , and this strikes him as salutary .
Now that his company , which handles trainings and a growing Web business , has grown to 32 employees and $ 6 million in annual revenue , he is constructing a building in downtown Ojai to house it .
His personal headquarters is still in the small guesthouse at the back of his property , with indoor - outdoor carpet on the floor , a plain desk in the entryway for an assistant , and a 100 - square - foot office where he works when not on the road .
A photograph of this office shows up in his presentations , where it illustrates the point that Getting Things Done is not about special equipment .
Almost everything in the room is ordinary .
There are six Herman Miller two - drawer filing cabinets , a low desk that takes up the better part of two walls , an inbox , a heavy - duty stapler , a to - read file , a laser printer , a scanner , and sound - recording equipment for the interviews he conducts by telephone and publishes on his Web site .
On this workday Allen is wearing jeans , a knit shirt , loafers , and a quilted vest .
Like other successful small proprietors , he has a custom license plate on his car that advertises his business .
It says GTD GUY .
Allen is grappling with all the normal challenges of a person who does not have a deep hierarchy above or below him , who is required to make countless small decisions , and who has limited ability to pass mundane tasks off to others .
He sets his own goals and uses his own methods to achieve them .
Allen 's list of open loops includes getting GTD adopted in schools , learning to type 80 words a minute , becoming better at small talk , and achieving a high net worth .
This ambitious mind - set , with its combination of boldness and conventionality , says something about where * Getting Things Done * is coming from , and to whom it is aimed .
The book is for people who are striving hard .
" The people who take to GTD are the most organized people , " Allen says , " but they self - assess as the least organized , because they are well - enough organized to know that they are fucking up . "
Allen would no more crowd his mental environment with unprocessed email in his inbox than he would go to bed in filthy clothes , or stop brushing his teeth .
" The scuzz factor gets too high , " he says .
Allen 's words , with their suggestion of personal shame , hint at something that goes beyond mere practicality .
They suggest an increase in the demands of civilization , a change in what sociologist Norbert Elias called our habitus , by which he meant our normal psychological organization , our comportment .
As these changes become the norm , they turn invisible .
It takes some effort to remember that a medieval nabob in fine clothes probably ate with his hands and blew his nose onto the floor , or that self - help authors of an earlier age had to point out that it was rude for dinner guests to spit unchewed food into their hands .
Today , we have different problems to work out .
Allen speculates it will soon be thought remarkable that civilized human beings once walked around with their brains polluted by stuff .
Among the normal array of equipment in Allen 's office , one item stands out .
It is an hourglass with two minutes of sand .
Any clock would serve equally well to mark the strict interval GTD gives us to process something the first time we handle it , but Allen 's hourglass is as much a talisman as a practical tool .
In a medieval painting , it would symbolize death .
Here , the hourglass is a symbol of virtue .
It regulates our attention .
It guards our self - esteem .
The guru of Getting Things Done is living by the standards of the future , and his hourglass is an icon of an emerging civilization whose exacting demands we may all someday be expected to meet .
Contributing editor Gary Wolf ( gary@aether.com ) wrote about atheism in issue 14.11 .
Seriously .
That 's what Bush said today .
He wants to meet with Democrats to work out an agreement over the war funding , provided that the Democrats understand that this is n't a negotiation , that Bush is n't going to change his mind , and that the Democrats will have to accept Bush 's position 100 % .
Really , that 's what he said .
From AP ( since AP changed their story and made it more amenable to Bush , I 'm going to quote the original AP story that gives the actual facts of what Bush said ) :
President Bush on Tuesday invited Democrats to discuss their standoff over a war - spending bill , but he made clear he would not change his position opposing troop withdrawals .
The White House bluntly said the meeting would not be a negotiation .
" At this meeting , the leaders in Congress can report on progress on getting an emergency spending bill to my desk , " Bush said .
" We can discuss the way forward on a bill that is a clean bill , a bill that funds our troops without artificial timetables for withdrawal and without handcuffing our generals on the ground .
I 'm hopeful we 'll see some results soon from the Congress . "
In other words , Bush wants Dems to report on the progress they 've made in caving on their position and agreeing to Bush's .
Real piece of work , that guy .
Oh , and you 'll be glad to know that Bush got a " boost " today , at least according to AP , because our puppet in Iraq has now said that they do n't need a timetable for US withdrawal to make them stand up and defend their own country rather than having our young men and women die for them .
Uh huh .
Kind of like asking a child if he needs rules - oh no , no rules needed , mom , you can trust me , just keep giving me that unlimited credit card and the key to the cars .
For AP to call this a " boost " is beyond absurd .
THE US went to war in Iraq motivated largely by oil , former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan says in a memoir to be released today .
" I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil , " he writes .
Mr Greenspan 's book The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World also criticises President George Bush for not responsibly handling the nation 's spending and racking up big budget deficits .
Is there really any choice at all but to impeach this joke of an Attorney General ?
Spencer Ackerman has this exclusive from former Sen .
Tom Daschle , one of the Gang of Eight who supposedly forced Gonzales 's infamous hospital visit to Ashcroft :
Tom Daschle , the former Senate Democratic leader who received briefings on the Bush administration 's warrantless surveillance programs , says Alberto Gonzales is n't telling the truth about what Senate and House leaders were told in March 2004 about the program 's utility and legality ....
" I have no recollection of such a meeting and believe that it did n't occur .
I am quite certain that at no time did we encourage the AG or anyone else to take such actions .
This appears to be another attempt to rewrite history just as they have attempted to do with the war resolution . "
Daschle 's statement bolsters one that his former Gang of Eight colleague , Senate intelligence committee chairman Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , gave to Dan Eggen of the Washington Post : Gonzales is " once again is making something up to protect himself , " Rockefeller said .
He lies with apparently no sense of remorse every damned time he appears before Congress .
Just to preserve their own sense of self - respect , you 'd think Congress would want to impeach the SOB .
Update :
Make that three members of the Gang of Eight who say Gonzales is lying :
Update : Based on user ’s feedback , we noticed that the 6V battery hack ( with video below ) is a hoax .
The 12 V battery hack with the link below is possible though .
Please accept our apologies .
We previously posted a video that showed how to turn a 12 v battery into eight small 1.5 v to power up small electronics ( here ) .
Todayâ€™s cool video shows quickly how to hack a 6 volt lantern battery to 32 AA sized ones .
Since AA batteries are so popular , this simple trick can easily help you save hundreds of dollars a year .
The reason is that the approximate price of a 6 v lantern battery is only $ 5 .
There is an additional video on Youtube demonstrating that this may not work with every lantern battery ( here ) .
If you know how to determine which batteries the video below is for , please let everyone know within the comments .

A perennial question on this site ’s popular Ask the Ranger facility is “ Where do spiders go in the winter ? ” ( So much so that the answer is given on the same page and can be found here ) .
At this time of the year , however , more direct approaches to The Ranger are common , as spiders start appearing indoors all over the place and startled home - owners seek advice from their nearest spider enthusiast .
So The Ranger was prepared when Naturenet designer Cat posed the question “ Where do spiders come from in the autumn ? ” , or , more specifically , why is Cat ’s flat filling up with spiders ?
The spiders use Cat ’s bath more than she does !
On investigation it did indeed seem as though Cat ’s place was a great attraction for one of the largest spiders in the UK – Tegenaria gigantea .
In her bath was an impressive male spider ; and further searching , urged on from a distance by Cat , revealed two more similar males hiding in the kitchen sink .
These two seemed to have fallen out with each other , and despite having somewhere lost two legs each , were intent on combat .
Cunning use of a beaker and a postcard of Frankie Howerd
Using suitable equipment it is usually possible to capture even the largest specimen safely , and all three of the spiders were put in a plastic box safely .
But this still leaves some of those questions that The Ranger is often asked – and here come the answers .
Why do spiders come indoors in the autumn ?
Not surprisingly , most spiders do n’t like it in houses , as they are too dry and clean , with little food .
But there are also few predators , so a few species have got quite used to houses , and some live hardly anywhere else .
But in the autumn particularly , a range of species which normally stay outdoors start coming in .
That is why they suddenly seem to appear from nowhere .
The errant spiders are almost always males , who having reached maturity now set off in search of a female .
Most will remain outdoors , but as they are quite adventurous some will by random chance end up in your house .
Why do spiders like the bath ?
Well they do n’t particularly , but they ca n’t climb the sides .
They may fall in just by chance , or they might be attracted by the moisture , but generally once in they ca n’t get out .
This is especially true of large spiders which , unlike most small species , cannot walk up smooth surfaces , so that ’s why big spiders end up in the bottom of your bath .
Unable to run off and hide they are stuck there until you discover them .
It ’s often suggested that spiders come up the waste pipe – well , they might go down there but only if they have fallen into the bath in the first place , as they ca n’t swim up through the S - bend in your waste pipe any more than you can .
So if you take a bath often enough there should n’t be any spiders down the plughole .
If this still worries you just sluice the plughole out a few times , including the overflow .
Spiders have no magic survival abilities and water will wash them away just like anything else .
The easiest way to get them out of the bath is to drape a towel over the bath ’s side , with enough towelling inside the bath to enable the spider to climb out .
Then leave overnight .
This technique , although humane , is not universally popular amongst those afraid of spiders as , obviously enough , it will not necessarily get the spider out of your house .
How do I get rid of spiders in the house ?
Tricky .
They will probably just wander off again if you let them , and certainly by the time it gets at all cold most will be dead or dormant somewhere .
But you can always transfer them to the garden with the Frankie Howerd technique ( above ) or even a specialist tool like the Spider Catcher .
The Ranger has tried one of these out and it ’s actually pretty good – hard to harm the spider and ideal for even the squeamish .
There ’s no point in using pesticides – it wo n’t do you any good to have that stuff in your house and as the spiders are coming in from outside even if you kill them indoors they will come back pretty much straight away .
Better to keep your doors and windows shut , and get the cracks sealed up , then no more spiders can gain entry ( and your house will be warmer too ! ) .
So , what happened to Cat ’s three spiders in the plastic box ?
The video above shows a moment from the very prolonged tussle of the two lively six - legged protagonists .
Neither seemed likely to harm each other , and eventually The Ranger took pity and took them down the garden to release safely into the hedge .
No doubt he ’ll be doing the same for their progeny this time next year !
I 've known about this for two weeks , and have n't been able to tell anyone except the guys I was playing poker with when I got the news , but . . .
I 'm going to be on an episode of Family Guy !
ROCK !
I can't say much more than that until after we record on Thursday , and I find out exactly what I can and can't disclose , but I 've read the script , and I think it has the potential to be an episode that goes down as a classic .
Okay , one thing : I have a lot of scenes with Stewie .
The timing is perfect , too , because I 've spent so much time on Legion of Superheroes and other animated shows that I do n't feel intimidated or uncertain about whether I 'm up to the task or not .
I can't even describe how excited I am to do this , but it 's been one of my dreams for years .
In fact , I think I put it on a wishlist at one time .
I 'm going to go float around for a little while , now .
Professionally , I develop primarily in Ada .
When I do get a chance to program in C++ , I miss some of the features that Ada provides .
Ranged types is one of these features .
Ada allows the programmer to constrain a numerical type to a particular range .
Intermediate expression results are allowed to exceed the range , but an exception is raised if an attempt is made to assign an out - of - range value to a variable .
An exception is also raised if a result of an expression overflows the bounds of the ranged type 's base type .
This article details a class template I have created to implement a C++ type with similar behavior .
Design Goals
One requirement I have for the class is that it must be written in strictly conforming Standard C++.
This conflicts with the desire that the code be efficient as possible .
Checking for overflow in C++ without resorting to inline assembly can be expensive .
One of the reasons Ada has efficient ranged checked types is because these types are part of the language .
An Ada compiler can analyze the code and remove those checks that are unnecessary .
I decided to implement this behavior in my class using templates .
What is needed is a method to determine at compile - time if a given mathematical operation can overflow .
The possible occurrence of two conditions needs to be determined at compile - time .
These conditions are overflow and out - of - range .
Overflow occurs when the result of an operation exceeds the limits of the primitive used in defining the ranged type .
An out - of - range condition occurs when an attempt is made to assign a value to a variable that is outside the bounds of the variable 's defined range .
Method of Analysis
The simplest condition is out - of - range .
This is merely a matter of checking that the constructor is only called with values within the allowed range .
The bounds of the argument type dictate whether checks are made .
If either the upper or lower bound of the type is within the range , the check is removed .
For example , assume the range of type signed char is [ - 128 , 127 ] .
If a variable with a range of [ 0 , 65536 ] is constructed with a value of type signed char , only the lower bound would be checked .
Since the value cannot exceed the variable 's upper bound , the check can be removed .
The more thorny issue is how to determine if an overflow is possible .
Keeping track of the maximum range resulting from an operation is one possible way .
For example , if two variables of a type with the range [ - 100 , 100 ] are multiplied , then the resulting range is [ - 10000 , 10000 ] .
Any possibility of overflow may be determined by doing this for each sub-expression .
This is messy and overly complex , because it requires overflow checking when calculating each new range .
There is an easier way .
Instead of keeping track of maximum and minimum range values , the code keeps track of the maximum possible digits .
Ignoring the sign bit , a variable with the range [ - 100 , 100 ] will have a maximum of 7 binary digits .
The maximum resulting binary digits may be determined for every mathematical operation .
Multiplying two numbers , each with a maximum of 7 binary digits , creates a product with at most 14 binary digits .
So , for each sub - expression : 1 ) calculate the maximum digits required to hold the result , based on the maximum digits of each operand and the type of operation ; 2 ) locate a primitive type with the same signedness as the base type that will hold a value of at least the resulting number of digits ; 3 ) if the implementation has no such primitive type , flag the operation as having a possibility of overflowing ; 4 ) do the operation , checking for overflow if necessary .
Obviously , this method only works for integral types .
So , currently floating point types are not supported .

Telling girls that boys are better than they are at mathematics can irritate them so much that it negatively impacts their performance , according to a U.S. study .
Telling girls that boys are better than they are at mathematics can irritate them so much that it negatively impacts their performance , according to a U.S. study .
REUTERS / Shai Goller
Researchers from three U.S. universities found that the threat of stereotypes could create worries that undermined the women ’s short - term memory system needed for problem solving .
“ The women start worrying about screwing up which uses up important short term or working memory which could otherwise be used performing the task , ” said Sian Beilock , assistant professor in psychology at the University of Chicago and lead investigator in the study .
But the study also found that reminding girls of popular stereotypes , such as boys being better at math , did not just undermine performance in that topic , but in other areas too .
“ They get so concerned with the stereotype that this spills over into other tests , ” Beilock told Reuters .
“ Our work suggests that if a girl has a mathematics class first thing in the morning and experiences math - related worries in this class , these worries may carry implications for her performance in the class she attends next . ”
Researchers have been aware that stereotypes can undermine achievement in schools but little research had focused on the specific mental processes that prompt this response .
The research by Beilock and colleagues from the University of Miami and University of California was based on five studies involving about 200 college women who did well in mathematics .
Math was chosen as a topic because the representation of women in this discipline in low and the stereotypes common .
The women were randomly assigned to two groups , with one set told they were being tested to see why men generally do better on math than women , and the other group simply told they were part of an experiment on math performance .
The accuracy of women exposed to the stereotype was reduced from nearly 90 percent in a pretest to about 80 percent .
The women reported being distracted by thoughts such as : “ I thought about how boys are usually better than girls at math so I was trying harder not to make mistakes ” .
Among women not given the stereotype message , performance actually improved slightly .
After the math test , the women were also given a standard memory test involving verbal information and it was found that women exposed to the stereotyping also did less well there .
Beilock said reminding any social or cultural group of a stereotype can negatively affect performance .
“ This does not need to just be about women .
If you remind African Americans about stereotypes in racial differences this can have the same effect , ” she said .
The results of the study appear in the paper “ Stereotype Threat and Working Memory : Mechanisms , Alleviation , and Spill Over , ” in the Journal of Experimental Psychology : General .

pope air force base , n.c. --
In the early - morning hours of May 13 , 2006 , after a night of partying with fellow airmen who were mixing a potent cocktail called the Incredible Hulk , Airman 1st Class Cassandra Hernandez told authorities that three of them had raped her .
One of the men was charged .
After being questioned twice by the airman ’s military lawyer , Hernandez said , she felt “ enormous stress ” and decided not to testify .
“ The pressure of the judicial process was too much for me , and I felt like no one was looking out for my interests , ” Hernandez , a 20 - year - old Texan , wrote in a June letter to Texas Gov. Rick Perry .
What the Air Force did next , Hernandez and her military attorneys say , has a chilling effect on sexual assault victims :
The military dropped the rape prosecution and instead charged Hernandez with committing an indecent act .
The Air Force granted the three male airmen immunity for their testimony against her .

Court - martial proceedings against Hernandez are scheduled for Sept. 24 .
If convicted , she could get as long as a year behind bars , a reduction in rank and a bad - conduct discharge .
Her attorneys say she also could be required to register as a sex offender .
“ Will other women come forward after a rape when they hear that this is how they may be treated ? ”
Hernandez asked in her letter .
“ I am afraid they will not . ”
Capt .
Christopher A. Eason , one of Hernandez ’s attorneys , said : “ The system failed her at every level , and she is now being asked to pay the price . ”
Any service member who has been sexually assaulted , said Capt .
Omar S. Ashmawy , Hernandez ’s other attorney , must now wonder : “ Will the system do the right thing ?
Does the system even know the right thing to do ? ”

In a statement Thursday , the public affairs office at Pope Air Force Base said Hernandez had been treated fairly , with all legal procedures properly followed .
It said rape charges were dropped because of “ factual inconsistencies , ” as well as Hernandez ’s decision not to testify .
“ While there have been statements made that she is being prosecuted for refusing to testify , those statements are incorrect , ” the military said .
In response to an allegation by Hernandez , the statement said that there had been “ no effort to cover up any misconduct ” by the male airmen .
In sworn statements provided to The Times by the defense , the three airmen say Hernandez initiated the sexual encounters after baring her breasts and then removing her clothes following several hours of drinking .
The men were given nonjudicial punishments for committing indecent acts in the presence of other airmen , a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
All three received suspended reductions in rank , but the penalties will be lifted if there is no further misconduct .
One of the men was fined two months ’ pay ; a second lost two months ’ pay , but the penalty was suspended ; the third airman got 30 days of extra duties .
All three were ordered not to have contact with Hernandez .

Even though the three have been granted testimonial immunity , the Air Force ’s statement said , they still could be charged with crimes .
But prosecutors could not use their testimony or any evidence derived from it .
Ashmawy said that “ while not technically impossible , it is practically improbable to prosecute these men for rape now that the Air Force has immunized them . ”
According to Hernandez , several of the airmen she was drinking with at a base dormitory made sexual comments to her and one touched her buttocks .
Hernandez said she argued with the airman and left the party .
When she returned , she said , she was assaulted .
“ I remember very little about that night , but I do remember telling them no , ” she said .
“ I also remember crying and telling them to stop , but they did n’t listen ; one of them kept telling me to ‘ Shhh . ’ ”

Airman Russell Basile , who initially was charged with rape , said Hernandez “ without comment ” began performing oral sex on Airman 1st Class Jerrel Apache .
Minutes later , Basile said , “ I asked her if I could have sex with her . . . and she told me I could .
I had sex with her . ”
In his statement , Apache said Hernandez performed oral sex on him after helping him undress .
He said he had intercourse with her later after Basile and Airman Rotez Butler “ swapped back and forth having sex with her . ”
Butler said that as he was having sex with Hernandez , “ she just started crying . ”
He said he got dressed .
Hernandez , he said , “ put her clothes on , grabbed her cellphone and left .
She left her purse on the desk and her shoes in the room . ”
Basile said he saw Butler and Hernandez sitting on the floor .
When he asked her why she was crying , he said , she said “ something about her being a slut . ”

Hernandez , who was 19 at the time of the incident , also has been charged with underage drinking .
“ I drank underage that night , ” she said in her letter to Gov. Perry , a Republican .
“ It was wrong and it was stupid . . . .
But I never consented to sex with any of those men . ”
Defense lawyers point out that Hernandez has never changed her story , and that the military has not charged her with perjury or obstruction of justice .
Hernandez has said that she asked to have her military sexual assault victim advocate present during extensive interviews with Basile ’s attorney , but that her request was denied .
The advocate , Air Force Tech .
Sgt. James E. McDaniel , said in a statement that he was told by Basile ’s attorney that he was not permitted to attend because Hernandez was a potential witness .

After two days of questioning , McDaniel wrote , “ my client seemed very unsettled . . and very wore down both mentally and emotionally . ”
Air Force guidelines on sexual assault cases say advocates “ may accompany the victim , at the victim ’s request , during investigative interviews . ”
The policy cautions that the advocate could be called as a witness .
In a statement Thursday , defense attorneys said the Air Force statement that Hernandez ’s rights had been protected and all procedures properly followed was false .
They said “ important , relevant evidence ” was denied them during discovery and that Hernandez decided not to plead to the same indecent - act charge as the three airmen because “ she was told that she was considered guilty unless she proved herself innocent . ”

Under North Carolina law , Hernandez ’s attorneys said , state authorities could require anyone convicted of indecent acts to register as a sex offender .
The Pope Air Force Base statement said Pentagon policies require sex offender notification only in cases involving sex with minors , or sex acts involving violence .
“ Because this was a traumatic event for me , and I was severely intoxicated , my memory of the night is admittedly hazy at times , ” Hernandez wrote .
But she added , “ To be clear : I was raped by all three men . ”
In Hernandez ’s letter -- which also was sent to North Carolina Gov. Michael F. Easley , a Democrat , and members of the Texas and North Carolina congressional delegations -- she said she had been a good and faithful airman .
“ I am not putting myself through this process because I ’m seeking attention , ” she wrote .
“ I love the Air Force .
I want to remain in the Air Force .
However , the way I ’m being treated is wrong . ”

The problem is a basic lack of understanding of economics .
And The Economist is hardly the only culprit .
Wow , that ’s a shockingly foolish statement .
Each day approximately 84 million barrels of oil are extracted from the earth , and approximately the same amount is consumed .
It can be no other way : inventory space is limited , and could not be extended significantly by “ excess production ” or indeed drawn down for long by “ excess demand ” .
This is part one of a two part article on the economics of oil price demand .
The second part looks at the economics of peak oil , and how the oil fits into an overall energy demand curve .
Take the IEA ’s latest Oil Market report :
Global oil product demand is expected to rise by a robust 2.5 % to 88.2 mb/d in 2008 …
Non-OPEC supply in 2008 is forecast to reach 51.0 mb/d .
But of course , as any economist will tell you , there is no simple supply number and demand number : there is only a demand curve and a supply curve .
And the key to all of this is to understand that demand can never outstrip supply , there is never a supply “ gap ” , there is only the price at which the market clears .
Supply and Demand
The study of supply and demand inside a market is known as micro-economics .
( This differs from macro-economics , which is the study of inflation , unemployment , and the like . )
So , let us take a simplified market ; it has a demand curve that looks like this :
The x-axis is the price , and the y - axis is the demand .
There is an inverse correlation between price , and quantity demanded .
If we pretend this is the car market , then we see that at lower price levels , people who could n’t previously afford ( or justify ) cars can now buy them , and that some families which previously owned one car , will spend on a second .
Demand varies with price .
And the same is true of supply :
If the price rises , so will supply .
At first , this can be difficult to appreciate ; surely supply is a function of how many factories make cars ?
But supply is “ elastic ” , it does grow with price .
In the short - term , higher car prices encourage factories to run with two or three shifts and to pay over - time .
Longer - term , higher - prices will feed into firms ’ capital expenditure decisions : new machines will be bought .
Higher prices mean more supply .
Economists put these two curves together , the demand and the supply to understand a market :
The market price is the point at which demand meets supply .
That is , there is a price level where the level of demand is equal to the level of supply .
This point cannot be emphasized enough : the market will clear .
In any normal market , there cannot be enormous inventories of unsold products , or millions of people willing to pay the prevailing market price … yet unable to do so .
An excess of supply , or shortage thereof , is merely another way of saying that the clearing price is moving .
And markets will clear .
Oil Supply and Demand
The market for oil is unusual , because – in the short - term – both demand and supply are highly inelastic .
Irrespective of what petrol costs , your car cannot easily switch to another fuel .
Ships and aeroplanes cannot move from diesel oil and kerosene for their propulsion .
If it ’s freezing cold , and you need to heat your house , the only option may be to pay more for heating oil .
Likewise , if the price of petrol was to halve , you would not drive twice as far , or turn the thermostat up from 22 to 44 .
The result is that the short - term demand curve looks like this :
In other words , a large change in price only has a small impact on demand .
Supply of conventional oil is also relatively inelastic , although for a different reason .
The actual cost of pumping a marginal barrel of oil is relatively low , once the capital expenses of prospecting and building an oil rig ( and associated infrastructure ) has been put in place .
An oilfield will cost roughly the same to operate whether it is producing at 50 % of capacity or at full capacity .
Given this , once you have an oil field in place , producers will tend to pump at their maximum sustainable rate .
Of course , there is always some flexibility : old wells can be “ uncapped ” , scheduled maintenance can be postponed , and greater concentrations of gas can be pumped into the well .
But these have costs , and oilfield owners are loath to do these , unless the price of oil is high enough to justify it .
The result of this is that the oil market is one where small changes to the supply or demand curve cause large changes to the clearing price .
The Oil Shocks of the 1970s
This model can be applied to the oil price shocks of the 1973 .
Following US support for Israel in the Yom Kippur war , the newly founded OPEC announced it would stop selling oil to the US , and would restrict its overall oil output .
Because OPEC supplied so much of the world ’s oil , this had the effect of changing the shape of the supply curve .
In other words , for any given price level , there would be less oil supplied :
As can be seen from the chart above , this restricting of supply caused the blue supply curve to move to the left , and – as the market must clear – the price rocketed .
Dropping out of theory and into practice , we see that this is exactly what did happen .
The price of Saudi Light oil jumped from under $ 3 a barrel in 1971 to almost $ 40 by 1980 .
Other Short - Term Changes to Supply and Demand Curves
It is not only sellers ’ cartels that affect the oil price .
When Hurricane Katrina knocked out production in the Gulf of Mexico it had a similar effect : the supply curve was shifted to the left and prices rose .
The rise of emerging markets has also changed the supply and demand dynamics .
As China , India and the like industrialize , and their emergent middle classes buy cars , then the demand curve moves to the right .
For any given level of price , more oil is demanded .
As the chart below shows , this has exactly the same impact on the clearing price of oil as does reducing supply : the price moves , and sharply .
Long -term Supply and Demand Dynamics
But this analysis misses one key point .
Oil demand and supply may be inelastic in the short - term , but in the long - term , they are remarkably elastic .
Hurricane Katrina does not cause a long - term change in consumer behaviour ; but if long - term expectations for oil prices rise , then both the demand and supply curves will shift .
Nowhere is this clearer than in the study of the results of the 1970s oil shocks .
In the US the government responded by introducing a 56 mph national speed limit , and mandating strict new efficieny standards .
In 1975 , the average American new car had 136 horsepower under its hood ; by 1982 , that number had fallen to under 100 .
Consumers shifted to more fuel efficient cars ( a boon for Japanese makers , and a bane for Detroit ) , and the demand curve moved to the left .
Similarly , electricity generators chose to build nuclear or coal - fired power stations rather than oil - fired ones .
EDF , France ’s national generator , now supplies the vast majority of its electricity from nuclear power stations .
In the three years following the first oil shock in 1973 , oil consumption continued to rise – despite soaring prices .
Yet from a peak in 1976 , consumption began to fall , dropping eventually 15 % from its highs .
And , again , consumption continued falling for three years , even after oil prices peaked in 1980 and after the world economy began recovering .
Moves towards energy efficiency and towards alternative power sources are slow to ramp up , but their effect on the demand curve cannot be over - stated .
Rising prices had another effect in the 1970s , they spurred investment in exploration and production in areas that had previously not been cost efficient .
Building rigs in the hostile waters of the North Sea , or in the wilds of Alaska , made little sense while Saudi crude was available for $ 3 a barrel .
But if the Saudi ’s oil was restricted , and the price had shot up north of $ 30 , then a lot of new oil suddenly became competitive .
And because the key expenses are upfront – building the infrastructure in the first place – then once the new oil came on stream then it was unlikely to be removed , irrespective of the price of oil .
The oil supply curve moved to the right .
The impact of a supply curve that moved right ( more supply at any given price ) , and a demand curve that moved left ( less demand at any given price ) was a collapse in the market clearing price .
By 1985 , the oil price had fallen back to $ 10 .
On an inflation - adjusted basis , oil was as cheap as it had been before the 1973 oil shock .
The lesson here is simple : there is no “ over ” or “ under ” supply , there is only the price at which the market clears .
And over the long - term , high oil prices will tend to encourage consumers to either reduce energy consumption or shift to other forms of energy .
Similarly , investment in either inhospitable areas or in developing technologies will result in greater quantities of oil or synthetic crude coming on to the market .
Each boom in the oil price sows the seeds of its own destruction .
The DVLA said the plates were changed to avoid offence
The plate had been due to follow on from the SN56 registration in March .
Licensing officials at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) changed the plate to TN07 to avoid it being similar to the word " snot " .
The change means that cars registered in the capital are the only ones in Scotland not to begin with an S .
A DVLA spokesperson said the decision to change the plates was taken to avoid offending car buyers in the capital .
She added : " It is our policy that any registration mark that can be construed as being offensive to people will be suppressed .
" In this case , the SN07 marks would have been too similar to the word ' snot ' and , as that could possibly offend some buyers , they were replaced with new TN07 registrations . "
Naïve Americans who think they live in a free society should watch the videos filmed by students at a John Kerry speech Sept. 17 , Constitution Day , at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
At the conclusion of Kerry ’s speech , Andrew Meyer , a 21 - year - old journalism student , was selected by Sen .
Kerry to ask a question .
Meyer held up a copy of BBC investigative reporter Greg Palast ’s book Armed Madhouse and asked if Kerry was aware that Palast ’s investigations determined that Kerry had actually won the election .
Why , Meyer asked , had Kerry conceded the election so quickly when there were so many obvious examples of vote fraud ?
Why , Meyer went on to ask , was Kerry refusing to consider Bush ’s impeachment when Bush was about to initiate another act of military aggression , this time against Iran ?
At this point the public ’s protectors  the police  decided that Meyer had said too much .
They grabbed Meyer and began dragging him off .
Meyer said repeatedly " I have done nothing wrong , " which under our laws he had not .
He threatened no one and assaulted no one .
But the police decided that Meyer , an American citizen , had no right to free speech and no constitutional protection .
They threw him to the floor and Tasered him right in front of Kerry and the large student audience , who captured on video the unquestionable act of police brutality .
Meyer was carted off and jailed on a phony charge of " disrupting a public event . "
Part 1 :
Part 2 :
The question we should all ask is why did a United States senator just stand there while Gestapo goons violated the constitutional rights of a student participating in a public event , brutalized him in full view of everyone , and then took him off to jail on phony charges ?
Kerry ’s meekness not only in the face of electoral fraud , not only in the face of Bush ’s wars that are crimes under the Nuremberg standard , but also in the face of police goons trampling the constitutional rights of American citizens makes it completely clear that he was not fit to be president , and he is not fit to be a U.S. senator .
Usually when police violate constitutional rights and commit acts of police brutality they do it when they believe no one is watching , not in front of a large audience .
Clearly , the police have become more audacious in their abuse of rights and citizens .
What explains the new fearlessness of police to violate rights and brutalize citizens without cause ?
The answer is that police , most of whom have authoritarian personalities , have seen that constitutional rights are no longer protected .
President Bush does not protect our constitutional rights .
Neither does Vice President Cheney , nor the attorney general , nor the U.S. Congress .
Just as Kerry allowed Meyer ’s rights to be Tasered out of him , Congress has enabled Bush to strip people , including American citizens , of constitutional protection and incarcerate them without presenting evidence .
How long before Kerry himself or some other senator will be dragged from his podium and Tasered ?
The Bush Republicans with complicit Democrats have essentially brought government accountability to an end in the U.S. The U.S. government has 80,000 people , including ordinary American citizens , on its " no - fly list . "
No one knows why they are on the list , and no one on the list can find out how to get off it .
An unaccountable act by the Bush administration put them there .
Airport security harasses and abuses people who do not fit any known definition of terrorist .
Nalini Ghuman , a British - born citizen and music professor at Mills College in California , was met on her return from a trip to England by armed guards at the airplane door and escorted away .
A Gestapo goon squad tore up her U.S. visa , defaced her British passport , body - searched her , and told her she could leave immediately for England or be sent to a detention center .
Professor Ghuman , an Oxford University graduate with a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley , says she feels like the character in Kafka ’s book The Trial .
" I do n’t know why it ’s happened , what I ’m accused of .
There ’s no opportunity to defend myself .
One is just completely powerless . "
Over one year later there is still no answer .
The Bush Republicans and their Democratic toadies have , in the name of " security , " made all of us powerless .
While Sen. John Kerry and his Democratic colleagues stand silently , the Bush administration has stolen our country from us and turned us into subjects .
Prison is something we all want to avoid , but the time may come when you have to spend some time there ( whether or not you are guilty ) .
This is a list of the top 10 things to remember if you find yourself in the big house .
If you follow these rules , you should manage to make your stay tolerable .
If you found this article through a search engine , I sincerely hope you are reading it out of curiosity and not necessity !
10 Do not get involved with punks
I am not talking about guys with spiked hair – I am talking about guys who become other guys ’ “ girlfriends ” – usually for protection .
While the short term benefits may be appealing ( protection from other prisoners ) , you can become a virtual slave , to be gambled or sold to other inmates and you will definitely be used and abused .
This also includes being taken under someone ’s wing – it will almost certainly lead to you being a victim of rape .
People who offer this kind of help are either looking for a punk , or are looking for someone to pimp out .
You should not associate with anyone involved with punks either .
Jealousy in prison can lead to murder .
9 Do not discuss your crime
Advertisement
This rule applies especially in cases of sexual crimes .
Prisoners doing time for these types of crimes are the biggest target for rape and brutality .
In fact , it is virtually guaranteed if the crime involves children .
If you are convicted of a child related crime , you should probably request protective custody from the outset – this will keep you out of the main body of the prison and will probably save your life .
8 Do not get involved in gambling
This is a sure way to end up dead .
This is a no win situation ; you either cannot afford to pay your gambling bills , or you win and make the wrong people very angry .
Avoid gambling like the plague in prison .
Prisoners will do anything to get what you owe them .
Having said that , it is wise to learn a few card games before you enter so you can pass the time playing friendly games .
7 Do not collaborate with the guards against other prisoners
You should never tell on your fellow prisoners – if it is found out you can enter a whole new world of pain .
Having said that , do n’t be disrespectful to the guards – they can help to make your time go easier .
6 Do not become indebted to anyone
When you first arrive , other prisoners will offer to lend you things until you get on your feet – cigarettes for example .
They will offer you a pack in exchange for two later .
Absolutely do not accept this offer , it is a very common trick to get you indebted to someone .
If you smoke – quit .
You should wait until you have earnt your own money before buying things .
Basically , the rule is : NEVER take anything from anyone in prison .
This is going to get you killed or seriously hurt .
5 Do n’t stare at another prisoner
Always walk with your head facing forwards .
All it can take is a stare that lasts one second too long for you to become the target of violence .
A guy might appear to be friendly or placid one minute , but the next he can be your worst enemy .
4 Do not use drugs
Drug use is a guaranteed road to trouble .
You will become severely indebted if you become addicted and you run the risk of being caught by the guards .
Drugs are readily accessible and while they may make your time seem less painful , they will almost certainly lead you into big trouble .

3 Work out
Working out not only helps to pass the time , it also helps to to bulk you up – making you less of a target .
You should not appear weak – this means walking with your head up – do not look at your feet while you walk .
Avoid the temptation to get a tattoo – they often lead to diseases like hepatitis .
You will also regret it once you are out .
2 Keep your mouth shut
Do not tell other prisoners about your private life .
Do not discuss your crimes and do not discuss politics or religion .
Any type of discussion that can lead to an argument is a big no no .
Do n’t put your business out onto the street .
At the same time , respect other prisoner ’s privacy and do n’t pry into their private lives .
1 Be respectful and polite
Always be polite and respectful to other prisoners .
Respect is the only thing a prisoner has and taking that away can be disastrous .
Remember , if you give others your respect , they will most likely return the favour .
You do not want to make enemies in prison .
Finally , remember , being in prison is like being at war – so it is better not to commit a crime in the first place .
Democrats and Republicans alike are adept at making decisions without letting the facts get in the way , a new study shows .
And they get quite a rush from ignoring information that 's contrary to their point of view .
Researchers asked staunch party members from both sides to evaluate information that threatened their preferred candidate prior to the 2004 Presidential election .
The subjects ' brains were monitored while they pondered .
The results were announced today .
" We did not see any increased activation of the parts of the brain normally engaged during reasoning , " said Drew Westen , director of clinical psychology at Emory University .
" What we saw instead was a network of emotion circuits lighting up , including circuits hypothesized to be involved in regulating emotion , and circuits known to be involved in resolving conflicts . "
Bias on both sides
The test subjects on both sides of the political aisle reached totally biased conclusions by ignoring information that could not rationally be discounted , Westen and his colleagues say .
Then , with their minds made up , brain activity ceased in the areas that deal with negative emotions such as disgust .
But activity spiked in the circuits involved in reward , a response similar to what addicts experience when they get a fix , Westen explained .
The study points to a total lack of reason in political decision - making .
" None of the circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particularly engaged , " Westen said .
" Essentially , it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want , and then they get massively reinforced for it , with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones . "
Notably absent were any increases in activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain most associated with reasoning .
The tests involved pairs of statements by the candidates , President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry , that clearly contradicted each other .
The test subjects were asked to consider and rate the discrepancy .
Then they were presented with another statement that might explain away the contradiction .
The scenario was repeated several times for each candidate .
The brain imaging revealed a consistent pattern .
Both Republicans and Democrats consistently denied obvious contradictions for their own candidate but detected contradictions in the opposing candidate .
" The result is that partisan beliefs are calcified , and the person can learn very little from new data , " Westen said .
Vote for Tom Hanks
Other relatively neutral candidates were introduced into the mix , such as the actor Tom Hanks .
Importantly , both the Democrats and Republicans reacted to the contradictions of these characters in the same manner .
The findings could prove useful beyond the campaign trail .
" Everyone from executives and judges to scientists and politicians may reason to emotionally biased judgments when they have a vested interest in how to interpret ' the facts , ' " Westen said .
The researchers will present the findings Saturday at the Annual Conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology .

Omnia pro aegroto
4/10/2003 STATEMENT
BY CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL , M.D. ( R - TX ) , A LIFETIME AAPS MEMBER , ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO INTRODUCE HIS BILL , H.R. 1699 , THE " PATIENT PROTECTION ACT " TO REPEAL THE HIPAA PRIVACY REGULATIONS AND TO ABOLISH A NATIONAL PATIENT IDENTIFIER .
" Mr. Speaker , I rise to introduce the Patient Privacy Act .
This bill repeals the misnamed Medical Privacy regulation , which goes into effect on April 14 and actually destroys individual medical privacy .
The Patient Privacy
Act also repeals those sections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 authorizing the establishment of a ``standard unique health care identifier '' for all Americans , as well as prohibiting the use of federal funds to develop or implement a database containing personal health information .
Both of these threats to medical freedom grew out of the Clinton - era craze to nationalize as much of health care as politically possible .
" Establishment of a uniform medical identifier would allow federal bureaucrats to track every citizen 's medical history from cradle to grave .
Furthermore , as explained in more detail below , it is possible that every medical professional , hospital , and Health Maintenance Organization ( HMO ) in the country would be able to access an individual citizens ' record simply by entering the patient 's identifier into a health care database .
" The dangers to liberty inherent in the " uniform health identifier " are magnified by the so - called " medical privacy " regulation .
Many things in Washington are misnamed , however , this regulation may be the most blatant case of false advertising I have come across in all my years in Congress .
" Rather than protect an individual right to medical privacy , these regulations empower government officials to determine how much medical privacy an individual " needs . ''
This ``one - size - fits - all ' ' approach ignores the fact that different people may prefer different levels of privacy .
Certain individuals may be willing to exchange a great deal of their personal medical information in order to obtain certain benefits , such as lower - priced care or having information targeted to their medical needs sent to them in a timely manner .
Others may forgo those benefits in order to limit the number of people who have access to their medical history .
Federal bureaucrats cannot possibly know , much less meet , the optimal level of privacy for each individual .
In contrast , the free market allows individuals to obtain the level of privacy protection they desire .
" The so - called ``medical privacy ' ' regulations and uniform health identifier scheme not only reduce individuals ' ability to determine who has access to their personal medical information , but actually threaten medical privacy and constitutionally - protected liberties .
For example , these regulations allow law enforcement and other government officials ' access to a citizen 's private medical record without having to obtain a search warrant .
" Allowing government officials to access a private person 's medical records without a warrant is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which protects American citizens from warrantless searches by government officials .
The requirement that law enforcement officials obtain a warrant from a judge before searching private documents is one of the fundamental protections against abuse of the government 's power to seize an individual 's private documents .
While the Fourth Amendment has been interpreted to allow warrantless searches in emergency situations , it is hard to conceive of a situation where law enforcement officials would be unable to obtain a warrant before electronic medical records would be destroyed .
" Mr. Speaker , these regulations also require health care providers to give medical records to the federal government for inclusion in a federal health care data system .
Such a system would contain all citizens ' personal health care information , accessible to anyone who knows the individual 's " unique health identifier . "
History shows that when the government collects this type of personal information , the inevitable result is the abuse of citizens ' privacy and liberty by unscrupulous government officials .
The only fail - safe privacy protection is for the government not to collect and store this type of personal information . "
In addition to law enforcement , these so - called ``privacy protection '' regulations create a privileged class of people with a federally - guaranteed right to see an individual 's medical records without the individual 's consent .
My medical office recently received a Model " Privacy Act Compliance " form .
This three - page form lists over 20 situations where medical information may be disclosed without individual consent .
Medical information may be disclosed to attorneys , business associates of the provider , and federal agencies conducting " health oversight activities . "
Medical information may also be divulged without consent to insurance companies and medical researchers !
" Medical researchers claim to be able to protect the autonomy of their unwilling subjects , but the fact is that allowing third parties to use medical records for research purposes runs the risk of inadvertent identification of personal medical information .
I am aware of at least one incident where a man had his identity revealed when his medical records were used without his consent .
As a result , many people in his community discovered details of his medical history that he wished to keep private ! " Forcing individuals to divulge medical information without their consent also runs afoul of the Fifth Amendment 's prohibition on taking private property for public use without just compensation .
After all , people do have a legitimate property interest in their private information .
Therefore , restrictions on an individual 's ability to control the dissemination of their private information represents a massive regulatory taking .
The takings clause is designed to prevent this type of sacrifice of individual property rights for the ``greater good . ''
" In a free society such as the one envisioned by those who drafted the Constitution , the federal government should never force a citizen to divulge personal information to advance ``important social goals . ''
Rather , it should be up to the individuals , not the government , to determine what social goals are important enough to warrant allowing others access to their personal property , including their personal information .
To the extent these regulations sacrifice individual rights in the name of a bureaucratically determined ``common good , '' they are incompatible with a free society and a constitutional government .
" As an OB - GYN with more than 30 years experience in private practice , I am very concerned by the threat to medical practice posed by these privacy regulations and the unique health identifier scheme .
The confidential physician - patient relationship is the basis of good health care .
" Oftentimes , effective treatment depends on the patient 's ability to place absolute trust in his or her doctor .
The legal system has acknowledged the importance of maintaining physician - patient confidentiality by granting physicians a privilege not to divulge confidential patient information .
" I ask my colleagues to consider how comfortable you would be confiding an embarrassing physical or emotional problem to your physicians if you knew that any and all information given your doctor may be placed in a government database or seen by medical researchers , handed over to government agents without so much as a simple warrant or accessed by anyone who happens to know your " unique health identifier ? "
" By now it should be clear to every member of Congress that the American people do not want their health information recorded on a database , and they do not wish to be assigned a unique health identifier .
According to a survey by the respected Gallup Company , 91 percent of Americans oppose assigning Americans a ``unique health care identifier '' while 92 percent of the people oppose allowing government agencies the unrestrained power to view private medical records and 88 percent of Americans oppose placing private health care information in a national database .
Congress has acknowledge this public concern by including language forbidding the expenditure of funds to implement or develop a medical identifier in the federal budget for the past five fiscal years .
Rather than continuing to extend the prohibition on funding for another year , Congress should finally obey the wishes of the American people by repealing the authorization of the individual medical ID this year as well as repeal these dangerous medical privacy rules .
" Mr. Speaker , the misnamed medical privacy regulations and the scheme to assign all Americans a " unique health care identifier " violates the fourth and fifth amendments by allowing law enforcement officials and government favored special interests to seize medical records without an individual 's consent or a warrant .
Federal supervision of who can access medical records combined with a federally - assigned medical ID also facilitate the creation of a federal database containing the health care data of every American citizen .
These developments could undermine the doctor - patient relationship and thus worsen the health care of millions of Americans .
I , therefore , call on my colleagues to join me in repealing these threats to privacy and quality health care by cosponsoring the Patient Privacy Act . "

Someone named Eric Rauchway , of , is rather upset .
And CBS decided to reprint Rauchway ’s little complaint .
Rauchway appears to be one of those Left - wing Statists who ca n’t stomach the idea that anyone who might want to increase individual freedom is getting any positive publicity at all -- even if they are dead .
What has Rauchway so pissed is that the new edition of Barry Goldwater ’shad an afterward by Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. and that “ Goldwater gets glowing praise from Democrats Edward Kennedy and Hillary Clinton . ”
Rauchway whines about an “ unseemly outpouring of liberal affection for a right - wing icon ” .
Kennedy even had the audacity to “ declare Goldwater ‘ a man of principle . ’”
And no one , who is n’t a raving Leftist , can be a man of principle .
That a Kennedy wrote the afterword is actually fitting .
While Goldwater disagreed with JFK on many issues , he planned to run against the man .
But he had a great deal of respect for him .
And he and the President joked about traveling the country debating one another .
Goldwater was horrified when Kenendy was killed and disappointed that he had to run against Johnson , who he considered to be a scoundrel , with good reason .
Rauchway does n’t get Goldwater .
He also does n’t get the political spectrum .
He ’s still caught up the antiquated and deficient notion that there is Left and Right and they are the opposites of each other .
That idea was debunked decades ago but Rauchway was n’t told .
And that leads to Rauchway making juvenile accusations such as Goldwater “ standing well to the right of Adam Smith .
” The reality is that Mr. Smith was a liberal and so was Goldwater .
They were true liberals not socialists .
The founding giants of liberalism were advocates of limited government .
They all wanted to expand social , political and economic freedom .
The conservatives opposed that trend , they wanted to protect state power which was basically power for themselves .
They were the representatives of the status quo -- the advocates of conserving things precisely as they were .
Almost 90 years ago Oliver Brett wrote his masterpiece Iwhere he argues quite strongly that socialism is merely another form of conservative power .
During the founding of liberalism thesocialists were nothings .
They basically were n’t there .
The debate raged between the forces of liberalism and conservatism and in that battle Smith and a host of others like Cobden , Bright , Bastiat , Jefferson , Madison , Turgot , et. al. , were with the liberals .
Goldwater was in the same tradition .
But liberalism scared people .
The very idea of allowing people to be free scares the bejesus out of the conservatives .
But many people found the liberal goals of economic prosperity , equality of rights and so forth appealing .
Out of that was born a reactionary movement that attempted to blend conservative means with liberal goals -- socialism , or what today people like Rauchway erroneously call liberalism .
Rauchway is horrified that Goldwater actually wanted to limit the state , that he did n’t believe in government doing “ everything ” as the Prohibitionist / Socialist Francis Willard would put it .
So Rauchway laments that the evil Goldwater “ advocates ( sic ) cutting welfare , agriculture subsidies , and laws permitting unionizaiton . ”
Gee , Clinton cut welfare and the results were positive and remain so this many years down the road .
And God forbid we do n’t subsidize agribusiness and let corporate entities and relatively wealthy farmers live off the taxpayers .
Apparently Rauchway believes both rich and poor deserve a piece of the pie .
But the idea that Goldwater wanted to cut “ laws permitting unionization ” is dishonest .
Goldwater was a liberal and believed any individual had the right to join a union if they wished .
What he opposed was not laws permitting unions but laws forcing individuals to join them if they did n’t wish to do so .
He did n't think unions should be granted rights not afforded to everyone else .
Rauchway is apparently as confused about Goldwater ’s views as he is about the history of liberalism .
Rauchway then gets downright dishonest , more so than already apparent , and vicious .
He tries to distort Goldwater ’s view on federalism and convert it into racism .
He does acknowledge that “ pretty much everyone , including Martin Luther King Jr. , Roy Wilkins and Julian Bond is willing to concede that Goldwater was not personally bigoted . ”
But , he quotes someone claiming that “ Goldwater is merely a crowd pleaser . ”
He is saying that Goldwater took his views on federal versus state powers merely to please the crowd .
Apparently Rauchway is unwilling to see Goldwater as being nothing more than a typical politician who will say anything that is popular .
The problem is that any moron who has read anything about the 1964 election will know this is just so much bull .
Goldwater said precisely what he felt was right regardless of whether it pleased the crowds or not .
If he wanted to be a crowd pleaser he would have run on LBJ ’s platform not his own -- precisely what I think Rauchway would have preferred .
When Goldwater died thereferred to him as “ recklessly candid ” .
Apparently Goldwater mastered the art of being a recklessly candid crowd - pleaser .
Or maybe Mr. Rauchway is just engaging in a smear job ?
Rauchway goes even lower , he climbs into the mud and starts flinging it when he says : “ Apparently , whatever race - baiting Goldwater encouraged it was not sincere . ”
So not only was Goldwater merely a crowd - pleaser but he engaged in “ race - baiting ” to please the crowd even though he was not a racist .
In fact , Goldwater was a supporter of the NAACP and had been for years , he made sure the family business in Phoenix was desegregated in the 1930s .
And when he founded the Arizona Air National Guard he did so as an integrated organization .
And he did so two years before Truman integrated the US military .
Goldwater was desegregating when Democrats were still wearing sheets .
Rauchway ’s smear heavily depends on Goldwater ’s opposition to the Civil Rights of 1964 , which Goldwater felt went further than was Constitutionally allowed .
Rauchway ignores Goldwater ’s support of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 .
That would be inconvenient for the smear job .
Rauchway stretches even further .
Goldwater was a well known anti-Communist who said that the US should only “ engage the enemy at times and places , and with weapons , of our own choosing . ”
That statement is called , by Rauchway , a “ strategy of aggression ” .
Rauchway argues that opposing the idea of communism means “ you ’ve committed yourself to maintain a permanent war footing and a first - strike capacity anywhere at will ” and this means you have “ no kind of libertarian principles at all . ”
There is a reason Rauchway is n’t teaching logic .
Real liberals , and progressives alike , have many reasons to be glad for Goldwater .
He did hold forth to principles meant to limit state power .
He did think that the government was facing a conflict with the Soviets and needed to be prepared -- the Soviets thought the same thing .
I was never a hawk and thought the US exaggerated Soviet military might -- in part because the political Left was constantly lying about the power of the Soviet economy .
Goldwater ’s error was little different from the errors of Democrats like Truman and Kennedy .
Goldwater was often a prophet in the wilderness , especially within the Republican Party .
Long before the Left put out a slew of books on the dangers of the Religious Right , Goldwater was opposing them and warning people they were dangerous .
In 1989 he warned the Republican Party had been taken over by “ a bunch of kooks ” and said that ministers like Pat Robertson were trying to turn the Republican Party into a religious organization .
He once suggested that Christians “ kick Falwell right in the ass . ”
He told the Republican Right : “ Do not associate my name with anything you do .
You are extremists , and you ’ve hurt the Republican Party much more than the Democrats have . ”
( And that was well before King George besmirched the Party with his presence . )
Goldwater was always a supporter of choice when it came to abortion .
He also was a vocal supporter of allowing gays to serve openly in the military saying : “ Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of Julius Caesar . ”
Even today the Democratic top - contenders are shy about the topic .
Goldwater was donating money to Planned Parenthood long before Roe v. Wade .
He desegregated the family business and the Air National Guard while the Democrats were still wooing the Klan vote .
He endorsed measures to legalize medical marijuana .
Barry Goldwater has no reason to be ashamed , though Mr. Rauchway can’t say the same .

Found this Idaho poll via Think Progress .
It ’s not good for the senior Senator from Idaho ( who is not gay , btw , and never has been ) .
The headlines from the SurveyUSA poll show that an astounding 55 % of Idahoans already think Craig should resign .
And , Craig ’s disapproval is at 58 % — with a drop of 26 percentage points in his approval :
55 % in Idaho Say U.S. Senator Larry Craig Should Resign : Less than 36 hours after the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call first broke the story of Larry Craig ’s arrest in an airport bathroom , 89 % in Idaho are aware .
SurveyUSA interviewed 600 Idaho adults the evening of 8/28/07 to measure initial reaction , including 475 registered voters who have heard the news accounts .
Of Idaho voters , 55 % today say Craig should resign .
34 % say Craig should remain in office .
11 % are not sure .
Among Idaho Republicans , 45 % say Craig should resign , 42 % say Craig should remain in office .
Democrats and Independents overwhelmingly say Craig should resign .
There are many sides to a complex story , and as new facts come to light , opinions can be expected to change .
Job Approval for Craig down 26 Points to 34 % : Among all Idaho adults , 34 % today approve of Craig ’s Job Performance , 58 % disapprove .
When SurveyUSA last recorded Job Approval numbers for Craig and fellow U.S. Senator from Idaho Mike Crapo , in November 2006 , Craig had a 60 % Job Approval , 26 percentage points higher than his approval today .
Crapo had a 61 % Job Approval in November 2006 , identical to his Job Approval today .
Over 19 consecutive months of tracking Craig , his SurveyUSA Job Approval among Idaho Republicans ranged from 71 % to 82 % .
Today , among Idaho Republicans Craig ’s approval is 46 % .
Among Idaho Conservatives , Craig ’s Job Approval for 19 months ranged between 70 % and 80 % .
Today , among Conservatives , Craig ’s approval is at 51 % .
I ’m beginning to wonder if Larry Craig will even return to DC next week when the Senate reconvenes .
With these poll numbers and that debacle of a press conference yesterday , the odds are increasing that he ’ll just resign .
There ’s going to be enormous pressure from Republicans to get him out of office .
Maybe that will be Rove ’s last task before he leaves the Bush administration at the end of the month .
And as if on cue , CNN just reported that a Bush spokesperson said that the Bush administration is “ disappointed ” with Craig .
And , they think Craig and the Senate leaders need to address it .
Uh-huh .
McJoan at DailyKos , who is our favorite Idahoan and to whom we turn for Idaho political insight , had this to say about the implications of Craig leaving :
Before you scoff at the idea of an Idaho race being competitive , remember Larry Grant in ID - 01 in 2006 .
The Republicans and the Club for Growth were forced to spend hundreds of thousands to get that seat .
Freakin’ Dick Cheney actually had to come to the state to campaign for Sali .
Yes , Sali being the nominee helped the Dems , but it did n’t take long for the Republican establishment fully embrace his campaign to protect that seat .
A Senate seat is a taller order , but it still can be credibly challenged , even in Idaho .
The Republicans are going to have to compete to keep a Senate seat in Idaho .
They ’re going to have to work really hard for it .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In the end , it was Pascal Riché , a Paris - based former Washington correspondent for France ’s Libération newspaper , who uncovered a scandal at a top US television news network .
On September 7 , Pascal reported that an ABC counterterrorism consultant , Alexis Debat , had faked an interview with Sen.
Barack Obama that he published under his name in a French journal , Politique Internationale , and that he had published other alleged interviews in the same journal with Sen.
Hillary Clinton , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , former Microsoft chairman Bill Gates , and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
It turns out , ABC itself later reported , the interviews were apparently fabricated .
Riché also reported that Debat claimed to have a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne that he did not in fact complete , and that he had exaggerated his CV in other respects — claiming to be an advisor to the French Ministry of Defense on transatlantic issues , for instance , when in fact he had been a lowly desk clerk in the bowels of the ministry for less than a year ; claiming to be a visiting professor at Middlebury College , when in fact he had been a visiting instructor for a short winter term at Middlebury , and other such exaggerations .
Mother Jones has obtained an annotated CV the French Embassy prepared about Debat — whose claims to be a former government official have apparently long irritated the government in Paris — outlining these and other discrepancies .
( ABC believed the annotated CV was prepared by the French embassy , but sources now say it may have been annotated by a Washington - based French academic . )
Though Debat , often described in the American media as “ a former French defense official , ” insisted he would clear his name and sue Riché and his online magazine Rue89 for slander , the alleged fabricated interviews soon became a problem not just for Debat but for ABC .
Since 2002 , the network has employed Debat as a counterterrorism consultant and sometimes reporter , sending him to far - flung locations to report on Al Qaeda , Iraq , Iran , and Pakistan .
( For the past year and a half , Debat has also served as the director of the terrorism and national security program at the Nixon Center ; he resigned “ for personal reasons ” this week , an official with the Nixon Center said . )
Sources also say that Debat claimed in the spring to have received a “ large chunk of money ” from the Pentagon to conduct a study concerning radical Islam ; when I inquired about the contract , a Defense Department official said he would check into it .
Following Riché ’s report , ABC publicly announced that it had demanded Debat ’s resignation in June , after obtaining the annotated CV and investigating his claims to have a doctorate .
ABC said it had investigated his reports then , and was undertaking a more extensive investigation upon learning of the fabricated interviews at Politique Internationale , but that to date , it was confident that all of Debat ’s reports for ABC had been vetted and multiply sourced and were standing up to scrutiny .
Interviews with journalists , think tank associates , and a former government official indicate that there were warning signs about Debat for years — even within the network itself .
Two journalists familiar with Debat ’s work point to ABC chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross not only as the victim of Debat ’s alleged deceptions , but as an enabler , who has promoted sensational stories — including some that Debat brought the network — at the expense at times of rigorous journalism standards .
( Ross did not return Mother Jones ‘ phone call by press time , although an ABC executive has been in touch by phone and email . )
They also say that they do not believe ABC has properly investigated Debat ’s reporting at all .
The two key questions to ask ABC , one source familiar with Ross ’ unit who asked to speak on background , are : “ How is ABC investigating the information :
Is it only being investigated by the Ross unit , or are outside reporters doing it ?
And in vetting or second - sourcing information brought to the network [ by Debat ] , were resources outside of the Ross unit used ? ” Sources , and the AP reported late Thursday that ABC was sending long time Ross producer Rhonda Schwartz to Pakistan to investigate some of Debat ’s stories .
Overall , the picture of Debat that emerges from these interviews is of a smart , ambitious and cunning operator who would claim to be getting text messages from Middle Eastern intelligence operatives while at meetings with Ross and others at ABC , with tips that seemed too good to be true ( which some colleagues believe were bogus ) , yet were used as “ exclusives . ”
Sources provided multiple examples of stories that Ross — often with Debat ’s contributions — reported , only to be forced to run a correction the next day .
For instance , one source noted , on September 5 last year , Ross reported that a Pakistani general had said that Pakistan would leave Osama bin Laden alone as long as he did n’t cause any trouble .
The Pakistani government angrily denied it , and the next day the ABC investigative unit ’s blog , the Blotter ran a correction .
Another ABC news story largely sourced to Debat – claiming that the U.S. government was advising and encouraging an Iranian Baluchi separatist group Jundullah which was carrying out attacks against the Iranian regime – was followed by an ABC report the next day carrying a “ sharply - worded ” denunciation from the Pakistani government .
One ethical issue raised by ABC ’s handling of Debat concerns the investigative unit ’s use of paid sources / consultants , who are often put on monthly retainer .
But in ABC ’s use of Debat as a paid “ consultant ” who also had for the past year and a half an appointment at the Nixon Center , ABC also frequently had him reporting on its blog , the Blotter , and appearing as a “ source ” inside others ’ stories , blurring the line between source ( and a paid one at that , with outside — also paid — affiliations ) and a journalist , not clearly identified in the report .
ABC also sent Debat frequently abroad , to gather information which he would put on the air and on the investigative unit ’s website .
Network officials strongly deny that ABC has tried to sweep the Debat matter under the rug , and say they are taking the matter of investigating his stories very seriously .
“ We acted expeditiously to sever ties with Debat when we could not establish his credentials and we did immediately investigate his work , ” ABC senior vice president Jeffrey W. Schneider emailed me .
In fact , the French news service AFP reported as far back as 2002 that according to the French government , Debat had never been a defense ministry official .
“ Alexis Debat , presented by the American [ TV ] channel ABC as ‘ a former official at the French Defence Ministry ’ in the context of the case of [ Zacarias ] Moussaoui … ‘ has never belonged ’ to this
ministry , ” the AFP reported September 6 , 2002 .
According to the annotated Debat CV , he had at one time had a low - rank desk job at the Ministry for less than a year .
And overnight Friday , Riché had a new scoop : a whistleblower inside ABC had alerted the network to its Debat problem , first in complaints to editors , and later , with a memo .
“ The ABC news reporter tried to alert the management of her network that Alexis Debat was not reliable , ” Riché reported .
“ In an email she wrote last May to a researcher in a Washington think tank , she explained she had been ‘ quietly concerned ’ about Debat ’s work for ABC ‘ for some time . ' ”

To Whom it May Concern ,
I found out that my brother , Sergeant Ryan M. Campbell , was dead during a graduate seminar at Emory University on April 29 , 2004 .
Immediately after a uniformed officer knocked at my mother 's door to deliver the message that broke her heart , she called me on my cell phone .
She could say nothing but " He 's gone . "
I could say nothing but " No . "
Over and over again we chanted this refrain to each other over the phone as I made my way across the country to hold her as she wept .
I had made the very same trip in February , cutting classes to spend my brother 's two weeks ' leave from Baghdad with him .
Little did I know then that the next time I saw him would be at Arlington National Cemetery .
During those days in February , my brother shared with me his fear , his disillusionment , and his anger .
" We had all been led to believe that Iraq posed a serious threat to America as well as its surrounding nations , " he said .
" We invaded expecting to find weapons of mass destruction and a much more prepared and well - trained Republican Guard waiting for us .
It is now a year later , and alas , no weapons of mass destruction or any other real threat , for that matter . "
Ryan was scheduled to complete his one - year assignment to Iraq on April 25 .
But on April 11 , he emailed me to let me know not to expect him in Atlanta for a May visit , because his tour of duty had been involuntarily extended .
" Just do me one big favor , ok ? " he wrote .
" Do n't vote for Bush .
No .
Just do n't do it .
I would not be happy with you . "
Last night , I listened to George W. Bush 's live , televised speech at the Republican National Convention .
He spoke to me and my family when he announced , " I have met with parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag , and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved .
I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I am in their prayers and to offer encouragement to me .
Where does strength like that come from ?
How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride ?
It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good .
Because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost .
And in those military families , I have seen the character of a great nation : decent , and idealistic , and strong . "
This is my reply : Mr. President , I know that you probably still " do n't do body counts , " so you may not know that almost one thousand U.S. troops have died doing what you told them they had to do to protect America .
Ryan was Number 832 .
Liberty was , indeed , precious to the one I lost -- so precious that he would rather have gone to prison than back to Iraq in February .
Like you , I do n't know where the strength for " such pride " on the part of people " so burdened with sorrow " comes from ; maybe I spent it all holding my mother as she wept .
I last saw my loved one at the Kansas City airport , staring after me as I walked away .
I could see April 29 written on his sad , sand - chapped and sunburned face .
I could see that he desperately wanted to believe that if he died , it would be while " doing good , " as you put it .
He wanted us to be able to be proud of him .
Mr. President , you gave me and my mother a folded flag instead of the beautiful boy who called us " Moms " and " Brookster . "
But worse than that , you sold my little brother a bill of goods .
Not only did you cheat him of a long meaningful life , but you cheated him of a meaningful death .
You are in my prayers , Mr. President , because I think that you need them more than anyone on the face of the planet .
But you will never get my vote .
So to whom it may concern : Do n't vote for Bush .
No .
Just do n't do it .
I would not be happy with you .
Sincerely ,
Brooke M. Campbell

Kirksville , Missouri - A soldier from northeast Missouri was among eight killed April 29 , 2004 , in a car bombing in Iraq , the U.S. Department of Defense said Monday .
Sergeant Ryan M. Campbell , 25 , of Kirksville , was a member of the Army 's 4th Battalion , 27th Field Artillery Regiment , 1st Armored Division .
The soldiers were removing roadside bombs from a highway south of Baghdad .
Campbell 's mother , Mary Ann MacCombie of Kirksville , said the unit intercepted a station wagon crammed with 500 pounds of ammunition , and the driver detonated an explosive .
Campbell was stationed in Germany before he was sent to Iraq .
He originally had been expected to return to the United States in April , but his duty in Iraq was extended three months .
" He 's supposed to be home now , " said MacCombie , recalling that her son called twice Wednesday , a day before he died .
" His last words were , ' I 'll be back in July . ' "
Campbell joined the National Guard along with his best friend , Brendan McEvoy , several years ago .
The pair enlisted in the Army in February 2002 .
MacCombie said Campbell was an avid outdoorsman and a talented drummer who tried to assemble a band during his time in Germany .
He graduated from Truman State University in Kirksville and planned to attend graduate school after completing his military service .
A memorial service will be Friday at Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Kirksville .
A specific time has not been set .
Campbell will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery .
Other soldiers killed in the attack were
Staff Sergeant Esau G. Patterson Jr. , 25 , of Ridgeland , South Carolina
Staff Sergeant Jeffrey F. Dayton , 27 , of Caledonia , Mississippi
Specialist James L. Beckstrand , 27 , of Escondido , California
Specialist Justin B. Schmidt , 23 , of Bradenton , Florida
Private First Class Ryan E. Reed , 20 , of Colorado Springs , Colorado
Private First Class Norman Darling , 29 , of Middleboro , Massachusetts

" To whom it may concern , " usually accompanied by a shrug of the shoulders , was the way — through black humor — that infantrymen in Vietnam acknowledged among themselves that whether you live or die in war is most often just a matter of fate .
None of them , I believe , would agree that civilians in a combat zone should be subjected to the same unholy circumstance .
... Lest we forget George Bush 's 12,000 dead Iraqi civilians , none of whom , to my knowledge , had a gun or a reason to be murdered ...
Ms. Campbell 's letter , along with the photograph her brother wanted placed on his coffin , can be found here : http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/090604A.shtml

Please note that Ryan Montgomery Campbell is NOT riverrun 's brother .
He is ALL our brothers .
To the numerous noders who offered rr condolences , thank you and bless you .
I believe the whole point of posting Ms. Campbell 's letter here is that shock of recognition you felt when you read it .
It is my firm belief that war is serious business best not left to cowboys and corporations .
It is also my firm belief that in order to prosecute — as they say — this misbegotten war and the others that will surely follow on its heels , conscription WILL be reinstated , no matter who is elected in November .
The mechanism is already in place , the draft boards are staffed .
Registration continues apace .
The price we pay for American hubris is written in the blood of our brothers .
Until the 19th century and the beginning of the Women ’s Suffrage movement , traditional gender definitions prevailed .
But as women gradually claimed their share of political power , they were not content with the classic male - work - rational - strong vs. female - home - emotional - weak dichotomy that dominated — and of course they should n’t have been .
Men resisted the movement until they could do so no longer .
As women took steps to define their own gender roles , men missed the opportunity to do the same .
We were left with a confused , ragtag concept of what it means to be a man , defined not by ourselves , but rather by contrasting ideals from two sources — liberated women and posterity .
But most modern men defy these narrow stereotypes , taking pieces of each .
So without further ado , I now present to you ...
The Male Scale
1 : John Wayne
The cowboy .
Solitary , does n’t need anyone else , but everyone else needs him to save the day .
He is untethered by the world , an emotional Gibraltar .
Therein lies his power , and his doom .
2 : James Bond
Bond is …almost untrammeled .
As a spy , he is defined by his one “ weakness , ” a desire to save the women who he encounters , and not solely for the sex .
It is this chink in his armor , this mite of sensitivity in an environment where it could mean his death , that has made his image an echoing one .
3 : Hemingway
Hemingway would pretend to be Wayne , hunting and fishing and eschewing the women for the guys .
For Chrissake , he got a special dispensation to hunt U - Boats in the Caribbean during WWII , which really just was him and his buddies getting drunk in pleasant waters .
But his manliness , down to his nickname — Papa — was always a bit of trying too hard , always a dodge from the heavy emotions that consumed him .
His characters were constantly hurt and refused to show it .
He was the sensitive man who could n’t bear to think it , so tried to cover it up with obscene displays to the contrary .
4 : Jason Bourne
As we reach the middle of the scale , Bourne is a twist on Bond .
He has that something that many men crave , that surety that every other guy he sees , he can take in a fight .
But he ’s also a man in search of himself , haunted by his status as an assassin .
If you choose to see it that way , he represents a drive towards self - awareness that few action heroes attempt .
5 : Harry Potter
Harry is n’t the best wizard .
He ’s not the smartest .
But he is the bravest .
He alternates between brash actions that make you cheer cringe , and moments of self - doubt and emotional connection that , well , make you cheer and cringe .
He is motivated by the desire to protect , but also for love and family .
And , of course , he combats evil .
It ’s fitting , perhaps , that the balance is embodied in a child , who is less affected by the cultural ideas that can take root in the soul after so many years .
6 : Brad Pitt
Right , right .
We all know he plays a badass Irish boxer , a secret agent , and Tyler Durden .
But let 's not forget roles like Tristan in Legends of the Fall .
( Sure , Tristan was one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend , but the name also means " sad " ) .
And , since hooking up with Jolie , Pitt has actively been trying to change his image from sex symbol to humanitarian aid symbol .
That Vanity Fair cover he got so upset about was said by some to be working against this new image .
Obama is a sensitive voter ’s fantasy , hitting all the right notes of compassion and unity and hope .
He lets us fantasize about the possibility of a President who is n’t a 1 or a 2 like most of those we ’ve gotten over the years ( particularly from the Republican party ) .
Although he displays a strong chin , he is constantly criticized for his “ lack of experience , ” meaning his indecisiveness , lack of definitive policy , etc .
In effect , he ’s being criticized for not being more like Wayne or Bond .
8 : Anderson Cooper
The compassionate anchor .
Cooper vaunted into celebrity , of course , with his impassioned reporting from New Orleans during the Katrina disaster .
He attracts viewers who want something beyond that dispassionate traditional approach , an anchor with whom they can connect emotionally .
His stature , fine features , and blue blood are also not prototypically masculine , but are part of a package that a lot of people find appealing .
9 : Danny Tanner
On Full House , he was father and mother , teaching his children about emotions really more than anything else .
He was respectable , the kind of dad a lot of people would want .
Of course , that did n’t stop everyone from calling him gay to the point that Bob Saget wrote a hysterical song defending Tanner ’s heterosexuality .
10 : Mr. Sensitive
Just to get the point across , I ’m going with a caricature here .
In the certifiably crappy movie Bedazzled ( whose only redeeming feature was Liz Hurley in shifting , besequined outfits ) , Brendan Fraser for his wishes switches his personality around in an effort to win the heart of this one girl .
At one point , he wishes to be “ sensitive , ” which just means that he starts crying over crap like the flight of a bird .
The lesson I think we ’re supposed to take away : some , or even a lot of sensitivity is good , but for God ’s sake , be a man !
So now I ask you : is this scale accurate ?
Is it skewed in one direction or another ?
Where do prominent figures you know fall ?

業務の効率化についてはだいたいこんなことがいわれている：
業務の効率化は短期的には効率が落ちることが多い
業務の効率化は長期的な対策なしには実現できない
例えば、プログラマの作業環境を変更する場合。今まで慣れ親しんだ環境を大幅に変更されると、代替のシステムがどんなに便利であっても、ちょっとしたことですぐに作業の効率は落ちる。メモリの増設やディスプレイの追加や交換であれば、これといって問題はなく、むしろ助かったと感謝されるだろうが、バージョン管理システムの導入や夜間ビルド、自動テストなど、開発環境には欠かせないようなものであっても、慣れ親しんだ環境を捨ててそれまでの手順と異なる作業を強いることはプログラマの負担になる。
実体験を語るのはちょっと憚られるので、例えば、平均以上の技量を持つプログラマが、普段viでコードを書いているとしよう。仮名は丸山さんでいいや。28歳、独身。痩せ形で、これといって目立つところはないが、強いて特徴をあげるとすれば、どんな暑い日でもシルクハットとお揃いの黒いビロードのスーツ姿でしか人前に出てこないWilcomユーザ。そんな丸山さんに、チームでの作業には欠かせないからという理由でコードチェックやレポジトリへの自動コミットなどなどの機能がてんこもりになったEclipseに移行してもらうとする。発案したのは丸山さんの直属の上司にあたるSEで、丸山さんとはちょっと趣味やコミュニケーションの面では難しい関係にあると感じているが、時折砂漠でラクダと話しているような気分になることを除けば、丸山さんのことは好きだし、出来ることなら夜道を歩いても通報されないくらいの時間には家に帰してあげたいと思っている。
もちろん、そのための準備としてSEは業務の合間に徹夜で資料を作成し、効率化グラフなんかをでっち上げて作業を進める承認を貰ったり、上司に予算を確保してもらったり、プログラマへの説明資料を用意していた。これが調査を含めて実働でだいたい一週間くらいの作業だから、コストはその分のSEの単価と彼の寿命、上司のミーティングの時間分の単価、それから説明会に出席する丸山さんたちプログラマの一時間分の時給の合計だ。１００万には届かないが、数十万円にはなっている。哀れなSEの命はプライスレス。
説明会は順調で、丸山さんも見事な口髭に手をやりながら、遠くを見るような目でしっかり話を聞いてくれていた。SEも少しは自分が何か出来たような気がして満足した。これで明日ちょっとくらいは遅刻してもいいなら、もっと幸せなのに。ソフトウェアの導入は各プログラマが各々の環境に一時間ばかりかけてインストールする。ここでもちょっとコストがかかった。今日の作業に支障が出ないように、インストール作業は定時ちょっと前に始められ、完了したらみんな帰っていいことになっている。丸山さんはちょっと戸惑っているようだ。エディタが白い背景にカラフルな文字という組み合わせには耐えられないと、あれこれ設定をいじっている。明日からは人心一新、ジョエル・テストで３ポイントくらいアップした環境で作業を続けよう。SEは明日から業務の効率化の計測が始まるため、結局また準備で終電まで働いた。
プログラマとその作り出すプログラムのユーザに共通している点は、いくら説明を聴いてもマニュアルを読んでも、片っ端から忘れてしまうことなので、翌朝から現場にはちょっとした混乱が生じていた。説明会で話を聞いているときにはなんだかわかったような気がしたのに、いざ目の前のシステムを触る段になって、あれはどうするんだっけ、これはどうなってんだっけ、と迷ってしまう。他のプログラマたちがあくせくとマニュアルを読み返したりしている中、丸山さんはというと、独自のマクロやキーバインドが使えないので、どうにかならないかとやはりウェブや書籍とにらめっこしている。午後になっても今日のタスクに取りかかれていないらしい。やがて、諦めてようやく作業を始めるが、ため息をついたり、ティッシュを敷いてその上にコーヒーかすをもんじゃ焼きみたいに丸く集めたり、どうも集中出来ていないらしい。周囲のプログラマが徐々に作業のペースを取り戻す中、明らかに孤立してしまっている。
と、ここまで延々と書いてきて、そろそろ疲れたのでどこかの本からパクッてきたようなお話し口調を中断して、結末がどうなったかというと、だいたいこんな感じだ：丸山さんは、自分が不当な扱いを受けているような気がしてくる。他のメンバと比べても遜色ない実績をあげてきたのに、急に妙なルールを押し付けられて足を引っ張られたような気分だからだ。SEはなんとか彼を励まして、このシステムがいかに他のメンバに貢献するのか説得するが、そんなことはわかっているとしか返事をもらえないのでほとほと困り果てている。お気付きの方もいるだろうが、作業環境の変更の際、SEは自分のプランについて上司には承認をもらっているがプログラマである丸山さんには何の相談もしていないので、これはある意味当然の帰結だ。やがて、丸山さんも慣れてきて長期的な効率の向上には貢献出来るようになるのだが、なんとなく心の中に生じた嫌な感じは拭い切れない。そう、彼は上司であるSEに「恨み」の感情を持ってしまったのだ。
この「恨み」というやつは、人間のモチベーション管理の面で非常に大きな障害となるやっかいな代物だ。初めてこの「恨み」フィルタを通してで周囲を見てしまうと、周囲の人間がいかにロクでもない奴らで、自分はいったいどんなに哀れでちっぽけで無価値な存在なのだろうと思い込むようになる。不当な扱いを受けるのは、人間の合理性をなんとなく信じて生きているわれわれ人間にとって、それはそんな扱いを受けて当然のろくでなしだからだ、という結論に自然に到達するようになっている。たとえそうでないにしても、少なくとも自分以外の人間はそう思っているに違いない。だから、自分はこの職場にはフィットしない。よし、転職しよう。
こうして、丸山さんはたっぷりの有給休暇を使って、ちょっとした念願だったワードローブに立て篭って座禅を組む精神修行を始めてしまい、残されたプログラマやSEは掃除用モップをしゃぶって悲しんでいる。人が増えても業務は減らないが、人が減ると業務は確実に増えるからだ。
というわけで、悲哀の中間管理職としては、業務効率改善はいい加減には出来ないな、と思うと同時に、どうして俺はMacで仕事出来なくされてしまったんだろう、そして支給されたDELLのマシンのレジストリとやらが壊れて作成したドキュメントは消え去りディスクは認識されなくなり、再インストールとアップデートのやり直しで丸一日を無駄にして、結局最後は元のMacBookを引っ張りだしてEmobileで常時接続しながら、LANには入れない不便な環境でもなんとか仕事をやり終えて、家族にはどうせ夜中にエロサイトでも眺めて遊んでいるんだろうとそしられ、徹夜明けの朝に銀行で結んだローンの契約では最悪の選択をして、家族からは馬鹿にされ、再作成したドキュメントは間違いだらけで、心臓が涎を垂らして貧乏揺すりが止まらなくなるのでもうなんとかしてくれ。
Apple is sick and tired of people coming into their stores and hogging their computers for hours at a time while they waste time on MySpace .
Apparently people have taken to coming in , taking pictures of themselves with PhotoBooth ( the filters are so funny !!! ) , and uploading them to their profiles .
In response , MySpace is now blocked in all Apple stores .

Good riddance , I say .
I 'm sure the types of people who would dick around on MySpace for two hours in a store are n't the types of people who would actually , you know , buy anything , and Apple has no responsibility to provide free Web access to the general mouth - breathing population .
Just do n't block Gmail , OK guys ?
I 'll be quick , I promise .
Think Secret [ via Crave ]
Pat Tillman was slated to become an iconic figure , the purest representation of the New Bushian Man : a football hero who had refused a lucrative contract in order to enlist in the military , who could have had a life of riches and ease but chose , instead , to go to Afghanistan to take up arms against our enemies .
Most important of all , for propaganda purposes , he looked the part , almost as if he ’d been crafted to embody the virtues of a life in service to the Empire .
His enlistment provoked a personal letter from then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and his death provided the War Party with the opportunity to canonize him as a martyr to The Cause .
An elaborate narrative was conjured by administration spinmeisters in the wake of his death , valorizing him as an example to be followed .
There was just one problem : Tillman was n’t a gung - ho warmonger .
The San Francisco Chronicle reports :
" A side of Pat Tillman not widely known  a fiercely independent thinker who enlisted , fought , and died in service to his country yet was critical of President Bush and opposed the war in Iraq , where he served a tour of duty .
He was an avid reader whose interests ranged from history books to works of leftist Noam Chomsky , a favorite author . ”
Apparently a meeting between Tillman and Chomsky was planned for after Pat ’s return to the U.S. , but he never returned .
Instead , he was killed  under circumstances that Pat ’s mother , Mary , has always characterized as " murky , " at best , and that seem , to my eye , at least , suspicious at worst .
And it is n’t just me .
Now the release of thousands of pages of documents by the Pentagon , as the result of a Freedom of Information
Act request , raise even more questions about the circumstances surrounding Pat Tillman ’s death :
" Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman ’s forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player ’s death amounted to a crime , according to documents obtained by The Associated Press .
" ’ The medical evidence did not match up with the , with the scenario as described , ’ a doctor who examined Tillman ’s body after he was killed on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators .
" The doctors  whose names were blacked out  said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the Army Ranger was cut down by an M - 16 fired from a mere 10 yards or so away . "
This occurs after at least three investigations have supposedly been conducted , in which Tillman ’s death was attributed to " friendly fire , " adding to the strong suspicion that there ’s something they ’re not telling us  something they have been trying desperately to cover up .
" The Army used him , " says his mother .
" They knew right away he was killed by fratricide and [ they ] used him for their own purposes to promote the war , to get sympathy for the war , for five weeks . "
Mary Tillman has long suggested that her son was deliberately murdered by his fellow soldiers .
After initially dismissing her allegations as a case of grief - gone - over - the - edge , I ’ve come to believe that there is something awfully fishy about this whole incident .
After all , why were Army attorneys sending " congratulatory e- mails " to each other for fending off criminal investigators on the case ?
The general who kept the details of Tillman ’s death from the Tillman family and the public claimed that he was having a problem with his memory , and that ’s why he just could n’t recall any important details of how Tillman ’s death was handled .
Doctors who tried to reconcile the forensic evidence with the official account urged that a criminal investigation be pursued , but they were rebuffed .
What ’s really suspicious , however , is that evidence of enemy fire at the scene was singularly lacking : no one was hit by enemy fire , nor was any equipment damaged .
According to numerous reports , there were no Taliban in the area .
Now , I ’m not willing to go as far as this guy , but I have to wonder : what if that meeting with Chomsky had come off , as scheduled , and Tillman had arisen to become a vocal critic of the Iraq war  which he bitterly opposed  and had even become involved in politics ?
The War Party ’s own propagandistic creation would have turned against them  a form of " blowback " that would have had a devastating effect on the effort to shore up support for our crazed foreign policy .
Especially if Tillman teamed up with Democratic Party operatives , either to run for office himself or to endorse candidates opposed to the war .
The backtracking , the misinformation , the deliberate withholding of documents that required a FOIA request in the first place , and now the demotion of a general involved in the " investigation "  all point to a cover - up of massive proportions .
Tillman had been keeping a journal since the age of 16 , and he took it with him to Afghanistan .
Two days after his demise , the journal , along with most of his personal property , mysteriously vanished .
Adding another layer of murk , the White House is claiming " executive privilege " in refusing to release documents dealing with Tillman ’s death .
But who is being protected ?
First they told us Tillman was killed by hostile fire fighting for Bush ’s crusade to export " democracy " to Afghanistan .
Then they said he was felled by " friendly fire , " i.e. , by his own troops .
These new revelations suggest  although they do n’t conclusively prove  that this fire may not have been all that friendly .
What I want to know is this : how could someone who was apparently killed from 10 yards away  and was hit by three bullets in very close proximity
on the forehead  be a victim of " friendly fire " from 90 yards away , as claimed ?
All of which raises another , increasingly troubling question : Who killed Pat Tillman  and why ?

The Ten Plagues
The third installment of “ Do You Really Believe That ? ” will examine another famous story of the Old Testament , the ten plagues of Egypt .
As the Book of Exodus tells it , the Israelite prophet Moses was chosen by God to set his people free from their long slavery in Egypt .
But when the hard - hearted Pharaoh refused to release them , God sent ten plagues upon the land , each more terrible than the last , until the Egyptians ’ resistance finally crumbled .
These are the famous ten :
First plague : Water to blood .
“ And the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt . ” ( 7:21 )
Second plague : Frogs .
“ And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thine ovens , and into thy kneadingtroughs . ” ( 8:3 )
Third plague : Lice .
“ And they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt . ” ( 8:17 )
Fourth plague : Flies .
“ And there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants ’ houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies . ” ( 8:24 )
Fifth plague : Murrain ( death of cattle ) .
“ And all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one . ” ( 9:6 )
Sixth plague : Boils .
“ And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt . ” ( 9:9 )
Seventh plague : Hail .
“ And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field . ” ( 9:25 )
Eighth plague : Locusts .
“ For they covered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkened ; and they did eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left : and there remained not any green thing in the trees , or in the herbs of the field , through all the land of Egypt . ” ( 10:15 )
Ninth plague : Darkness .
“ And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days . ” ( 10:22 )
Tenth plague : Death of the firstborn .
“ And Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead . ” ( 12:30 )
The story of the ten plagues has been retold numerous times , including several successful cinematic dramatizations .
Some skeptics have even accepted that they happened literally as written and have sought to provide non-miraculous explanations .
However , there ’s a problem that the text and all its retellings never address :
What happened to Egypt after the Israelites left ?
The kingdom must have been in a disastrous state .
Between the hail and the locusts , all the trees had been smashed and all the crops eaten .
The rivers turning to blood had not only left the water undrinkable , but all the fish and other marine life dead .
The cattle and livestock were likewise dead of the murrain .
Whatever food had been stored must have been corrupted and made inedible by the swarms of flies and frogs .
The people were suffering from lice infestations and boils , and on top of that , an entire generation of children was dead , every house in Egypt mourning .
And on top of all this , the Israelites also plundered their former masters when they left , taking much clothing , silver and gold ( 12:35 ) .
The Pharaoh himself was dead , along with most of his army , drowned in the closing of the sea when they gave chase ( 14:28 ) .
And the slave labor that the Egyptian economy had depended on for centuries was suddenly gone , with nothing to replace them .
When all was said and done , the Egyptians had no ruler , no army , no money , no food , and no labor , and every family in the nation had been shattered by tragedy .
What would have happened ?
What could have happened ?
There would have been looting , violence , societal breakdown .
The kingdom should have dissolved into chaos and anarchy and either become a no - man ’s - land or been swallowed up by its neighbors .
Egyptian civilization should have taken centuries to reconstitute itself , if it ever did .
Such a collapse would be readily visible in the archaeological and historical record , and if such a thing had been found , it would have provided dramatic corroboration for the stories of the Bible .
But the record reveals nothing like this .
No such discontinuity is visible in ancient Egyptian history .
Worse , some Christian apologists have placed the exodus during the New Kingdom period – the historical height of Egypt ’s power and glory – without postulating any kind of societal impact .
It ’s as if they believe the shattered , ruined kingdom simply picked itself up and rebuilt within a few years , completely forgetting that any of this had ever happened .
To anyone who knows anything about human society , this is completely implausible .
After a catastrophe of this magnitude , no civilization could recover within such a short period , and especially not without leaving abundant evidence of its decline .
( Compare Hurricane Katrina today – the images of overwhelming crowds , of desperation to escape , of chaos among those who were trapped in the city , and a rebuilding that is still going on with painful slowness and unevenness . )
If the ten plagues had really happened , they should be an established , unquestionable historical fact .
But we have evidence of no such thing , and so I ask :
Do you really believe that ?

Using virtual - reality goggles , a camera and a stick , scientists have induced out - of - body experiences — the sensation of drifting outside of one ’s own body — in ordinary , healthy people , according to studies being published today in the journal Science .
When people gazed at an illusory image of themselves through the goggles and were prodded in just the right way with the stick , they felt as if they had left their bodies .
The research reveals that “ the sense of having a body , of being in a bodily self , ” is actually constructed from multiple sensory streams , said one expert on body and mind , Dr. Matthew M. Botvinick , an assistant professor of neuroscience at Princeton University .
Usually these sensory streams , which include vision , touch , balance and the sense of where one ’s body is positioned in space , work together seamlessly , Dr. Botvinick said .
But when the information coming from the sensory sources does not match up , the sense of being embodied as a whole comes apart .
US Republicans are none too pleased with Brit artist Jonathan Yeo , who 's just completed a fetching portrait of George Bush constructed from grumble mag clippings :
The work was unveiled yesterday at London 's Lazarides gallery , which explains the motivation behind the thought - provoking piece : " Yeo was commissioned to undertake a portrait of US President George W Bush , but was later told his services were not required .
He decided to continue the commission on his own ... "
According to the Sun , Republicans have reacted with predictable indignation .
A spokesman for Republicans Abroad International said : " This will cause outrage in America .
Some people will think it ’s funny - but personally I think it is a cheap stunt . "
A spokesman for the Texas tentacle of the Republican Party chipped in with : " This picture is very distasteful .
Why would anyone want to make a picture of our President from pornographic material ? "
The answer is , as Yeo explained at the meisterwork 's launch : " I did it for fun , not to offend , but I 'm pleased with it .
I did it to amuse . " ®
The Iraq War has been lost .
The British are acknowledging this fact by pulling out their troops from Basra , Iraqâ€ ™s second largest city , handing over the city to the control of Shia militias .
For all intents and purposes , the â€œCoalition of the Willingâ€ is now dead .
America is now going it alone .
Bush is not acknowledging defeat , but has indirectly admitted it by saying that some troops can start being brought home soon , even though clearly nothing has been accomplished with the addition of 30,000 troops for the last six months .
He acknowledged defeat too , by flying into Iraq stealthily in the dead of night this week , landing at a remote desert outpost in western Iraq , instead of going to Baghdad , and meeting with American military officials , instead of with the Iraqi government .
( So much for Iraqâ€ ™s being a â€œsovereign nationâ€  !
Can you imaging a head of state of some foreign government , together with his war secretary and his secretary of state , flying in unannounced to some remote American state , and not even meeting with American government officials ? )
Clearly the US military could not guarantee the presidentâ€™s safety in Baghdad and the Green Zone , so he had to go to a remote outpost where he was safe behind razor wire , mines and an obscene arsenal of soldiers , tanks and gunships .
With the British giving up on their quadrant of Iraqâ€ ” a strategically crucial location at the northern tip of the Persian Gulf , where the bulk of supplies for the US military in Iraq are offloaded , and from which the vast majority of Iraqâ€ ™s dismal oil experts are exportedâ€ ” American troops are stranded , and dependent upon air drops for their secure delivery of supplies .
Reports say that the real reason Bush is talking about troops coming home is because the military in Iraq is broken , and can no longer sustain a commitment of 160,000 soldiers and marines in the country .
There is no choice ; they have to start coming home .
As in Vietnam , where open mutiny and sullen disobedience became the norm after 1968 , in Iraq , the military is finally cracking .
Seven enlisted soldiers even dared to write an open and scathing critique of the war in an opinion piece in the New York Times , saying that the US was widely viewed as an occupation force in Iraq , and that Iraqis wanted us outâ € ” the sooner the better .
The organization Iraq Veterans Against the War is growing rapidly in membership .
The military has resorted to offering potential enlistees a whopping $ 20,000 bonus to go to boot camp immediately , because recruitment and reenlistment numbers for this year are so dismally low .
Junior officer resignations are at a record high .
As military family members are pointing out , the American military is no longer a volunteer force .
In name it may appear to be , but once stop - loss orders start routinely preventing troops from quitting the service , it is no longer volunteer , whatever it may be called .
People are being coerced into fighting .
And once you have a coerced army loyalty goes out the window .
While there is nothing to be done about the disaster in Iraq , which will go down in military history as one of the great defeats of all timeâ € ” the most powerful military the world has ever known beaten by a disorganized assortment of ill - trained and ill - equipped guerrilla fightersâ€ ” this is nonetheless a dangerous moment .
Wounded animals are dangerous animals , and President Bush and his gang of Neocon wackoes , badly wounded by defeat in Iraq , are not anxious to slither off the political stage as losers .
Hence the plans in the works to go double or nothing with an all - out aerial assault on Iran .
Numerous reports , including most credibly one in The Times in London ( owned by Rupert Murdochâ€™s News Corp. ) , suggest that a plan has already been laid out for a three - day massive bombardment on over 1200 targets in Iran , which would attempt to destroy not just that countryâ€™s nascent nuclear processing capability , but also its government , communications , and military facilities , essentially leaving the country of 70 million a smoking ruin .
Such an attack , with no international support , no UN sanction , no threat , imminent or otherwise , and no provocation , would be , pure and simple , a war crime of the first order .
It would also put the US at war , not just with Iran , but also with virtually the entire Islamic world .
The Neocon fantasy is that after such a blitzkrieg , Iranians would rise up and overthrow their leadersâ€ ” those leaders who survivedâ € ” but history has shown that in such times of national disaster , people donâ€™t turn on their leaders , but rather rally to them , however unpopular they may have been .
This is likely to be all the more true in the case of Iran , a country with a history going back as long as Chinaâ€™s with a strong sense of national identity , and a long recent history of feeling put upon by the U.S. ( America , after all , overthrew Iranâ €™s first democratic government in the 1950 in a CIA - inspired coup which set up the regime of the hated Shah Reza Palevi ) .
An Iran at war would be free to set its agents loose to attack American targets around the world , and inside the U.S. , and under the doctrine of reciprocity , would be justified in attacking anything in America that came under attack in Iran .
If we attacked Iranian nuclear facilities , they could attack American nuclear facilities , with all the concomitant resulting spread of radioactive materials .
If we attacked power plants or oil refineries , they would be free to do the same .
If we attacked radio and television stations , so could they .
To be sure , Iran would have to use guerrilla tactics in its attacks , where America would be using B - 1 and B - 2 bombers and ship - launched cruise missiles , but as has been observed , a terrorist or guerrilla is just a bomber without a fancy plane .
As Iâ€™ve noted before , war with Iran would mean oil prices zooming to levels never before seenâ€ ” perhaps as high as $ 200 / barrel or 150 % above the all time record of $ 80 / barrel set a year ago .
Such prices would bring Americaâ€™s and the worldâ€™s economies to a screeching halt .
Islamic governments allied with the US , most notably the one in Pakistan , already shaky , could fall to radical backers of Iran ( and Pakistan has the Bomb ) .
The shocking thing is that even though all the signs of a Bush attack on Iran are there , including the build - up of an unprecedented Naval armada , armed to the teeth , in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea , nobody in Congress or the American media is talking about this looming crime and imminent disaster .
Most Americans are blissfully unaware , even though people in the military are watching it all unfold in horror .
In 2002 , Bush illegally diverted billions of dollars Congress appropriated for the war in Afghanistan to a covert build - up of troops and weapons in the Middle East for an attack on Iraq .
Now the president is asking Congress for another $ 50 billion for the War in Iraq , which he will almost certainly be diverting to the attack on Iran .
The pathetic Democrats in Congress , who already handed Bush $ 120 billion a few months ago for continuing and escalating his epic disaster in Iraq , are likely to grant him this new kingâ€™s ransom to finance an even worse disaster in Iran .
If they do , the blood of Iranians and Americans will be equally on all their hands .
The clock is ticking .
The only thing that could prevent this Crime Against Peace by the president would be for Congress , as one , to vote to rescind the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force , which Bush has claimed authorized an unending â€œwar on terror , â€  and which will be his justification for attacking Iran , and to begin impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president for conspiring to violate the Nuremberg Charter by attacking a nation that poses no immediate threat .
Every American should contact their representatives to demand action ( to reach your Congressional delegation , call the Capitol switchboard at 202-225-3121 ) .

# 1 : Elephants on Acid
What happens if you give an elephant LSD ?
On Friday August 3 , 1962 , a group of Oklahoma City researchers decided to find out .
Warren Thomas , Director of the City Zoo , fired a cartridge - syringe containing 297 milligrams of LSD into Tusko the Elephant 's rump .
With Thomas were two scientific colleagues from the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine , Louis Jolyon West and Chester M. Pierce .
297 milligrams is a lot of LSD  about 3000 times the level of a typical human dose .
In fact , it remains the largest dose of LSD ever given to a living creature .
The researchers figured that , if they were going to give an elephant LSD , they better not give him too little .
Thomas , West , and Pierce later explained that the experiment was designed to find out if LSD would induce musth in an elephant  musth being a kind of temporary madness male elephants sometimes experience during which they become highly aggressive and secrete a sticky fluid from their temporal glands .
But one suspects a small element of ghoulish curiosity might also have been involved .
Whatever the reason for the experiment , it almost immediately went awry .
Tusko reacted to the shot as if a bee had stung him .
He trumpeted around his pen for a few minutes , and then keeled over on his side .
Horrified , the researchers tried to revive him , but about an hour later he was dead .
The three scientists sheepishly concluded that , " It appears that the elephant is highly sensitive to the effects of LSD . "
In the years that followed controversy lingered over whether it was the LSD that killed Tusko , or the drugs used to revive him .
So twenty years later , Ronald Siegel of UCLA decided to settle the debate by giving two elephants a dose similar to what Tusko received .
Reportedly he had to sign an agreement promising to replace the animals in the event of their deaths .
Instead of injecting the elephants with LSD , Siegel mixed the drug into their water , and when it was administered in this way , the elephants not only survived but did n't seem too upset at all .
They acted sluggish , rocked back and forth , and made some strange vocalizations such as chirping and squeaking , but within a few hours they were back to normal .
However , Siegel noted that the dosage Tusko received may have exceeded some threshold of toxicity , so he could n't rule out that LSD was the cause of his death .
The controversy continues .

# 2 : Obedience
Imagine that you 've volunteered for an experiment , but when you show up at the lab you discover the researcher wants you to murder an innocent person .
You protest , but the researcher firmly states , " The experiment requires that you do it . "
Would you acquiesce and kill the person ?
When asked what they would do in such a situation , almost everyone replies that of course they would refuse to commit murder .
But Stanley Milgram 's famous obedience experiment , conducted at Yale University in the early 1960s , revealed that this optimistic belief is wrong .
If the request is presented in the right way , almost all of us quite obediently become killers .
Milgram told subjects they were participating in an experiment to determine the effect of punishment on learning .
One volunteer ( who was , in reality , an actor in cahoots with Milgram ) would attempt to memorize a series of word pairs .
The other volunteer ( the real subject ) would read out the word pairs and give the learner an electric shock every time he got an answer wrong .
The shocks would increase in intensity by fifteen volts with each wrong answer .
The experiment began .
The learner started getting some wrong answers , and pretty soon the shocks had reached 120 volts .
At this point the learner started crying out , " Hey , this really hurts . "
At 150 volts the learner screamed in pain and demanded to be let out .
Confused , the volunteers turned around and asked the researcher what they should do .
He always calmly replied , " The experiment requires that you continue . "
Milgram had no interest in the effect of punishment on learning .
What he really wanted to see was how long people would keep pressing the shock button before they refused to participate any further .
Would they remain obedient to the authority of the researcher up to the point of killing someone ?
To Milgram 's surprise , even though volunteers could plainly hear the agonized cries of the learner echoing through the walls of the lab from the neighboring room , two - thirds of them continued to press the shock button all the way up to the end of scale , 450 volts , by which time the learner had fallen into an eerie silence , apparently dead .
Milgram 's subjects sweated and shook , and some laughed hysterically , but they kept pressing the button .
Even more disturbingly , when volunteers could neither see nor hear feedback from the learner , compliance with the order to give ever greater shocks was almost 100 % .
Milgram later commented , " I would say , on the basis of having observed a thousand people in the experiment and having my own intuition shaped and informed by these experiments , that if a system of death camps were set up in the United States of the sort we had seen in Nazi Germany , one would be able to find sufficient personnel for those camps in any medium - sized American town . "
[ On YouTube : See Imagine that you 've volunteered for an experiment , but when you show up at the lab you discover the researcher wants you to murder an innocent person .
You protest , but the researcher firmly states , " The experiment requires that you do it . "
Would you acquiesce and kill the person ?
When asked what they would do in such a situation , almost everyone replies that of course they would refuse to commit murder .
But Stanley Milgram 's famous obedience experiment , conducted at Yale University in the early 1960s , revealed that this optimistic belief is wrong .
If the request is presented in the right way , almost all of us quite obediently become killers .
Milgram told subjects they were participating in an experiment to determine the effect of punishment on learning .

# 3 : Demikhov ’s Two - Headed Dogs
In 1954 Vladimir Demikhov shocked the world by unveiling a surgically created monstrosity : A two - headed dog .
He created the creature in a lab on the outskirts of Moscow by grafting the head , shoulders , and front legs of a puppy onto the neck of a mature German shepherd .
Demikhov paraded the dog before reporters from around the world .
Journalists gasped as both heads simultaneously lapped at bowls of milk , and then cringed as the milk from the puppy 's head dribbled out the unconnected stump of its esophageal tube .
The Soviet Union proudly boasted that the dog was proof of their nation 's medical preeminence .
Over the course of the next fifteen years , Demikhov created a total of twenty of his two - headed dogs .
None of them lived very long , as they inevitably succumbed to problems of tissue rejection .
The record was a month .
Demikhov explained that the dogs were part of a continuing series of experiments in surgical techniques , with his ultimate goal being to learn how to perform a human heart and lung transplant .
Another surgeon beat him to this goal  Dr. Christian Baarnard in 1967  but Demikhov is widely credited with paving the way for it .

# 4 : The Initiation of Heterosexual Behavior in a Homosexual Male
In 1954 James Olds and Peter Milner of McGill University discovered that the septal region is the feel - good center of the brain .
Electrical stimulation of it produces sensations of intense pleasure and sexual arousal .
They demonstrated their discovery by inserting wires into a rat 's brain and then showing that when the rat figured out it could self - stimulate itself by pressing a lever , it would maniacally bang on that lever up to two - thousand times an hour .
( The image at the very top of this page , third from the right , shows one of Olds and Milner 's rats banging on its lever . )
In 1970 , Robert Heath of Tulane University dreamed up a far more novel application of Olds and Milner 's discovery .
Heath decided to test whether repeated stimulation of the septal region could transform a homosexual man into a heterosexual .
Heath referred to his homosexual subject as patient B - 19 .
He inserted Teflon - insulated electrodes into the septal region of B - 19's brain and then gave B - 19 carefully controlled amounts of stimulation in experimental sessions .
Soon the young man was reporting increased stirrings of sexual motivation .
Heath then rigged up a device to allow B - 19 to self - stimulate himself .
It was like letting a chocoholic loose in a candy shop .
B - 19 quickly became obsessed with the pleasure button .
In one three - hour session he pressed it 1500 times until , as Heath noted , " he was experiencing an almost overwhelming euphoria and elation and had to be disconnected . "
By this stage of the experiment B - 19's libido was so jacked up that Heath decided to proceed with the final stage in which B - 19 would be introduced to a sexually - willing female partner .
With permission from the state attorney general , Heath arranged for a twenty - one - year - old female prostitute to visit the lab , and he placed her in a room with B - 19 .
For an hour B - 19 did nothing , but then the prostitute took the initiative and a successful sexual encounter between the two occurred .
Heath considered this a positive result .
Little is known of B - 19's later fate .
Heath reported that the young man drifted back into a life of homosexual prostitution , but that he also had an affair with a married woman .
Heath optimistically decided that this showed the treatment was at least partially successful .
However , Heath never did try to convert any more homosexuals .

# 5 : The Isolated Head of a Dog
What could be more horrific than creating a two - headed dog ?
What about keeping the severed head of a dog alive apart from its body !
Ever since the carnage of the French Revolution , when the guillotine sent thousands of severed heads tumbling into baskets , scientists had wondered whether it would be possible to keep a head alive apart from its body , but it was n't until the late 1920s that someone managed to pull off this feat .
Soviet physician Sergei Brukhonenko developed a primitive heart - lung machine he called an " autojector , " and with this device he succeeded in keeping the severed head of a dog alive .
He displayed one of his living dog heads in 1928 before an international audience of scientists at the Third Congress of Physiologists of the USSR .
To prove that the head lying on the table really was alive , he showed that it reacted to stimuli .
Brukhonenko banged a hammer on the table , and the head flinched .
He shone light in its eyes , and the eyes blinked .
He even fed the head a piece of cheese , which promptly popped out the esophageal tube on the other end .
Brukhonenko's severed dog head became the talk of Europe and inspired the playwright George Bernard Shaw to muse , " I am even tempted to have my own head cut off so that I can continue to dictate plays and books without being bothered by illness , without having to dress and undress , without having to eat , without having anything else to do other than to produce masterpieces of dramatic art and literature . "

# 6 : Human - Ape Hybrid
For decades dark rumors circulated alleging that the Soviets had conducted experiments to try to create a human - ape hybrid by breeding chimpanzees and humans , but it was n't until the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of Russian archives that the rumors were confirmed .
Dr. Il 'ya Ivanov was a world - renowned expert on veterinary reproductive biology , but he wanted to do more in life than breed fatter cows .
So in 1927 he traveled to Africa to pursue his vision of interbreeding man and ape .
Thankfully his efforts were n't successful .
To a great degree this was due to the native staff of the West Guinea research facility where he worked , from whom he constantly had to conceal the true purpose of his experiments .
If they had found out what he was really doing , he wrote in his diary , " this could have led to very unpleasant consequences . "
The necessity of carrying out his work in secrecy made it almost impossible to do anything , although he did record two unsuccessful attempts to artificially inseminate female chimpanzees with human sperm .
Frustrated , Ivanov eventually returned to the Soviet Union .
He brought an orangutan named Tarzan back with him , hoping to continue his research in a more accepting environment .
Back home he advertised for female volunteers willing to carry Tarzan 's child , and remarkably he got a few takers .
But then Tarzan died and Ivanov himself was sent off to a prison camp for a couple of years .
This ended his research .
There are vague rumors suggesting that other Soviet scientists continued Ivanov 's work , but nothing definite has been proven .
# 7 : The Stanford Prison Experiment
Philip Zimbardo was curious about why prisons are such violent places .
Is it because of the character of their inhabitants , or is it due to the corrosive effect of the power structure of the prisons themselves ?
To find out , Zimbardo created a mock prison in the basement of the Stanford psychology department .
He recruited clean - cut young men as volunteers  none had criminal records and all rated " normal " on psychological tests  and he randomly assigned half of them to play the role of prisoners and the other half to play guards .
His plan was that he would step back for two weeks and observe how these model citizens interacted with each other in their new roles .
What happened next has become the stuff of legend .
Social conditions in the mock prison deteriorated with stunning rapidity .
On the first night the prisoners staged a revolt , and the guards , feeling threatened by the insubordination of the prisoners , cracked down hard .
They began devising creative ways to discipline the prisoners , using methods such as random strip - searches , curtailed bathroom privileges , verbal abuse , sleep deprivation , and the withholding of food .
Under this pressure , prisoners began to crack .
The first one left after only thirty - six hours , screaming that he felt like he was " burning up inside . "
Within six days , four more prisoners had followed his lead , one of whom had broken out in a full - body stress - related rash .
It was clear that for everyone involved the new roles had quickly become more than just a game .
Even Zimbardo himself felt seduced by the corrosive psychology of the situation .
He began entertaining paranoid fears that his prisoners were planning a break - out , and he tried to contact the real police for help .
Luckily , at this point Zimbardo realized things had gone too far .
Only six days had passed , but already the happy college kids who had begun the experiment had transformed into sullen prisoners and sadistic guards .
Zimbardo called a meeting the next morning and told everyone they could go home .
The remaining prisoners were relieved , but tellingly , the guards were upset .
They had been quite enjoying their new - found power and had no desire to give it up .

#8 : Facial expressions while decapitating a rat
In 1924 Carney Landis , a graduate student in psychology at the University of Minnesota , designed an experiment to study whether emotions evoke characteristic facial expressions .
For instance , is there one expression everyone uses to convey shock , and another commonly used to display disgust ?
Most of Landis 's subjects were fellow graduate students .
He brought them into his lab and painted lines on their faces so that he could more easily see the movement of their muscles .
He then exposed them to a variety of stimuli designed to provoke a strong psychological reaction .
As they reacted , he snapped pictures of their faces .
He made them smell ammonia , look at pornographic pictures , and reach their hand into a bucket containing slimy frogs .
But the climax of the experiment arrived when he carried out a live white rat on a tray and asked them to decapitate it .
Most people initially resisted his request , but eventually two - thirds did as he ordered .
Landis noted that most of them performed the task quite clumsily : " The effort and attempt to hurry usually resulted in a rather awkward and prolonged job of decapitation . "
For the one - third that refused , Landis eventually picked up the knife and decapitated the rat for them .
Landis 's experiment presented a stunning display of the willingness of people to obey the demands of experimenters , no matter how bizarre those demands might be .
It anticipated the results of Milgram 's obedience experiment by almost forty years .
However , Landis never realized that the compliance of his subjects was far more interesting than their facial expressions .
Landis remained single - mindedly focused on his initial research topic , even though he never was able to match up emotions and expressions .
It turns out that people use a wide variety of expressions to convey the same emotion  even an emotion such as disgust at having to decapitate a rat .

# 9 : The Vomit - Drinking Doctor
How far would you go to prove a theory ?
Stubbins Ffirth , a doctor - in - training living in Philadelphia during the early nineteenth century , went further than most .
Way further .
Having observed that yellow fever ran riot during the summer , but disappeared during the winter , Ffirth concluded that it was not a contagious disease .
Instead , he theorized it was caused by an excess of stimulants such as heat , food , and noise .
To prove his theory , Ffirth set out to demonstrate that no matter how much he exposed himself to yellow fever , he would n't catch it .
He started by making small incisions on his arms and pouring " fresh black vomit " obtained from a yellow - fever patient into the cuts .
He did n't get sick .
Next he dribbled some vomit in his eyes .
He fried some up on a skillet and inhaled the fumes .
He fashioned some into a pill and swallowed it .
Finally he took to drinking entire glasses of pure , undiluted black vomit .
And still he did n't get sick .
Ffirth rounded out his experiment by liberally smearing himself with other yellow - fever tainted fluids : blood , saliva , perspiration , and urine .
Healthy as ever , he declared his theory proven .
Unfortunately , he was wrong .
Yellow fever is very contagious , but it requires direct transmission into the blood stream , usually by a mosquito , to cause infection .
But considering all Ffirth did to infect himself , it is a bit of a miracle he remained alive .
# 10 : Beneficial Brainwashing
Dr. Ewen Cameron believed he had come up with a cure for schizophrenia .
His theory was that the brain could be reprogrammed to think in healthy ways by forcibly imposing new thought patterns on it .
His method was to make patients wear headphones and listen to audio messages looped over and over , sometimes for days or even weeks at a time .
He called this method " psychic driving , " because the messages were being driven into the psyche .
The press hailed it as " beneficial brainwashing . "
During the 1950s and early 1960s , hundreds of Cameron 's patients at Montreal 's Allan Memorial Clinic became his unwitting test subjects  whether or not they actually had schizophrenia .
Some patients checked in complaining of problems as minor as menopause - related anxiety , only to find themselves sedated with barbiturates , strapped into a bed , and forced to listen for days on end to messages such as " People like you and need you .
You have confidence in yourself . "
One time , to test the technique , Cameron placed patients into a drugged sleep and made them listen to the message , " When you see a piece of paper , you want to pick it up . "
Later he drove them to a local gymnasium .
There , lying in the middle of the gym floor , was a single piece of paper .
He happily reported that many of them spontaneously walked over to pick it up .
When the CIA learned of what Cameron was doing , it became interested and started surreptitiously channeling him money .
But eventually the agency concluded that Cameron 's technique was a failure and cut his funding , prompting Cameron himself to admit that his experiments had been " a ten year trip down the wrong road . "
In the late 1970s a group of Cameron 's former patients filed suit against the CIA for its support of his work and reached an out - of - court settlement for an undisclosed amount of money .

Jack Cole , executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , visited the editorial board Thursday , along with L.A. Chamber of Commerce chairman David Fleming , for a discussion of his group ’s plan to end America ’s war on drugs .
Some highlights :
A state trooper gets fed up
Jack Cole : I retired from the New Jersey State Police after 26 years there .
And 14 years there I was undercover narcotics .
I retired as a detective lieutenant .
I started in the war on drugs at the very beginning .
That ’s when I went undercover , in 1970 .
So I worked the first 14 years undercover .
And of course I followed it ever since , because when I retired I felt so bad about my role in implementing what today I consider an unjust war on drugs that in 2002 I sat down with four other police officers and we decided we were going to try and do something about this thing .
When we sat down we decided first , what should law enforcement people be trying to do ?
And when we boiled it down to the very essence it came down to we were interested in reducing the incidence of death , disease , crime and addiction .
And sadly , folks , all four of those categories are just made infinitely worse by the war on drugs itself .
So that obviously was n’t what we wanted .
As our name implies , we decided we wanted to end drug prohibition , just like we ended alcohol prohibition in 1933 .
Cause as law enforcers we knew that the very day after we ended that terrible law , Al Capone and all his smuggling buddies , all the people at the very top , people we could n’t touch for all those years , they were out of business .
They were no longer out on the streets , killing each other to try and control that lucrative business .
They were no longer killing us cops trying to fight that useless war .
They were no longer killing our children caught in crossfire and drive - by shootings : all the things we have today .
So we knew that if we came up with a system of legalized regulation of drugs today we could take all the violence out of this equation .
All of it .
And if we treated drug abuse we could actually start helping these people instead of destroying their lives .
Let me give you an idea of what we mean :
We ’ve already spent more than a trillion dollars on the war on drugs , since 1970 .
And what do we have to show for that money ?
And by the way , it ’s $ 69 billion more every year that we ’ll throw down the same rathole .
What we have to show for it is in 37 years we ’ve made over 38 million arrests for non-violent drug offenses .
We ’ve quadrupled the number of people in our prisons in the last , in a twenty - year period .
We ’ve made building prisons the fastest - growing industry in the United States , which , there ’s something to be proud of , right ?
And to bring it down , so you guys can really understand it where you live , in ten years , you ’ve increased the people on your staffs at prisons , guarding those folks in prison , by 25,000 .
At the same time you ’ve cut your teachers by 8,000 .
Seems to me to be the wrong message we ’re trying to send to our young people .
That ’s just for California .
Despite all this money spent , and all these lives destroyed , today drugs are cheaper , they ’re more potent and they ’re easier for our children to access than they were in 1970 when I started buying them as an undercover agent .
So that ’s a failed policy , any way you look at it .
War bucks
Jack Cole : I joined the New Jersey State Police in 1964 .
The War On Drugs was coined and created by Richard Milhous Nixon in 1968 .
Had nothing to do with drugs ; it had everything to do with the fact that he was running for the presidency for the second time and he thought this time it ’d be really nice if he won . [...]
When I joined in 1964 we had a seven - man narcotics unit .
Six years later , as the federal funding started pouring in , we went from a seven - man unit to a 76 - person bureau of narcotics .
Think what that means .
When you increase any organization by 11 times overnight , you set up a great deal of expectations , and since cops are judged mainly on the number of arrests they make , the expectation with us , the expectation was that in the coming year we ’d arrest at least 11 times as many people for non-violent drug offense as we did the year before .
So after two weeks ’ training they designated one - third of us undercover , and I was one of that third so that ’s where I spent most of the next 14 years of my life .
We were supposed to arrest drug users :
Not an easy job in 1970 for several reasons .
First , we did n’t really have much of a drug problem in 1970 .
Those of us old enough to look back to those times , we know the main problem was soft drugs : marijuana , hashish psilocybin mushrooms , LSD  the mind - altering drugs .
The targeted us against young folks , folks in high school or college or in between , little friendship groups , because there were no drug dealers .
And our bosses did n’t know how to fight a war on drugs , which was a problem .
But they knew one thing :
They knew how to work that federal cash cow .
They ’d just hired 75 new troopers to replace us seasoned guy .
So they had to make the war on drugs look like it was an absolute necessity .
This was probably not the right thing to do .
But we made it the right thing to do .
We started arresting everybody we could put our fingers on .
I infiltrated a group of maybe 15 young people .
Friday night , school ’s out , work ’s out , somebody ’d say “ You wanna get high ? ”
And a few people would take them up on that , and of course I was always there to take them up on that .
One of the friends who happened to have access to the family car and could go and get drugs  because I was working the suburbs and there just were no drugs in the suburbs ; you had to go to New York City to get them  and he ’d ask what do you want ?
One person says get me a couple joints , one says get me some acid , and when they came to me I ’d put my order in too , for this tiny bit of substance .
And an hour later they ’d come back and hand this stuff out to their friends .
And when they handed it to me they became a big - time drug dealer .
And I would stay in that group until I got everybody in the group .
Which was easy because whoever made the run before did n’t want to do it again ; they were n’t even getting gas money .
These were just young people accommodating each other .
We were working ten of those groups at the same time , and we had about thirty cops working cases like this , and when we had 90 , 95 cases like this , and that took maybe a month , month and a half , we ’d have a roundup .
We ’d sweep into the community , kick down the doors , arrest the people , drag them out in chains .
And when we got down to the police station we ’d call you folks , who would be there with photographers .
And we ’d run them through the perp walk where they ’d have their pictures taken so they could have any respectability they had destroyed , and when we got them all lined up against the wall , our boss would come in and say to the media , “ See that ?
That ’s 95 major drug dealers we took out of your community .
We ’ve got to do something to stop this .
This is the worst thing that ’s ever happened to the United States .
We need more money so we can hire more cops and make more arrests . ”
In 1969 you could count the number of arrests for non-violent drug offenses in the tens of thousands .
That first year when we started this campaign that number went up to 415,000 .
We just increased it slightly each year .
Drugs : faster , better , cheaper
Jack Cole : Everything that you should be able to look at to judge whether a program is good or bad is going the opposite way .
If we were doing anything to interdict drugs , the price would go up , not down , right ?
The supply would go down , not up .
Instead , when I was a young trooper in 1970 , kicking down doors and executing search warrants a good seizure for a local cop might be an ounce of cocaine or a quarter - ounce of heroin .
Look at what we ’re seizing today .
In 2002 , in a single seizure we seized ten tons of heroin and in another single seizure 20 tons of cocaine .
I know you got 18 tons here , right off the coast of California .
So things are going up , not down .
Jim Newton :
Is that not , arguably , a success , if interdictions are going up , if they ’re seizing more and more drugs ?
Why does that not get counted as a measure of success ?
Jack Cole : Because all that means ... it would be a measure of success if we were seizing more and more drugs and therefore the price was going up .
It would mean that it ’s harder to get on the street .
But it ’s not harder on the street .
On the street it ’s easier than ever [...]
We ’re having zero effect on the things that are measurable .
Is pot still cool ?
Jack Cole :
If we look at other countries where they ’ve lessened the penalties .
In any country where they ’ve loosened the laws , things get better .
Jim Newton :
Well we ’ve loosened the laws and lessened the penalties in California since I was a kid .
I mean , I remember growing up , when I was in high school it was a felony to be arrested with marijuana ; now it ’s not even a misdemeanor .
Jack Cole :
In fact you ’ve got legal marijuana
Jim Newton :
Has the loosening of the laws in California had some of the effect you ’re describing .
Jack Cole :
Yes it has .
In fact the drug warriors are now bragging that in the last four years teenage marijuana use has dropped 11 % .
That ’s 11 % from where it was four years ago ; it ’s still up 50 % from where it was at the start of the war on drugs , which should be where you start measuring .
They say it ’s dropped 11 % in the last four years .
But in California , where you were the first state to legalize medical marijuana , it ’s dropped by 47 % .
Tim Cavanaugh : Teenage usage ?
Jack Cole : Yeah .
Lisa Richardson :
What ’s the correlation of that ?
Jack Cole : I think the correlation is it ’s not particularly cool to get together and smoke a joint when that ’s what grandma does to treat her glaucoma .
Tim Cavanaugh : Come on , it ’s still cool !
David Fleming :
We ought to outlaw spinach .
Postwar society
Jim Newton :
Let ’s talk about what this world would look like .
We wake up January 1 , drugs are legal .
Seems like there could be manifold unintended consequences of that too .
David Fleming :
It would be from a Class 1 to a Class 2 drug .
Jim Newton :
So drugs would still be illegal ?
Jack Cole :
They would be regulated .
Most drugs would be legal .
And we believe the more dangerous a drug is , the more reason there would be to legalize it , because you cannot control or regulate anything that is illegal .
But it does n’t mean it wo n’t be regulated , harshly regulated .
It just wo n’t be a Class 1 drug anymore .
Jim Newton :
So as a consumer , would I buy from a doctor ?
How would I get access to these drugs ?
Jack Cole :
That depends on the drug .
And it depends on the policies we set up .
If you ’re asking , and we do n’t recommend any specific policy .
The first half of our talk is to convince people of the horror of the war on drugs .
And the second half is to discuss what we ’d like to see . [...]
The only drug we ’ve had any success in lowering the rate of use of in this country is tobacco .
In the last 22 years we ’ve cut tobacco use in half in this country .
We did n’t do that by making tobacco illegal , by arresting executives at R.J. Reynolds .
The most effective thing we did was a massive education program .
Cynics and prohibition
Jim Newton : What ended alcohol prohibition in 1933 ?
Jack Cole :
It ended when the public began to see the unintended consequences of this misguided law .
David Fleming :
There ’s another part of that .
At the time we were in the midst of a depression .
Income tax revenues were way down , and the federal government said to itself , where were we getting our revenues before ?
And the answer was that a substantial portion of federal revenues had been coming from taxes on alcohol .
Jim Newton : David , you are a cynic !
