The prevailing myth among those who have never experienced the U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Service first hand is that when you marry an American you are simply issued a Green Card and all is well .
You sail off into the sunset , everyone ’s happy , America has gained another taxpayer .
You raise bilingual kids .
End of story .
By virtue of having married a Polish citizen , I now possess a wealth of knowledge that not only contradicts that myth of bliss , but actually is capable of shattering it completely to the point that it is unrecognizable .
Even to the myth ’s relatives and close friends .
When fate introduced me to a Polish girl in an Irish bar in France , fate was also arranging my introduction to a world of stifling bureaucratic chaos I once thought was monopolized solely by the Internal Revenue Service .
How naive I was .
Recently we had what a layman might call our Green Card appointment .
This became our life ’s goal when we mailed an over - stuffed manila envelope to INS nearly two years ago .
The odyssey began with our civic marriage .
The “ civic ” marriage was a necessity because the “ church ” marriage was n’t to be until August 2002 .
But INS could not wait that long .
They did not care that I was in love with an Alien .
They only cared that she was an Alien .
Paperwork had to be filed immediately or my Alien fiancé would have been deported – which is terrible for relationships .
I also think calling someone ’s spouse an Alien is terrible for relationships , but I ’ve got bigger fish to fry .
And so , in order to get the INS paperwork going , we had our civic ceremony that December in 2001 .
By civic ceremony I mean we were at the matrimonial equivalent of the Registry of Motor Vehicles .
We were married right after a sketchy long - haired guy and his South American wife , right ahead of the morbidly obese couple who came dressed in jeans and t- shirts to celebrate their commitment to dressing like crap .
A woman with a tremendous Hispanic accent called us into a room , recited from the top of her head the marriage vows in mumbled Spanglish , and pronounced us married .
My dating life ceased .
As the grand finale I was told “ chew may now kees dee brine . ”
So , I kissed me brine .
My brother ’s cell phone went off , playing Michelle Ma Belle in pre-polyphonic digital bleeps .
It was as glorious and romantic as you ’d imagine it would n’t be .
Afterwards , we stood in front of the fake Christmas tree and plastic Menorah in the lobby to have our photo taken .
Newly married , and in possession of a piece of paper saying so , I immediately set about filling out the paperwork .
The first step in the coveted Green Card journey .
The first step involves reams of paper .
Environmental fanatics take note : an entire forest was murdered to accommodate me .
I can recite the forms off the top of my head now .
First there was the I - 485 Adjustment of Status .
This was what you might call the Green Card application .
Then there was the I - 130 Petition for Alien Relative which you use to prove that you ’re related to an Alien and entitled to file the I - 485 in the first place .
In addition , we needed to supply the G - 325A Biographic Information forms for the two of us , and I had to fill out the I - 864 Affidavit of Support .
The I - 864 , backed up by copies of three years of tax returns , W2 and 1099 forms and pay stubs , all my bank account information and any other proof of worth helps to show that you earn more than the poverty limit ( $ 12,000 a year at the time ) so that INS could be assured my wife was n’t going to go on welfare .
If you are making less than $ 12,000 a year no one would want to marry you anyway , so this rule seems completely pointless .
The I -693 Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status form required a visit to an INS approved doctor .
That doctor ran tests and provided a sealed envelope to include in the application .
God forbid my wife had a horrible disease , since that could mean she was dying and was going to be deported .
You ’d want to know that right away .
But they do n’t open the sealed envelope until your interview .
Two years later .
So , right in the beginning of the interview you ’ve waited two years for , they presumably dish out the bad news , ask you to cover your mouth , and drag you to the airport for your one - way trip back to the homeland .
Each form comes with a set of instructions unique to that form .
Each form requires a certain number of photocopies and originals of various things .
Some forms require photographs .
Everything needs to be done correctly .
The penalties for doing them incorrectly are anybody ’s guess – at the very least it means a delay in your application which is already going to take two years under the best of circumstances .
Worst case , I imagine you get deported .
Again , terrible for relationships .
The anxiety starts to build .
The forms were all various degrees of confusing , often with several pages of text telling you what you need to do , but leaving you with enough questions that you ’re terrified you ’re making a mistake and ruining your life .
I pity the poor souls who do n’t speak English .
Their eyes must tear up as they go from word to word trying to make sense of it all .
A lot of it did n’t make sense to me either , and I can read .
In English .
Questions are plentiful , and worrisome , because answers are hard or impossible to come by .
You will not reach a human by phone .
You can go to the district office and wait long periods of time to ask a question .
Make it a good question though , because you can only ask one and then you have to go to the back of the line and wait all over again .
For quicker answers the best you can do is flip through Do It Yourself books and hope they ’re not outdated .
Since the numerous forms are subject to change , you can count on your book being outdated .
A few times the books referred to sections that no longer existed on the forms , or did n’t acknowledge other sections on the forms .
The books often contained actual copies of forms which would have been helpful if they were n’t outdated .
Your best bet was downloading the most current forms on the INS website .
Depending on the form , some looked great and others looked like a ninth - generation photocopy .
All this form confusion just added to the anxiety , which had already climbed to maximum by the specter of my wife being hauled off by INS agents because I forgot to dot an “ i ” or cross a “ t ” on one of my I - forms .
I ’m not known for being detail oriented .
Processing fees also changed without much fanfare , and had I not noticed this on their website I would have sent in a check for the wrong amount .
In any other instance this would have been an unfortunate inconvenience .
With the INS it would be a terrifying , nerve - racking disaster .
If you were desperate for assistance you could easily spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer .
We had spoken with one early on and she either did n’t know what she was talking about , was n’t aware the rules had changed , or was deliberately trying to frighten us into using her services .
I decided she was a moron and vowed not to involve lawyers in the process .
Plus I ’m not fond of lawyers .
I hate to give them money .
By December ’s end I had pounds of paper ready to go .
In hindsight I should have also filled out the I - 765 Application for Employment Authorization Document which would have allowed her to work and the I - 131 Petition for Advance Parole which would have allowed her to leave the country and return , but I held off .
Part of me was confused , part of me was tired of paperwork , and part of me did n’t realize that without the I - 131 Advance Parole your spouse is in big trouble if they leave the country .
This would be another source of extreme anxiety in the near future .
After you mail off the manila envelope , you wait .
How long you wait is anyone ’s guess .
And what you ’re waiting for is anyone ’s guess .
A few weeks later I received a hand - scrawled envelope that contained nothing but a small , yellow receipt .
At least it was proof , I hoped , that they had received what I mailed .
I cherished that receipt .
It was all I had to go by .
I photocopied it numerous times .
I treasured it like it was a family heirloom when in reality it was a tiny yellow receipt that was barely legible because the ink was so faint .
I was under the impression I would be receiving something more substantial .
One book suggested I ’d get an official looking letter that said they had received my application and it was being processed .
The book even had a picture of the letter .
That never happened .
Or if it did happen , I never got it .
Fear of not getting correspondence from INS added tremendously to the anxiety .
Most correspondence was hand addressed .
The idea that in the 21st Century we had people hand writing addresses seemed absurd , counter - productive , and error - prone .
What if the human misspelled the address ?
What if it was illegible ?
It certainly looked close to illegible .
It had to be — a human being was scribbling 300 of these a day by hand .
I constantly wondered if we had missed vital pieces of mail .
On top of that , my Chinese expatriate mailman constantly gives me other people ’s mail .
Despite complaints to the Postmaster , I continue receiving X - rays for a dentist on another block .
I could only assume someone other than me was getting some of our mail .
Probably our INS letters .
More anxiety .
I soon realized the folly of not filing the I - 131 Advance Parole document .
Without obtaining this piece of laser - printed paper with a photo glued to it , my wife could not leave the country and return .
If she did , on an emergency family visit for example , they would not let her re-enter the United States .
Even better , all the paperwork we had filed – the entire case – would have been thrown out .
We ’d then have to start from scratch , but she ’d be living outside the US for months or longer .
Again , not good for a marriage .
Even more anxiety .
To top it all off , her aunt was very sick .
Every time the phone rang I was terrified my wife would be summoned to Poland .
In mid-March 2002 I filed the I - 131 Advance Parole and prayed to any deity that would listen .
Near the end of the month we got a little yellow receipt for the I - 131 check , which I took to mean the Advance Parole was in the works .
But we heard nothing .
And her aunt was apparently more ill .
Now I was losing sleep .
By April 2002 , four months after we ’d sent in our paperwork , I only had yellow receipts to show that my checks had been accepted .
I had received no other correspondence .
I had no A - number , which is the Alien Registration Number they use as an identifier for your case .
I had not seen the letter that one of the books claimed I ’d be receiving .
I started to worry that maybe they misaddressed our mail , lost us in the system or just took my money .
At the end of May 2002 we received a letter telling us to come pick up our Advance Parole Document the following month .
After that , she ’d be able to leave the country and come back .
Though not without a great deal of anxiety .
If we were ever to lose that document while abroad the consequences would be unfathomable .
The I - 131 was valid for one year .
Unfortunately , by the time they issued our appointment to pick it up it was already two months old .
We ’d have to apply for a new one in short order .
By this point , my wife was desperate to visit her family .
She ’d never been away from them for so long .
When we picked up the Advance Parole document in mid-June , we were thrilled .
She could leave the country to visit her family and it would n’t be the end of the world .
The document had her A - number which we had never before seen .
I immediately filed the I -765 for her Employment Authorization Document .
We were also happy that the Advance Parole would allow us to go to Poland and get married again , this time in a church with friends and family .
We had invited people to the wedding in August .
It would have sucked if we could n’t have been there .
There was much more waiting .
By September 2002 , nine months after filing , I knew only this much :
We had now been married twice .
Once on INS terms and once on our own .
INS had cashed our checks .
They had issued an Advance Parole Document , which means we were in the system somewhere .
But still no news on the coveted Green Card interview .
We received a letter saying the Employment Authorization Document could be picked up in December .
Picking that up was a story all its own , and a terrific example of how horrible a mean - spirited little man can be when he ’s handed power over other people .
For every decent INS employee we encountered there were a few of these types : bureaucrats to the nth degree who were dreadful to the wide - eyed , helpless masses sitting in their lobbies .
Months came and went .
No news .
I just had to hope all was progressing along normally .
Going to the mailbox was a combination of hope , dread and anger .
I never knew what to expect , but since I ’m terribly pessimistic I expected the worst .
When I opened the mailbox and received nothing , I then expected that the worst had happened but the mail had been misaddressed .
Or that the Chinese mailman gave it to the dentist down the street .
As we approached May 2003 , we had to re-submit another I - 131 Advance Parole application so that my wife could continue to leave the US and be allowed to return to it when she was finished .
Same deal .
We sent it , received a small , yellow receipt weeks later .
And an appointment letter after that .
Naturally , the appointment was scheduled for a date that my wife was out of town on .
she was returning the day after the appointment had been scheduled .
More anxiety .
I had to go down to the offices , wait in line , and ask a lady what I should do .
I told her the appointment was set for May 2nd but my wife was returning May 3rd .
The lady told me we could come pick it up on May 4th .
I was relieved .
I left .
Then I realized May 4th was Sunday .
More anxiety .
I opted to suck it up and we ’d simply return on the 5th .
Fortunately they did n’t seem to mind when we did that .
We finally had our new Advance Parole .
We continued to travel .
Returning from abroad was always terrifying to me .
Even though we had the Advance Parole I was nervous that the rules had changed while we were out of the country .
As we approached the INS desks at the airport I ’d start to feel jittery .
I was artificially friendly with the INS staff and visibly nervous .
To a trained eye , I ’m sure I ’d look like a suspect of some sort .
Knowing that I looked guilty of something made me even more nervous .
The palms of my hands would get clammy .
I ’d stutter … I ’d make a lousy spy .
Inevitably , we ’d be told to go to the airport INS office to have the Advance Parole stamped .
This took a minimum of 45 minutes , sometimes longer .
We ’d sit and watch other people from various countries going through various Hells .
I saw fathers being told their kid would not be allowed in the country .
I saw a hysterical Chinese lady being deported .
And I saw countless African guys lying through their teeth .
The Africans were my absolute favorite .
I watched guys with fake passports , expired passports , no passports or other people ’s passports stand there and lie and lie and lie .
The INS agent would ask a question , the guy would lie , get caught , and the cycle would repeat itself .
It would go like this :
“ What is the reason for your visit ? ”
I have business .
“ This is a work visit ? ”
Yes .
“ So you ’re visiting for work ? ”
Yes .
“ Well , sir , you do n’t have a work visa .
You do n’t have permission to come here and work . ”
( Pause )
It ’s not for work .
“ Wait , you just told me this was a work visit . ”
No .
“ Why did you tell me this was a work visit ? ”
I did n’t .
“ Yes you did . ”
My brother lives here .
And so on .
If it was n’t holding everyone else up it would have been hilarious .
Eventually the guy would be cuffed to a chair while they awaited the next flight home .
The end of May finally brought us what we ’d been looking for : the date of the Green Card appointment .
We were thrilled , though the appointment was not until mid-November 2003 .
In the time in between we ’d have to assemble the necessary evidence to prove that we were a legitimately married couple .
A man and his Alien .
My wife also had a Fingerprinting appointment , which turned out to be the greatest immigration experience we had .
The reason for this was that it was n’t INS doing the fingerprinting , it was the Department of Homeland Security .
We received an appointment letter which directed us to a clean , well - lit , modern space with only a few folks in it .
We were in and out in only 10 minutes .
And on top of it all , they handed her a customer satisfaction survey .
My first thought was that it was a trap of some sort .
It all seemed to good to be true .
As our November 2003 appointment grew closer , my anxiety grew bigger .
I fully expected to walk into the meeting and be told that they did n’t believe we were married .
I spent hours assembling everything they wanted to see , as well as anything else I thought they might want to see .
I had to bring originals and photocopies .
On the day of the meeting , we woke early and headed down to the INS office .
I was pulling a rolling suitcase filled with : copies of all our paperwork , our passports , birth certificates , translations of her birth certificate , ID photographs , Social Security card , marriage certificate , life insurance policy showing my wife as the beneficiary , any INS correspondence from the past two years , three years of tax returns with three years of W2s , 1099s and paystubs , canceled checks from the IRS , three months of checking and savings account information for myself , three months of checking and savings account information showing joint accounts , gym membership card , health insurance information proving she was on my plan , hospital bills from a miscarriage to show that we were trying to have kids , proof she had her fingerprints taken , her work authorization , a copy of our wedding invitation , cards from a Las Vegas casino to show we share a life together , receipts from our wedding rings , boarding passes from flights we ’ve taken together , bills from the dentist to show I ’m paying for her dental work , receipts from NYU to show I ’m learning Polish , a receipt showing we sat through the horrendous Pre-Cana classes the Catholic church required us to take to get married on their property , phone and utility bills , my college quarterly showing a photo from our wedding , both Advance Parole documents and enough photographs to detail our entire life together .
We had photocopies of everything , save the pictures .
For the first time ever , there was no line at the INS building .
We walked right in and went through security .
It was eerily quiet .
That turned out to be misleading .
We exited the elevator onto the eighth floor and into a sea of people .
After handing the agent our appointment letter we were told it would be a 3 - 4 hour wait .
We sat .
We waited .
I studied the crowd .
There was a little bit of everyone in the world sitting in that room .
The PA system did not work correctly .
For over an hour and a half we heard people testing the microphone .
They tapped on it .
They blew on it .
They said “ Test , test , test ' ” into it .
But it did n’t work properly .
I was certain that after two years of waiting for this appointment we were n’t going to hear our name called and that would be that .
Every few minutes and INS officer would come out , on the other end of the room , and call out a name .
It was nearly impossible to hear .
Some of the agents halfheartedly called the names , as if they were conserving valuable oxygen .
Between that and the din of the crowd the anxiety was working itself to a fever pitch .
I tried to read , but all I could really do was listen intently the nearly inaudible announcements .
As seats became available we migrated our way towards the area where the INS officers called out names .
When we heard ours we bolted towards the woman and were escorted through a labyrinthine office – a football field of cubicles .
She took us into a side office and shut the door .
I was a nervous wreck .
I feared that my nervousness would make her think that we were lying .
That made me more nervous .
I fumbled through my suitcase as she asked to see a few ID documents to make sure we were who we said we were .
She opened a file on her desk , our file , and I recognized all the documents that I had mailed to them nearly two years ago .
When she asked to see the I -693 Medical Report results my heart sank .
We had sent them in with the initial packet in December 2001 .
We told her as much .
I was terrified they had lost them and it would suddenly be our fault .
She flipped through the folder and found them .
She opened the envelope .
Apparently no diseases to worry about .
She pressed on .
The questions were straightforward .
Her job is to determine that we ’re legitimately married and financially secure enough that we wo n’t be going on welfare .
Fair enough .
She asked where we met .
What we did .
She looked at the original birth certificates , marriage license , passports , bank documents and passports .
She took copies of them .
Copies of the W2s and 1099s .
She flipped through our photos and asked a few Who , What and Where questions .
She made a photocopy of a picture from our honeymoon .
She wrote her name and date in my wife ’s passport and told us we ’d be getting a letter in a month or so .
The letter would have an appointment time for us to come in and get her passport stamped .
That would serve as proof of a Green Card until the temporary Green Card arrived in the mail , God knows when .
A temporary Green Card , called a Conditional , is issued if the couple has been married less than two years .
In our case , we would have reached that mark only five weeks later .
We mentioned this , but it did n’t matter .
Rules are rules .
Even if our second anniversary was only five weeks away , we had n’t been married two years yet .
A Conditional was issued .
This means that our two - year journey did not end on that day .
Two years from now , we ’ll be filing an I - 751 Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence .
We ’ll be given another interview date .
I ’ll be packing another suitcase full of paperwork , and we ’ll be making our way back to the sea of humanity to once again prove that I ’m legitimately married to an Alien .
I do not hold the moldy piece of toast against London .
It was served to me just after the long Easter weekend ( and in Britain , the celebration lasts four days ) .
The swank little North London cafe we were at for breakfast had perhaps found bread deliveries lacking during the break .
And even though the bacon and tomato omelets were fine alternatives to the baked beans and bad bangers we had come across , apparently no one in the kitchen bothered to check the toast .
That ’s the thing about food in London .
For all the excitement about the city ’s gastronomic revolution , the basics can still be bloody awful .
Certainly , there is no argument that the food in London has gotten much better .
Organic offerings are everywhere now , and it ’s quite fashionable to brighten old British recipes with seasonal ingredients and lighter techniques .
The strength of the gastro - pub ( a term my colleague Eric Asimov thinks is manufactured gobbledygook ) seems unchallenged , with reinvigorated classic British dishes more popular than ever .
Even Gordon Ramsay is in the game .
He opened The Narrow , his first pub , earlier in April , with dishes that include a rotating roast of the week , deviled kidneys on toast or braised Gloucester pig cheeks with bashed neeps .
At the highest end , where Ramsay also rules , London ’s food is very good but frighteningly expensive .
Prices are almost exactly double that of New York .
( Imagine the humiliation when Brit after Brit gloats about the beating their credit cards take when they come to New York , quite a fashionable trip these days .
( “ The prices are just superb ! ” )
Still and all — and thank you for staying with my rant for so long — we found a few lovely moments in our short spin through London .
Perhaps they seemed so terrific in light of so much food that was n’t , but still . . .
The top food moment came at Borough Market in South London , which is very much that city ’s version of San Francisco ’s Ferry Plaza Market .
While the New York City Greenmarkets are very lovely reflections of season and place , the food theme does not extend into standing shops or restaurants as it does in London and San Francisco .
That sort of critical mass makes the market feel much more a part of the city and brings a broader set of food shopping options .
Aside from a long and lovely conversation about the qualities of what the Brits call wild beef ( from both Welsh Blacks and Devons ) , a highlight of the day was simply to stand in the cool damp of Neal ’s Yard cheese shop , tasting and talking cheese .
And I ca n’t say enough about the ewe ’s milk yogurt flavored with elderflower they sell .
The other highlight was lunch at Fish ! on Cathedral Street along an edge of the market .
We did n’t eat inside the glass - walled restaurant , where simply prepared plates of fish approved by the Marine Stewardship Council are served from a sleek open kitchen .
Better to stand out in the street at the fry station and receive a box of steaming hot cod in a crisp brown jacket and a crazy pile of fresh - cut chips .
And can we mention the beauty of the mushy peas ?
This is one British food fetish , along with the back bacon sandwich , I can get behind .
For dinner , we headed to St John Bread & Wine , the more casual , younger sister of chef Fergus Henderson ’s St. John .
It ’s on the other side Spitalfields market , and has the same lean , industrial feel as St. John without the tablecloths .
The menu is a rolling list of pig parts , puddings , lamb roasts and some of the rarest beef I have seen in some time .
You order small plates , so a beautifully chunky terrine of ham and parsley might come out alongside puréed chicken livers spread over country toast like peanut butter .
I had the most astonishing quail , cooked first in a hot pan and basted with hot butter then finished in the oven .
It came to the table on a white plate — nothing but juicy , crisp - skinned naked quail .
Oh , and they bake madeleines and berry pies to order , too .
Another surprise : Frontline , a restaurant near St. Mary ’s hospital in Paddington that opened a few years ago in the first floor of a building that houses what is essentially a war correspondents club .
The club promotes independent journalism and freedom of expression .
The walls of the restaurant express that , with moving examples of photojournalism from Belfast in 1971 , South Africa in 1994 , Moscow in 1953 and present day images from Iraq .
The effect , somehow , is smart and even a bit playful .
On white tablecloths , the food comes forth .
Crispy shredded duck on watercress with pickled red onions , bubble and squeak cake ( a modern twist on the traditional cabbage and potato dish ) with a poached duck ’s egg , the best sticky pudding I ’ve ever had .
The wine list is a particular draw .
Malcolm Gluck , the wine writer , created it , vowing “ to wage war on dining out wine prices . ”
It starts with “ a short list for wine list haters ” and leads people through with helpful descriptions that encourage people who , for example , like Beaujolais to stick their necks out with a 2004 Largrein Weingut Niklas for about $ 40 .
Looking back on all of this , it appears I did find some good things to eat in London after all .
I spared you details about the bad stuff , but let me just say I left feeling like the London food revolution was a bit of an overstatement .
So I leave it to you , the smart , well - traveled readers of this blog :
Does a marked improvement in really bad food make someplace a great food town ?
Is London overrated as a culinary destination ?
Is there more to London than mushy peas , chicken tikka and moldy brown toast ?

 Jan Scruggs stretches his arms toward the Vietnam Veterans Memorial he imagined and made real 25 years ago .
As the names on the wall are read aloud in the distance , he stands on the spot where he plans an underground visitors center as one last tribute to the war 's dead .
" This is where the entrance will be , " says Scruggs , his back to the nearby Lincoln Memorial .
Pointing to a gift shop kiosk nearby , he says , " This is not a historic vista . "
That 's not how preservationists see it .
Like the divisive Vietnam War and the unconventional design of the monument to it , the center is opposed by critics who fear it will mar the already crowded National Mall and overshadow the memorial itself .
As thousands gathered Sunday for Veterans Day , though , the controversy seemed a faint echo compared with the furor that preceded the wall 's dedication on Nov. 13 , 1982 .
The design by Yale student Maya Lin was below ground , black and unlike any war memorial before it .
Vietnam vet Tom Carhart called it " a black gash of shame . "
PHOTOS : Vets , others participate in parade REMEMBERING VETS : Memorial still gets offerings 25 years later VIDEO : Cheney pays tribute to Iraq vets
Over time , though , the memorial became a place for healing that 4.4 million people visit each year .
Pressure prompted a series of additions to the site .
A flagpole .
Statues of soldiers on patrol .
A tribute to female veterans .
A plaque honoring those who died after the war as a result of injuries suffered in it .
None of those additions compare to the visitors center .
The 35,000 - square - foot space could cost up to $ 100 million .
The memorial cost $ 8.4 million , or just under $ 18 million in today 's dollars .
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund has raised $ 15 million .
It hopes to open the center by 2012 .
Final design details must be approved by local review boards , but the project got a boost last month when the advisory U.S. Commission of Fine Arts granted conditional approval .
' A new way of mourning '
Visitors would descend ramps into the center , which the architect says would not be visible from the wall or the Lincoln Memorial .
They would see a large screen of changing photos of the more than 58,000 people whose names are engraved in the black granite wall .
Their pictures would appear on their birthdays .
Karen Zacharias of Hermiston , Ore. , hopes to see a photo of her father , David Spears .
He was killed in 1966 at age 34 when she was 9 .
She worries about the future .
" What 's going to happen in two generations when we have a whole society of people for whom the wall is just a list of names ? " she asks .
" Without knowing their personal sacrifices … it 's just a wall with names on it . "
Across from the faces would be some of the 100,000 objects that have been left at the memorial : dog tags , medals , boots , whiskey , stuffed animals , birthday cards , even a Harley - Davidson motorcycle .
The memorial " defined a new way of mourning , leaving things " to recall a lost one , says retired Army general Barry McCaffrey , who has helped raise funds .
Next , visitors would see a timeline of the war and the effort to build the memorial .
There would be no photos of such figures as President Nixon or anti-war protests .
" This is not about the politics of the Vietnam War , " says Scruggs , 57 .
" We 're teaching citizenship .
We 're teaching loyalty .
We 're teaching sacrifice . "
Before leaving , visitors would pass images of the fallen from all of America 's wars from the Battle of Lexington in 1775 to the current conflict in Iraq .
Scruggs says exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum suggested the center expand its focus to reflect " a larger national purpose . "
Scruggs rejects criticism from the National Coalition to Save Our Mall and others that the aim was to placate veterans of Korea and World War II whose nearby memorials do n't have interpretive centers .
A moratorium on building on the Mall has stymied groups that want a place on the nation 's prime memorial grounds .
Years of lobbying by Scruggs won an exception from Congress .
Like the Capitol Visitors Center , which is estimated to be a year from completion , and a planned National Law Enforcement Memorial museum here , the new center was required to be built mostly out of sight .
Architect James Polshek says the design adheres to guidelines issued by the National Capital Planning Commission last year .
" It is as subtle as anything could be , " he says .
Opposition to visitors center Not so , says Elizabeth Merritt of the National Trust for Historic Preservation .
She calls the center 's entry courtyard " a huge gash , " a description that calls to mind Lin 's critics .
Viewed from some angles , the entrance is " too evocative of the memorial , " whose uniqueness should not be overshadowed , Merritt says .
Judy Scott Feldman of the National Coalition to Save Our Mall says the center would set a precedent that would encourage other groups to push for interpretive adjuncts to their monuments .
" We are mistaking the power of our memorials with the educational value of our museums . "
For Ray Saikus , a Vietnam War veteran from Cleveland , the underground center evokes the tunnels where the Viet Cong hid .
" It will be distracting , " he says .
" It will diminish … the wall , ( which ) should stand on its own .
Nobody should be interpreting anything . "
Many at the memorial last week welcomed the prospect of the addition .
" It will continue the healing from this war , " said Annmarie Emmet , 77 , a volunteer at the wall .
" I think it 's a good idea , " said Ron Traaseth , 57 , a wounded veteran who came from Eleva , Wis. , to trace the name of his brother Larry , who died in Vietnam at age 19 .
" If you do n't learn from the war , you 'll repeat it . "
Kim Carnahan , 13 , of London , Ohio , said she knew the war " ended in the early 1970s , a lot of people risked their lives to help our country and a lot of people died .
And that 's about it .
A center would help people be able to comprehend it a little better . "

Will Bunch thinks so :
A publication for photojournalists called Photo District News has been covering the heck out of the Bilal Hussein situation , and they ran a long and interesting piece last night entitled " The Man from Fallujah . "
Overall , it 's a good read for anyone who 's been following the story , but I found this piece of the saga especially troubling .
Did an anonymous blogger some 11,000 miles removed from the front lines stir up the probe of the imprisoned AP photographer ?
Sure sounds like " Rusty " played a key role here in all of this : [..]

The CIA 's " Family Jewels " file shows that things have not changed much since the 1960s and 70s
The " Family Jewels " documents recently released by the CIA show that not much has changed since the 1960s and 70s .
American journalists were being physically surveilled and wiretapped , government employees thought to be leakers were also under surveillance and subjected to polygraphs , and U.S. domestic communications were being wiretapped as part of " testing . "
However , the CIA also acquired from AT&T " routing slips " of " overseas telephone calls between persons in the US and persons overseas and telephone calls between two foreign points routed through US switchboards . "
The CIA domestic wiretapping operation lasted for approximately six months .
In February 1972 , AT&T " call slips " were obtained for three of four months for US - China telephone calls .
Since interception was not involved , the operation was deemed legal .
Domestic microwave communications were intercepted as part of a " communications link loading study . "
In September 1972 , " hearability " tests of certain high frequency long - distance commercial circuits between the US and South America were conducted by the CIA .
On January 30 , 1973 , the tests were aborted after it was determined they were illegal .
The CIA routinely provided support , including technical assistance , to metropolitan police departments in their efforts to surveill anti-Vietnam War groups .
Liaison was established between the CIA and the Montgomery County , Maryland ; Fairfax County , Virginia ; Arlington County , Virginia ; Washington , DC Metropolitan ; Miami ; New York City ; New York State ; Los Angeles ; and San Francisco police departments and the San Mateo County Sheriff 's Office .
Through the CIA 's contact with the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration ( LEAA ) , it had contact with police departments , large and small , throughout the country .
The CIA maintained support and training links with foreign police agencies through the International Police Academy .
CIA support and training for foreign police officers was conducted through the International Police Academy through the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) ..
The CIA was concerned about a Ramparts magazine article in January 1972 that stated that the CIA 's Bob Kiley and Drex Godfrey were working to improve police organizations throughout the country .
The information was contained in a December 21 , 1971 , memo written by DDP Thomas H. Karamessines .
CIA mail covers , in cooperation with the FBI , conducted mail surveillance , beginning in 1953 , of incoming and outgoing Russian and " other selected " mail at Kennedy Airport in New York .
The operation was code named SRPOINTER .
It was part of an overall project called HTLINGUAL .
A similar operation was conducted in San Francisco for China incoming and outgoing mail .
The operation was code - named Project WESTPOINTER .
A CIA black bag breaking and entering was conducted at the home of a CIA employee , a defector , in Silver Spring , Maryland .
The operation was REDFACE I .
The CIA participated in a domestic CIA and National Security Agency communications intelligence ( COMINT ) collection project , which they deemed as " illegal , " which was code - named LONG SHAFT .
A May 30 , 1973 CIA memo from CIA Inspector General William V. Broe points to a " high degree of resentment " among " many Agency employees " over being asked to participate in a domestic spying operation code - named MHCHAOS .
Americans who traveled to the following locales were targeted by MHCHAOS : Paris , Stockholm , Brussels , Dar es Salaam , Conakry , Algiers , Mexico City , Santiago , Ottawa , and Hong Kong .
The program to reptriate Bay of Pigs Cuban Brigade prisoners from Cuba was code - named Project MOSES .
The CIA cooperated with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs ( BNDD ) , the forerunner of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , in Project TWO - FOLD .
The CIA also funded foreign travel on behalf of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control during the Nixon administration .
The CIA 's collection of data on dangerous drugs from U.S. pharmaceutical and other firms was code - named Project OFTEN .
After a leak of information concenring the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ( SALT ) to the New York Times ' William Beecher , President Richard Nixon ordered an investigation of the leak and the CIA arranged with the State Department 's Security chief G. Marvin Gentile to polygraph one Defense Department official and three from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency .
After Murrey Marder of the Washington Post reported that the FBI polygraphed the four government officials , FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was incensed and said it was another government agency that was responsible .
The documents released show that Hoover was right -- the CIA was the agency involved .

Spiders use two different kinds of threads to spin their webs .
One kind is sticky , and is used to catch the flies and insects spiders like to eat .
The other kind of thread is a non-sticky , or silky , thread .
It is on the non-sticky threads that the spider walks when it wants to get to different parts of its web .
To make walking on its web ’s thread easy , the spider has a special hooked claw at the tip of each of its eight legs .
Even if one leg should get caught in a sticky thread , the spider can use its other seven to pull that leg off .
Some scientists also think that the spider has a certain kind of oil on its body which helps keep the web from sticking to the spider .
Spiders can tell the difference in the vibrations in their webs made by a fly , an insect , a dangerous wasp , or even something useless , like a leaf or twig !

Stock photography - the pictures used by companies on packaging , leaflets , and websites - used to sell for thousands of dollars .
Changing technology has meant you can now pick up these images very cheaply .
But not everyone is happy with the development .
Shannon Fagan is one of New York 's top stock photographers .
His goal is to produce photographs that evoke the message potential clients want their packaging or product to convey .
When he goes on a shoot he finances it himself .
Location fees , equipment rental , and staffing costs can run into thousands of dollars per day .
Shannon Fagan finances the photography sessions upfront
" We have up to five models , a make - up artist , a stylist , sometimes there is an art director , sometimes the producer is on set , sometimes the producer is off on a different location .
There is a photo assistant and then there is sometimes a production assistant who is in charge of the paperwork , " says Fagan .
Shannon sells most of his photos as exclusives or " rights managed " images .
Clients pay a premium to use his photos exclusively and prevent them from appearing anywhere else .
Snap job
But his livelihood is under attack thanks to a proliferation of websites dedicated to amateur and semi- pro stock photography called " microstock " .
All you need to turn your precious collection of memories into saleable images is a super fast scanner , a reliable internet connection , and written permission from your subjects .
The steady march of technology means that the more recent images have been snapped with a four megapixel or better digital camera .
Smart tools on the latest compact cameras also mean that amateur snappers do not have to be very skilled .
Shutterstock claims to have over 2.5 m royalty free photos
" The auto function on cameras has really allowed a wide range of photographers to get instant access to taking great photos , " Jon Feinstein from Shutterstock , a stock photography website .
" They do n't have to learn light metering or the large technical issues beforehand .
They can still produce images that are close to the quality that seasoned professionals would be shooting , " he says .
Every time a file is bought and downloaded from a microstock website the photographer gets paid a nominal amount .
The market place for cheap images is growing fast and quality is no longer a priority .
Because almost anyone can produce sophisticated leaflets , newsletters , blogs and websites a so the customer base for microstock has ballooned .
" Stock photographers are really a new generation , " says Auriga Bork from online training library Lynda.com .
" They are having interesting ideas and more meaningful content .
It is not necessarily a technically perfect photo any more .
It is a lot more than that now . "
MS Bork 's advice for those that want to get into microstock photography is to be original - especially if they want to make money from it .
Support the artists
The microstock websites claim they are not affecting the highly paid pro-stock snappers .
" We 're targeting a different market , " says Stephen Kapsinow from Stockxpert , another stock photography website .
" We 're targeting a more consumer orientated market - non-profit , religious groups , school teachers - people who would not be paying hundreds of dollars for images . "
Unfortunately , we need to be paid to survive .
I have seen very little evidence , if any , that anyone can thrive on a microstock income
Betsy Reid , Stock Artists Alliance
And there are those who claim that the growth of microstock has opened up a previously closed world .
Shutterstock.com was set up after founder Jon Oringer became frustrated with his lack of opportunities as a semi-pro photographer .
" I had a collection of 30,000 photographs , " he says .
" I went looking for a place to sell them .
The top agencies did n't return my phone calls .
" When I put them online to sell them at the price point I wanted to sell them , hundreds of other photographers started e-mailing me saying they wanted to sell them too , " he says .
But for the stock photographers , the growth of microstock has not been so welcome .
" If photographers , like any artist , are going to continue to invest and create and be involved and if the business want to see the types of images from professional photographers that are really extraordinary then they are going to have to support the artists , " says Betsy Reid from the Stock Artists Alliance which represents professional stock photographers .
Shutterstock claims to have 80,529 photographers
Microstock has also put pressure on professional photographers like Shannon Fagan .
He now has to produce 60 saleable shots in one session rather than the 10 he used to aim for and the budget cuts affect his entire operation .
" My fees are dropping .
I presented that to the agencies that sell the photos , said this is a problem .
There is nothing they can do about it .
It is not their problem .
It gets transferred to me , the crew , the models , the locations , " he says .
But microstock websites seem unstoppable and are already moving into other areas such as cheap video clips , ready - made backgrounds , and graphic images that can be used for consumer and corporate projects .
Together with better software solutions and faster hardware they are creating a whole new generation of designers , powered by technology that is within everyone 's reach .
The body of Joanne Coombs was discovered last night at Manningtree , where her missing daughter 's body was found in undergrowth near the railway line .
Mrs Coombs , 40 , had said her daughter 's disappearance was " unbearable " when she appealed for information at a press conference .
A spokesman for the British Transport police said today the driver of a Liverpool Street to Norwich service reported a possible track fault last night .
When the line was checked by the driver of a following freight train , he found the body of a woman on the line .
" BTP can confirm that this is the same location where the body of 17 - year - old Natasha Coombs was found on 10 August , " she said .
" It is believed that the woman was struck and killed by the train reporting the track fault .
This incident is not being treated as suspicious .
" The deceased has not yet been formally identified and an investigation is under way . "
Officers visited the family 's home in Harwich last night .
Natasha was her parents ' only child .
She disappeared on July 27 after boarding a late night train from Ipswich .
At a press conference on August 2 , Mrs Coombs broke down in front of cameras .
She had said : " The house is so empty without her . "
Six days later , Mrs Coombs and her husband , Gary , 48 , made a second appeal for help to find Natasha and said they lived in constant fear of " what tomorrow will bring " .
Police said Natasha had been upset about separating from her boyfriend in the hours before she died , leading to speculation that she committed suicide .
But her grandfather , Peter Clackett , 62 , insisted her death was an accident .
Essex police said there was no suggestion of criminal activity .
The postmortem examination found her death was " consistent with a train strike " .
Prayers were being said for the Coombs family at their local church in Dovercourt today .
Opening his service this morning , the Rev Erwin Lammens said : " You have probably heard this morning the sad news about the mother of Natasha Coombs who passed away this morning or last night .
" We do n't have any details as yet .
I would like to dedicate this service to her and the Coombs family . "

News from the E stables From : Carsten Haitzler ( The Rasterman ) < raster ( ) rasterman ! com > Date : 2007-11-05 13:54:45 Message -ID : 20071105215445.09807277.raster ( ) rasterman !

First .
I need to offer some big apologies .
I have been pretty bad at being responsive and attentive to E for a while now .
I can give you a million reasons ( excuses ) - but that not fair .
I 've basically been " paying the rent " with Jobs - and they have not had anything to do with E ( first ) and then nothing to do with Open source OR E .
This means E swindled into a small corner of my world .
I 've been bad to respond to mail or provide any form of direction , feedback - or for that matter - leadership .
Please accept my sincerest apologies .
It 's my fault and my problem .
I need to fix this .
And fix it I shall .
That is my intent .
So launching into fixing , I shall do below .
So bear with me .
First on to some news .
It may has snuck out before and it's now official .
I 'm @ OpenMoko ( http://www.openmoko.org ) now .
Why ?
Back to OpenSource roots - and for that matter , back to Linux , X11 and Graphics ... and .... E !
For those who do n't know what OpenMoko is - read the link .
It 's exciting .
This mans I now will have more time .
Right now I will be all over the place - I am shifting countries again , so I 'll be sporadic with E- mail and reachability , but that will settle .
I 'm moving ( partly ) back to Sydney , Australia , and the other half of my time i will be in Taipei or other locations .
But I do intend to have more focus and support on E .
Now why ?
OpenMoko is convinced the technology behind E is what it takes to make exciting mobile phones that are Linux based and OpenSource .
This amounts to what is commercial support for E .
This makes me excited .
This opens doors for us .
In addition to the work Nokia 's INDT are doing , Terrasoft , and now gOS with Everex - this is a growing list of companies putting their faith in us .
Some of you may be suspicious of this - please do not be .
In E land we have believed in freedom - not a limited brand of it , but one that ALSO gives freedom to those producing commercial products to do whatever it is they need or want to do .
I believe that in the end , they will come back to the fold and not close and hide their source , because the cost of maintaining a fork is just too high .
I belive with support will come resources , and resources will mean development of the things you need and want .
Everyone wins .
One thing people may notice is that E is getting some splits .
Desktop vs. " Embedded " .
Apps vs libraries and multiple libraries and projects .
I do n't think E will ever really totally split - it will just have lots of useful libraries , tools and apps - different ones aiming for different directions .
One thing I hope to do is keep E together - even if there are different directions .
I also see the team growing - this is great , but it serves to just increase communication traffic , and that in turn means less coding gets done .
The traditional solution here is to start some hierarchy and " reporting lines " .
I do n't want to do this though - this will server to create splits where once there was fluid freedom .
If we must - we must .
Any suggestions ?
I 'm thinking of maybe just formalising a bit more of our developer " Relations " , involvement and teamwork .
Some Ideas for people - things : 1 . Identify people who WANT to be leaders and shape the direction of E - and are willing to spent the effort .
Some of you do it as a hobby and love just that , some do it for a job , others are in half - way houses .
2 . Lets have actual weekly or monthly developer meetings - literally all - in live discussions - maybe IRC ?
Have actual agendas in meetings .
Minutes .
3 . Have regular community meetings where people can tell us what they like and do n't - give feedback or whatever .
4 . Try an organise some annual get - together .
An " E meet " ( I think I 'll just call it " The Rave " for now - it fits with the whole E thing ) .
So Literally find a place on the planet we all can / want to go to - go there .
Now we also need to fix up enlightenment .org a bit - I intend to sink a bit of time into solidifying some content .
The Wiki has a fair bit .
Anyone is welcome to contribute as they see fit .
But the primary thing of importance is getting E17 out the door .
It 's actually looking petty good .
Only 2 really big TODO items left .
I 'm doing a theme revamp .
The Default theme has very much aged .
The gold bling is n't incredibly popular .
I 'm working on something I think people will love - and it still shows off E .
It will replace the current default - and will also knock off some of the " comment the default theme so its better documented for people to build new themes from and learn Edje .
Once E17 is out I intend to work hard on taking E mobile .
That mans giving it the ability to run beautifully on tiny 1 - 4 " screens or so , from 320x240 up to 800x480 or beyond but work like a charm with touchcreens , stylus 's or fingers , with or without a keyboard or other buttons .
But above all - it has to be sexy .
This will simply be extending E - adding hooks , modules or module replacements .
This will not mean E for the desktop is abandoned by me - it means it is simply a parallel focus - I use it every day of my life on every machine I have .
Now I want it in the palm of my hand too .
I hope that everyone can be just as excited .
I know I am .
I smell a new age of ...
Enlightenment . :)

Futurist , scientist , and all - around technosocial guru Freeman does n't think climate change is a big deal – at least , not in the way it 's usually discussed .
There is no doubt that parts of the world are getting warmer , but the warming is not global .
I am not saying that the warming does not cause problems .
Obviously it does .
Obviously we should be trying to understand it better .
I am saying that the problems are grossly exaggerated .
They take away money and attention from other problems that are more urgent and more important , such as poverty and infectious disease and public education and public health , and the preservation of living creatures on land and in the oceans , not to mention easy problems such as the timely construction of adequate dikes around the city of New Orleans .
Being Freeman Dyson , he 's got a techie fix : genetically engineer plants to put more biomass into their roots , practice no - till farming that allows carbon - rich topsoil to accumulate , and – voila !
– we can keep enough CO2 out of the atmosphere to put our minds at ease .
But the importance of topsoil aside , Dyson 's a lot less certain about other things : whether sea levels are likely to rise or a new ice age arrive .
In fact , the only thing he seems certain about is this :
When I listen to the public debates about climate change , I am impressed by the enormous gaps in our knowledge , the sparseness of our observations and the superficiality of our theories .
Many of the basic processes of planetary ecology are poorly understood .
They must be better understood before we can reach an accurate diagnosis of the present condition of our planet .
When we are trying to take care of a planet , just as when we are taking care of a human patient , diseases must be diagnosed before they can be cured .
We need to observe and measure what is going on in the biosphere , rather than relying on computer models .
It 's a vexing position .
On the one hand , Dyson says our climate and ecosystem models are too primitive to work with , yet he suggests technology be used in radical , world - changing ways that we can hardly even begin to model .
This does n't quite hold together .
But maybe that 's not the point :
Dyson 's an idea man , someone who leaves the messy details to others .
But if what he 's saying falls outside the mainstream , even to the point of illogic , there 's still a place for it ; such " heresy " is the necessary opposite of overconfidence .
So it happens that the experts who talk publicly about politically contentious questions tend to speak more clearly than they think .
They make confident predictions about the future , and end up believing their own predictions .
Their predictions become dogmas which they do not question .
The public is led to believe that the fashionable scientific dogmas are true , and it may sometimes happen that they are wrong .
That is why heretics who question the dogmas are needed .
I 'm glad Freeman Dyson is around to say these things .
And he 's right about the importance of informed contrarianism .
But – as Dyson also recounts in his essay – he also told a young Francis Crick to stick with physics , not biology .
Even heretics can be wrong , too .

The average person sitting down to dinner probably does n’t realize the important role bees played in preparing that meal .
Here ’s something that might surprise you :
One out of every three mouthfuls of food in the American diet is , in some way , a product of honeybee pollination — from fruit to nuts to coffee beans .
And because bees are dying at a rapid rate ( 42 percent of bee colonies collapsed in the United States alone in 2015 ) , our food supply is at serious risk .
The bee ’s plight is widespread : Serious declines have been reported in both managed honeybee colonies and wild populations .
Jennifer Sass , an NRDC senior scientist , says there are multiple factors at play .
Each on its own is bad enough , but combined they are quickly proving too much to handle .
Pesticides :
These chemicals are designed , of course , to kill insects .
But some systemic varieties — specifically neonicotinoids — are worse for bees than others .
Loss of habitat :
As rural areas become urban , the patches of green space that remain are often stripped of all weeds and their flowers , which bees rely on for food .
Climate change : Unusually warm winters have caused plants to shift their schedules .
When bees come out of hibernation , the flowers they need to feed on have already bloomed and died .
Disease : Pathogens carried by mites weaken bees , which makes them more susceptible to pesticide poisoning .
On the flip side , if bees are already weakened by pesticides , they ’re more vulnerable to disease .
It ’s hard to imagine a world without bees , but we know the impacts on our food supply would be significant .
( Think way less varied and much more expensive . )
Industry is scrambling to manage the crisis , with Big Agriculture securing healthy honeybee hives from wherever it can find them and transporting them around the country to pollinate crops .
Some regions in China are even hand - pollinating .
The rest of us can help , too .
“ The thing we can most control is pesticides , ” says Sass .
Anyone with outdoor space — from a container garden to a large lawn — can create a pesticide - free , safe space for pollinators that will encourage native bees and other beneficial insects .
We can also make sure to purchase plants that are n’t pretreated with pesticides by asking questions when we shop for seeds and flowers .
We can let our lawns grow a bit longer and leave the blooming clover for bees to enjoy .
We can ask our elected officials to pass county and town ordinances to reduce pesticide spraying , and we can urge corporations to stop making and selling neonicotinoids .
It ’s time to pay back the tiny , struggling pollinators that do so much for us , especially at mealtime .
KAGUYA ( SELENE ) World 's First Image Taken of the Moon by HDTV
Press Release From : Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA )
Posted : Wednesday , November 7 , 2007
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and NHK ( Japan Broadcasting Corporation ) have successfully performed the world 's first high - definition image taking by the lunar explorer " KAGUYA " ( SELENE , ) which was injected into a lunar orbit at an altitude of about 100 km on October 18 , 2007 , ( Japan Standard Time .
Following times and dates are all JST . )
The image shooting was carried out by the onboard high definition television ( HDTV ) of the KAGUYA , and it is the world 's first high definition image data acquisition of the Moon from an altitude about 100 kilometers away from the Moon .
The image taking was performed twice on October 31 .
Both were eight - fold speed intermittent shooting ( eight minutes is converged to one minute . )
The first shooting covered from the northern area of the " Oceanus Procellarum " toward the center of the North Pole , then the second one was from the south to the north on the western side of the " Oceanus Procellarum . "
The moving image data acquired by the KAGUYA was received at the JAXA Usuda Deep Space Center , and processed by NHK .
The satellite was confirmed to be in good health through telemetry data received at the Usuda station .

This is a still image taken out from the first moving image shooting when the KAGUYA flew from the northern area of the " Oceanus Procel larum " ( * 1 ) to the center of the North Pole .
As the altitude near the North Pole is high , the angle of the coming sunlight was lower , thus the shade of the crater topography looks long in the image .
The moving image was taken at 4:07 a.m. on October 31 , 2007 ( JST ) by eight - fold speed intermittent shooting ( eight minutes is converged to one minute ) from the KAGUYA , and the data was received at the JAXA Usuda Deep Space Center on the same day .
( *1 ) Oceanus Procellarum :
The dark area on the Moon 's surface called " ocean . "
It is located at the left end of the northern hemisphere on the front side of the Moon when we look up at it from the Earth .
(2) The western side of the " Oceanus Procellarum " ( cut out from the second image shooting )
http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2007/11/20071107_kaguya_e.html#pict02
This is a still image taken out from the second moving image shooting when the KAGUYA flew from the south to the north on the western side of the " Oceanus Procellarum . "
The dark part on the right of the above image is the Ocean ( Oceanus Procellarum , ) and the light area on the left is called the " highland . "
The moving image was taken at 5:51 a.m. on Oct. 31 , 2007 ( JST ) by eight - fold speed intermittent shooting ( eight minutes is converged to one minute ) from the KAGUYA , and the data was received at the JAXA Usuda Deep Space Center on the same day .
(3) The west side of the " Oceanus Procellarum "
( cut out from the second image shooting )
http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2007/11/20071107_kaguya_e.html#pict03
This is a still image taken out from the end part of the second moving image taking .
We can observe a crater called " Repsold , " whose diameter is 107 km , at the center on the near side of this image .
The channel that crosses this crater is called the " Repsold Valley , " and its length is about 180 km ( equivalent to the distance between Tokyo and Shizuoka on the Tokaido Line in Japan . )
The shooting time was the same as the above ( 2. )

Yesterday there was a lot of buzz in mass media about something going on in Georgia .
Russian bloggers could n’t leave this event unnoticed and also made their contribution , though they were n’t attracted by the political side of the question rather than by the strange masks the Georgia policemen wear .
So at first they shared those pictures among Russian blogs actively and then first photoshops arrived .
These are un-processed images of Georgian special force and their masks :
And these are samples of the photoshopped versions that were widely spread yesterday across the Russian part of the Internet :

I spent some time at BodyWorlds 2 , an exhibition of plasticized human cadavers designed to educate people who are not yet dead .
I learned many things , but the main thing I learned is that the body is jam - packed with organs , much like a throbbing , oozing Swiss Army knife .
Actually , you may be surprised to learn that the human body is even more complex than a Swiss Army knife .
Even more than those really thick knives that have an added , non-advertised function such as a cudgel .
Bulbous biological material is wrapped all around in your body , tucked into alcoves , threaded through bone holes – it's as efficient as it is disgusting .

But like a Swiss Army knife , not every part is equally useful .
For instance , every Swiss Army knife I have owned incorporated a fish scraper , but I have never scraped a fish in my life .
I assure you , if an unscraped fish is brought to me , it leaves my presence still unscraped .
Similarly , there are a number of body parts that may have served some important purpose in the distant past , but are now more likely to host disease and infection , much like pay phones .
A lot of transhumanist types focus on replacing perfectly good body parts with even better ones , giving us more durable hearts or prettier eyelashes , but it seems to me we ought to start by dropping some of our vestigial organs in favor of something more useful , or at least more classy .
These organs are clearly ready for upgrades :
Male Nipples
Looking at the accessories department at the Apple Store , it seems like there 's an inexhaustible demand for portable iPod speakers .
We have a left nipple and a right nipple , they 're circular and conveniently located – seems like a perfect match to me .
Every man could be a party waiting to happen !
Moreso !
Now , some will point out that nipples are erogenous zones , and lord knows we do n't want to start cutting those out willy or nilly .
But there 's no reason they can't be both .
Highly sensitive , erotically charged iPod speakers .
There 's absolutely nothing creepy about that !
Wisdom Teeth
Why should ninjas and spies alone have all the fun of a cyanide - filled tooth ?
For some reason , the ability to kill yourself instantly when about to be interrogated was not selected by evolutionary processes , but that does n't mean we can't correct nature 's mistake with a little genetic tweaking .
Yeah , there would be the odd thousand accidental deaths a year , but I think it would be worth it for the electric thrill of danger and espionage that we 'd all experience .
Plus , wisdom teeth tend to grow in late , so we do n't have to worry about teenagers biting down just because their favorite band broke up or Jenny in homeroom likes them as a friend .
Ear Muscles
Some people can wiggle their ears .
Others cannot .
The former do n't really have anything to be proud of .
It would be nice to be able to rotate my ears like a stoat , but as long as we 're improving the muscles , why not make the ears fully prehensile ?
You could pull down your hat if it starts to fall off , you could play " la la la , I ca n't hear you , " without having to pause your videogame , and you could play " earsie " with a loved one .
And , best of all , you could imitate that old Looney Tunes cartoon where Clark Gable does the backstroke with his ears .
I think that 's something that every one of us has longed for with a deep , resonating desire .
Appendix
The problem with saving money for emergencies is that often the " emergency " ends up being " they came out with a new version of the Nintendo DS " or " damn , I really need to get out of this stupid town for a couple days . "
What if each of us had , deep within our abdominal cavity , $ 5,000 ?
Like in a little squirmy pouch ?
That would really lend some gravity to financial decisions .
" Yes , I 'd really like a motorcycle , but do I want it enough to undergo major organ surgery ? "
I 'm assuming here that discount surgeons working out of pawn shops would be willing to cut you up for a couple hundo .
Coccyx
Devil tail , man .
Yeah .

Halloween Candy Prototypes That Never Saw The Light Of Day !
I 'm sure many of you read my big piece last year about the Ultimate Guide to the Halloween Candies of 2006 , and while I definitely have another one of those planned for this season with all new candies galore , there are some candies that we wo n't be seeing on the store shelves .
Not this year or any other year for that matter , I 'm sad to say .
Fortunately , Dave Jupp ( who designs candies and their packaging ) , was nice enough to contact me after reading my article to share some pics of his insanely cool candy prototypes that were unfortunately turned down by Target .
Anyway , let 's get down to the good stuff with a look at some of the fantastic Halloween prototypes from the Chef Goul - R - Dee pantry of candy .
If you want to see larger close - up versions of these photos , just click on any of them and they 'll pop up in a new window .
First up we have Scab - A - Roni .
That 's right , edible scabs !
Who would n't want to peel scabs and scars straight off o' some flesh for a tasty snack ?
Gotta love it .
I could easily see them making Fruit Roll - Ups with these on 'em for Halloween ...
I mean , they have countless other peel - off shapes on 'em , so why not scabs 'n scars too ?
Next up is the Body Bag of Parts , and while candies shaped like body parts are n't too unusual during Halloween season , it 's the little details that make these ones special .
Whether it's the arteries and blood vessels on the heart or the glob of earwax dripping from the ear , these candies just offer that extra special something for a truly distinguished horror candy feast .
Now here 's one that I never thought of ... candy Zombie Claws !
I understand that having claws can certainly help zombies tear their victims apart to get to the braiiiiiiiiins quickly , but I never knew that they were so colorful !
Maybe they 're born with it .
Maybe it's Maybelline !
Last but certainly not least we have Just The Heads fish heads candies .
Out of all the candies , these are definitely my favorites of the bunch , and therefore , the most heartbreaking since they were rejected .
Fish heads are constantly discarded by fishermen , ca n't we as a society at least find a use for mock fish heads in candy form ?
And there you have it , a bunch of candies that never were , but should 've been .
After seeing them along with what the store display would 've looked like , I personally think Target made a big mistake by not going with these .
On the plus side though , there will be a new and improved Box of Boogers this year .
Dave assures me that this time , they 'll both taste better AND look far more realistic than ever before .
Really looking forward to eating those boogers !
Man , now that 's something I never thought I 'd be typing .
Survey # 1 : If you were designing a novelty candy for Halloween , what would it be and how would it look ?
Survey # 2 : Most towns have some Halloween stores popping up by now , so which of you people are going to check 'em out this weekend ?
Going searching for anything in particular ?

Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said this week that if Congress cannot pass legislation that ties war money to troop withdrawals , they would not send President Bush a bill this year .
Instead , they would revisit the issue upon returning in January , pushing the Pentagon to the brink of an accounting nightmare and deepening Democrats ' conflict with the White House on the war .
In the meantime , Democrats say , the Pentagon can use some of its $ 471 billion annual budget without being forced to take drastic steps .
" The days of a free lunch are over , " said Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y .
At the White House on Friday , deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said : " DOD would have to eat into their annual budget and I believe that still presents difficulties in getting the troops in the field the resources they need to carry out their mission . "
" We 'd rather see the Department of Defense , the military planners and our troops focusing on military maneuvers rather than accounting maneuvers as they carry out their mission in the field , " Fratto said .
" There is a misperception that this department can continue funding our troops in the field for an indefinite period of time through accounting maneuvers , that we can shuffle money around the department .
This is a serious misconception , " Gates told reporters at the Pentagon .
As a result , he said that he is faced with the undesirable task of preparing to cease operations at Army bases by mid-February , and lay off about 100,000 defense department employees and an equal number of civilian contractors .
A month later , he said , similar moves would have to be made by the Marines .
Some members of Congress believe the Pentagon can switch enough money to cover the war accounts , Gates said .
But he added that he only has the flexibility to transfer about $ 3.7 billion — which is just one week 's worth of war expenses .
Senate Democrats voted almost along party lines 53 - 45 to pass a House measure that would have paid for the Iraq War but required the President to start bringing the troops home .
Since the measure failed to get 60 votes thus making it filibuster proof , additional funding for the troops is dead for the moment :
According to Defense Secretary Gates , the Democrats are mistaken ( or lying through their teeth ) if they think the war can be funded the way they say it can :
Once again , the Democrats and the President are going to play chicken with funding the troops .
It remains to be seen if the Democrats are going to be responsible enough to cut a deal with the Administration so that the troops in the field get all the funding they need to carry out their mission .
LIMA ( Reuters ) - A 4,000 - year - old temple filled with murals has been unearthed on the northern coast of Peru , making it one of the oldest finds in the Americas , a leading archaeologist said on Saturday .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
The temple , inside a larger ruin , includes a staircase that leads up to an altar used for fire worship at a site scientists have called Ventarron , said Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva , who led the dig .
It sits in the Lambayeque valley , near the ancient Sipan complex that Alva unearthed in the 1980s .
Ventarron was built long before Sipan , about 2,000 years before Christ , he said .
“ It ’s a temple that is about 4,000 years old , ” Alva , director of the Museum Tumbas Reales ( Royal Tombs ) of Sipan , told Reuters by telephone after announcing the results of carbon dating at a ceremony north of Lima sponsored by Peru ’s government .
“ What ’s surprising are the construction methods , the architectural design and most of all the existence of murals that could be the oldest in the Americas , ” he said .
Lambayeque is 472 miles from Lima , Peru ’s capital .
Discoveries at Sipan , an administrative and religious center of the Moche culture , have included a gold - filled tomb built 1,700 years ago for a pre-Incan king .
Peru is rich in archaeological treasures , including the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu in the Andes .
Until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1500s , the Incas ruled an empire for several centuries that stretched from Colombia and Ecuador in the north to what are now Peru and Chile in the south .
“ The discovery of this temple reveals evidence suggesting the region of Lambayeque was one of great cultural exchange between the Pacific coast and the rest of Peru , ” said Alva .
Apple TV is finally on sale and on the boat .
So , why bother ?
Here 's why Apple TV will change the world , slightly .
1 . It 's currently the only easy way to get stuff locked away in iTunes streaming to a TV set .
Bam .
Simple as that .
2 . It 's sexy .
It just looks nice .
Networkable media - slurping boxes can look rather industrial , but this sleek slab of brushed metal will be good for everyone who is n't a rackmount nerd or Apple - averse .
3 . It goes spiffingly with the Mac Mini , using the same a similar form factor at half - brick height .
You can use the Mini as the server , turning the duo into a fully - featured high - def PVR , streaming media system , WebTV box and game console .
4 . There 's not a lot of high - profile , branded competition .
This is more a kind of analysty point , but if the time is ripe for the mass - market for these things to wake up , Apple 's managed to wedge its way into a sunny spot without too much in the way of rivals .
5 . Everyone else has finally , belatedly , decided it 's hot .
This might seem like a stupid reason .
Maybe Not .
If it repeats the success of iTunes , it 'll become the standard , and sometimes , that 's the direction of least annoyance .
Remember , this is supposed to be an appliance , not an application .
Most of us want it to be a near - invisible interface between us and our media , not a science project .
Ready to buy ?
Think again .
Here 's five reasons why it wo n't change much of anything .
1. It 's $ 300 .
Damn .
And no free cables !
2 . If you do n't use iTunes - DRMed media , it offers nothing new .
There 's no reason to bother if you have something similar and your movies and such are not gotten via Apple .
3 . It does n't do much .
Even though it 's a capable computer in itself , it 's all in the service of functionality that 's designed in , instead of being emergent from its hardware capabilities .
Yeah , that 's just the way it works with modern appliances , but if it has a Pentium M CPU , 256 MB RAM , a 40 GB hard drive , why no PVR ?
Why such limited features ?
4 . This is really just 3b : With all that grunt , it 's basically a Mac Mini Mini with lots of outputs and special software .
Why can't I just slap OS X or Windows or Linux on it and use it as a kids ' computer , the heart of a MAME cabinet , a Car PC , or something a little more fully - featured ?
Let me in .
( We may get in real easy , of course , but that 's for the hackers to discover . )
5 . Wo n't work with other DRM systems .
Goes without saying , but say it I must .
It 's our fault for using DRM , of course .
Then again , DRM is the top reason for having to buy this expensive baby .
Hackability is what it comes down to for me .
I want it to be a success , so that lots of people dick around inside it , and I want to get into it for use as an ultra-tiny computer .
Do n't laugh : if Debian can be stuffed in a $ 75 hard drive ethernet adapter , it can be stuffed in this .

Alan Greenspan accepts no responsibility for the current situation :
Demand in those days was driven by the expectation of rising prices -- the dynamic that fuels most asset - price bubbles .
If low adjustable - rate financing had not been available , most of the demand would have been financed with fixed rate , long - term mortgages .
In fact , home prices continued to rise for two years subsequent to the peak of ARM originations ( seasonally adjusted ) .
Felix Salmon critiques this on the grounds that " the main reason why the housing bust seems to be much worse in the US than elsewhere is surely those ARMs – which , as Greenspan concedes , were a function of low short - term interest rates . "
There seems to me to be a more fundamental problem here .
Greenspan had what he thought were good reasons to put interest rates very low .
One consequence of that was to make ARMs look more appealing to a lot of people .
Greenspan could have responded to that in one of three ways .
He could have ignored the ARM issue .
He did n't do that .
He could have tried to warn people about the risks of ARMs .
He did n't do that .
Instead , Greenspan encouraged people to get ARMs .
I think it 's never really been clear why he did that , but it was pretty bad advice and he just does n't mention it at all during his retrospective .

UK.gov has unveiled its latest weapon in its battle against illegal immigration – the fearsome text message .
Home secretary John Reid today outlined a stack of proposals to make life for illegals " uncomfortable and constrained " .
We presume he meant to add " even more " .
Reid 's aim is to prevent illegal immigrants accessing public services .
He railed against foreigners who come to the UK " stealing our benefits " and accessing the NHS for free , according to the BBC .
Reid described plans for a " watch list " of illegal migrants to alert government departments when they apply for services to which they 're not entitled .
Foreigners settling in the UK legally will need to carry ID cards , and landlords and employers will face action if they employ or house illegal immigrants .
Part of the crackdown will include a " pilot " scheme to remind individuals who enter the UK on visas to not to over - stay .
Reid did n't elaborate on how the Home Office proposes to police the cellphones of immigrants .
Not to mention whether he planned to strike the world 's biggest free SMS deal to avoid bankrupting the HM Treasury .
But that 's all just detail .
The point is the mere sight of a Home Office text will clearly be enough to scare people on the cusp of overstaying right back over the UK 's borders .
Which presumably will put them in the middle of the deep blue sea .
Luckily , they 'll have their mobiles so they 'll be able to call the coast guard for help .
For which John Reid will presumably charge them . ®

Raghad and her mother are on Iraq 's most wanted list
Raghad Saddam Hussein , who fled the 2003 US - led invasion , is accused of terrorism and other offences .
She helped organise the legal defence of her father , who was hanged last December for crimes against humanity .
Last year Iraq put Raghad and her mother , Sajida , on a list of its most wanted fugitives , alleging they supported the insurgency in Iraq .
The Iraqi Interior Ministry told the BBC Interpol had notified member countries on Friday .
Before her father was executed last year , Raghad asked for his body to be buried temporarily in Yemen until , she said , such time as coalition forces were expelled from Iraq .
The Jordanian authorities said last year that she was living in their country as an asylum seeker , but it is not clear where she is at present .
“ Today 200 People Demanded That Rep. Allen and the U.S. Congress Adhere to the Constitution !
Today I along with 200 others signed a letter which we hand delivered to the staff of Congressman Tom Allen D- Maine letting him know that he has a responsibility and a duty to properly represent the people of Maine .
We had the opportunity to have 5 minutes to voice our views .
I was near the end and by the time I got there the two women listening to everyone looked like they were deer in headlights ! ”
We all believe good system documentation is important , but who actually does it ?
The typical corporate IT system documentation usually consists of repository comments , a few moldering requirements documents abandoned on some network share and maybe a few inline code comments .
A couple years ago I finally tired of the standard “ documentation process ” and actually started to document some of what I do .
Here are some lessons I ’ve learned :
1 ) Like any skill , writing documentation improves with practice .
As skill improves it also becomes more fun .
( Yes , I said fun .
It really * can* be fun )
2 ) Some of the “ classic ” documents ( requirements for example ) turn out to have a very short useful life .
Other nameless documents — instructions for running a complex script — turn out to be highly useful .
3 ) Documentation is best written in short segments .
I use a wiki — it facilitates the kind of quick , “ jot down an idea ” thoughts that are often the most useful .
Writing in short segments also keeps it from getting boring .
4 ) Documentation must be easy to update .
Otherwise it gets out of date and looses the trust factor .
Again I really like the wiki for that .
5 ) Documentation must be easy to search .
Anything difficult to reference — like the traditional formal document stored on a shared drive — simply wo n’t be used .
6 ) Documentation is for programmers and users , not management .
Keep it professional ( even if the document on multi- threading seems like it deserves that explicative ! ) , but casual .
7 ) Keep documents small .
I prefer 1 to 2 printed pages .
If any single document is more than 3 pages long its coving too much ground and should be broken into its component parts .
It ’s easier to navigate short documents and they are easier to search .
( Fewer false positives ) Leverage the power of the hyperlink !
8 ) Scale the documentation .
Systems are naturally hierarchical .
Systems break into sub-systems , which become classes and so on .
Let the documentation naturally break out into patterns that fit either the architecture , or usage of your systems .
9 ) Its OK to have documentation outside the code .
Documentation that ’s tied to specific parts of the code should be in the code–class and method documentation for example .
But system and subsystem documentation may work better in a wiki .
The important thing is that the documentation is easily accessible and universally recognized as the place to go .
10 ) Not all documentation is code related .
( For example , a dictionary of business terms / acronyms )
There needs to be a place to store non-code documentation .
11 ) Documentation should answer questions of what , where and why .
The code already answers “ how ” so do n’t waste time on that .
For those who think code is “ self documenting ” , just try to write code that explains why a particular design or architecture was chosen instead of a competing alternative .
. .
Some of the most useful comments are ones like “ we tried doing … but that turned out to be a bad idea because . . . ”
12 ) Documentation should be shared .
The more eyes that see it , the more valuable it becomes .
But in the end , the biggest lesson –the person who uses my documentation the most : me .
I ’m amazed at how often I go back and read something I wrote to refresh my memory on a certain system , process or whatever .
The time I ’ve spent writing has easily paid for itself just in time saved from re-researching .

( Dear read­er :
Here you have a lit­tle gift to con­tin­ue the Thanks­giv­ing spir­it .
Enjoy the inter­view , and thank you for vis­it­ing our site . )
Prof. Robert Emmons stud­ies grat­i­tude for a liv­ing as Pro­fes­sor of Psy­chol­o­gy at UC Davis and is Edi­tor - In - Chief of the Jour­nal of Pos­i­tive Psy­chol­o­gy .
He has just pub­lished Thanks :
How the New Sci­ence of Grat­i­tude Can Make You Hap­pi­er , an inter­dis­ci­pli­nary book that pro­vides a research - based syn­the­sis of the top­ic as well as prac­ti­cal sug­ges­tions .
Alvaro Fer­nan­dez : Wel­come .
Prof.
Emmons , could you please pro­vide us an overview of the Pos­i­tive Psy­chol­o­gy field so we under­stand the con­text for your research ?
Robert Emmons : Sure .
Mar­tin Selig­man and col­leagues launched what was called “ pos­i­tive psy­chol­o­gy in the late 90s as an anti­dote to the tra­di­tion­al near­ly exclu­sive empha­sis of “ neg­a­tive psy­chol­o­gy ” focused on fix­ing prob­lems like trau­ma , addic­tion , and stress .
We want to bal­ance our focus and be able to help every­one , includ­ing high - func­tion­ing indi­vid­u­als .
A num­ber of researchers were inves­ti­gat­ing the field since the late 80s , but Selig­man pro­vid­ed a new umbrel­la , a new cat­e­go­ry , with cred­i­bil­i­ty , orga­nized net­works and fund­ing oppor­tu­ni­ties for the whole field .
And where does your own research fit into this over­all pic­ture ?
I have been research­ing grat­i­tude for almost 10 years .
Grat­i­tude is a pos­i­tive emo­tion that has tra­di­tion­al­ly been the realm of human­ists and philoso­phers , and only recent­ly the sub­ject of a more sci­en­tif­ic approach .
We study grat­i­tude not as a mere­ly aca­d­e­m­ic dis­ci­pline , but as a prac­ti­cal frame­work to bet­ter func­tion­ing in life by tak­ing con­trol of hap­pi­ness lev­els and prac­tic­ing the skill of emo­tion­al self - reg­u­la­tion .
What are the 3 key mes­sages that you would like read­ers to take away from your book ?
First , the prac­tice of grat­i­tude can increase hap­pi­ness lev­els by around 25 % .
Sec­ond , this is not hard to achieve — a few hours writ­ing a grat­i­tude jour­nal over 3 weeks can cre­ate an effect that lasts 6 months if not more .
Third , that cul­ti­vat­ing grat­i­tude brings oth­er health effects , such as longer and bet­ter qual­i­ty sleep time .
What are some ways to prac­tice grat­i­tude , and what ben­e­fits could we expect ?
Please refer to your 2003 paper in the Jour­nal of Per­son­al­i­ty and Social Psy­chol­o­gy , where I found fas­ci­nat­ing quotes such as that “ The abil­i­ty to notice , appre­ci­ate , and sav­ior the ele­ments of one life has been viewed as a cru­cial ele­ment of well - being .
The most com­mon method we use in our research is to ask peo­ple to keep a “ Grat­i­tude Jour­nal ” where you write some­thing you feel grate­ful for .
Doing so 4 times a week , for as lit­tle as 3 weeks , is often enough to cre­ate a mean­ing­ful dif­fer­ence in one lev­el of hap­pi­ness .
Anoth­er exer­cise is to write a “ Grat­i­tude Let­ter ” to a per­son who has exert­ed a pos­i­tive influ­ence on one ’s life but whom we have not prop­er­ly thanked in the past , and then to meet that per­son and read the let­ter to them face to face .
The ben­e­fits seem to be very sim­i­lar using both meth­ods in terms of enhanced hap­pi­ness , health and well­be­ing .
Most of the out­comes are self - report­ed , but there is an increas­ing empha­sis on mea­sur­ing objec­tive data such as cor­ti­sol and stress lev­els , heart rate vari­abil­i­ty , and even brain acti­va­tion pat­terns .
The work of Richard David­son is exem­plary in that respect , show­ing how mind­ful­ness prac­tice can rewire some acti­va­tion pat­terns in the frontal lobes .
Now , let me give an overview of the paper you men­tion , titled Count­ing Bless­ings ver­sus Bur­dens : An Exper­i­men­tal Inves­ti­ga­tion of Grat­i­tude and Sub­jec­tive Well - Being in Dai­ly Life ( note : ref­er­ence below ) .
The paper includes 3 sep­a­rate stud­ies , so I will just be able to pro­vide a quick glimpse .
More than a hun­dred adults were all asked to keep a jour­nal , and were ran­dom­ly assigned to 3 dif­fer­ent groups .
Group
A had to write about things they felt grate­ful about .
Group B about things they found annoy­ing , irri­tat­ing .
Group C about things that had had a major impact on them .
2 out of the 3 dif­fer­ent exper­i­ments were rel­a­tive­ly intense and short term ( keep­ing a dai­ly jour­nal for 2 – 3 weeks ) , while one required a week­ly entry dur­ing 10 weeks .
Across the 3 dif­fer­ent stud­ies we found that peo­ple in the grat­i­tude group gen­er­al­ly evi­denced high­er - lev­els of well - being than those in the com­par­i­son con­di­tions , espe­cial­ly when com­pared to Group B ( the one jour­nal­ing about has­sles ) , but also com­pared to the “ neu­tral ” group .
In the longer study , which ran for 10 weeks , we also saw a pos­i­tive effect on hours of sleep and on time spent exer­cis­ing , on more opti­mistic expec­ta­tions for the com­ing week , and few­er report­ed phys­i­cal symp­toms , such as pain .
Addi­tion­al­ly , we observed an increase in report­ed con­nect­ed­ness to oth­er peo­ple and in like­li­hood of help­ing anoth­er per­son deal with a per­son­al prob­lem .
We could then say that we can train our­selves to devel­op a more grate­ful atti­tude and opti­mistic out­look in life , result­ing in well - being and health improve­ments , and even in becom­ing bet­ter - not just hap­pi­er - cit­i­zens .
And prob­a­bly one can expect few neg­a­tive side effects from keep­ing a grat­i­tude jour­nal .
What do you think pre­vents more peo­ple from ben­e­fit­ing from these research find­ings ?
Great ques­tion , I reflect often on that .
My sense is that some peo­ple feel uncom­fort­able talk­ing about these top­ics , since they may sound too spir­i­tu­al , or reli­gious .
Oth­ers sim­ply do n’t want to feel oblig­at­ed to the per­son who helped them , and nev­er come to real­ize the boost in ener­gy , enthu­si­asm , and social ben­e­fits that come from a more grate­ful , con­nect­ed life .
Judith Beck talked to us recent­ly ( inter­view notes here ) about her work help­ing dieters learn impor­tant men­tal skills through cog­ni­tive ther­a­py tech­niques .
You talk about grat­i­tude .
Oth­er pos­i­tive psy­chol­o­gists focus on For­give­ness .
How can we know which of these tech­niques may be help­ful for us ?
The key is to reflect on ones goal and cur­rent sit­u­a­tion .
For exam­ple , the prac­tice of for­give­ness can be most appro­pri­ate for peo­ple who have high lev­els of anger and resent­ment .
Cog­ni­tive ther­a­py has been shown to be very effec­tive against depres­sion .
In a sense both groups are try­ing to elim­i­nate the neg­a­tive .

The term ‘ cognitive map ’ was first used by Edward Tolman in a classic 1948 paper , in which he described the now famous experiments he performed on rats :
In the typical experiment a hungry rat is put at the entrance of the maze … and wanders about … until he finally comes to the food box and eats .
This is repeated …every 24 hours , and the animal tends to make fewer and fewer errors …and to take less and less time between start and goal - box until finally he is … running in a very few seconds from start to goal … [ I ] believe that in the course of learning something like a field map of the environment gets established in the rat ’s brain … [ and that ] incoming impulses are usually worked over and elaborated … into a tentative , cognitive - like map of the environment … indicating routes and paths and environmental relationships .
Tolman ’s theory of the cognitive map was highly influential , but he , and his contemporaries , had few research methods at their disposal .
Today , researchers have a wide variety of techniques available to them ; these techniques enable them to observe the human brain in action while it performs a cognitive task , or to probe the cellular and molecular bases of cognition .
U sing these methods , researchers have confirmed that organisms , including humans , do indeed generate cognitive maps of their environment and use them for spatial navigation .
It is now well established that circuits in the hippocampus and parietal cortex are essential for encoding spatial information , but the cellular mechanisms by which they do so are still largely a mystery .
A new study , published in advance on the Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences website , adds more to the little understanding we have of how individual neurons contribute to the production of a cognitive map .
Using single - unit electrophysiological recordings ,
Sato et al provide strong evidence for the existence of navigation neurons and movement - selective neurons in the medial parietal region of the Japanese macaque monkey ( Macaca fuscata ) .
Two monkeys were taught to use a joystick to navigate through a virtual environment consisting of a two - storey building with 8 rooms on the first floor and 7 on the second .
As the monkeys navigated through the building , the researchers used microelectrodes to record the electrical activity of single cells in the medial parietal region ( MPR , left ) .
Of the 580 cells from which recordings were made , 180 ( or 31 % ) fired in response to the monkeys ’ movements through the virtual environment .
Of these , 77 % were selective for specific movements in specific locations ; these the researchers have termed ‘ navigation neurons ’ ; 14 of the cells ( 8 % ) , named movement - selective neurons , fired in response to a specific movement such as a left or a right turn , irrespective of the location in which the movement was made .
While these cells fired in response to unique combinations of movement and / or location , other cells ( 27 in total , or 15 % ) were non-selective .
For example , one navigation neuron responded when the monkey made a left turn at a specific checkpoint in the building , but not when it made another movement at the same checkpoint or when it made a left turn at any other location .
The researchers then injected the GABA A receptor agonist muscimol into the monkeys ’ MPR .
GABA ( gamma aminobutyric acid ) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system , so activating GABA A receptors with compounds such as muscimol therefore inhibits neuronal activity .
With the MPR ‘ switched off ’ upon injection of muscimol , the monkeys ’ navigation was impaired , and they lost their way when attempting to reach their destination in the virtual building .
This is consistent with studies of patients with damage to the medial parietal region , who can recognize landmarks in their surroundings but cannot determine which route they should take to reach their desired destination .
This film clip shows the performance of one of the monkeys on the navigation task ; the monkey ’s corresponding hand movements can be seen in the inset at the bottom right of the screen :
Investigations of spatial cognition have largely focused on the hippocampus , whose role in such processes has been extensively studied .
The CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus are known to contain place cells , which are also involved in navigation .
Place cells fire when an organism is in a specific location of its environment ; the location to which an individual place cell responds is known as its ‘ place field ’ .
For obvious reasons , researchers rarely get the opportunity to conduct such experiments in humans , and the vast majority of electrophysiological studies have been performed on animals .
However , in 2003 , Ekstrom et al , performed a study that was almost identical to that of the Japaneses team , on epileptic patients who were resistant to pharmacological treatment .
Prior to surgery , the patients ’ brains were invasively monitored with intracranial electrodes so that the surgeons could determine the loci of the seizures .
During the monitoring , the patients played a computer game in which they navigated through a virtual town , and the responses of single neurons in the medial temporal and frontal lobes were recorded .
It was found that 11 % of the cells examined were responsive to specific locations in the virtual town around which the patients moved .
These cells were more prevalent in the hippocampus than in the other brain regions examined – 24 % of all hippocampal cells whose activity was recorded turned out to be place - selective .
The place fields of these cells were in locations of the virtual town that were traversed frequently , but fired independently of the direction in which movement was taking place .
A small number of cells – the so - called ‘ view cells ’ - were location - independent but fired in response to specific objects , such as shop fronts .
Justice Minister Christoph Blocher , the man in the driving seat of the far - right Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) , won the support of only 115 of the 246 lawmakers in the country 's parliament on Wednesday , Dec. 12 .
It was not enough for him to retain his seat in the governing , seven - member Federal Council .
The SVP itself has threatened to pull out of the Federal Council altogether if Blocher was not re-elected , thereby declaring itself the opposition .
Blocher has made enemies with his anti-immigrant rhetoric
The move could plunge the government into a crisis since the nation 's four parties -- the SVP , Christian Democrats , Social Democrats and Free Democrats -- have ruled together since 1959 .
Since that time , the Federal Council has been composed according to the " magic formula " of near - equal representation by all four major parties , which has contributed to Switzerland 's reputation of stability .
In a last - minute gesture , lawmakers and SVP rivals proposed a more moderate candidate -- Blocher 's fellow party member , Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf .
She won the vote , but could still refuse to take up the post , which would then require another round of voting .
Stability at risk ?
The Swiss people themselves ultimately have the final word in politics through the nation 's unique system of referendums .
But , it 's Switzerland 's rock - solid political system that has often been named as the major factor on which the country 's reputation as a financial haven is based .
According to economists , however , the vote ousting Blocher will not shake that position .
" It has no impact on the short - or medium - term economic outlook , " Bank Sarasin economist Alessandro Bee told Reuters news agency .
" Swiss politics is always much ado about nothing . "
Controversial Blocher
Swiss politics : " much ado abuot nothing " ?
During October 's general elections , the SVP gained a record 29 percent of the vote -- the best result for any Swiss party since 1919 .
The election campaign was fraught with factionalism and marred by a riot .
A United Nations expert also denounced the SVP 's tactics as racist .
Since the election in October , two of the co-governing parties , the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats , have voiced their opposition to Blocher gaining a seat in the new government .
With his aggressive stance and inflammatory politics , particularly with regard to his opinions about immigrants and asylum seekers , Blocher has made many enemies in Swiss politics , where consensus usually reigns .
Among voters , however , the SVP as led by Blocher has evolved in the last two decades from a small group with support from the farming community , into a larger right - wing party popular among middle - class voters concerned about crime and immigration .
Date : 17 Apr 97 09:53:23 - 0700 Subject : Re : Apple IIc// IIe graphics modes .
From : " Eric Jacobs " < no@no.no >
Aw.. do n't shoot down the graphics design of the Apple II !
That 's the best part of the whole computer !
Its insanity makes it my personal favorite , I 'll tell you that .
A video system built solely using discrete counters and adders .. that 's pretty impressive .
A lot of the reason the hires color system is so confusing is that it's not built on an RGB color model , but directly on the NTSC composite television standard .
Most other computers ( including the GS ) generate the image in RGB , and then display it .
( When systems like the GS and the Super Nintendo need to output to composite , they encode the RGB signal using a matrix chip , and then send it out . )
The original Apple II , on the other hand , directly generates a composite signal .
In an NTSC video signal , the color ( chrominance ) signal " rides " on a 3.579545 MHz subcarrier .
The subcarrier is then decoded and referenced to an internal oscillator in the TV or monitor , which determines its amplitude and phase .
The amplitude is the color 's " saturation " : how much color there is .
In the Apple , this is always 0 , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % , or 100 % .
The other element is the phase .
The phase specifies an angle in an imaginary color circle .
Thus if the phase of the chrominance signal is exactly in phase with the color reference , it is 0 degrees -- the color is yellow - orange .
180 degrees is blue .
90 degrees is red , and so on .
The internal oscillator is kept in sync by a signal called color burst in the horizontal blanking before every line .
Using the tint knob on the TV and the variable capacitor on the motherboard fine tunes the color reference .
Any 3.579545 MHz component in the video signal will produce a color on the screen .
The Apple II text and hires modes clock the video signal at 7.15909 MHz -- twice that of color burst .
Therefore , the bit pattern 10101010 ... will produce a color on the screen .
The only other color produced that way is its complement , 01010101 ...
In the original Apple II design , these two colors were purple and green ( respectively ) .
Combined with black and white ( which have no color component ) , this gave the original four colors .
After Revision 0 of the Apple II motherboard , additional circuitry was added to produce two more colors .
When bit 7 of the data byte was 1 , a flipflop was selected that would delay the bit stream by 70 ns ( that 's 90 degrees ) .
Thus , the Apple could now generate six colors , black , white , purple , green , blue , and orange ( 135 , 315 , 225 , and 45 degrees to color burst , respectively ) .
The only limitation was that this new palette select bit applied to the entire byte .
So it was not possible to display blue and green in the same byte , for instance .
Now , for Nate 's question about colors spanning bytes with different high bits : if you 're going from D7=0 to D7=1 , the flipflop holds the bit for an extra 70 ns .
This creates a bit pattern that 's a different color entirely : in fact , it is a 25 % or 75 % - intensity color from the lores palette !
For example , going from green to orange will give you yellow ; purple and blue will give you light blue .
This same phenomenon is also responsible for the Mysterious Pink Line .
This is a orange - pinkish line that appears under certain conditions along the left edge of the screen .
It occurs when bit 7 of the left edge of the screen is set , and bit 6 of the previous byte is also set .
The flipflop holds that value of bit 6 during the first 70 ns of the first byte of the new line .
The result is an eerie pink half - dot at the left end of that line .
For example , for scan line # 1 , set $ 2080 to $ 80 , and $ 207 F to $ 40 .
$ 207 F -- an unused screen location ( screen hole ) -- is actually being used to store that dot !
Sadly , the Myserious Pink Line is not correctly emulated under the Apple IIGS 's video chip .
It seems that Apple 's engineers had the sudden thought that maybe the Apple II video modes should make sense .. i dunno .
Actually the Apple II 's video could have been much better if Apple had adhered closer to the NTSC video standard .
For example , the number of cycles of color ref in one horizontal line should be 227.5 , not 228 .
The number of lines per field should be 262.5 , not 262 .
( Apparently , Woz much preferred integers . )
Although these deviations seem small , they actually would have fixed many of the color anomalies , including virtually eliminating that annoying color fringing .
Just take a look at the Nintendo or Super Nintendo 's color display .. it 's absolutely beautiful .
There are no wacky color fringes on those machines .
Or look at the credits to a movie on your VCR .
That text is no bigger than an 80 - column display , and it looks great .
Ah , the wonders of composite video .. now how can the GS and its dumb old SHR compare to this ?? :)

In this era of pervasive broadband , I 'm constantly surprised how often I am forced to buy a physical CD or DVD to obtain the software I want .
Physical distribution methods have their place , but they should be on the decline by now .
Software is best distributed digitally through our high - speed internet connections -- using BitTorrent if necessary .
Instead , I find that download options for commercial software are quite rare .
Even when the download option is available , you end up paying the same price as retail or even more .
Here 's a typical example .
I purchased Titan Quest : Gold from Steam about a month ago .
I paid $ 29.95 , which is the standard retail box price .
But online discounters sell boxed copies of the very same game for $ 22.90 .
Digital Distribution : $ 29.95 Retail Copy : $ 22.90
Selling directly to the consumer via download means bypassing the entire brick and mortar sales chain .
This should result in cheaper prices than retail , not the same prices -- and it should never result in higher prices .
Paying a premium for the privilege of downloading software is complete ripoff , and yet it happens all the time .
In this case , Valve is the distributor , so they 're getting a healthy cut of the sale price ( rumor says 50 % ) .
That 's still a fantastic deal compared to retail software sales , where the authors will be lucky to get 10 % of the sale price .
But this " download is the same cost as retail " pricing strategy is particularly egregious when you buy the software directly from the company who created it .
That 's pure profit , as Greg Costikyan points out :
If you can retain the right to sell [ your software ] off your own site , do , obviously .
Even if your traffic is low , you keep 90 % of the revenues , and that 's gravy .
Microsoft does allow us to purchase and download upgrade versions of Vista digitally .
But as usual , you 'll be paying full retail price for the privilege .
The downloadable Vista Ultimate upgrade is $ 259.95 , but you can purchase the same product in a retail box for $ 249.99 .
Digital Distribution : $ 259.95 Retail Copy : $ 249.99
I do n't mean to single out Microsoft here .
At least they provide the download option for Vista ( but , oddly , not for Office , their other cash cow ) .
I 've also purchased games directly from EA using their EA Link download service , and you always pay full retail price there , too .
Sadly , paying full retail price to download software is a standard practice in the software industry .
Oh sure , sometimes they 'll throw in some cheesy extras like downloadable soundtracks and so forth -- but does that really make up for the fact that you just increased their profit margin on the sale by a factor of five ?
I do n't think so .
About the only " benefit " of buying game software digitally is that they 'll ( sometimes ) let you unlock it on midnight of the street date , so you get a few bonus hours of play before everyone else .
I can understand the desire not to undercut their own distribution channel .
I 'm sure Best Buy would n't be too happy with Microsoft or EA selling software directly to consumers for less than they can on their store shelves .
But do vendors assume we are completely ignorant of basic retail economics ?
Digital software distribution should cost less :
When vendors sell direct , it 's insanely profitable ( 90 % profit )
When selling through a third - party portal , it 's still extremely profitable , far more than retail sales .
( 50 % profit )
It 's more efficient .
There are no trucks full of boxes , manuals , jewelcases , and other atoms to be distributed across the world .
Distribution costs effectively drop to zero .
It 's more work for consumers .
There are a bunch of additional hoops you do n't have with physical media , such as DRM wrappers , helper software to install , and a long download period .
It should n't be like this .
Standard Vista style online activation from an ISO image should be all that 's required .
But you typically get hogtied into vendor - specific downloaders and wrappers that have to be installed on your machine , such as Steam , and the EA downloader .
Unfortunately , the state of digital software distribution is so bad right now that it 's almost a parody of itself .
It should be a wondrous , democratizing tool that pushes software pricing down by naturally leveraging the inherent efficiency of bits over atoms .
Instead , as it exists today , the digital distribution of commercial software is intentionally crippled .
It 's only useful for the rich and impatient , a fact vendors exploit to line their pockets with obscene profit margins ( even by software industry standards , which is saying a lot ) .
The average consumer avoids digital software distribution entirely in favor of retail discounters .
Can you blame them ?
With every download at retail prices , you 're effectively paying vendors five times as much for the same software , and that 's a huge ripoff .
It seems to me that , in the area of digital distribution efficiencies , commercial software still has a lot to learn from the open source world -- where everything is downloadable by design .
I hope they can adapt before they 're forced into extinction .
Every Wednesday is Simplicity Day on Zen Habits .
One of the most rewarding changes in my life in the last couple of years has been finding peace with a morning routine .
I ’ve made it a habit to wake before most of the world , at about 4:30 a.m. , and just enjoy the quiet and solitude .
It has made all the difference in the world .
I sit quietly with a cup of coffee , and enjoy the silence .
I go for a morning run , which relieves stress and is perfect for contemplation .
I use the quiet time before my family awakes to write something each morning .
I read , as a good novel is one of my favorite companions .
Now , not everyone is a morning person , of course .
But that does n’t mean you ca n’t create your own routine , one that incorporates something that gives you solitude , quiet , or stress release .
While morning is an ideal time for such a routine , other ideal times are after work and before bed — and really , any time that works for you is good .
I recommend that if you have n’t yet , you create your own calming routine .
Give it a couple of weeks to become a habit , focusing on doing it every day , and soon , you will not want to miss it .
Here are just a few ideas to get you started :
Lately , with the popularity of President Bush in the low twenties , and the Supreme court tilting toward the right , and no one trusting voting results , I wonder what it would take to spark a revolution , or a coup .
The thing with history is that nothing seems likely until after it happens .
So if your first reaction is to dismiss this possibility because it ’s unlikely , you have n’t studied history .
Everything that happens is unlikely .
So what series of events could cause an uprising ?
While I am not predicting it will happen , I think it ’s more possible than you think .
Let ’s say , for the sake of argument , the following series of events unfold :
1. McCain , behind in the polls , somehow wins the nomination and the general election .
2. McCain ’s win causes mistrust in voting machines , for reasons either real or imagined .
3. McCain intensifies the war in Iraq because he thinks it ’s the right thing for the country .
4. Protesters take to the streets in sixties fashion .
There are clashes with police .
The media makes this THE story .
5. McCain , one of our oldest candidates , dies in office from natural causes .
His vice president assumes the job .
The vice president , chosen to appease the conservative base , is the most right wing politician ever , and makes Dick Cheney look like Bambii .
6 . The new Vice President cracks down hard on protesters .
He starts suspending even more civil liberties .
Martial law is discussed as if it is imminent .
7 . An opening on the Supreme Court allows the new president to push a conservative into the slot .
This moves the court completely to the right .
All abortions are banned in the United States .
8 . The war in Iraq spreads to Iran , where once again , no signs of nuclear weapons production are found .
This added war is so unpopular with the rest of the world that allies start withdrawing from NATO to form their own defense club .
9 . Strained by the war in Iraq , and now Iran , and potentially Syria , the American economy crumbles .
Now would there be a revolution ?
And which part of this scenario could n’t happen ?
Recent days have seen Dick Cheney and Tony Blair point belligerent fingers at Tehran , but both spoke in the slipstream of Bernard Kouchner , who a month ago warned the world that it should prepare for war over Iran 's nuclear programme .
" We have to prepare for the worst , and the worst is war , " said the French minister of foreign affairs .
The swell of rhetoric - which culminated in President Bush 's assertion last week that a nuclear - armed Iran could provoke a third world war - is gravely undermined by what Sir John Holmes , the UN 's emergency relief coordinator , has called the " taint of Iraq " , and the weapons of mass destruction pretext for invasion .
Why should we believe the US and its allies now , when we were already so brutally deceived ?
There is , however , another aspect of Kouchner 's warning that is much more worrying .
When the newly elected French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , nominated Kouchner , the great humanitarian , as the head of Quai d'Orsay , even some of Sarkozy 's critics hailed this as a pleasant surprise .
Now the meaning of this nomination is clear : the return of the ideology of " militaristic humanism " .
The problem with militaristic humanism resides not in " militaristic " but in " humanism " .
Under this doctrine , military intervention is dressed up as humanitarian salvation , justified according to depoliticised , universal human rights , so that anyone who opposes it is not only taking the enemy 's side in an armed conflict but betraying the international community of civilised nations .
This is why , in the new global order , we no longer have wars in the old sense of regulated conflict between sovereign states in which certain rules apply ( the treatment of prisoners , the prohibition of certain weapons , etc ) .
We instead confront violations of the rules of universal human rights ; they do not count as wars proper , and call for the " humanitarian pacifist " intervention of the western powers - especially in the case of direct attacks on the US or other representatives of the new global order .
One can hardly imagine a neutral humanitarian organisation such as the Red Cross mediating between the warring parties , organising the exchange of prisoners , and so on .
For one side in the conflict already assumes the role of the Red Cross - it does not perceive itself as one of the warring sides but as a mediating agent of peace and global order .
The key question is , thus : who is this " we " on behalf of whom Kouchner , Blair et al are speaking ?
Who is included in it and who is excluded ?
Is this " we " really " the world " , the apolitical community of civilised people acting on behalf of human rights ?
We got an unexpected answer ( or , rather , a complication ) to this question last week , when , in defiance of pressure from the US , Turkey 's parliament overwhelmingly granted permission for its government to launch military operations into Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish rebels .
Syria 's president , Bashar Assad , while visiting Turkey , declared his support of Turkey 's right to take action " against terrorism and terrorist activities " .
With the likelihood of Turkey launching a cross - border attack under the banner of the war on terror growing by the minute , it is as if an intruder has gate - crashed the closed circle of " we " , the domain of those who hold the de facto monopoly on military humanitarianism .
What makes the situation unpleasant is not Turkey 's " otherness " , but its claim to sameness .
What such a situation reveals is the set of unwritten rules and silent prohibitions that qualifies the " we " of the enlightened humanity .
It is not the first time Turkey has been a thorn in the side of the cosy western consensus .
The crisis of the EU today springs to a large degree from its would - be member .
According to polls , the main reason for no votes at the ill - fated referendums in France and the Netherlands was opposition to Turkish membership .
The no can be grounded in rightist - populist terms ( no to the threat to our culture , no to immigrant labour ) , or in liberal - multiculturalist terms ( no to its treatment of the Kurds , no to its record on human rights ) .
The Turkish problem - the perplexity of the EU with regard to what to do with Turkey - is not about Turkey as such , but the confusion about what is Europe itself .
The impasse with the European constitution , and European leaders ' efforts to persuade their electorates that the treaty agreed last week does not need a referendum - is a sign the European project is now in search of its identity .
In his Notes Towards the Definition of Culture , the great conservative TS Eliot remarked there are moments when the only choice is the one between sectarianism and non-belief , when the only way to keep a religion alive is to perform a sectarian split from its main corpse .
This is our only chance today : only by means of a " sectarian split " from the standard European legacy , by cutting ourselves off the decaying corpse of old Europe , can we keep the renewed European legacy alive .
The task is difficult , it compels us to take a great risk of stepping into the unknown , yet its only alternative is slow decay , the transformation of Europe into what Greece was for the mature Roman empire , a destination for nostalgic cultural tourism with no effective relevance .

Loop Patterns

Background
There are many ways to look at patterns .
An especially useful way to think of patterns is as a tool for teaching .
We do n't use patterns blindly ; we learn them .
Patterns are all about learning successful techniques , understanding when and how to use them .
At ChiliPLoP '98 , a small group of computer science educators gathered to think about and write patterns appropriate for novices learning to program in the first two years of undergraduate instruction .
( For more information or to become involved in this ongoing project , visit the elementary patterns web page . )
The patterns contained here were first discussed and written as a part of the ChiliPLoP workshop .
They are , we hope , the beginnings of what will be a pattern language for helping novice programmers construct loops .
Writing loops is the basis for many of the problems students attempt to solve when writing programs in Algol - like languages .
( In functional languages such as Scheme , recursion is typically used for repetition instead of loops .
See , for example , Roundabout , a pattern language for recursive programming that was workshopped at PLoP ' 97 . )
We focused our initial efforts on identifying specific problems that students encounter when learning to write loops .
This lead us to several specific patterns .
At this point , they are only rather loosely related , but we hope that they serve as a useful starting point for a more extensive documenting effort .
Linear Search
You are working with a collection or stream of objects .
How do you find an object that meets a specific condition ?
Suppose that you have a set of students , and you would like to find the first student with an " A " average .
In the worst case , you will look at the whole collection before finding your target .
But , if you find a match sooner , you would like to terminate the search and work with the object that you found .
Therefore , construct a Process All Items loop , but provide a way to exit the loop early should you find your target sooner .
Express your student search as :
for ( i = 0 ; i < students.size ( ) ; i++) if ( student[i].grade ( ) .isAnA ( ) ) break ; // process student [ i ] , who has an A
If it is possible that you will not find your target , be sure to do a Guarded Linear Search .
Guarded Linear Search
You are doing a Linear Search .
How do you handle the possibility that no target may be found ?
What happens if it is possible that no student has an " A " average ?
Your loop will look at the entire collection and still not find a target .
But the code that follows the loop assumes that student [ i ] is the target .
Therefore , follow the loop with an Alternative Action that treats the " not found " situation as a special case .
Express your student search as :
for ( i = 0 ; i < students.size ( ) ; i++) if ( student [ i].grade ( ) .isAnA ( ) ) break ; if ( i < students.size ( ) ) // found it ! // process student [ i ] , who has an A else // handle the exception
[ Resulting context ... ]
Process All Items
You are writing code that manipulates a collection .
How do you process all of the items in the collection ?
The collection might be an array , a bag , a hashtable , a stream , or a file -- in general , items stored in some structure and made accessible to the programmer through some collection / iterator interface .
You want to process all of the items in an identical manner .
You may need to process all of the items because in the worst case all items must be processed ( Linear Search ) , or because all items must be processed even in the best case , in order to ensure correctness ( Extreme Values ) .
There are two kinds of process - all - items loops : a definite loop that uses indexing when the number of indexable items in a collection is known in advance , and an iterating loop when an iterating interface is used to access the items in a collection sequentially .
Therefore choose the appropriate loop and loop pattern for processing all the items in the collection once .
Definite Process All Items
You are writing a Process All Items loop for an indexable collection , the number of items in the collection can be determined simply ( in constant time ) and indexing is constant time .
How do you access every indexable item ?
The collection might be a vector or a string where the number of elements in the collection can be determined by a function call , or the number of items might be another variable associated with the collection , e.g. , as a parameter to a function or a field in a class .
Therefore use a Definite Process All Items for loop to touch evey element in the collection .
Example
The items are stored in a vector .
Use a definite loop to process all the items , even for algorithms like Linear Search .
In C ++:
for ( int k=0 ; k < v.size ( ) ; k++) { process v[k ] }
Iterator Process All Items
How do you access every item in the collection ?
The items may be stored in a collection with a standard iterator interface , e.g. , a Java enumeration .
The items may be stored in a simple linked list where there is no explicit iterator interface , but ( iterating ) links must be followed .
Therefore use an iterator process all items while loop that tests the iterator to see if it is finished .
Examples
Hashtable table = new Hashtable ( ) ; // code to put values in table Enumeration e = table.keys ( ) ; while ( e.hasMoreElements ( ) ) { process ( table.get(e.nextElement ( ) ) ) ; }
In C++ processing a linked list requires an iterating pointer variable :
Node * ptr = first ; while ( ptr != NULL ) { process ( ptr - > info ) ; ptr = ptr->next ; }
The Iterator pattern is widely known from the GOF patterns book , but is mentioned as an idiom in Coplien 's Advanced C++
Loop and a Half
You are writing a Process All Items loop .
How do you structure the loop when the number of items in the collection is n't known in advance and the items are provided one - at - a - time ?
For example , you might be reading values from the keyboard or from a file .
In general , you are processing all items until a sentinel is reached .
The sentinel may be end - of - file , a valid value for the type of data being read , or an exception .
The loop requires priming to read / get the first value , a loop guard to test for the sentinel , and another read / get inside the loop .
This leads to duplicate code for the read / get and makes the loop body harder to understand since it turns a read - and - process loop into a process - and - read loop .
Therefore , use a while - true loop with a break in the loop body to avoid duplicate code and to match your intuition that the loop is a read - and - process loop .
For example , consider pseudocode for a sentinel loop :
read value while ( value != sentinel ) process value read value
This can be rewritten as
while ( true ) read value if ( value == sentinel ) break ; process value
Although the break is essentially a goto and thus violates a canon of structured programming , it results in code that it easier to develop Roberts .
Because there is no code duplication the code should be easier to maintain and easier to understand --- see Assign Variables Once and Local Variables Reassigned Above Their Uses .
[ Resulting Context : Patterns for writing ( compound ) Boolean expressions . ]
Polling Loop
You are writing a program that asks the user to enter a data value .
How do you poll until the user enters a valid data item ?
For example , suppose that we want the user to enter a legal grade , between 0 and 100 inclusive .
Many languages provide a do ... while ... construct that allows direct testing of a value after entry .
For example :
do { cout << " Enter a grade between 0 and 100 , inclusive : " ; cin >> grade ; } while ( grade < 0 || grade > 100 )
This solution gives the same prompt on all requests , so the user may be confused by the repetition .
The test is negative , which requires students to use DeMorgan 's laws to write the condition .
Instead , you could follow the data entry with an explicit validation loop :
cout << " Enter a grade between 0 and 100 , inclusive : " ; cin >> grade ; while ( grade < 0 || grade > 100 ) { cout << " Sorry !
That is an illegal value . " << endl ; cout << " Enter a grade between 0 and 100 , inclusive : " ; cin >> grade ; }
This solution replicates the prompt code .
We can lessen the negative effect by making the prompt a procedure call .
But , the test is still written in the negative , which is difficult to do -- and undo , for the reader who wants to know what the legal values are .
Both of these solutions stop processing when the negative condition fails , and the prompting sequence is difficult .
Therefore , use a loop and a half .
Write a positive condition that stops the repetition when the user enters a legal value .
So , you might solve your grade - entering as :
while ( 1 ) { cout << " Enter a grade between 0 and 100 , inclusive : " ; cin >> grade ; if ( grade >= 0 && grade <= 100 ) break ; cout << " Sorry !
That is an illegal value . " << endl ; }
If the condition that stops the loop is compound ( or always ? ? ) , Use a Function for a Compound Boolean .
Extreme Values
You are writing code to find extreme values , for example the maximum and minimum in a collection or sequence of values .
What kind of loop do you use and how do you initialize the variables that track the extreme values ?
You must process all items in the collection to ensure that the correct extreme values are found .
The same forces are at play that help to identify a Definite Process All Items and a Iterator Process All Items loop .
The principle difficulty in writing code to find extreme values is determining initial values for the variables that represent the extreme value so far e.g. , currentMin and currentMax .
The invariant for currentMin is that it represents the minimal value of all the values processed so far .
The best method for establishing this invariant is to use the first value of the collection for the initialization , but this can lead to the kind of duplicate code seen in the Loop and a Half pattern .
The range of values from which the extreme values are chosen is a force that affects the algorithm / code .
For example , if extreme values are chosen from integers or doubles ( floating point numbers ) there are largest and smallest values ; effectively there are values for infinity and negative infinity .
For other types there may be no effective values for infinity , e.g. , in choosing the largest or smallest string lexicogaphically there is no maximal string value ( there may be a smallest string , usually the empty string " " is less than any non-empty string ) .
Therefore , use the appropriate Process All Items loop and initialize extreme values to the first value in the collection from which extreme values are determined ( care must be taken if the collection is empty ) .
If possible , use indices , pointers , or references rather than values of objects / variables , i.e. , keep track of the index of the current minimum in an array rather than the current minimal value .
The value can be determined from the index , pointer , or reference .
Examples
Find the largest and smallest values in a vector of strings in C ++.
Use a Definite Process All Items loop and initialize current min and max indexing variables to the first value in the vector .
vector a ; // code that puts values in a using push_back int minIndex = 0 ; // index of minimum values between 0 and k int maxIndex = 0 ; // index of maximum values between 0 and k int k ; for ( k=1 ; k < a.size ( ) ; k++) { if ( a [ k ] < a[ minIndex ] ) minIndex = k ; if ( a [ k ] > a[ maxIndex ] ) maxIndex = k ; } // minimal string stored in a[ minIndex ] // maximal string stored in a[ maxIndex ]
It 's possible to write a generic function that returns the minimal value in a vector / array :
template Type min( const vector & a ) // precondition : a contains a.size ( ) values , values in a comparable by < // postcondition : returns the index of the smallest value in a { int minIndex = 0 ; // index of minimal value in a [ 0..k ] int k ; for ( k=1 ; k < a.size ( ) ; k++) { if ( a [ k ] < a[ minIndex ] ) minIndex = k ; } return a[ minIndex ] ;
In Java this could be written as follows :
class Extreme { /** * @param a is Vector of values that implement Comparable * @returns the the smallest object in the Vector */ public static Object min( Vector a ) { int minIndex = 0 ; int k ; for ( k=1 ; k < a.length ( ) ; k++) { if ( a.elementAt(k).compareTo(a.elementAt(minIndex ) ) < 0 ) { minIndex = 0 ; } } return a.elementAt( minIndex ) ; } } ;
You are finding the extreme values in a stream of string values using C++.
The collection here uses an iterator interface , where the interface is the C++ convention of reading the stream and using the returned state of the stream to indicate when the iteration is finished .
The first values read , if any , are used to initialize the extreme values .
It is not possible to use indexes or references to maintain the extreme values , so the values themselves are stored .
void findMinMax ( istream & input , string & min , string & max ) // postcondition : min is the minimal value in stream input , // max is the maximal value in stream input { string current ; if ( input >> current ) { min = current ; max = current ; } while ( input >> current ) { if ( current < min ) min = current ; if ( current > max ) max = current ; } }
There is duplicated code for reading values in the code fragment above .
It 's possible to avoid duplicated code when the range of values has effective values for positive and negative infinity .
You are finding the extreme values in a stream of double values .
You want to avoid duplicated reading code .
Therefore , initialize current min and max to positive and negative infinity ( and use <= and >= for comparisons ) .
void findMinMax ( istream & input , double & min , double & max ) // postcondition : min is the minimal value in stream input , // max is the maximal value in stream input { double min = DBL_MAX ; // #include for DBL_MAX double max = DBL_MIN ; double current ; while ( input >> current ) { if ( current <= min ) min = current ; if ( current >= max ) max = current ; } }
One Loop for Linear Structures
You are writing Simply Understood Code( Gabriel ) , code whose intent and correctness are not apparent .
How do you write code that processes data stored in a linear structure , such as an array , list , or file ?
Developing such code is not trivial , because you think that complex control structures are needed to implement the algorithm , or because of special cases .
Algorithmically , a problem may seem to call for multiple loops to match intuition on how control structures are used to program a solution to the problem , but the data is stored sequentially , e.g. , in an array or a file .
Programming based on control leads to more problems than programming based on structure .
Therefore , use the structure of the data to guide the programmed solution : one loop for sequential data with appropriately Guarded Conditionals ( ? ) to implement the control .
The structure of the source of data is the guide for using this pattern , not the structure of how the data is processed or where information is written .
For example , in processing a file representing a black - and - white bitmap stored as run-length encoded zeros and ones , e.g. , 5 3 4 represents 000001110000 , the structure of the file dictates using one loop while the structure of the image dictates using two loops .
Use one loop because the data is stored in a file .
Examples
void removedups ( vector & a , int & n ) // precondition : a [ 0 ] <= a [ 1 ] <= ... <= a[n - 1 ] // postcondition : all duplicates removed from a , // n = # elements in a { int k ; int uniqueCount = 1 ; // invariant : no duplicates in a [ 0 ] .. a[ uniqueCount - 1 ] for ( k=1 ; k < n ; k++ ) { if ( a [ k ] != a[ uniqueCount - 1 ] ) { a[ uniqueCount ] = a[k ] ; uniqueCount ++ ; } } n = uniqueCount ; }
A more elabore example of Quicksort Partition is given in an appendix .
Loop Invariant / Loop Initialization
You are writing a loop whose termination / continuation conditions are determined by values of local variables .
How do you determine the initial values of the variables ?
The name of each variable should indicate its role in the loop and the invariant property that holds for the variable .
A comment that expresses the invariant property should accompany each variable whose name does not immediately convey the invariant property .
Explicitly identifying the invariant for each variable used in the loop is a start .
The invariant helps determine what the initial values are since the invariant must be true the first time the loop test is evaluated .
See the example of removing duplicated elements in the One Loop for Linear Structures pattern .
For example ,
You are writing code to find the date on which Thanksgiving , the fourth Thursday in November , occurs .
You decide to start on the first day of the month , and iterate through days counting Thursdays .
Your first loop is :
Date d( 11,1,1998 ) ; int thursdayCount = 0 ; // # of thursdays while ( thursdayCount < 4 ) { if ( d.DayName ( ) == " Thursday " ) { thursdayCount ++ ; } d++ ; } // d is Thanksgiving
You recognize a problem with this solution : d is incremented as the last statement in the loop so it will be one day after Thanksgiving when the loop terminates .
You may decide to move d++ before the if statement in the loop , or to rewrite the if statement as an if / else statement .
The problem here is not with the loop body per se , it is with the initialization of the variable thursdayCount ; what does thursdayCount count ?
Therefore you must explicitly identify what is tracked / counted , what is the invariant property that holds for thursdayCount .
In this case you want thursdayCount to be the number of Thursdays in November on or before Date d.
You attempt to verify that the invariant holds the first time the loop test is evaluated and see that it will not hold when November 1 is a Thursday .
You could initialize based on what day of the week November 1 falls on as shown below , but you want to avoid special cases .
if ( d.DayName ( ) == " Thursday " ) thursdayCount = 1 ; else thursdayCount = 0 ;
To ensure that the invariant holds the first time the loop test is evaluated , you initialize d to the last day in October rather than the first day of November :
Date d( 11,1,1998 ) ; d--; // last day of October , month before int thursdayCount = 0 ; // # thursdays on or before d while ( thursdayCount < 4 ) { d++ ; if ( d.DayName ( ) == " Thursday " ) { thursdayCount ++ ; } } // d is Thanksgiving

Appendix : The Quicksort Partition
The partition phase of quicksort for arrays is a classic example .
Most textbooks use a complicated solution in which an outer loop is essentially a Process All Items loop wrapped around two inner loops that move indices delineating the two sections of the array .
This three - loop solution is difficult for students to understand , easy to code incorrectly , and harder to generalize to a three - phase partition required to avoid bad asymptotic performance when duplicate elements are stored in an array .
Using One Loop for Linear Structures in conjunction with Process All Items leads to the code shown below ( taken from Engineering a Sort Function ) .
int partition ( vector & a , int left , int right ) // precondition : left <= right // postcondition : rearranges entries in vector a // returns pivot such that // forall k , left <= k <= pivot , a[ k ] <= a[ pivot ] and // forall k , pivot < k <= right , a[ pivot ] < a[k ] // { int k , pivot = left ; string center = a [ left ] ; for ( k=left +1 , k <= right ; k++ ) { if ( a [ k ] <= center ) { pivot ++ ; swap ( a[k ] , a[ pivot ] ) ; } } swap ( a [ left ] , a[ pivot ] ) ; return pivot ; }
The invariant for this can be shown pictorially .
Not only is this code simpler to understand than the code shown in many texts , it is more easily generalized to the three - phase " fat partition " ( see Bentley ) in which elements equal to the pivot are treated separately and put in their own partition .
A fat partition scheme is necessary to avoid O ( n2 ) performance for arrays with many duplicate items .
Fat partitioning yields a section of elements equal to the pivot element as well as sections less than and greater than the pivot element ( two values are returned from the function and no recursion occurs on the equal section ) .
It is also simple to include a median - of - three partition by swapping the median value into the left - most entry before the loop begins .
The code below is indicative of partition functions developed without the benefit of the one loop for linear structures pattern , it appears in the text by Sahni .
On the surface this code is harder to reason about and harder to adapt to the " fat partition " scheme .
int partition ( vector & a , int left , int right ) // precondition : left <= right // postcondition : rearranges entries in vector a // returns pivot such that // forall k , left <= k <= pivot , a[ k ] <= a[ pivot ] and // forall k , pivot < k <= right , a[ pivot ] < a[k ] // { int i = left , j = right + 1 ; string pivot = a [ left ] ; while ( true ) { do{ i++ ; } while ( a [ i ] < pivot ) ; do{ j--; } while ( a[j ] > pivot ) ; if ( i >= j ) break ; swap ( a [ i ] , a[j ] ) ; } a[ left ] = a[j ] ; a[j ] = pivot ; return j ; }
Code developed with multiple loops can be more efficient .
For example , the final , fully - tuned version of partition in Bentley uses the loops - in - a - loop coding style shown in the Sahni example .

For dog lovers there is only one ' lifetime dog '
1 / 1 Back to Gallery
So there I was by myself , sitting outside Tully 's and enjoying a latte while reading the paper , when a young woman approached me .
" Excuse me , " she said with a concerned look .
" Is your dog OK ? "
Who was this person ?
Puzzled , I reassured her that Elvis was fine .
He 'd gone on a long walk earlier that morning and could n't be budged off his La - Z - Dog recliner .
I had to ask .
" I 'm sorry , but do I know you ? "
" No , " she replied , smiling .
" It 's just that I see you around town and you 're never without your dog .
I wanted to be sure he 's OK . "
She was right .
Without thinking about it , my greyhound , Elvis , has become such an integral part of my life that even strangers see me incomplete without him .
Although I 've loved many dogs since childhood , none have been like this one .
To use an expression coined by " A Good Dog " author Jon Katz , Elvis is my " lifetime dog , " a dog that I 'll hold dear long after he 's gone and others have staked their spot on the sofa .
" So many people told me they had one dog in their life that meant everything to them , that stood out in their hearts and memories , " Katz responded when I sent him an e-mail asking about the expression .
" Sometimes it was a dog that entered their life at a critical juncture or changed their life .
When people hear the term , they all nod .
Loving a dog can be a powerful experience . "
Indeed .
Because Elvis is n't " just " a pet .
He 's my companion , my friend , my joy .
He is n't a replacement for the husband I never married or the children I never had , as is the common stereotype of single people .
Johnny Depp could be my betrothed and cherubs my children .
I would n't love this dog one iota less .
When Stu and Barbara Homer of Golden State Greyhound Adoption delivered Elvis to my home on that hot June day five years ago , I had no idea what a life - altering occasion it was .
As the underweight ex-racer jumped out of their truck and I met my new trembling , deer - like dog , I was struck by two emotions : first , delight that he was so pretty , immediately followed by sheer terror : how would I manage this horse in my house ?
But over the next few weeks , as we adjusted -- he to his new home and me to my new dog -- we began to establish our life together , the one that I cherish today .
I love that Elvis greets me at the door with a toy in his mouth , jumping with joy whether I 've been gone 10 minutes or 10 hours .
I love how he rests his head on my lap while I 'm watching TV , wanting nothing more than to feel my touch .
I love how he gobbles his food with gusto and then , with kernels of rice still on his nose , does a happy little trot as if to offer his compliments to the chef .
I love how he meanders over to my bed every night after I 've turned out the lights and taps my face with his soft , wet nose before retiring to his La - Z - Dog recliner .
I love caring for Elvis , stroking his knobby head , rubbing his velvety ears , observing him with other dogs , other people .
Such as my neighbors ' 15 - month - old baby , the adorable Isabella .
When Bella sees Elvis , she flaps her arms like she 's preparing for liftoff and -- having walked for all of three weeks -- stumbles unafraid toward the great big dog .
Elvis , who towers over the tiny toddler by a good 10 inches , leans down and gently nuzzles Bella 's cheek and she gurgles with unabashed joy .
Talk about your Kodak moment .
Today , when I look at my beloved dog who will soon turn 8 , I can't help but note his gray muzzle and eyebrows .
Like his human , Elvis is showing signs of age .
And unlike the life I might have enjoyed with the man I never married or children I never had , I realize , with an ache , that our time together will be much too brief .
That explains why I 'm so fond of one particular " Twilight Zone " episode .
Titled " The Hunt , " it features a recently deceased man and his dog .
As they amble down a country road in the hereafter , they come upon a gate .
" Welcome to heaven ! " the gatekeeper declares .
Except for the dog , that is .
" What kind of heaven wo n't allow dogs ? " the old man asks .
" If he can't come in , then I 'll stay out with him .
He 's been my faithful companion all his life .
I can't desert him now . "
So the old man continues down the road with his dog .
Later , they come upon another gate .
" Welcome to heaven ! " the gatekeeper greets both man and dog .
When the old man inquires about the previous gatekeeper 's proclamation , he learns it was the devil .
" He gets people who are willing to give up a lifelong companion for a comfortable place to stay , " the old man is told .
" They soon find out their mistake , but then it 's too late . "
And man and dog pass through the gates , toward the light .
Toward heaven .
When I cradle my dog's face in my hands and look into his liquid eyes , so full of unwavering loyalty and love , there 's no doubt .
Elvis is my faithful companion .
My lifetime dog .
And this is heaven .
Ask the vet
This month 's guest veterinarian is Gilbert T. Robello of PetCare Veterinary Hospital , 1370 Fulton Road , Santa Rosa ; phone ( 707 ) 579-5900 ; online at www.pcvh.com.
Q : My 9 - year - old yellow lab has dysplasia in both elbows .
He takes glucosamine and chondroitin daily and has since he was 6 months old .
When he 's a real devil dog and overdoes it , he gets a Deramaxx .
Any updates on what can be done for this condition ?
We were told he would be lame by age 5 .
A : Elbow dysplasia is an inherited , developmental , degenerative disease of the elbow joint that is more common in medium - and large - breed dogs .
The condition starts at 4 to 6 months old , and causes lameness and arthritis .
Diagnosis is made by a physical exam and radiographs .
Early surgical intervention ( arthroscopic or conventional ) can provide relief and slow arthritic progression .
Treatment of arthritis secondary to elbow dysplasia includes rest and an anti-inflammatory drug until the lameness improves .
Consistent , moderate , low - impact activities help to maintain muscle tone .
Keep your dog lean -- obesity puts a great deal of stress on joints and causes more discomfort .
Continue the glucosamine / chondroitin supplement .
If medical management fails to provide relief , surgical options of elbow replacement or arthrodesis ( fusing the joint ) can be considered .
Research Box Title
In January 2002 , a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our Sun , temporarily making it the brightest star in our Milky Way galaxy .
The mysterious star has long since faded back to obscurity , but observations by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope of a phenomenon called a " light echo " have uncovered remarkable new features .
These details promise to provide astronomers with a CAT - scan - like probe of the three - dimensional structure of shells of dust surrounding an aging star .
The results appear tomorrow in the journal Nature .
" Like some past celebrities , this star had its 15 minutes of fame , " says Anne Kinney , director of NASA 's Astronomy and Physics program , Headquarters , Washington .
" But its legacy continues as it unveils an eerie light show in space .
Thankfully , NASA 's Hubble has a front row seat to this unique event in our galaxy . "
Light from a stellar explosion echoing off circumstellar dust in our Milky Way galaxy was last seen in 1936 , long before Hubble was available to study the tidal wave of light and reveal the netherworld of dusty black interstellar space .
" As light from the outburst continues to reflect off the dust surrounding the star , we view continuously changing cross-sections of the dust envelope .
Hubble 's view is so sharp that we can do an ' astronomical cat - scan ' of the space around the star , " says the lead observer , astronomer Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore .
Bond and his team used the Hubble images to determine that the petulant star , called V838 Monocerotis ( V838 Mon ) is about 20,000 light - years from Earth .
The star put out enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate surrounding dust , like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls of an undiscovered cavern .
The star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts .
Light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to Earth .
Because of this indirect path , the light arrives at Earth months after light coming directly toward Earth from the star itself .
The outburst of V838 Mon was somewhat similar to that of a nova , a more common stellar outburst .
A typical nova is a normal star that dumps hydrogen onto a compact white - dwarf companion star .
The hydrogen piles up until it spontaneously explodes by nuclear fusion - like a titanic hydrogen bomb .
This exposes a searing stellar core , which has a temperature of hundreds of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit .
By contrast , however , V838 Mon did not expel its outer layers .
Instead , it grew enormously in size , with its surface temperature dropping to temperatures not much hotter than a light bulb .
This behavior of ballooning to an immense size , but not losing its outer layers , is very unusual and completely unlike an ordinary nova explosion .
" We are having a hard time understanding this outburst , which has shown a behavior that is not predicted by present theories of nova outbursts , " says Bond .
" It may represent a rare combination of stellar properties that we have not seen before . "
The star is so unique it may represent a transitory stage in a star 's evolution that is rarely seen .
The star has some similarities to highly unstable aging stars called eruptive variables , which suddenly and unpredictably increase in brightness .
The circular light - echo feature has now expanded to twice the angular size of Jupiter on the sky .
Astronomers expect it to continue expanding as reflected light from farther out in the dust envelope finally arrives at Earth .
Bond predicts that the echo will be observable for the rest of this decade .
The research team included investigators from the Space Telescope Institute in Baltimore ; the Universities Space Research Association at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff , Ariz . ; the European Space Agency ; Arizona State University ; the Large Binocular Telescope Observatory at the University of Arizona at Tucson ; the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes in Spain 's Canary Islands ; and the INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova in Asiago , Italy .
Eight times as many Republicans fleeing Congress than Democrats John Byrne
Published : Tuesday October 16 , 2007

The announcements seem so frequent they no longer appear to be news -- yet another Republican congressmember is planning retirement .
Last night , news broke that yet another Republican would n't run for reelection : Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , of Texas .
All told , 17 Republican lawmakers have their sights on Capitol Hill 's exit signs .
Democrats , however , are n't leaving .
Just two Democrats have called it quits -- both of them leaving the House to seek higher office in the Senate .
An article Tuesday in the Los Angeles Times seeks to illuminate the cause .
The piece paints a Republican caucus that is disillusioned with Bush 's poll numbers , the war in Iraq , the possibility of a soft economy and perhaps most importantly : life in the minority .
" I do n't like being in the minority , " Rep. Ray LaHood ( R - IL ) , who was first elected in 1994 , told the Times .
" It 's not that much fun , and the prospects for the future do n't look that good . "
The numbers of retiring congressmembers are n't out of line with previous sessions .
What makes the current situation unique is the number of Republicans who are retiring relative to the number of Democrats .
Also startling is the Democrats ' fundraising prowess , particularly in the House : the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has $ 22.1 million on hand to the Republicans ' $ 1.6 million .
That 's a more than 13 to 1 advantage .
The piece notes that " many of the Republicans choosing to retire are older , more pragmatic lawmakers , such as Rep. Ralph Regula of Ohio ; moderates like Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia ; and mavericks like Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska .
These departures reflect the generational and ideological changes that have pushed the Republican contingent in Congress steadily to the right over the last decade . "
Former GOP official Eddie Mahe told the paper : " If I was talking to my favorite brother - in - law and he was thinking about running for Congress , I would say , ' Why would you want to do that now ? '
If anybody 's not smart enough to figure that out , I do n't want them around anyway . "

By now , almost everyone in America has heard of Jena , La. , because they 've all heard the story of the " Jena 6 . "
White students hanging nooses barely punished , a schoolyard fight , excessive punishment for the six black attackers , racist local officials , public outrage and protests – the outside media made sure everyone knew the basics .
There 's just one problem :
The media got most of the basics wrong .
In fact , I have never before witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism .
Myths replaced facts , and journalists abdicated their solemn duty to investigate every claim because they were seduced by a powerfully appealing but false narrative of racial injustice .
I should know .
I live in Jena .
My wife has taught at Jena High School for many years .
And most important , I am probably the only reporter who has covered these events from the very beginning .
The reason the Jena cases have been propelled into the world spotlight is two - fold : First , because local officials did not speak publicly early on about the true events of the past year , the media simply formed their stories based on one - side 's statements – the Jena 6 .
Second , the media were downright lazy in their efforts to find the truth .
Often , they simply reported what they 'd read on blogs , which expressed only one side of the issue .
The real story of Jena and the Jena 6 is quite different from what the national media presented .
It 's time to set the record straight .
Myth 1 : The Whites - Only Tree .
There has never been a " whites - only " tree at Jena High School .
Students of all races sat underneath this tree .
When a student asked during an assembly at the start of school last year if anyone could sit under the tree , it evoked laughter from everyone present – blacks and whites .
As reported by students in the assembly , the question was asked to make a joke and to drag out the assembly and avoid class .
Myth 2 : Nooses a Signal to Black Students .
An investigation by school officials , police , and an FBI agent revealed the true motivation behind the placing of two nooses in the tree the day after the assembly .
According to the expulsion committee , the crudely constructed nooses were not aimed at black students .
Instead , they were understood to be a prank by three white students aimed at their fellow white friends , members of the school rodeo team .
( The students apparently got the idea from watching episodes of " Lonesome Dove . " )
The committee further concluded that the three young teens had no knowledge that nooses symbolize the terrible legacy of the lynchings of countless blacks in American history .
When informed of this history by school officials , they became visibly remorseful because they had many black friends .
Another myth concerns their punishment , which was not a three - day suspension , but rather nine days at an alternative facility followed by two weeks of in - school suspension , Saturday detentions , attendance at Discipline Court , and evaluation by licensed mental - health professionals .
The students who hung the nooses have not publicly come forward to give their version of events .
Myth 3 : Nooses Were a Hate Crime .
Although many believe the three white students should have been prosecuted for a hate crime for hanging the nooses , the incident did not meet the legal criteria for a federal hate crime .
It also did not meet the standard for Louisiana 's hate - crime statute , and though widely condemned by all officials , there was no crime to charge the youths with .
Myth 4 : DA 's Threat to Black Students .
When District Attorney Reed Walters spoke to Jena High students at an assembly in September , he did not tell black students that he could make their life miserable with " the stroke of a pen . "
Instead , according to Walters , " two or three girls , white girls , were chit- chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones right in the middle of my dissertation .
I got a little irritated at them and said , ' Pay attention to me .
I am right now having to deal with an aggravated rape case where I 've got to decide whether the death penalty applies or not . '
I said , ' Look , I can be your best friend or your worst enemy .
With the stroke of a pen I can make your life miserable so I want you to call me before you do something stupid . ' "
Mr. Walters had been called to the assembly by police , who had been at the school earlier that day dealing with some students who were causing disturbances .
Teachers and students have confirmed Walters 's version of events .
Myth 5 : The Fair Barn Party Incident .
On Dec. 1 , 2006 , a private party – not an all - white party as reported – was held at the local community center called the Fair Barn .
Robert Bailey Jr. , soon to be one of the Jena 6 , came to the party with others seeking admittance .
When they were denied entrance by the renter of the facility , a white male named Justin Sloan ( not a Jena High student ) at the party attacked Bailey and hit him in the face with his fist .
This is reported in witness statements to police , including the victim , Robert Bailey , Jr .
Months later , Bailey contended he was hit in the head with a beer bottle and required stitches .
No medical records show this ever occurred .
Mr. Sloan was prosecuted for simple battery , which according to Louisiana law , is the proper charge for hitting someone with a fist .
Myth 6 : The " Gotta - Go " Grocery Incident .
On Dec. 2 , 2006 , Bailey and two other black Jena High students were involved in an altercation at this local convenience store , stemming from the incident that occurred the night before .
The three were accused by police of jumping a white man as he entered the store and stealing a shotgun from him .
The two parties gave conflicting statements to police .
However , two unrelated eye witnesses of the event gave statements that corresponded with that of the white male .
Myth 7 : The Schoolyard Fight .
The event on Dec. 4 , 2006 was consistently labeled a " schoolyard fight . "
But witnesses described something much more horrific .
Several black students , including those now known as the Jena 6 , barricaded an exit to the school 's gym as they lay in wait for Justin Barker to exit .
( It remains unclear why Mr. Barker was specifically targeted . )
When Barker tried to leave through another exit , court testimony indicates , he was hit from behind by Mychal Bell .
Multiple witnesses confirmed that Barker was immediately knocked unconscious and lay on the floor defenseless as several other black students joined together to kick and stomp him , with most of the blows striking his head .
Police speculate that the motivation for the attack was related to the racially charged fights that had occurred during the previous weekend .
Myth 8 : The Attack Is Linked to the Nooses .
Nowhere in any of the evidence , including statements by witnesses and defendants , is there any reference to the noose incident that occurred three months prior .
This was confirmed by the United States attorney for the Western District of Louisiana , Donald Washington , on numerous occasions .
Myth 9 : Mychal Bell 's All - White Jury .
While it is true that Mychal Bell was convicted as an adult by an all - white jury in June ( a conviction that was later overturned with his case sent to juvenile court ) , the jury selection process was completely legal and withstood an investigation by the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division .
Court officials insist that several black residents were summoned for jury duty , but did not appear .
Myth 10 : Jena 6 as Model Youth .
While some members were simply caught up in the moment , others had criminal records .
Bell had at least four prior violent - crime arrests before the December attack , and was on probation during most of this year .
Myth 11 : Jena Is One of the Most Racist Towns in America .
Actually , Jena is a wonderful place to live for both whites and blacks .
The media 's distortion and outright lies concerning the case have given this rural Louisiana town a label it does n't deserve .
Myth 12 : Two Levels of Justice .
Outside protesters were convinced that the prosecution of the Jena 6 was proof of a racially biased system of justice .
But the US Justice Department 's investigation found no evidence to support such a claim .
In fact , the percentage of blacks and whites prosecuted matches the parish 's population statistics .
These are just 12 of many myths that are portrayed as fact in the media concerning the Jena cases .
( A more thorough review of all events can be found at www.thejenatimes.net – click on Chronological Order of Events . )
As with the Duke Lacrosse case , the truth about Jena will eventually be known .
But the town of Jena is n't expecting any apologies from the media .
They will probably never admit their error and have already moved on to the next " big " story .
Meanwhile in Jena , residents are getting back to their regular routines , where friends are friends regardless of race .
Just as it has been all along .

Bush threatened nations that did not back Iraq war : report Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 26 , 2007

In a private conversation at his Texas ranch in early 2003 , President Bush said he was committed to invading Iraq whether or not the United Nations passed another resolution condemning Saddam Hussein , a Spanish Language newspaper reported Wednesday .
" Saddam Husein will not change and will continue playing ; the moment has arrived for undoing of him , " Bush told Spain 's then - Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on February 22 , 2003 , according to transcript of Bush 's remarks that was posted on the Web site of El Pais , Spain 's largest daily .
( The quote was automatically translated from Spanish to English using Google . )
Bush said he would prefer to have a second UN resolution , but in his conversation , he makes clear that he would not hesitate to act without one , El Pais reported .
" We have to get rid of Saddam .
There are two weeks left .
In two weeks we will be ready militarily .
We will be in Baghdad at the end of March , " Bush said less than a month before bombs began falling on Baghdad .
The US invaded Iraq March 20 , 2003 .
More than 150,000 US troops remain stationed in the country .
Although Aznar was a supporter of Bush 's invasion , his successor Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero withdrew the 1,300 Spanish troops that were in Iraq in late April 2004 , soon after his election .
Bush also threatened nations with retaliation if they did not vote for a UN resolution backing the Iraq war , according to a the transcript .
Nations like Mexico , Angola , Chile and Cameroon must know that the security of the United States is at stake , the president tells Aznar .
The left - wing El Pais reported that Bush threatened to pull financial aid from Angola and warned that a free - trade agreement with Chile might be delayed in the Senate if they did not back another UN resolution .
The confidential transcript was prepared by Spain 's ambassador to the United States at the time , Javier Ruperez , the paper said .
Prior to the US - led invasion of Iraq , Washington unsuccessfully lobbied the 15 members of the UN Security Council for a second resolution paving the way for military action against Iraq if Saddam Hussein failed to comply with demands to disarm .
Victory would come " without destruction " , he added .
The meeting between Aznar and Bush came just days after a massive protest in Madrid by more than a million people against the invasion which Aznar 's conservative government backed .
Aznar tells Bush in the transcript that he needed Washington 's help to get Spanish public opinion behind the invasion .
He adds that he is worried by Bush 's optimism .
" I am optimistic because I believe I am right .
I am at peace with myself , " Bush responded .

Watch Task Force members discuss the report
Thirty - seven million Americans live below the official poverty line .
Millions more struggle each month to pay for basic necessities , or run out of savings when they lose their jobs or face health emergencies .
Poverty imposes enormous costs on society .
The lost potential of children raised in poor households , the lower productivity and earnings of poor adults , the poor health , increased crime , and broken neighborhoods all hurt our nation .
Persistent childhood poverty is estimated to cost our nation $ 500 billion each year , or about four percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product .
In a world of increasing global competition , we cannot afford to squander these human resources .
The Center for American Progress last year convened a diverse group of national experts and leaders to examine the causes and consequences of poverty in America and make recommendations for national action .
In this report , our Task Force on Poverty calls for a national goal of cutting poverty in half in the next 10 years and proposes a strategy to reach the goal .
Our nation has seen periods of dramatic poverty reduction at times when near - full employment was combined with sound federal and state policies , motivated individual initiative , supportive civic involvement , and sustained national commitment .
In the last six years , however , our nation has moved in the opposite direction .
The number of poor Americans has grown by five million , while inequality has reached historic high levels .
Consider the following facts :
One in eight Americans now lives in poverty .
A family of four is considered poor if the family ’s income is below $ 19,971 — a bar far below what most people believe a family needs to get by .
Still , using this measure , 12.6 percent of all Americans were poor in 2005 , and more than 90 million people ( 31 percent of all Americans ) had incomes below 200 percent of federal poverty thresholds .
Millions of Americans will spend at least one year in poverty at some point in their lives .
One third of all Americans will experience poverty within a 13 - year period .
In that period , one in 10 Americans are poor for most of the time , and one in 20 are poor for 10 or more years .
Poverty in the United States is far higher than in many other developed nations .
At the turn of the 21st century , the United States ranked 24th among 25 countries when measuring the share of the population below 50 percent of median income .
Inequality has reached record highs .
The richest 1 percent of Americans in 2005 held the largest share of the nation ’s income ( 19 percent ) since 1929 .
At the same time , the poorest 20 percent of Americans held only 3.4 percent of the nation ’s income .
It does not have to be this way .
Our nation need not tolerate persistent poverty alongside great wealth .
The United States should set a national goal of cutting poverty in half over the next 10 years .
A strategy to cut poverty in half should be guided by four principles :
Promote Decent Work .
People should work and work should pay enough to ensure that workers and their families can avoid poverty , meet basic needs , and save for the future .
Provide Opportunity for All .
Children should grow up in conditions that maximize their opportunities for success ; adults should have opportunities throughout their lives to connect to work , get more education , live in a good neighborhood , and move up in the workforce .
Ensure Economic Security .
Americans should not fall into poverty when they cannot work or work is unavailable , unstable , or pays so little that they can not make ends meet .
Help People Build Wealth .
All Americans should have the opportunity to build assets that allow them to weather periods of flux and volatility , and to have the resources that may be essential to advancement and upward mobility .
We recommend 12 key steps to cut poverty in half :
1. Raise and index the minimum wage to half the average hourly wage .
At $ 5.15 , the federal minimum wage is at its lowest level in real terms since 1956 .
The federal minimum wage was once 50 percent of the average wage but is now 30 percent of that wage .
Congress should restore the minimum wage to 50 percent of the average wage , about $ 8.40 an hour in 2006 .
Doing so would help nearly 5 million poor workers and nearly 10 million other low - income workers .
2. Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit .
As an earnings supplement for low - income working families , the EITC raises incomes and helps families build assets .
The Child Tax Credit provides a tax credit of up to $ 1,000 per child , but provides no help to the poorest families .
We recommend tripling the EITC for childless workers and expanding help to larger working families .
We recommend making the Child Tax Credit available to all low - and moderate - income families .
Doing so would move as many as 5 million people out of poverty .
3. Promote unionization by enacting the Employee Free Choice Act . The Employee Free Choice
Act would require employers to recognize a union after a majority of workers signs cards authorizing union representation and establish stronger penalties for violation of employee rights .
The increased union representation made possible by the Act would lead to better jobs and less poverty for American workers .
4. Guarantee child care assistance to low - income families and promote early education for all .
We propose that the federal and state governments guarantee child care help to families with incomes below about $ 40,000 a year , with expanded tax help to higher - earning families .
At the same time , states should be encouraged to improve the quality of early education and broaden access for all children .
Our child care expansion would raise employment among low - income parents and help nearly 3 million parents and children escape poverty .
5. Create 2 million new “ opportunity ” housing vouchers , and promote equitable development in and around central cities .
Nearly 8 million Americans live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty where at least 40 percent of residents are poor .
Our nation should seek to end concentrated poverty and economic segregation , and promote regional equity and inner-city revitalization .
We propose that over the next 10 years the federal government fund 2 million new “ opportunity vouchers ” designed to help people live in opportunity - rich areas .
Any new affordable housing should be in communities with employment opportunities and high - quality public services , or in gentrifying communities .
These housing policies should be part of a broader effort to pursue equitable development strategies in regional and local planning efforts , including efforts to improve schools , create affordable housing , assure physical security , and enhance neighborhood amenities .
6. Connect disadvantaged and disconnected youth with school and work .
About 1.7 million poor youth ages 16 to 24 were out of school and out of work in 2005 .
We recommend that the federal government restore Youth Opportunity Grants to help the most disadvantaged communities and expand funding for effective and promising youth programs — with the goal of reaching 600,000 poor disadvantaged youth through these efforts .
We propose a new Upward Pathway program to offer low - income youth opportunities to participate in service and training in fields that are in high - demand and provide needed public services .
7. Simplify and expand Pell Grants and make higher education accessible to residents of each state .
Low - income youth are much less likely to attend college than their higher income peers , even among those of comparable abilities .
Pell Grants play a crucial role for lower - income students .
We propose to simplify the Pell grant application process , gradually raise Pell Grants to reach 70 percent of the average costs of attending a four - year public institution , and encourage institutions to do more to raise student completion rates .
As the federal government does its part , states should develop strategies to make postsecondary education affordable for all residents , following promising models already underway in a number of states .
8 . Help former prisoners find stable employment and reintegrate into their communities .
The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
We urge all states to develop comprehensive reentry services aimed at reintegrating former prisoners into their communities with full - time , consistent employment .
9 . Ensure equity for low - wage workers in the Unemployment Insurance system .
Only about 35 percent of the unemployed , and a smaller share of unemployed low - wage workers , receive unemployment insurance benefits .
We recommend that states ( with federal help ) reform “ monetary eligibility ” rules that screen out low - wage workers , broaden eligibility for part - time workers and workers who have lost employment as a result of compelling family circumstances , and allow unemployed workers to use periods of unemployment as a time to upgrade their skills and qualifications .
10 . Modernize means - tested benefits programs to develop a coordinated system that helps workers and families .
A well - functioning safety net should help people get into or return to work and ensure a decent level of living for those who cannot work or are temporarily between jobs .
Our current system fails to do so .
We recommend that governments at all levels simplify and improve benefits access for working families and improve services to individuals with disabilities .
The Food Stamp Program should be strengthened to improve benefits , eligibility , and access .
And the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program should be reformed to shift its focus from cutting caseloads to helping needy families find sustainable employment .
11 . Reduce the high costs of being poor and increase access to financial services .
Despite having less income , lower - income families often pay more than middle and high - income families for the same consumer products .
We recommend that the federal and state governments should address the foreclosure crisis through expanded mortgage assistance programs and by new federal legislation to curb unscrupulous practices .
And we propose that the federal government establish a $ 50 million Financial Fairness Innovation Fund to support state efforts to broaden access to mainstream goods and financial services in predominantly low - income communities .
12 . Expand and simplify the Saver ’s Credit to encourage saving for education , homeownership , and retirement .
For many families , saving for purposes such as education , a home , or a small business is key to making economic progress .
We propose that the federal “ Saver ’s Credit ” be reformed to make it fully refundable .
This Credit should also be broadened to apply to other appropriate savings vehicles intended to foster asset accumulation , with consideration given to including individual development accounts , children ’s saving accounts , and college savings plans .
Our recommendations would cut poverty in half .
The Urban Institute , which modeled the implementation of one set of our recommendations , estimates that four of our steps would reduce poverty by 26 percent , bringing us more than halfway toward our goal .
Among their findings :
Taken together , our minimum wage , EITC , child credit , and child care recommendations would reduce poverty by 26 percent .
This would mean 9.4 million fewer people in poverty and a national poverty rate of 9.1 percent — the lowest in recorded U.S. history .
The racial poverty gap would be narrowed :
White poverty would fall from 8.7 percent to 7 percent .
Poverty among African Americans would fall from 21.4 percent to 15.6 percent .
Hispanic poverty would fall from 21.4 percent to 12.9 percent and poverty for all others would fall from 12.7 percent to 10.3 percent .
Child poverty and extreme poverty would both fall : Child poverty would drop by 41 percent .
The number of people in extreme poverty would fall by 2.4 million .
Millions of low - and moderate - income families would benefit .
Almost half of the benefits of our proposal would help low - and moderate - income families .
That these recommendations would reduce poverty by more than one quarter is powerful evidence that a 50 percent reduction can be reached within a decade .
The combined cost of our principal recommendations is in the range of $ 90 billion a year — a significant cost but one that could be readily funded through a fairer tax system .
An additional $ 90 billion in annual spending would represent about 0.8 percent of the nation ’s gross domestic product , which is a fraction of the money spent on tax changes that benefited primarily the wealthy in recent years .
Consider that :
The current annual costs of the tax cuts enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2003 are in the range of $ 400 billion a year .
In 2008 alone the value of the tax cuts to households with incomes exceeding $ 200,000 a year is projected to be $ 100 billion .
Our recommendations could be fully paid for simply by bringing better balance to the federal tax system and recouping part of what has been lost by the excessive tax cuts of recent years .
We recognize that serious action has serious costs , but the challenge before the nation is not that we cannot afford to act ; rather , it is that we must decide to act .
The Next Steps
In 2009 , we will have a new president and a new Congress .
Across the nation , there is a yearning for a shared national commitment to build a better , fairer , more prosperous country , with opportunity for all .
In communities across the nation , policymakers , business people , people of faith , and concerned citizens are coming together .
Our commitment to the common good compels us to move forward .

In a letter to colleagues , Mr. McConnell and Mr. Lott said that the measure “ imposes an open - ended financial burden on American taxpayers and takes a significant step toward a government - run health care system . ”
Six Republicans voted for the bill .
Mr. McConnell said other Republican senators were concerned about “ the size of the plan that came out of the Finance Committee and what that may portend for the future in terms of an entire government takeover of American health care and , in essence , a single - payer system down the road . ”
Representative Diana DeGette , Democrat of Colorado , a leading proponent of the House bill , said : “ For the longest time , I was mystified why Republicans would oppose expansion of the Children ’s Health Insurance Program to kids who are eligible but not enrolled .
Now I realize .
They are trying to deny us a political victory .
They want to be able to say that Democrats ca n’t get anything done .
“ Unfortunately , ” Ms. DeGette said , “ Republicans are pursuing this strategy on the backs of poor children . ”
The Senate bill focuses on coverage for children .
The House bill also calls for major changes in Medicare .
It would , for example , halt a 10 percent cut in payments to doctors , scheduled for January , and would reduce payments for private insurance known as Medicare Advantage plans .
Medicare typically pays the private plans more than it would cost to care for the same people in traditional Medicare .
Many private plans offer additional benefits .
America ’s Health Insurance Plans , a trade group , announced a national television advertising campaign .
The ads will urge older people to contact their members of Congress and speak out against the proposed cuts in payments to private insurers .

South Koreans digest details of the deal
Prominent members of US President George W Bush 's administration make no secret of their contempt for a previous nuclear deal signed by the Clinton administration with North Korea in 1994 .
Now , after years of confrontation , they have signed up to something that looks suspiciously similar - a nuclear freeze in return for economic and diplomatic incentives .
The difference is that North Korea now claims to be a nuclear power , having used the period of hostility to test a nuclear device and build a small arsenal of weapons .
The US negotiator , Christopher Hill , says the new agreement is just a first step .
Strategic decision
The aim is still the full dismantlement of all North Korea 's nuclear capabilities , although he concedes there is still a long way to go .
North Korea will see the deal as a victory , our correspondent says
But analysts say US policy looks increasingly like a containment exercise - an attempt to limit the damage and restrict the expansion of the North 's existing capabilities .
" After years of mistakes the United States has decided to stop digging a hole for itself , " says Peter Beck , North - East Asia Director of the International Crisis group .
" The administration has made a strategic decision to go after Iran and to go soft on North Korea , " he said .
After first ruling out rewards for " bad behaviour " , the US has now signed up to a deal that will see substantial incentives for a state Mr Bush once consigned to his Axis of Evil .
Staggered rewards
North Korea will receive 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil for shutting down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon , which produces enough plutonium for one atom bomb each year .
Another 950,000 tonnes of oil has been promised once the reactor has been " disabled " .
N KOREA NUCLEAR PROGRAMME
Believed to have ' handful ' of nuclear weapons
But not thought to have any small enough to put in a missile Could try dropping from plane , though world watching closely
The US will say that amounts to more than a simple freeze - but to the North Koreans it will mean less than full dismantlement .
There will also be discussions on the establishment of diplomatic relations and the de-listing of North Korea as a state that sponsors terrorism .
The idea is to stagger the rewards in line with concrete North Korean steps towards nuclear disarmament .
That , however , was also the rationale behind the Agreed Framework of 1994 , which fell apart after less than a decade .
" We 've lost four or five years and now we have to start again with North Korea - except the situation is worse because they 've now tested a nuclear device , " says Jun Bong - geun of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul .
in Seoul , there is relief that the US has gradually moderated its position .
Washington has dropped its long objection to direct talks with the North Koreans and agreed to moderate the financial squeeze it imposed in September 2005 - a response it said at the time to the " criminal activities " of the North Korean regime .
' Victory '
One of the architects of the more punitive approach , however , the former US Ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton , does not like what he sees .
" I 'm very disturbed by this deal , it sends exactly the wrong signal to would - be proliferators around the world :
If you hold out long enough , wear down the State Department negotiators , eventually you get rewarded , " he told CNN .
The first test will come in 60 days when the North Koreans are required to shut down the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon .
If past experience is any guide , each step will be hotly contested and further breakdowns in the process are likely .
The US is insisting on a full accounting of North Korea 's nuclear inventory , including an alleged parallel nuclear programme based on the enrichment of uranium .
North Korea denies it exists .
North Korea will probably see the latest round in its decades - long confrontation with the US as a victory .
Its goal is probably the extraction of economic aid and the maintenance of a nuclear arsenal as a final deterrent - an objective that appears more realistic now than it did when the latest confrontation began .
The Ubuntu Technical Board voted yesterday to ship Ubuntu 7.10 ( " Gutsy " ) with Compiz enabled by default .
Although Compiz has been featured in Ubuntu 7.10 Tribe prerelesases , the board has had difficulty determining whether or not it is reliable and functionally complete enough to warrant inclusion in the final release .
Compiz is a compositing window manager that includes a number of highly sophisticated visual effects like window shadows , transparency , and desktop zooming .
In the Tribe prereleases , basic visual effects are enabled by default on supported hardware , and more sophisticated visual effects — like wobbling windows — can be enabled with a configuration utility .
A compositing window manager was originally planned for inclusion in Ubuntu 7.04 , but it was delayed because the software was n't considered mature enough .
Unfortunately , there are still a number of technical issues that detract from the viability of Compiz as a default option .
These technical issues and various human factors make inclusion of Compiz a difficult decision .
During the Ubuntu Technical Board meeting where the decision was made , the problem was concisely summarized by Ubuntu development manager Scott James Remnant .
" It strikes me that we 're repeatedly in a rock - and - hard - place situation , " said Remnant .
" Drivers are n't good enough to support bling , [ but ] without requirements of bling , there 's no incentive to make the drivers good enough . "
A similar concern was echoed by Travis Watkins later in the discussion .
" It still has some rough spots , " said Watkins , " but if we do n't get it out there at some point it 'll never get good enough . "
Technical board member Matthew Garrett disagreed .
" Shipping compiz wo n't make those problems get fixed faster , " Garrett argued .
Driver problems and Xorg developer priorities
The most serious problems that emerge when running Compiz relate to the drivers and underlying components of Xorg .
For instance , there are some problems — like accelerated video playback issues with Intel drivers — that can only be resolved by using the EXA accelerated rendering framework which is still not ready yet .
When asked why Intel is n't addressing the driver issue , technical board member Mathew Garrett explained that " Intel are working on the basis that composited desktops wo n't be ready for rolling out until EXA is stable enough anyway , so it 's not a concern [ for them ] . "
EXA improvements could be done by any developer with sufficient experience with graphics programming , but most of the Xorg developers who have the ability are focusing on more critical issues .
" Have we , by positioning it as a feature for gutsy , motivated anybody to work on fixing the underlying issues ? " asked Remnant .
" Why is n't anybody interested in this enough to fix the issues ? "
Garrett responds , explaining that its a low priority for the X community .
" Nobody who has the skills to fix it is interested in running the software , " Garrett said .
" The general feeling in the X community is pretty much that Compiz is not of high quality ... The technical aspects of a composited desktop are interesting , but there are more fundamental issues that people want to fix first .
People want to get X up to the Win2 K level before trying to match Vista . "
The recent major priorities of the X community include hotplugging and input redirection support .
Most of the hotplugging issues have finally been resolved in Xorg 7.3 .
Another major problem faced by the technical board members was the difficulty of determining exactly how many people are affected by the problems .
" Do you think there is any quantitative way we can assess whether it works well for most of [ Ubuntu 's ] current users ? " asked Canonical 's Chief Technical Officer Matt Zimmerman .
" I feel a bit doomed either way , not having much in the way of concrete data to work from . "
" Some feedback on how many people are actually using it would be helpful , " commented technical board member Matthew Garrett , " but since we do n't enable it by default on upgrades it 's quite possible that most of the people following gutsy are n't running it . "
The Ubuntu Technical Board also considered how users would respond to a decision not to include Compiz by default in Ubuntu 7.10 .
" I 'm fairly certain I understand who the people are who would be disappointed by disabling it , " said Zimmerman .
" However , I do n't feel that I have a good understanding of the people who are affected by the problems . "
Not enabling Compiz by default would " disappoint a lot of community members and result in a lot of bad press , " Zimmerman noted , but enabling it would " result in functional problems for some users . "
When the decision was made , all of the participants voted in favor of inclusion , except for Garrett , who expressed discomfort with the fact that the original decision at the beginning of the development cycle to try to get Compiz into Ubuntu 7.10 " was not especially based on technical correctness . "
Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth relayed his vote in favor of Compiz inclusion over the phone , but did not participate in the meeting because he was at the VMware World event and did n't have Internet access .
I think that Garrett deserves a lot of credit for taking a strong position in favor of high quality standards , but ultimately I think the board 's decision to include Compiz by default is the best choice .
The discussion itself reflects some of the significant challenges faced by the technical board and provides valuable insight into the thought process behind one of the most important decisions about the Ubuntu 7.10 release .
A federal judge in Washington , DC , has handed the RIAA another setback in its campaign against on - campus file - sharing .
In Arista v. Does 1 - 19 , a case brought against 19 George Washington University students by the Big Four record labels , Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly has ordered the RIAA to show cause why the ex parte subpoenas issued to GWU should n't be quashed .
Judge Kollar - Kotelly 's order comes in response to a motion filed by Doe number three last week .
In that motion , the unnamed student asked the judge to quash the subpoena , arguing that the RIAA was relying on the wrong law to obtain the subpoena , and furthermore , that there was no applicable law that authorized the issue of ex parte subpoenas to colleges and universities .
The RIAA typically relies on the Cable Communications Policy Act to obtain the names and addresses of suspected file - sharers in its lawsuits .
Doe three argued that , since GWU is a university and not a cable provider , the CCPA could not be used to authorize a subpoena .
Doe three 's argument followed a ruling in Interscope v. Does 1 - 7 , a case brought against seven students at the College of William and Mary .
The judge in that case told the RIAA that the CCPA was n't applicable , and that the only avenue available to it was the DMCA .
One problem : the RIAA never issued any takedown notices , which are required by the DMCA before a lawsuit can be filed .
And it looks like there 's no way a DMCA notice could be issued in a campus file - sharing case .
Only entities that host , cache , or transmit infringing content can be served with DMCA takedown notices , and GWU did none of the above .
As a result , Doe three argues , the RIAA should be unable to obtain the subpoenas at all .
Judge Kollar - Kotelly has apparently found the student 's argument compelling .
Her Order to Show Cause ( available from the Recording Industry vs The People ) , directs the RIAA to submit a motion to convince her why she should n't quash all 19 of the subpoenas .
The judge notes the opinion in Interscope v. Does 1 - 7 , also mentioning a ruling in RIAA v. Verizon in which the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that the DMCA was not applicable to file - sharing cases .
With few exceptions , the music industry has largely had its way in court with its over 25,000 file - sharing lawsuits .
Colleges have been a different matter entirely , however , and if judges in the various on - campus file - sharing cases find the arguments made in Arista v. Does 1 - 19 and Interscope v. Does 1 - 7 convincing , it could have the effect of putting the brakes on the RIAA 's lawsuits against college students .

Announcing Developer Preview Release 1
I 'm pleased to announce the first Developer Preview Release of the open - source port of Java 6 to Mac OS X .
This release includes support for 32 - bit and 64 - bit Intel machines running Mac OS X Leopard ( 10.5 ) .
Port Status
( Nearly ) everything up to and including Swing ( X11 ) is functional .
Sound is not currently supported .
While I 've spent some time testing this release with my own projects , this preview release should be considered beta quality .
The project is very much in need of additional community testing --
If you 're hankering for Java 6 , please give this a try !
See below for information on submitting bug reports .
This work represents quite a few of my weekend and evening hours -- I hope you find it useful !
Additionally , this port would n't be possible without building on the amazing FreeBSD , OpenBSD , and NetBSD porting work .
Tiger Support
While bugs in Tiger 's compiler currently prevent the building of the 32 - bit JDK , it should be possible to build the JDK on Leopard using MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and the MacOSX 10.4u SDK .
I plan on working on Tiger support over Thanksgiving .
If you get this working before I get around to it , let me know !
Supporting PowerPC
Implementing PowerPC hotspot / interpreter support would require an incredible amount of work , and is not something I have planned .
Most impressively , Gary Benson of Red Hat has implemented initial PowerPC interpreter support for OpenJDK .
It 's possible that this could be used to implement Mac OS X / PowerPC at some future date .
I still have PowerPC Macs , so I 'll look into this eventually .

Please review the license at http://java.net/jrl.csp, and submit your license acceptance to Sun .
Building the JDK
Building the full JDK will take quite some time -- up to an hour on my Mac Pro .
You can tune the number of parallel jobs with the HOTSPOT_BUILD_JOBS and PARALLEL_BUILD_JOBS make tunables ( eg , PARALLEL_BUILD_JOBS=4 ) , which will speed things up considerably on multi-core machines .
There are two builds available for the 64 - bit and 32 - bit VMs : debug , and release .
The debug JRE is significantly slower than the release version -- for day to day work , I suggest using the release build .
OpenMotif is a required build dependency .
I 've installed it using MacPorts .
If you install it using Fink , or by hand , be sure to update the ALT_MOTIF_DIR build setting accordingly .
When the build is complete , a full JDK image will be available in javasrc_ 1_6_jrl_darwin/ control / build / < build style >/ j2sdk-image .
You can copy / rename the j2sdk - image directory as appropriate ( ie , /usr/local / darwin-jdk16-32 bit ) .
To use the new JDK , set the JAVA_HOME environmental variable and ( optionally ) add the j2sdk - image directory to the start of your path .
Lastly , I expect the 64 - bit JVM to be faster than the 32 - bit JVM , but I 've yet to do benchmarks .
64 - bit Release Version :

" After the most secretive administration in memory , an administration that consistently misled the American people , we need a president who is going to be open and forthright .
I think [ the Philadelphia ] debate really exposed this fault line .
Senator Clinton left us wondering where she stood on every single hard question from Iran to Social Security to drivers ' licenses for undocumented workers ...
Her big answer on whether she would release the papers from her White House years was particularly troubling because she is running on her record as first lady as much as on her record as a senator .
How can people fully judge that record if the documents from those years remain locked away ? "

Joining a growing crowd of people to complain about the general lack of openness in the iPhone is none other than Steve Wozniak , co-founder of the company .
Woz has a reputation for being critical of the company he helped create , although no - one would argue that his views are unreasonable : in an interview he calls into question Apple 's treatment of the iPhone as an appliance , and not as a computer platform designed to allow users to install their own apps at will ( " I 'm really for the unlockers , the rebels trying to make it free . " )
He also took a dig at Leopard , saying that OSes are n't what sell computers these days , and that OS updates today are nothing more than slow improvements , rather than a procession towards a UI that works " for someone who knows nothing about the computer . "
Personally , we think these are fair viewpoints : as much as we may hate to say it , a lot of new technology these days requires a compromise .
Is n't it about time compromise took a back seat ?

US and UK researchers have stitched together more than 1,000 views of the White Continent to make a stunning new high - definition polar panorama .
The images come primarily from the American Landsat spacecraft and show features on the 3,500 km - wide icy terrain down to a resolution of 15 m .
The international team behind the project says the true - colour mosaic will revolutionise Antarctic research .
It is said to be 10 times more detailed than any made before .
It can be browsed through a free - to - use website , and the data will also be made available for use on " virtual globe " software , such as Google Earth .
Worldwide effort
" This is how Antarctica really looks and you can have any piece of it you want .
This really is Antarctica in true colour , " said Robert Bindschadler from the US space agency 's ( Nasa ) Goddard Space Flight Center .
" Most people have never been to Antarctica , yet Lima is a way we can bring Antarctica to them . "
It is also a snapshot of the current state of the cryosphere
Enlarge Image
The project team has had to search through a multi- year archive of images to find all the cloud - free pictures of Antarctica .
The current Landsat 7 platform provides coverage down to about 83 degrees South .
The " hole " in the data below this latitude has been filled with pictures from the Modis sensors on Nasa 's Terra and Aqua satellites .
For the Landsat 7 pictures , each pixel represents a little over half the length of a tennis court .
To cover Antarctica , more than 100 billion such pixels are required .
" This is the highest resolution dataset for the entire continent , " said Andrew Flemming from BAS .
" There are huge areas that people have simply not seen in this detail before , " he told BBC News .
The new mosaic will provide invaluable support for logistics .
It will allow field parties - the glaciologists , the geologists , the biologists and other Antarctic scientists - to recce places before they go in .
Some small sections of the mosaic have already been shared with pilots who have wanted a " heads - up " on locations into which they have never flown before .
The mosaic 's higher resolution will help researchers interpret changes in land elevation in hard - to - access regions .
Scientists also think the true - colour mosaic will help them better map various rock formations and types .
" Yes , it 's stunning to look at - but it's not just a pretty picture , " said Andrew Flemming .
Most of the images in the mosaic were gathered by Landsat 7
Lima is released in the middle of what is International Polar Year ( IPY ) - the global science community 's concerted push to try to answer the big questions about the Earth 's northern and southern extremes .
Parts of Antarctica , in particular on the Peninsula , are among the fastest warming places on the planet .
Some ice shelves and glaciers are undergoing dramatic change .
The current mosaic will provide a snapshot of the continent that can be compared with future datasets to detail those changes .
How An ACLU Lawsuit Might Force the Bush Administration To Reveal What Actually Happened
 from FindLaw
By my count , there appear to be no less than ten preliminary investigations underway , following the revelation that the CIA destroyed at least two sets of videotapes ( containing hundreds of hours of footage ) of " advanced interrogation " techniques being employed in terrorism investigations .
In fact , every branch of government is now involved .
Within the Executive Branch , according to news reports , the CIA 's General Counsel and Inspector General are investigating .
The Department of Justice is investigating .
On Capitol Hill , both the Senate and House Intelligence Committees are investigating .
In addition , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is inquiring as to whether the Federal Records Act has been violated .
And Senator Joseph Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee , has made preliminary inquiries as well .
The Bush Administration has shown that it is not very good at investigating itself , so no one should hold their breath for the outcome of either the CIA or Justice Department investigation .
And Attorney General Mukasey has dismissed an independent special counsel inquiry as very premature .
The Democratic - controlled Congress could get to the bottom of all this , but one should bear in mind that our elected representatives have yet to get to the bottom of the political firing of U.S. Attorneys ( although , to be fair , they did get former Attorney General Gonzales to resign ) .
Today , Congress suffers from a degenerative spinal malady , and while they can bark , they appear unable to bite .
There are three court orders that may have been violated , but one in particular strikes me as a very serious problem for the CIA .
Accordingly , we may well be in the unique situation in which a pending civil lawsuit might flush out some answers , and the federal judiciary might thus embarrass the other branches into actually taking meaningful action .
I say " might " because the Bush Administration thinks nothing of stiffing federal court judges who seek information , and they probably figure they can tap - dance for the federal judiciary - along with all the other inquiries -- until they are out of Washington on January 20 , 2009 .
Nevertheless , the situation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , as a result of Freedom of Information Act requests by the American Civil Liberties Union , could well force the Bush Administration 's hand .
An order holding the CIA in contempt of court might get the Administration 's attention .
The ACLU 's Lawsuit , and the Order that the CIA Produce Documents
When word of mistreatment of detainees surfaced , the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request targeting the CIA and others on October 7 , 2003 and May 25 , 2004 , seeking records concerning the treatment of all detainees apprehended after September 11 , 2001 and held in U.S. custody abroad .
This , of course , would mean not only in Guantanamo but in the secret prisons in Eastern Europe operated by the CIA .
Not surprisingly , the government stiffed the request , so the ACLU filed a lawsuit in June 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York .
The case ended up in the courtroom of Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein .
On September 15 , 2004 , Judge Hellerstein ordered the CIA and other government departments to " produce or identify " all responsive documents by October 15 , 2004 .
The CIA claimed that some of the relevant documents were the subject of an inquiry by the CIA 's Office of the Inspector General , so its attorneys requested a stay of the judge 's order and an extension of time to comply with the request for other documents .
In February 2005 , Judge Hellerstein denied the CIA 's request for a stay , but he did not enforce the stay immediately when the CIA moved for the judge to reconsider his ruling based on additional evidence from the CIA 's Director - as the CIA entered a full - court press to prevent the ACLU from getting anything .
This stalling action had been playing out , when news of the destruction of the tapes became public .
Now , in the action before Judge Hellerstein , he ACLU has moved to hold the CIA in contempt of court , based on the Judge 's September 15 , 2004 ruling .
It is difficult to see why the CIA is , in fact , not in contempt , given the nature of the FOIA request and the judge 's order .
Motion to Hold the CIA In Contempt
On December 6 , The New York Times reported that the CIA had destroyed two videotapes of CIA detainees who were being subjected to " aggressive interrogation techniques " - more commonly called torture .
The Washington Post soon reported that the destruction of the tapes had occurred in November 2005 .
CIA Director Michael Hayden publicly acknowledged that destruction , and soon confirmed this statement under oath in testimony to the House and Senate , saying that the destruction had occurred before he became Director .
Passing over who did what and why to focus on the situation in Judge Hellerstein 's courtroom , on December 12 , of this year the ACLU filed a motion to hold the CIA in contempt of court .
The ACLU makes a powerful case that the CIA violated Judge Hellerstein 's order of September 15 , 2005 - issued before the CIA 's apparent destruction of the tapes .
The Court 's Order required the CIA to " produce or identify all responsive documents . "
Those not produced had to be identified .
Classified documents were to be " identified in camera [ that is , only to the court ] on a log produced to the court . "
Recall , too , that the FOIA request sought information on the handling of all but a few detainees , who were within the United States .
It is well - and long - established law that a court order of this nature requires that the party preserve all information possessed that is responsive to the request .
Thus , the CIA was obligated to preserve the tapes even if they were hell - bent on fighting in court to deny them to the ACLU .
And as this litigation proceeded , Judge Hellerstein 's later orders only served to reinforce that obligation , as a string of precedents makes clear .
What Is Next ?
In addition to holding the CIA in contempt for destroying tapes that were subject to an FOIA request that surely reached these videos , the ACLU has also requested that the CIA provide some public disclosure of the facts surrounding the destruction of this material .
In addition , the ACLU has requested permission to take depositions of those involved , under oath , and has requested that the court issue a further order barring the CIA from destroying , removing , or tampering with other records that are the subject of the ACLU 's FOIA request .
Finally , the ACLU is seeking costs for its expenses and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate .
How this is resolved depends on one factor : Judge Hellerstein .
Doubtless , the CIA will respond with papers proclaiming its innocence , and no doubt denying that it was aware of the destruction .
However , this is where the Judge himself - if he does not give the ACLU discovery powers - may demand that the CIA tell him what they have been up to , given his clear prior orders .
As I have written before , judges appointed by Republican presidents tend to throw cases that might embarrass Republican presidents out of their court , as quickly as they can figure out how to do so .
Federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents , fortunately , do not tend to cower when either Republican or Democratic presidents are involved .
A judge ends up with a case like this through a random selection procedure ; in this case , the CIA happened to draw a Judge it cannot intimidate , which makes it interesting .
More on Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein , Who Issued the Videotapes Order
Judge Hellerstein was appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1998 .
An editor of the Columbia Law Review during his law school years , he started his legal career in the Judge Advocate General ( JAG ) Corps of the Army in 1959 - 1960 .
An experienced litigator with a prestigious New York City law firm , he is a highly - respected judge .
He works hard , is fair , and is savvy .
He is also a nightmare for the CIA in a case like this , because on June 3 , 2005 he ordered the release of four videos from Abu Ghraib , along with dozens of photographs - not withstanding an effort of the government to suppress this material from ever becoming public .
Judge Hellerstein appears to have no tolerance for torture .
Unlike his former colleague and now - Attorney General Michael Mukasey , who still is not clear that waterboarding is torture , one does not have the sense that Judge Hellerstein suffers from such confusion .
While Judge Hellerstein is going to appropriately protect the sources and methods of the CIA , if any judge is going to get to the bottom of this destruction of these records quickly , this is the judge .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush cannot order the military to indefinitely imprison a suspected al Qaeda operative , who is the only foreign national held in the United States as an “ enemy combatant , ” a court ruled on Monday .

President Bush cannot order the military to seize and indefinitely detain the Qatari national and suspected al Qaeda operative , the only person being held in the United States as an " enemy combatant " , an appeals court ruled on Monday .
REUTERS / Peoria County Sheriff's Office / Handout
The 2 - 1 appellate ruling was a major setback for Bush ’s contention in the war on terrorism that he has the power to detain people in the United States without charging them .
The court panel based in Richmond , Virginia , ruled that the Qatari national involved , Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , must be released from military custody .
“ The decision protects legal residents and citizens from secret detention , ” said al - Marri ’s lawyer , Jonathan Hafetz of the Brennan Centre for Justice in New York .
The fresh blow to Bush ’s policies , already under scrutiny on Capitol Hill and in military tribunals , followed last week ’s dismissal of charges against two terrorism suspects at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
Judges in those high - profile cases have been considering acceptable standards for trying terrorism suspects since the September 11 attacks .
The Pentagon is asking for reconsideration of the rulings that two were being held in the controversial prison because they were designated only as “ enemy combatants , ” and not “ unlawful enemy combatants ” as required by a 2006 law crafted after earlier definitions were rejected .
In the case involving al - Marri , who has been held in a U.S. Navy brig in Charleston , South Carolina , for about four years without charges , Judge Diana Gribbon Motz made a clear distinction for suspects being held in the United States .
“ The government cannot subject al - Marri to indefinite military detention .
For in the United States , the military cannot seize and imprison civilians -- let alone imprison them indefinitely , ” she said .
The ruling sent the case back to a federal judge in South Carolina with instructions to direct the defence secretary to release al - Marri from military custody within a reasonable period of time .
The government can transfer him to civilian authorities to face criminal charges , initiate deportation proceedings , hold him as a witness in a grand jury proceeding or detain him for a limited period under the Patriot Act , an anti-terrorism law .
MILITARY DETENTION MUST CEASE
“ But military detention of al - Marri must cease , ” Motz concluded in her 77 - page ruling rejecting the administration ’s argument that Bush has the legal power to keep him indefinitely .
She also rejected the argument that the 2006 law passed by the Republican - controlled U.S. Congress takes away such cases from U.S. courts .
Al - Marri entered the United States on September 10 , 2001 , and was said by a captured al Qaeda member to be there to help operatives planning a second wave of attacks .
Al - Marri was a legal U.S. resident and was initially detained in December 2001 to testify in the investigation of the September 11 attacks .
He later was indicted in Illinois , where he attended school , for credit card fraud , making false statements to the FBI and other charges .
Al - Marri pleaded not guilty .
The U.S. government dropped the charges on June 23 , 2003 , when Bush designated him an enemy combatant and al - Marri was taken to Charleston .
Besides al - Marri , only two others have been held as enemy combatants inside the United States since the hijacked airliner attacks .
In January of 2006 , Jose Padilla , who had been held for three years at the same brig in Charleston , had his case transferred to a criminal court in Miami , where his trial is now under way .
And Yaser Esam Hamdi , another U.S. citizen held at the brig for two years , was deported to Saudi Arabia after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2004 upheld his right to challenge his detention .
The Justice Department said it would appeal the ruling to the entire appeals court .
Peterson was shot by a police sniper several hours after the killings
The shootings on Sunday have left the small town of Crandon , in the north of the Midwestern state , in shock .
The gunman , named as Tyler Peterson , 20 , worked full - time as a deputy sheriff in Forest County .
As well as his ex-girlfriend , he shot two childhood friends and a 14 - year - old girl .
His motive is not yet known .
Police Chief John Dennee said Peterson , who also worked as a part - time police officer , was not on duty at the time of the shooting .
The incident occurred at his ex-girlfriend 's house shortly before 0300 local time ( 0800 GMT ) , where the young people had gathered to watch movies and eat pizza , reports said .
A seventh youth is said to be in critical condition in hospital .
Tight - knit community
Residents of Crandon , a community of 2,000 about 225 miles ( 360 kilometres ) north of Milwaukee , were ordered to stay in their homes while police hunted for Peterson .
At about 3 pm local time he was " brought down by a sniper " , Crandon Mayor Gary Bradley said .
The young people had gathered at a house to watch late - night movies
" There is probably nobody in Crandon who is not affected by this , " Mr Peters said , adding that students would be especially affected .
" They are going to wake up in shock and disbelief and a lot of pain . "
Jenny Stahl , whose 14 - year - old daughter Lindsay was the youngest victim , said she had thought the teenager would be safer staying at a friend 's house than travelling home late at night .
" I 'm waiting for somebody to wake me up right now .
This is a bad , bad dream , " Mrs Stahl said .
Bud Evans , an elder at Crandon Praise Chapel , told BBC News 24 that worried relatives had gathered at the church as they waited for news .
" If there 's five or six children or kids , young adults , whatever , involved in this , I 'd know every one of them - the community 's that small and that tight - knit , " Mr Evans said .
The incident comes only six months after the Virginia Tech campus shooting , in which more than 30 people were killed .
New suborbital spaceplane design has been unveiled by Rocketplane Global , Inc. , featuring more powerful engines and added room for passengers .
HOLLOMANAIR FORCE BASE , N.M. – Rocketplane Global , Inc. ( RGI ) of Oklahoma City , Oklahoma announced today a facelift for itsfirst XP Spaceplane – transforming it into a morepowerful craft that provides a roomier ride for suborbital patrons .
Since 2004 , Rocketplane has been building their XPSpaceplane , a four - seat , fighter - sized vehiclepowered by two jet engines and a rocket engine .
But thingshave changed over the last year and a half , said Dave Faulkner , Program Managerof Rocketplane Global .
" We 've learned quite abit over that time and realized that we needed to make some changes , " hesaid .
The revisedXP Spaceplane design revealed today here at the siteof this year 's X Prize Cup festivities is a five - passenger , single - pilot craft .
Shipshapefeatures
Faulknertold SPACE.com that both computer modeling and wind tunnel testing haveled the firm 's design team to reshape their suborbital spaceship .
A key changeis that company engineers are going away from a souped - upLearjet concept .
" We were changing 95 percent of the Learjet to make it arocket plane .
So it was no longer a Learjet ?
it just so happened that we wereusing a few Learjet parts , " Faulkner said .
The vehiclenow features a new fuselage design , although , like its predecessor , the body ofthe spaceplane will be aluminum and utilize titaniumleading edges .
On the craft 's nose , a set of fixed canards have been added forcontrol purposes .
Anotheralteration can be seen at the spaceplane 's tailsection – a T - tail instead of a V - tail is to be used , shaving off some weightwhile realizing added redundancy and extra control .
A beefierlanding gear system has also been scoped out , to be provided by LoudEngineering & Manufacturing , a CIRCOR Aerospace company located in Ontario , California .
One majorchange is use of afterburning J85 engines , with the overall thrust to weightfor the spaceplane redesign going up significantly –about 50 percent more thrust , he added .
RocketplaneGlobal has already put their money down – a still hush - hush amount of cash – and is about to take receipt of 11 of those engines from Magellan Aerospace , aCanadian company .
Flightplan
Here 's the flightplan for suborbitalcustomers :
The Rocketplane XP would take off fromthe runway at the Oklahoma Spaceport , scooting into the air just like aconventional business jet .
The craft jets itself into climb mode , flying to alittle over 40,000 feet .
At this point , the spaceship 's pilot ignites thecraft 's powerful rocket engine , pulling up into a nearly vertical climb forsoaring into space .
As the vehicle arcs over , all onboard willexperience three to four minutes of weightlessness – along with an incredibleview that only a small , select group of people have ever seen .
Within minutes , the descent begins .
Under theload of several
Gs pushing passengers down into their seat , they are on aunique space roller coaster ride .
The XP 's specially designed thermalprotection system transfers away the heat of re-entry , permitting safe , slowtravel toward terra firma .
As the Rocketplane XPslows and enters the lower atmosphere , the pilot restarts the jet engines andbegins the final leg of the flight back to the spaceport and a conventionalrunway landing .
For the inside look of the passengercabin , Rocketplane Global is engaging the talents of Frank Nuovo , a visionary , world - class designer .
He isa visionary force behind Vertu , the luxurycommunications company , and spearheaded Nokia 's styling and global industrialdesign innovations .
Fee -paying flyers will be treated topersonal video screens , given the ability to pick views from different camerason the spaceship .
While passengers will be provided a personal DVD of theirflight , do n't be shy about stuffing your own camera in your flight suitfor taking those keepsake images of your own .
Investment dollars
Rocketplane Global is deep in discussion withseveral investment groups , Faulkner said , " and they are getting serious ? we 're progressing very well on that part . "
What amount of investment dollars isinvolved ?
Faulkner remained tight - lipped , noting that this information iscompetition sensitive .
" But we need to bring in thefinal round of investment to take the craft to flight .
So that 's what we 'rebusy doing , " Faulkner said .
" I believe that we bring in theinvestment soon ?
we will be in flight test and have revenue operations in2010 . "
Initially , the company would startout with two vehicles , forecasting a fleet of five by 2012 .
" We 're going to fly eachvehicle about a little over once a week .
If there are no issues with thevehicle , we 're going to be able to turn it around in 24 - hours , " Faulknerexplained .
" That 's the design goal right now ?
and I think that 's verydoable .
We want to be a service provider for space transportation . "
Recycling the spaceplaneto carry the next set of passengers wo n't require a standing army of thousands , said Chuck Lauer , Rocketplane Global ' sVice President of Business Development .
How much will a flight on the Rocketplane XP slap your wallet or cause you to dig deepinto your purse ?
At present , the standard rate after the first 50 FounderFlights is $ 200,000 per seat .
That up front , right seat next to the pilot , isat a premium ticket price of $ 250,000 – given the wrap - around windows to gazethrough , Lauer said .
Degree of difficulty
To get things rolling , quiteliterally , the current forecast is for a flight test program of 50 flights .
"
We 'll have the vehicle instrumented to the hilt ?
making sure that we 'renot exceeding any limits before going into operation , " Faulkner added .
Asked about degree of difficulty infashioning the suborbital vehicle , Faulkner responded : " I would say it ismedium difficulty .
It is certainly not easy , but I would n't call it hardeither .
That 's because we 're not trying to develop new technology .
That 's oneof the philosophies of our company ?
to use existing technology and learn fromthose people that have done it before , rather than trying to reinvent thewheel . "
Working on the project are engineersthat have gone through the hard knocks of trial and error , Faulkner added .
Theteam includes experts tasked to develop the space shuttle main engine , as wellas a rocket designer involved in blasting off Apollo astronauts from the Moon 'ssurface once their moonwalking missions werecompleted .
To date , a little over 200,000 engineering hours have been spent on the new RocketplaneXP that debuted today , Faulkner said .
The company , he continued , is in negotiationwith a major airframe manufacturer , but no details as yet .
Going global
Lauer said the intent of Rocketplane Global is just that – pushing a vision thatsuch vehicles could constitute a distributed fleet flying from multiplelocations .
" Having a site in Asia , Europe ?
being able to offer people views of their particular part of the world ispart of servicing the customer , " he told SPACE.com .
Use of the vehicle to support other typesof activity has also been detailed as part of the business strategy , Lauersaid .
" We 're not basing our businessplan on capturing the whole market , " Faulkner noted .
" I think there 'senough room , at least from what we 've seen , to have a few players in themarket .
But I guess we 'll see what happens when we get there , " heobserved .
Faulkner said that the vehicle , withthe changes that have been made , " just looks right and it's also relatableto the public out there . "
" It is like an airplane that happensto just pop up into space occasionally , " Faulkner pointed out .
" Andit just looks good . "
" Looks good , flies good .
Thatstill applies , even in space , " Lauer concluded .

OAKLAND , Calif .  Senator Clinton is moving to tie President Bush 's hands with respect to Iran by endorsing legislation that would prohibit military action against the regime in Tehran without prior approval from Congress .
" I believe the president has squandered our trust and that 's why we need this legislation .
If the president believes that the use of force against Iran is necessary , he must come to the Congress and make the case to the American people , " Mrs. Clinton said during a speech here yesterday .
" It would be a mistake of historic proportions if the administration thought anything Congress ever passed would give it the right to use force against Iran without further , explicit congressional authorization . "
Mrs. Clinton noted that she issued a similar warning to Mr. Bush in a Senate floor speech earlier this year .
However , she is now coupling that salvo with support for a bill Senator Webb of Virginia , a Democrat , is planning to introduce that would deny spending authority for any military operation against Iran .
The former first lady was quick to insist that the measure would not hamper the ability of American soldiers in Iraq to respond to attacks from Iranian forces or their allies .
" This legislation would not infringe on the ability of our troops to protect themselves against attack from Iran or by Iranian surrogates .
We never take away the right of self - defense , " she said .
By endorsing the Iran legislation , Mrs. Clinton is continuing to tack through the rocky shoals of Democratic Party opinion on war - related issues .
At a debate last week , a former senator from North Carolina , John Edwards , and a former senator from Alaska , Mike Gravel , both chastised Mrs. Clinton for voting for a nonbinding measure to designate Iran 's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization .
Mr. Edwards said passing the resolution could prompt Mr. Bush to claim he had congressional permission for an attack on Iran .
" You cannot give this president the authority and you can't even give him the first step in that authority because he cannot be trusted , " Mr. Edwards said .
Mrs. Clinton defended her vote on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard resolution yesterday , saying she backed the measure " in order to gain leverage in our diplomatic efforts . "
The new legislation proposed by Mr. Webb and Mrs. Clinton could prove to be little more than symbolic .
It may not get enough support to clear the Senate , could face a veto by Mr. Bush , and might well violate the Constitution by constraining the president 's authority as commander in chief .
Still , Mrs. Clinton 's endorsement of the measure underscores how concerned she is about being painted as a closet militarist by liberal Democratic activists .
A supporter of pro-Israel causes who is backing Mrs. Clinton 's presidential bid , Steve Rabinowitz , said her support for the funding restriction did not signal that the former first lady has turned soft on Iran .
" She has been as tough on Iran as anyone could reasonably expect , " Mr. Rabinowitz , a former aide to President Clinton , said .
" Let 's keep in mind that requiring congressional authority does n't mean you do n't have a willingness to give it . "
In a separate development , Mrs. Clinton made further inroads into Senator Obama 's potential base yesterday by winning the endorsement of a longtime African - American congressman who now serves as mayor of Oakland , Ronald Dellums .
" This is a pivotal moment .
This is not about symbolism .
This is about substance , " Mr. Dellums said in an apparent reference to expectations that he would endorse or at least avoid snubbing the presidential bid of Mr. Obama , who is partly of African descent .
" I believe that history will record you will go down as one of the greatest presidents that ever led this country further into the 21st century , " Mr. Dellums declared as he stood next to Mrs. Clinton at a community college in Oakland .
Mr. Dellums praised Mrs. Clinton 's urban policy agenda , which he said contained " a magnificent statement of the plight of thousands and thousands of our young people that we are grinding up like glass in this country . "
Earlier , Mrs. Clinton attended two fund - raisers , including one at a Tiburon , Calif. , home with a sweeping view of the San Francisco Bay .
Between 300 and 400 people paid $ 500 or more to attend the " sold out " breakfast .
" I thought her speech was magnificent , " one attendee , Jennifer Traeger - Hirschfelder , 37 , of San Francisco , said .
Ms. Traeger - Hirschfelder said she was supporting Mrs. Clinton in part because her seasoning would serve her well .
" She had been through the ringer when her husband was president .
Now she really knows how to sling it right back , " Ms. Traeger - Hirschfelder said .
" I like John Edwards and Barack Obama , but I 'm really not sure they would know what you have to do to deal with that . "
If you 're anything like me , you hate opening your mailbox to see a whole pile of junk mail waiting for you .
Credit Card offers ( more on those in part 2 of this series ) , fake checks from mortgage firms , endless reams of useless coupons and , of course , the trusty 1lb envelope of garbage from ValPak .
But a friend recently told me of a hidden gem inside the ValPak envelope .
A gem that 's worth at least $ 20 .
The voucher that 's like Wonka 's golden ticket .
Inside ValPak envelopes ( depending on your zip code ) is a voucher from Northwest Airlines .
It looks something like the picture below ( I apologize for the poor quality , it 's the best pic I could find anywhere on the web ) .
Now , what this voucher does is give the redeemer anywhere from $ 25 to $ 100 off of a Northwest Airlines flight .
Great , if you happen to be in the market for a flight .
If you 're not , which is probably the case , you 'll trash it .
But using the mighty reach of eBay you can find hundreds of people who desperately want to save cash on a flight .
And that means quick money for the smart eBayer .
Making the quick buck (s ) .
All you have to do is list your Northwest Airlines voucher on eBay .
As you can see , completed listings ( for eBay novices , those green prices are the final SOLD price for the item ) are averaging $ 20 - $ 25 .
That 's cold , hard cash for a voucher that was sent to you free in the mail .
List the item for a starting price of around $ 18.99 and give FREE shipping ( it 's just the cost of a stamp anyway ) .
You may also want to do a Buy It Now option for $ 19.99 .
It 's all up to you .
Get vouchers from friends , make even more money .
Most people will be more than happy to give you their ValPak envelopes , if they have n't already dumped them in the garbage .
You could get 5 or 6 NWA vouchers and sell them in seperate auctions , or list them as " 5 available " in one auction .
Either way , that 's at least $ 100 lovely dollars from something that used to be a pain in your butt .
Now , prepare for something you 've never experienced before in your life .
Get ready to be happy to see junk mail in your mail box .
Next time , starting the Junk Mail war .

In the Bush administration ’s latest attempt to put a prettier face on its war in Iraq , U.S. officials are making increasing reference to a “ Korea model . ”
In this pipe dream , the situation in Iraq would be stabilized in the same way that the Korean War was resolved .
Just as U.S. military bases and tens of thousands of U.S. troops remained in Korea after the fighting ended in 1953 — more than 25,000 will remain there even after the currently proceeding reductions — so U.S. bases and tens of thousands of troops would remain in Iraq indefinitely , conducting a “ security mission . ”
Although reference to the Korean War ’s outcome as a model for Iraq represents a novel element in the administration ’s propaganda , this gambit , like many others before it , simply clothes the established plan in a new rhetorical garment .
The maintenance of large , permanent U.S. bases and hefty troop contingents in Iraq has struck many observers as part of the plan all along , notwithstanding repeated official denials .
Construction of the gargantuan U.S. “ embassy ” in Baghdad also suggests strongly that the U.S. government expects to continue its domination of Iraq ’s affairs for a very long time .
Introduction of a new analogy in the administration ’s attempts to justify the continued U.S. engagement in Iraq does raise the question , though : why Korea ?
On its face , the comparison makes little sense .
As Fred Kaplan has aptly observed , “ in no meaningful way are these two wars , or these two countries , remotely similar .
In no way does one experience , or set of lessons , shed light on the other . ”
Moreover , the United States suffered a less - than - glorious outcome in the bloody , three - year clash of arms in Korea .
The fighting ended in a stalemate , and no peace treaty was signed , only an armistice enforced by a tense , permanent stand - off of heavily - armed forces facing each another across the Demilitarized Zone near the 38th parallel , where the North Korean invasion began in 1950 .
Why would anyone want to replicate the essential features of that costly and pointless engagement ’s outcome ?
Kaplan ’s answer seems insightful as far as it goes .
“ Now , ” he remarks , “ whether due to hindsight or forgetfulness , the Korean War does n’t seem so bad .
By likening that war to the present war , [ George W. ] Bush and [ Whitehouse press secretary Tony ]
Snow are trying to convince us that , in the future , the Iraq war wo n’t seem so bad either . ”
An important point Kaplan does not emphasize , however , pertains to a particular feature of the Korean War ’s outcome .
Although the great majority of Americans by 1952 had come to oppose the Korean War and to loathe President Harry S Truman , they learned to live with the war ’s consequences , in particular , with the permanent deployment of large U.S. military forces in and around South Korea .
Now , national leaders hope that although the great majority of Americans have come to oppose the war in Iraq and to loathe President Bush , they will learn to live with the war ’s consequences , in particular , with the permanent deployment of large U.S. military forces in and around Iraq .
The American people , for the most part , want to bring the troops home .
The government , however , wants to keep many of the troops in Iraq forever .
To resolve this political conflict between the people and their leaders , government officials seek to draw a parallel between it and a previous , similar , political conflict that was resolved by the public ’s acquiescence in the government ’s plan .
The president and his spokesmen in effect are telling us : you got used to bearing the costs of keeping a permanent U.S. force in Korea ; you can just as well get used to bearing the costs of keeping a permanent U.S. force in Iraq .
Even if this political stratagem succeeded on this side of the water , however , events in Iraq itself would almost certainly reveal its bankruptcy as a working model for a permanent U.S. occupation .
After 1953 , relatively few South Koreans were striving to kick out the U.S. military , and nobody was attacking G.I .
Joe with rifles , roadside bombs , and mortars .
South Korean politics , though turbulent , did not have to accommodate implacable tribal , ethnic , and religious hatreds joined with a widespread eagerness to resort to political violence .
One could imagine that South Korea might someday become a workable liberal democratic country , and in time it did so .
Only those of us inclined to disregard reality , however , can imagine Iraq becoming such a country any time soon .
Perhaps the greatest of all the neocon fantasies was the idea that Iraq could make this transformation — and easily , at that .
Iraq may break into more politically homogeneous fragments ( Kurdish Iraq is already semi-autonomous ) .
If it does not break apart , in all likelihood it can remain a viable political entity only under the sort of authoritarian regimes it endured throughout its history as an independent state prior to the U.S. invasion .
Even this unfortunate outcome , however , would constitute an improvement over the bloody Hobbesian chaos that has prevailed during the U.S. occupation .
The U.S. government cannot impose a better result at gunpoint , as the events of the past four years have clearly shown .
Moreover , as long as its forces remain in Iraq in more than token numbers , many Iraqis will continue to mount attacks on them , seeking to drive them out of the country completely .
The United States will never be able to achieve “ victory ” in Iraq in the same way that it “ won ” World War II .
When President Bush declares that in Iraq “ we ’ll succeed unless we quit , ” he is either defining success in a bizarre fashion or whistling past the graveyard or , perhaps most likely , failing to appreciate the realities on the ground — after all , the president is anything but an intellectual giant and , worse , he is sublimely content with his own ignorance .
Of course , he may simply be stalling , dishing out any half - plausible twaddle his handlers contrive , until the day he leaves office and the next president is saddled with cleaning up the mess Bush and company have made .
Whereas at this point no one can realistically imagine any real U.S. success in Iraq , apart from the great financial success being enjoyed by Halliburton , Blackwater , and the rest of the vast legion of contractors and mercenaries , one can easily imagine a Vietnam model for the ultimate resolution of the U.S. invasion and occupation .
The image comes readily to mind of the last U.S. helicopter lifting off the roof of a building in the super - fortress embassy complex , while exuberant crowds of insurgents celebrate in the streets of Baghdad by firing their AK - 47s into the air .
Exactly when the U.S. forces will leave Iraq , whether in an orderly withdrawal or in an ignominious getaway , depends most fundamentally , however , not on events in Iraq , but on events in the United States .
All politics is local ; all foreign policy is domestic politics .
The ill - fated U.S. occupation of Iraq will not end until a sufficient number of Americans stand up and declare that they will no longer tolerate its continuation and that they will use the material , intellectual , and moral resources at their disposal to punish any American politician who acts to keep U.S. forces in Iraq .
Then , and only then , will this nightmare end , as the previous nightmare in Vietnam finally ended when the great majority emphatically said “ no more . ”
Until that day , however , the politicians will stay the wretched course , regardless of public opinion , because doing so brings political and material benefits to themselves , their cronies , and the coalition of special - interest groups that brought them into office and rewards them for their actions there .
The war in Iraq only appears to be a conflict between American soldiers and Iraqi resistance fighters ; at its foundation , it is a conflict between the rulers and the ruled here in the United States .

A federal judge expressed frustration Tuesday that the government provided incorrect information about evidence in the prosecution of Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and raised the possibility of ordering a new trial in another high - profile terrorism case .
At a post - trial hearing Tuesday for Ali al - Timimi , a Muslim cleric from Virginia sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for soliciting treason , U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said she can no longer trust the CIA and other government agencies on how they represent classified evidence in terror cases .
After the hearing , the judge issued an order that said she would not rule on the prosecutors ' motion until the government grants needed security clearances to al - Timimi's defense lawyer , Jonathan Turley , and the lead trial prosecutor so they can review the secret pleadings .

As customers continue to shift their telephone needs away from traditional landlines and over to cell and VoIP services , DSL users still face the problem of hanging onto broadband without their landline phone connection .
Speakeasy has made a name for itself by offering naked DSL , but it 's not available in all areas , and most telcos would rather not give up a major revenue generator by allowing customers to bypass the landline .
But AT&T agreed earlier this year , as part of its conditions for acquiring BellSouth , that it would introduce a standalone DSL option by the end of 2007 .
As pointed out to us by DSL Reports , that day has already come and gone without much fanfare from AT&T .
The company began offering its $ 19.95 DSL - only service on December 20 , which apparently comes without contract and no landline .
However , some digging around AT&T 's site yields — to no one 's surprise — confusing and conflicting options .
The service is referred to as DSL Lite , but the only mention of DSL Lite I could find on AT&T 's site is in a press release about the service 's introduction in the Southwest in June .
There is , however , a similarly - priced $ 19.99 DSL option that does require a landline , but has no contract ( that 's clearly not it ) .
Finally , I was able to find an AT&T Yahoo !
High - Speed Internet " Basic " option for $ 19.95 per month with a downstream speed of up to 768 k bps — it has no landline requirement but it does apparently require a one - year contract .
The next tier up , " Express , " appears to be the closest to this mythical , contract - less $ 20 deal I can get where I live — it goes for $ 23.99 with no landline , no contract , and offers 1.5 M bps down .
That 's not a bad deal , but if we 're picking nits , it 's clear that AT&T is making this $ 19.95 option difficult to find and relatively undesirable .
That should come as no surprise , though .
In June , AT&T ( also quietly ) introduced a $ 10 DSL option as part of its merger agreement .
The 768 Kbps down , 128 Kbps up service came with a landline , came with a one - year contract , and was limited to new customers only .
It was slightly more buried in the company 's web site than the new naked DSL option , too , leading critics to blast the company for not doing enough to advertise the new service .
In August , AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson defended the move , claiming that it was n't difficult to find at all , but that customers just plain did n't want the $ 10 option .
As is the case with the $ 10 DSL offering , AT&T is only required to offer the $ 20 naked DSL option for the next two and a half years .
After that , the company is free to make whatever changes it wants to the service .
Given how little it has marketed either option , it 's pretty clear that when those two and a half years are up , AT&T will probably kill them both off .

" When the aggression by a territorial state is only downward , towards its own population , we call this condition u2018 peace ' . "
~ Murray Rothbard , from " Rothbard on the Warfare State "
As I completed a 6 - mile run the other day , an oft - repeated phrase danced around in my head , taunting me .
I was pondering libertarian law generally , and concepts like anarchy , self - defense , the NAP ( non-aggression principle ) specifically , along with what each of these concepts might mean to a society .
Simultaneously , I also pondered the plight of the two young men shot and killed by police in NYC some time ago .
In fact , the relatively recent ( on - going ? ) rash of police - involved injuries and deaths seemed to fill my thoughts , from the 92 - year - old who was shot to death by police during a drug raid gone bad , to the student who was severely tazed for not showing his ID .
Certainly , no review of recent law enforcement or judicial lawlessness would be complete without at least a passing glance at the similarities between the Duke non-rape non-sexual assault case and the Scottsboro boys case from long ago .
And who can forget the case of Genarlow Wilson , the teenager currently serving a 10 - year sentence for consensual sex , due almost totally to an ambitious ( and let 's be honest , psychotic ) prosecutor .
Ten years in jail ?
Are you kidding me ?
Against this backdrop , I found myself trying to reconcile that old legal saw , " No one can take the law into his own hands . "
This logic is cited on TV legal dramas whenever someone who has been harmed contemplates taking direct revenge upon those who are known to have caused their pain .
Often this phrase is uttered as a salve to soothe retribution - soaked homicidal urges .
What I wondered that day and what I wonder now is this :
Is n't the law already in our hands ?
Are we not somewhat to blame when prosecutors — such as ( former ) Durham District Attorney Michael Nifong , late of the Duke Non-Crime Hoax , or Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , who recently vowed to fight a judge 's ruling to have Wilson released — impose their heinous and power - mad will upon innocent victims ?
If the law is not in our hands , would we not be better off — as I discuss in my essay on the crime in Gotham City — if it were ?
Either we should take it back or it's our fault when it goes awry — plain and simple .
The Displacement of Responsibility
Fellow LRC contributor Stefan Molyneux is rather fond of telling statists , " You want me dead ! "
Part of his reason for saying this is to shock them , but part of it is also directly juxtaposed against the reality of a coercive state .
People who 've yet to drink of the libertarian Kool - Aid typically support some ( and sometimes quite a few ) government programs .
Which ones they support just depend upon which animal - shaped idol their political party marches under .
Liberals generally support social programs — welfare for example .
Conservatives generally support imperialist programs — worldwide military intervention for example .
Both sides typically support entitlement programs — social security for example .
The fact that all of these programs rest on the back of direct aggression — in the form of theft — from everyone , is apparently obscured from the view of either side .
Then again , maybe they just do n't care , but that is probably another debate .
If you approach anyone claiming membership in either of these groups with Stef 's pet phrase , they would recoil in horror .
Of course that is not true !
However , if any one of us stops paying taxes to support any or all those programs , eventually , men with guns are going to get involved .
At some later point , we could end up in prison .
( If you do n't think this is true , talk to Wesley Snipes , Irwin Schiff , Larken Rose , et al . )
While going to prison might not exactly be death , it is close enough for me .
If I now rephrase my objection to the statist , he would say , " I did n't put you in jail !
You broke the law ; it 's your own fault . "
To this I would simply say , " So you wanted me dead , punished , beaten , raped , or whatever ; you just did n't have the guts to do it yourself . "
Aye , there 's the rub .
Those who support the coercive state seem to think that when the hammer falls , it was n't their fault .
This is simply not true .
The law is already in our hands .
Some who witness the goings on of recent legal cinema , including the Martha Stewart trial , the Ken Lay trial , the Dick Simkanin trial , and countless others are likely to have some feeling that " justice was done " because they believe that the judicial system is set up to preclude mistakes .
What if it 's not ?
What if the same driving forces that make the coercive state such a great breeding ground for evil also interact with the supposed blindness of justice ?
As the law is used more and more as a first - order tool of social engineering versus a last - order tool of moral retribution do we not inevitably edge closer and closer to the abyss of a police state ?
G. Edward Griffin says it wonderfully in his Creed of Freedom :
" If government is powerful enough to give us everything we want , it is also powerful enough to take from us everything we have . "
Indeed .
Someone once said that we may not get all the government we want , but we should be happy we do n't get all the government we pay for .
I tend to agree , but that is why the law must remain in our hands .
( Now I 'm an anarchist , so I want even less government than Mr. Griffin , but I liked his words anyway . )
What 's Against the Law , and Who Gets to Decide ?
Before one can begin even the most cursory analysis of justice , one needs to understand the only two sources for crimes available .
A crime can be malum in se — wrong by its very nature , or malum prohibitum — wrong because it has been prohibited by statute .
We seem to live in a time when more and more people — seemingly drunk off the overcooked pot liquor of learned stupidity — either do n't know which is which or worse yet , do n't care .
Punishment is what the law is for !
Justice is just details !
Let me relate an example from my own life , before the logic of truth overwhelmed me .
Quite a few years back the Rochester P.D. ran a " sting " in the inner city .
They set up phony drug buys for people looking to pick up a little weed for the weekend .
They caught a bunch of suburbanites in the operation .
As I understand it , several of the folks arrested actually had their kids strapped in the back seats of their cars , on their way home after picking their off - spring up from Catholic schools in the city .
( I kid you not .
You can not make this stuff up . )
So anyway , here these folks were , pinched for ostensibly buying drugs , and about to be charged with a rather severe crime .
What happened ?
Nothing .
They were released .
What ?
The outrage !
This is a clear example of the system protecting its own .
If these folks had been black , well , you know …
Forget it .
( I actually had some of those types of thoughts back when this incident happened .
Good thing I decided to read a little more . )
They were released for one simple reason : they did n't break the law .
As part of the sting , the undercover cops sold their " marks " oregano or some other herb instead of , well , real " herb . "
( Does anyone still call it that ? )
It 's not against the law to purchase a legal substance , in this case a garden herb , from a police officer .
End of story .
So what 's the point of this little anecdote ?
Just one simple question provides the context :
What differentiates oregano from marijuana ?
If I decide I want to smoke some ragweed tomorrow , will anyone care ?
What makes the purchase of crack so bad when I could purchase powdered sugar from an undercover cop all day long ?
Nothing , except the effect it has on the user .
Yet we have a prison system filled to the brim with people who have done nothing but purchase an " illegal " drug , often for their own use or sell an illegal drug to people who sought them out to buy it .
Why have we let it come to this ?
I thought the law was in our hands ?
Here 's another anecdote from my own life .
I served on a jury in a criminal case about three ( 3 ) years ago .
By the way , I know jury duty gets a bad rap , but you owe it to yourself and your fellow citizens to serve if you get the chance .
Nothing can illustrate more about how " the system " works than actually seeing it in action .
( In case you 're wondering , watching Boston Legal does not accomplish the same thing ! )
The case we heard involved an assault , but that portion of the case is largely irrelevant to my story .
What is relevant is that the defendant had a previous drug conviction .
He had sold ( or bought ) some coke to ( or from ) an undercover policeman .
This gave him a " first strike " under the mandatory sentencing guidelines in NY .
Because of this , had we convicted him of the relatively " tame " assault charge , he would have gotten 25 years .
Twenty - five years ?
How in hell can anyone call that kind of sentencing justice ?
Furthermore , how can a judge render justice by looking at some chart ?
The law is ( supposed to be ) in his hands .
I should mention that we had no idea of the sentencing guidelines at the time .
We rendered our verdict without that knowledge .
The judge told us what would have happened in the " wrap - up " after the trial .
In all honesty , I was determined to not send a man to jail for a weak reason even without that prior knowledge , but if we had convicted him and learned about this mandatory sentencing after the fact , I would have been horribly disappointed .
As it turned out , I was even happier with our decision .
Thank goodness the law was in our hands .
No essay on the law could survive without at least one mention of Paris Hilton .
( Consider this essay covered ! )
As I troll the Internet ( yes , I 've too much time on my hands ) I notice that by and large the hue and cry is relatively uniform : " Put that bimbo in jail ! "
" She broke the law — twice — and she deserves her time . "
While no one could dispute that she did , in fact , break some rules , one would also have to admit that she committed no property violation .
She infringed upon no one else 's rights .
As such , what she committed was a malum prohibitum crime , which , as I already said , is simply a transgression against some State edict .
Certainly she was incredibly irresponsible , and certainly I am tired of her antics , but those are not crimes .
Yet .
As for me , despite her bimboriffic skankosity , I still say " Free Paris ! "
( And while we 're at it , " Free Genarlow ! " )
I wish the law were in my hands !
One of the most heinous areas where " crime " has been subverted for evil is in the federal realm .
The State has taken an entire area of free enterprise — the securities area — and simply " made up " — created out of thin air — a whole category of crimes , specifically for the purpose of dispensing justice as they see fit , regardless of the actual commission of a property violation .
For a better understanding of this area , allow me to quote fellow LRC contributor Bill Anderson :
The thing that people do n’t understand is that the government prosecuted Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling on “ securities fraud , ” which took acts that were legal ( if not questionable ) and bundled them into a crime .
Candice E. Jackson and I refer to such “ crimes ” as “ derivative crimes , ” in which the government takes a number of activities and then bundles them into an imaginary crime , yet it is considered a crime all the same .
For example , under RICO , one is charged with “ racketeering . ”
Now , no one “ racketeers ” someone else , as “ racketeering ” is an imaginary crime .
The “ crime ” of “ racketeering ” actually is a compilation of other actions that the government puts together the same way that finance people put financial “ derivatives ” together .
Because of the broad and loose way that federal criminal codes are written , just about any CEO can be charged with securities fraud .
Furthermore , let ’s face it , the Enron principals were prosecuted because the company got over - extended and went belly - up .
The government criminalized business failures .
My point always has been that this case belonged in civil , not criminal court .
However , in this day of the prosecutor , we see that people want others to go to prison , whether they committed a crime or not .
Rudy Giuliani started this mess , and we can be assured that the government is always looking to put new people into the crowbar motel .
Indeed .
The State decides , a priori , whom they want to make an example of , and then proceeds in whatever way they can to get the result they wish .
Not to put too fine a point on it , but that 's not close to justice .
If we know this , then the law could already be in our hands , we just are n't acting like it .
Conclusion
In order to rule , those in power , even in a pseudo - socialist democracy like Amerika must establish legitimacy for what they propose to do .
For all their power and all the overwhelming monopoly of force the state has , public opinion is a requirement for their continued success in ruling us .
As Hoppe states in , " The Origin and Nature of International Conflict , " what constrains the conduct of state rulers is public opinion .
So what should we do ?
Withhold your support , and let your opinion be known !
Do n't get out of jury duty .
There are few endeavors of which the " average citizen " can take part that matter more to the application of justice than serving on a jury .
When you serve , realize that you get to decide what is wrong and right , no matter what the judge says .
Do n't send anyone to jail for some B.S. that should n't even be against the law !
Let them know how you feel .
I said in a previous essay that I had written my first and last letter to my congressman .
I stand by that admission , but by the same token I have to admit that nothing can replace the feeling of contentment I got from letting my putz of a congressmen know that I knew he was chock full of dog poop .
Take responsibility for your own actions and demand the same of everyone else .
If you go to a car dealership and buy a lemon , it 's your responsibility .
The market penalizes loser car dealerships way more than a law ever will .
More importantly , a law can't protect you from your own stupidity without making you even more stupid in exchange .
Raise your voice .
I 'd be the first to admit that essayists like me are in no real danger here on " the internets . "
We can say pretty much whatever we please and even in this post 9/11 Amerika , we are relatively safe .
That 's all the better reason to take advantage of it !
Feel free to join me .
Fill your mind .
One of the completely unexpected benefits I experience from writing these essays is I end up absorbing a lot more information than I generate .
I read a lot of fantastic information both as research and in response to suggestions from respondents .
I can assure you that what I 've learned from writing these essays far exceeds what I 've conveyed within them .
( Yes , I know that 's obvious , but let 's just keep it between us . )
I said all of that to say just this :
The law is already in our hands .
I , for one , think it 's about time we started acting like it .

Bush 's Bogus Vietnam History Kills
It is often said that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it .
But a much worse fate may await countries whose leaders distort and falsify history .
Such countries are doomed to experience even bloodier miscalculations .

That was the case with Germany after World War I when Adolf Hitler ’s Nazis built a political movement based in part on the myth that weak politicians in Berlin had stabbed brave German troops in the back when they were on the verge of victory .
And it appears to be the case again today as President George W. Bush presents the history of the Vietnam War as a Rambo movie with the heroic narrative that if only the U.S. military had stuck it out , the war would have been won .
Or , more likely , the black wall of the Vietnam War Veterans Memorial would stretch most of the way to the U.S. Capitol .
After hearing his selective historical rendition of the Vietnam experience in his Aug. 22 address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , one is tempted to ask Bush what he would have done as President in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
Presumably , Bush would have prolonged or escalated the Vietnam War , although it ’s doubtful he would have called up the Texas Air National Guard where he was safely ensconced , while skipping his flight physical and seeking an early discharge .
In his speech , Bush justified an open - ended Vietnam War by citing the carnage that followed the U.S. military withdrawal .
“ One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America ’s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ‘ boat people , ’ ‘ re - education camps , ’ and ‘ killing fields , ’ ” Bush said .
In Bush ’s version of history , condemnation should fall on Presidents Lyndon Johnson , Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford for making the painful decisions that eventually extricated the United States from the Vietnam quagmire – rather than on Presidents Dwight Eisenhower , John Kennedy , Johnson and Nixon for inserting or keeping U.S. troops in the middle of the Indochinese civil war .
Bush also ignores the carnage that was inflicted by U.S. aerial bombings and massive firepower .
Historians estimate that some two million Indochinese were killed during the war , along with about 57,000 American soldiers .
Also , by invading Cambodia and authorizing secret carpet - bombing of the countryside , President Nixon spread the chaos into that politically fragile country , opening the door first to a military dictatorship and then to the rise of the fanatical Khmer Rouge .
Friends , Not Enemies
In his historical account , Bush leaves out , too , the longer - term reality and the fact that the great communist enemies of Asia – China and Vietnam – did not turn out to be the strategic threats to the United States that Cold Warriors insisted they would be .
Dominoes did not fall all across Asia .
Indeed , today ’s biggest threats from China appear to be the quality of the cheap goods it manufactures for American companies and its ownership of large quantities of U.S. government bonds .
Bush also has exchanged friendly visits with the leaders of Vietnam .
But that history and reality disappear in Bush ’s selective account .
Just as he cherry - picked intelligence on Iraq to justify his 2003 invasion , he is selecting what facts from history serve his political ends now .
In his VFW speech , Bush also continued his practice of baiting critics of his Iraq War policy as essentially imbecilic and anti-American .
He accused them of believing “ that if the United States would just leave a place like Iraq those who kill our troops or target civilians would no longer threaten us . ”
In truth , Iraq War critics have argued not that al - Qaeda would stop being a threat but that Bush ’s policies are playing into al - Qaeda ’s hands .
Not only did the U.S. invasion of Iraq divert U.S. forces from their pursuit of Osama bin Laden , but the Iraq War has proved to be a boon to al - Qaeda in recruiting , fundraising and regrouping for new terrorist attacks .
The evidence is that al - Qaeda actually wants the United States to remain bogged down in Iraq indefinitely so the organization can continue to exploit the American occupation .
In letters to Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , al - Qaeda leaders , holed up along the Pakistani - Afghan border , warned that al - Qaeda ’s position in Iraq might collapse if the United States left , removing both the magnet attracting young recruits and the glue holding together the fragile coalition between foreign jihadists and Iraqi nationalists .
A July 2005 letter attributed to al - Qaeda ’s second - in - command Ayman al - Zawahiri urged Zarqawi to talk up the idea of an Islamic “ caliphate , ” so the young jihadists , drawn to Iraq to fight the Americans , would n’t just “ lay down their weapons and silence the fighting zeal ” once the Americans left .
The “ Zawahiri letter , ” which was intercepted by U.S. intelligence , also predicted that an American departure would force the depleted force of al - Qaeda fighters into a desperate battle simply to carve out an enclave inside Iraq .
In a December 2005 letter , another top aide to Osama bin Laden , known as “ Atiyah , ” lectured Zarqawi on the need to act more respectfully toward Iraqi Sunni leaders so al - Qaeda could put down deeper roots in Iraq .
Atiyah emphasized the importance of keeping U.S. forces trapped in Iraq .
“ Prolonging the war is in our interest , ” Atiyah wrote in a letter that was discovered by U.S. forces after Zarqawi ’s death in June 2006 .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Al - Qaeda ’s Fragile Foothold . ” ]
Bush - bin Laden Symbiosis
By prolonging the Iraq War now , Bush is doing exactly what al - Qaeda wants .
“ As long as I ’m Commander in Chief , we will fight to win , ” Bush told the cheering VFW crowd .
In other words , Bush and the terrorists share a symbiotic relationship with Bush using the “ war on terror ” to expand his presidential powers at home and bin Laden exploiting the U.S. occupation of Iraq to enhance his standing in the Islamic world .
Now Bush has mixed in the emotional issue of the Vietnam War , as his father did during the first Persian Gulf War in 1991 .
Near the end of that standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein , President George H.W. Bush spurned a Russian plan for getting Iraqi forces to withdraw peacefully from Kuwait .
Instead , Bush wanted a successful ground war to exorcise the demons of Vietnam from the American psyche .
After U.S. ground forces administered a 100 - hour drubbing to the overmatched Iraqi troops , the elder George Bush declared in his first post - war remarks , “ By God , we ’ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all . ”
[ For details , see our new book , Neck Deep . ]
Still , the elder George Bush stopped U.S. forces before they could march up the Euphrates River and capture Baghdad .
He recognized that a military occupation of Iraq would alienate the Arab world and would sink the United States into another Vietnam - style quagmire , which could again embitter the American people about military adventures .
Sixteen years later , however , the specter of Vietnam has returned to hover over the deserts of Iraq , this time conjured up by the younger George Bush to justify an open - ended war , a war he is determined to pursue regardless of the number of U.S. soldiers and Iraqis who die and the number of new Islamic terrorists it creates .

Sony has nearly halved the cost of its PlayStation 3 hardware development kits to $ 10,250 /�7,500 , while also announcing a new integration of existing SN Systems software development tools , including ProDG , into the standard software development kit .
The PlayStation 3 Reference Tool will drop to $ 10,250 in North America , � 950,000 in Japan and � 7,500 in Europe , effective immediately and excluding tax .
Although the price cut may be seen as a reaction to the console 's continued low sales worldwide , the drop is in line with similar cuts made to PlayStation 2 development hardware a year after its launch .
As well as the hardware price drop , Sony will also integrate SN Systems ( now a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment , Inc. ) tools into the standard PS3 Software Development Kit ( SDK ) .
This will include the core ProDG programming tool , which can now be used on both the PS3 Reference Tool hardware and the Debugging Station .
Other SN Systems tools now included in the SDK include the SN Distributed Build System ( SN - DBS ) for reducing compiling times , the SN LINKER used to link compiled programs and the SN Compiler ( SNC ) which will be released in beta form from mid December .
Sony will also enable the Debugging Station for PS3 to be used in the programming process , assisting development on the Reference Tool hardware - instead of only being used as a quality assurance system for games under development .
In detailing the price cuts and new SDK a Sony press release also promised that , " As more and more new titles are developed for the PS3 format , SCEI will significantly reduce the price of the Reference Tool in order to contribute to the cost saving measures of the development community . "
It 's tearing me up so badly inside .
I just ca n't stand it .
I can't get rid of the feeling that I probably wo n't make it home from this war .
I have this horrible feeling that his fate will soon become my own .
I do n't want to die here Mom .
Do n't tell Erin bc I know it will devastate her .
But if somehow I do n't make it , I want you Mom and Dad and all the family and especially Erin to know I love you all so so much and appreciate everything you all have done for me in the thick and thin .
The most important thing I want you all to do , is to use all of your connections to do everything in your will to use my death as a tool with the media to end this pointless war .
Contact Michael
Moore or whomever it may be to get the word out about how disgusted with our government I am about forcing us to come here to wait for death to claim us .
I want it to end .
How many more friends , sons , daughters , mothers , and dads must die here before they say it 's enough ?
And if you do n't die , the worst part you have to live with is the guilt of surviving .
Surviving this war and not dying like your buddies to your left and to your right in combat .
I love you all so so much .
love ,
Zach
Wednesday August 8 2007 , Baghdad
' Death , " said Donald Rumsfeld , the former United States defence secretary , " has a tendency to encourage a depressing view of war . "
Zach Flory , 23 , did n't start his military career depressed .
He enlisted full of idealism about the potential of American power .
Raised in Clinton , Iowa , on the banks of the Mississippi , he came home on September 11 and asked his parents for permission to join the military .
They refused .
They wanted him to finish high school first .
" He was a young man with a conscience , " said his mother , Marcia , who has always been opposed to the war .
" He wanted to make things right . "
They hoped he would change his mind .
He did n't .
In February 2004 he enlisted in the first cavalry infantry division and signed a three - year contract .
He did his time , serving in South Korea and Texas , and should have been discharged in June .
Instead , the army forced him to extend his service by a year in what is known as the stop - loss programme - a form of indentured servitude that can keep soldiers working beyond the expiration of their contract for several years - and sent him to Iraq .
Shortly before he left he married Erin , whom he has known since childhood .
" Zach 's greatest fear is to have to shoot innocent civilians , " said Marcia shortly after he left .
" What is this war doing to our fine young men and women ? "
Even as Iraq has dominated America 's political stage it has occupied a parallel universe in mainstream society .
Military families may listen intently to every news report and live in constant fear of a visit from two uniformed officers in the wee hours .
But the rest of the nation is shopping .
This is the only war in modern American history that has coincided with a tax cut .
" People seem to think war is OK as long as it is someone else 's kid doing the fighting , " says Zach 's dad , Don .
Serving in it falls on the shoulders of the poor and the dark , who are over - represented in the military .
And the casualties fall disproportionately on white men from small towns - like Donald Young , Zach 's recently departed teenage friend .
Iraq remains the number one issue of political concern , but it is rarely the central topic of conversation .
Needless to say , Iraqi deaths barely feature at all .
The US military , which ostensibly came to liberate Iraqis , does not even count their corpses .
So their death toll is approximate - rounded up or down by the thousand rather than counted individually .
We 'll never know what tender words an insurgent might send to a family member following the death of a fellow combatant , let alone the final farewell of an unsuspecting civilian slain by American troops or a car bombing .
Perhaps if we did , it would help those with a limited imagination and compassion humanise the horrors of this war more easily .
Fortunately , this is not a competition .
Unfortunately , there is enough misery to go around .
This is an American story .
A tale of imperial overreach , military fatigue and political hubris as it affects a midwestern boy in a far away land who wants to get home .
" You can tell a true war story if it embarrasses you , " wrote Tim O'Brien in his Vietnam war novel , The Things They Carried .
" If you do n't care for obscenity , you do n't care for the truth ; if you do n't care for the truth , watch how you vote .
Send guys to war , they come home talking dirty . "
The army is " about broken " , said retired general Colin Powell last year - before Bush announced an escalation in troop numbers .
British military standards dictate that a soldier should have two years at home for every six months deployed and that anything less than this 4:1 ratio could " break the army " .
American troops currently serve 15 months followed by less than a year 's rest - a ratio of 4:5 .
US military leaders deny the army is strained .
But in recent years they have lowered standards and changed entry requirements in order to bolster flagging recruitment , including a push to attract non-citizens and to lift the upper age limit for new recruits .
Since 2001 it has raised by half the rate at which it grants " moral waivers " to potential recruits who have committed misdemeanours and lowered the educational level required .
Steven Green , the former soldier who now faces the death penalty on charges of raping a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and murdering her family in Mahmoudiya , entered the military on one such waiver .
On Friday the president 's new war adviser , Lieutenant General Douglas Lute , said it was time to think about restoring the draft .
" I think it makes sense to certainly consider it , " he said , suggesting that some soldiers ' families could soon reach breaking point themselves .
" And I can tell you , this has always been an option on the table . "
There is gruesome irony in the fact that such a possibility should come from an administration headed by a president who dodged the draft and a vice - president who " had other priorities " than serving in Vietnam .
But American conservatives have a curious inability to put their children where their mouth is when it comes to the war .
All of the main Republican contenders back it ; none of their children are in it .
On the day that Zach sent his email home , Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney addressed a town hall meeting 50 miles from his home town .
Romney was asked why none of his children are serving in the military .
" One of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation is helping me get elected because they think I 'd be a great president , " he said .

Considering how wise Senator Robert C. Byrd ( D ) was regarding Iraq , his words on Iran should carry significant weight .
Senator Byrd ( pdf ) :
It is deeply troubling to see the U.S. Senate joining the chest - pounding and saber - rattling of the Bush Administration .
I am no apologist for the Iranian regime , any more than I was for Saddam Hussein , but I fear that we may become entangled in another bloody quagmire .
We have been down this path before .
We have seen all too clearly where it leads .
Four and a half years ago , Secretary of State Colin Powell made a speech before the United Nations Security Council claiming to have evidence that proved Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was an imminent threat to U.S. and international security .
Others in the Administration made the rounds of the Washington news programs to pound the drums of war , scaring the public with visions of mushroom clouds and mobile chemical weapons labs .
The proponents of war compared Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler , warning ominously of the dangers of Chamberlain - like " appeasement . "
That is a seductive analogy , but it is a dangerously specious one .
Every foreign adversary is not the devil incarnate .
We know now that Saddam Hussein was militarily a paper tiger .
The intelligence that suggested he was an imminent threat was flat wrong .
Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction .
Saddam Hussein had not attacked our country .
Saddam Hussein was a ruthless tyrant , but he was not an imminent threat to U.S. national security .
And now we hear the same scare tactics and simple analogies trotted out again , this time with Iran .
Analogies can be dangerous things ; they risk oversimplifying complicated situations , and can lead to erroneous conclusions .
While there may be some superficial similarities between Hitler and Ahmadinejad , it does not mean that our only option is to start World War III .
We are now more than four years into a war that was launched by false fears and scary hyperbole , and here we are again , being led down a path by chest - pounding rhetoric , without a clear idea of where that path is taking us .
As the philosopher George Santayana once said , " those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
Are we condemned to
repeat the colossal blunder that is the Iraq war ?
Or has the United States Senate learned the lessons of history ?
Every day it seems the confrontational rhetoric between the United States and Iran escalates .
We hear shadowy claims about Iran 's destabilizing actions in Iraq , with little direct evidence offered to back it up .
The President telegraphs his desire to designate a large segment of the Iranian army as a terrorist organization - and instead of counseling prudence , the United States Senate rushes ahead to do it for him .
I hope that we can stop this war of words before it becomes a war of bombs .
We have seen the results when the U.S. Senate gives this Administration the benefit of the doubt : a war that has now directly cost the American people six hundred billion dollars , more than 3,800 American deaths , and more than 27,000 American casualties .
A war that has stretched our military to the breaking point .
A war that the commander of our forces in Iraq just three weeks ago could not say had made America safer .
I daresay many - perhaps most - in this chamber wish we had never gone into Iraq .
Are we willing to sleep - walk into yet another disastrous military confrontation with a Middle East tyrant ?
We need to talk directly to the government of Iran , without preconditions or artificial restrictions , and indicate that regime change is not our goal .
Unfortunately , the President seems unwilling to take that step ; we have held only two talks at a relatively low level , and those have focused solely on Iraq .
Direct talks with North Korea about the issue we were most concerned with - North Korea 's nuclear program - resulted in the first progress toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula in years .
And yet with Iran we continue to refuse to discuss the issues we are most concerned about , insisting that they must first renounce their nuclear program .
That is not negotiation .
That is dictating ultimatums .
I agree that no option should be taken off the table when considering how to deal with any threat posed by Iran .
But , if the President concludes , after serious diplomacy has failed , that an attack is necessary , he must make the case to the U.S. Congress and the American people .
Under Article 1 , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution , only the Congress - the elected representatives of the people - have the power to declare war .
Not the President .
The President has stated his belief that previously enacted Congressional authorizations to use force give him all the authority he requires to start a new war .
I respectfully disagree .
It is incumbent upon us to reassert the powers granted to the people 's branch in the Constitution .
That is the best way to prevent another colossal blunder in the Middle East .
It is the people of this country who pay the price of such presidential misadventures .
We , as their Representatives in the Congress , must not fail in our number one duty : to protect their interests .
Until now , I ’m still embracing the beauty of web 2.0 design :
The glossy effect , the badges etc. .
But the presentation of “ Destroy the Web 2.0 Look ” by Elliot Jay Stock has changed my perception and makes me understand even more about what is the real Web 2.0 .
Elliot presented this topic in FoWD event in New York and for people like me who could n’t attend the event , there is a slideshow which I embeded below and PDF document for download .
He emphasize that “ Web 2.0 ” is not a design aesthetic , and to encourage people to break with overused of the current web design trends .
In the presentation there said that the characteristics of Web 2.0 that coined by Mr. Tim O’Reilly does not touch anything about design at all !
So , do n’t blindly use the style but use it with rational , and come out with own concept and design .
Do n’t follow the cliche and pursue something new !
Actually there is some great and original designers had breaking out from the trends and come out with something really interesting .
Author of snap2objects was agreed with what Mr. Elliot Jay Stocks point of view and written out an interesting article on “ How to Destroy the Web 2.0 Look “ .
He listed out several well designed sites that is opposing the current web design trends .
The website screenshot shown below are one of the examples that mentioned in the post .
I can see that most of the designs are using heavy textures , grungy feels and not over contrasts color combinations .
Basically most of the examples are not the cliche Web 2.0 feel .
Well , this does not mean that the Web 2.0 style is evil and should fully avoid it , but use it with rational like I mentioned above .

Transcript :
James Harris :
This is Truthdig .
James Harris here with Josh Scheer and Sheerly Avni .
I ’ve got three Truthdiggers in the same room .
If you have n’t read Sheerly ’s article on Oakland , you certainly should do just that .
She talks about the influence of Ecstasy , and Ecstasy being one of the contributors to the rise in crime and the rise in the murder rate in Oakland in 2006 .
Josh , you were sharing some statistics with me , and you were quite frankly surprised to see Oakland very high up on the murder list .
Higher than Los Angeles , higher than some other cities that you mentioned .
What shocked you so much about that ?
Josh Scheer :
It ’s shocking to find them .
I do n’t know about Sheerly , whether it was hard to find them .
But the ones I did find were from 2003 .
I was shocked that New York only has a 7.4 murder rate , whereas Detroit has a 39.4 murder rate .
I could assume that some place like Camden , N.J. , or Detroit , where they already have the bad media image ; but certainly with Oakland or Atlanta , Ga. , which has a high murder rate , I was shocked with St. Louis — I was shocked with St. Louis being one of the most dangerous cities in 2006 .
Harris :
As we try to understand this , the sheer fact is that 15,000 people are murdered in America every year , if you combine all those cities .
And the approach you took , Sheerly , in your article about Ecstasy being one of the contributing factors , perhaps , to this murder rate increase , please tell us a little about what you found as you wrote this story ?
Sheerly Avni :
Well , I think for me , I would say that Ecstasy is more of a symptom and that the chief diseases are ones that we know really well .
…
It has to do with the fact that we have a public school system that was so completely corrupt and dysfunctional that it had to be taken over by the state .
You have broken families , you have Oakland being one of the first communities that was really devastated by the crack epidemic , which means you have multigenerational dysfunction in the families .
The list goes on and on and on and on .
The specific thing about Ecstasy that was important to me was that the only reason I even knew that Ecstasy was having a big impact on the lives of the kids was because I happen to work for this publication that goes into juvenile hall every week .
And that ’s been going on for the past 10 years .
So I ’ve been hearing about kids “ thizzing , ” which is what they call it , and taking Ecstasy in a way that ’s completely different from the way in which most of the people in mainstream media , who write about drugs and Ecstasy , remember that particular drug .
So , it was more that , like I said in the piece , we ’re all sitting around trying to understand what ’s happening .
The blind people touching different parts of an elephant , trying to understand what ’s going on , and nobody ’s paying attention to the kids , who have been screaming literally for at least five years , “ I ’m being killed by an elephant . ”
When the kids describe what “ thizzing ” has done to them , they describe it in the same lethal terms that you hear some of the white and Latino kids talking about what crystal meth has done to them .
Which is , it has straight - up destroyed their lives .
So that ’s why I wanted to bring it to the fore .
Harris : I do n’t understand how you go from popping a pill , or rolling , to shooting somebody .
So what was the correlation that they were drawing ?
Avni :
Well , a couple of kids have written that you take the pills in order to get the heart , or you take the pills to get the courage to go up and do something crazy .
You take the pills because it ’s a way of letting off steam , and you take the pills because at some times , “ Oh , man , take this , it will make you feel really good . ”
And we all know Ecstasy makes people feel absolutely great .
But the quality of , and the proportions of MDMA to speed that you can get in your drugs , has gone down over the course of the past decade , and now , let ’s say in the club scene , in the white mainstream middle - class club scene , cocaine is so cheap that cocaine has pretty much replaced Ecstasy as the drug of choice , in part because it ’s so hard to get pure MDMA .
What the kids are getting , mostly through the Asian street gangs , is Ecstasy that , if it ’s even got any MDMA in it , is cut with so much speed that they ’re mixing — .
So let ’s say you ’re taking speed to go up , you ’re drinking cough syrup to go down , you are smoking weed to go down .
What you end up with is a brain that ’s just completely not functional .
And as one of the kids in a poem for the piece wrote , “ If you feel like killing , then you ’re going to feel more like killing .
If you ’re feeling bad , it ’s going to make you feel worse . ”
And these are children who for the most part , suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder … because usually they know someone has died in the past month — that ’s how the statistics play out .
So , yeah , they ’re feeling bad , they ’re feeling mean , they ’re full of anger .
Guns are really easy to get .
And one of the things you read about more and more is that killings in Oakland used to be based on specific grievances and specific drug wars and specific revenge and turfs and this and that and the other .
Now , many more of the killings are just random and violent .
Someone was in the wrong place at the wrong time after someone got disrespected at a party .
That , to me , is more of a culture of just like reckless abandon , going wild , going dumb , than anything we ’ve seen in Oakland thus far .
Harris :
And you do n’t blame the drug .
You say it ’s not the drug — it ’s some of the traditional causes like public school systems failing , parents not at home ?
Avni :
As cities get wealthier and wealthier , the difference between rich and poor gets more striking and more frustrating .
What we just said about Oakland being a really dangerous city , well , it ’s even more dangerous if you ’re in East or West Oakland , because I was looking on the map , in the past three years , there ’s been one homicide in my part of town and none in Piedmont .
So that means that … when you have a really , really rich city , and a lots of really , really poor people in it , there ’s a couple of things that happens .
One is that the rich people tend to send their kids to private schools — they stop caring about what happens in the public schools , although that is shifting in Oakland right now .
Harris :
In what way would you say is that shifting ?
Avni : More and more of the middle - class people who come to move into Oakland have decided they want to send their kids to public schools and they ’ve put a lot of money and time into local schools in their neighborhood .
And there ’s a slight shift , more diversity in the schools — schools that were before all — one was 85 percent black ; now it ’s 35 percent black .
Scheer :
In the wealthier neighborhoods like Piedmont , the police force there is probably more available , and the residents expect the police to be there .
Whereas in West Oakland , you might not see a police officer for months .
And maybe that ’s also part of the cause , it ’s not just the education . …
Avni :
And if you do see the police , they may be members of the Oakland Riders .
Most of these kids , the first memory they have is of the police busting through their door and beating up on a family member .
So these — the young people I work with will never turn to the police for safety , even if they are not engaged in criminal behavior themselves .
Scheer : James , you live in Oakland .
What do you think about — when it ’s one of the most dangerous cities ?
Harris :
Well , Josh , if we look at some of the things that Sheerly was talking about earlier — the corruption in public schools , the lack of solid home base — that is the problem .
And I say , as a community , Oakland , frankly , could care less about whether or not black kids , Latino kids are living or dying .
Because if they cared , it would n’t happen .
Scheer :
And what about the new mayor ?
Do you think he cares ?
Harris :
I think the new mayor cares , but I think we have a new challenge , and that challenge is how do we get people to care ?
So I want to know from you guys , why is it that we wo n’t try to solve this problem ?
Why is it that our local governments wo n’t do that ?
Scheer :
Well , I think that one is that the same elected officials for the past 10 years have been in power .
There ’s no change , there ’s no changeover .
So there ’s no new ideas , and it ’s the same people , so if you keep on voting the same people in , maybe there needs to be a major change in the police force and the mayor .
Maybe you should n’t have elected a 70 - year - old mayor .
Maybe you should elect someone who is young , who has vision — someone like your sister , coming from a new school of thought , the state senators and that problem .
And , obviously , someone has to care about fixing the education system and putting money in that education system , and that comes from the state and the local government .
And there needs to be — there are people who care .
You need to pull them out and get them caring .
Right ?
Harris :
Sheerly , is it just that we ’re optimists , or perhaps I ’m just the angry guy who wants a solution ?
But your work in juvenile hall , your work as an educator , what are you hearing from these kids ?
Avni :
They … have tons of advice , and it ’s good advice .
Last week we asked them about education , because we were thinking about the recent Supreme Court decision , and all the kids writing about what their experiences with the education is like in juvenile hall talked about how bad the schools are , the teaching is in the hall , because you ’ve gotta go lowest common denominator .
There ’s one kid with a learning disability ; you ’re doing fourth - grade math .
And a lot of these kids are really smart .
They say , “ We want better schools .
We want better education . ”
They also , another one , said … in Oakland there is a new juvenile facility that is modeled , it has just been built , it was very expensive .
All of you environmentally conscious will be happy to note that it ’s a “ green ” building .
So our kids are being disposed of in an environmentally sound way .
But it is based architecturally and also philosophically on the model of Santa Rita Jail .
So what you ’re doing is you ’re taking a bunch of kids who used to be in a rehabilitative facility and putting them in a facility that is architecturally designed for group management .
It means that you now have 14- , 15 - year - old kids talking to their parents through glass when they come to visit them .
It means that it ’s much harder for boys to get a chance to see their children when their children are born , which means you ’re literally ruining their possibility of bonding with their kids .
And I know I ’m going off topic and ranting here , but I guess the solutions are there in the things the kids say : “ Treat us like human beings . ”
Another kid said , “ How come we do n’t have any programs ?
There ’s more programs in jail than in juvenile hall . ”
Another one wrote , “ You can tell by what the new building looks like what they really think of us . ”
Another one wrote , “ I do n’t have any models , ever , of anyone that ever went to college . ”
Another one said , “ I ca n’t afford to work at McDonald’s .
I have to feed two brothers . ”
I had a girl — this was in Las Vegas , so clearly it ’s not just local — explain to me that there was no way she could stop working as a prostitute because she has two sisters to support .
So what am I supposed to tell her ?
Get a minimum - wage job , and if you ca n’t afford to take care of your sisters , that we ’re going to have to go through CPS [ Child Protection Services ] ?
You do n’t want to break up families … and not give a solution .
Harris :
So if you had a solution , you ’d probably be the president .
Avni :
Well , no , I would n’t .
That ’s the problem .
That ’s the thing , we all have the solution , teach them , pay attention to them , stop treating them as criminals , you know .
Scheer : Get mentors .
Avni : Get mentors .
When you do get mentors , make it easier for them to access the facilities .
Apportion more money to schools , provide college scholarships .
It ’s not rocket science .
Harris :
It ’s not at all rocket science .
We ’ll continue to talk about some ways that we can get at a solution , or some ways that we can begin to rethink this problem , but it saddens me most because we know the answers .
And we just wo n’t make the necessary effort to make the change .
Scheer :
What hope is there ?
It ’s the same elected people .
They do n’t care , right ?
You talked about that in your piece .
I mean , people do n’t care .
There needs to be something that shakes them up , whether it be Beverly Hills being flooded with trash , or whatever , there needs to be something that shakes up the system enough so that people can get what they need .
Harris :
Sheerly , is there no hope ?
Avni :
Of course there ’s hope .
If it were easy , everyone would be doing it ; so it ’s hard .
But there ’s about 15 different organizations that I could name just off the top of my head that are available in Oakland for helping kids get employment , mentorship , even transportation to school .
All sorts of different things that could help them get what they want and get what they need .
So , absolutely , on an individual level , there ’s not a single person out there that ca n’t make it if they want to .
On an institutional level , to Truthdig listeners right out there , we ’re very active on the war .
I know that the people who read Truthdig care a lot about what ’s happening in Iraq , what ’s happening with our presidency .
If you also spent one hour a week in your local school , or tutoring some level in juvenile facilities , there is a war going on where we are right now .
And you can fight that one , too .
Harris : I think that ’s well said .
But , just tell me when you have the time to volunteer at juvenile hall ?
I ’m suggesting that the society we ’re living in has become so harsh on the average American that the average American does n’t have any time to really help out the public sector or to give back to the public .
Avni :
You can make time .
Harris :
They can make time ?
Scheer :
That ’s what I ’m saying though , you have to shake up people to let them know that there ’s a problem .
So many people do n’t know there ’s anything going on , and , you know , when you have someone who is elected and lives in the hills and does n’t know what ’s going on in West Oakland , that ’s a possibility , right ?
Someone has to educate [ Mayor ] Ron Dellums and others , other people across the country .
Avni :
Well , there ’s also a racism issue here .
It ’s not that people do n’t care , it ’s that most people who are doing well are in the white middle class , or the Asian middle class , and have really , really strong opinions about what ’s wrong with these people , that they ca n’t get their lives together .
So let ’s not pretend people are just busy .
Harris :
Sheerly , thanks for joining us , and thanks for your candor .

The name of the piece we discussed today is “ It ’s the Ecstasy , Stupid . ”
Until the next time , I bid you farewell for Josh Scheer , for Sheerly Avni .
This is James Harris and this is Truthdig .
Gamers will never get to play Manhunt 2 .
Yes , sometime this year you might be putting a disc labeled Manhunt 2 into your Wii or PlayStation 2 , and stepping into the shoes of Daniel Lamb , a mental patient who has to escape an insane asylum by killing the guards in the most gruesome manner possible .
But it wo n't be the game the creators originally intended .
The developer , Rockstar Games , had the code polished and ready for a July ship date , but was forced to slam on the brakes when the Entertainment Software Ratings Board , or ESRB , gave Manhunt 2 a rating of Adults Only , or AO , the game industry 's equivalent of an NC - 17 movie rating .
Neither Sony nor Nintendo allow AO - rated titles to be released on their hardware , and most major retailers refuse to stock the games .
As a result , creators whose games get an adult rating usually trim back the content or decline to release the product .
Manhunt 's ratings woes , which Rockstar announced to the public , is the first visible sign of a shift in the way video games are rated that 's unfolding largely behind the scenes .
In the wake of increased attacks on the industry by politicians , the industry - run ESRB and overseas groups have been awarding de facto NC - 17 ratings to content that would warrant an R or a PG - 13 if it were found in a movie instead of a game .
The ESRB reports about a dozen cases in the past five years in which it issued the AO for violence ; nobody has heard of them , because each game was held back and quietly watered down to win a lower rating .
In countries like Britain , the problem is even clearer .
There , the board that rates video games and films is under the auspices of Parliament , and Manhunt 2 has been de jure banned : Selling it to anyone is illegal .
Game designers are feeling the chill .
Developers at Sega , working on the upcoming Condemned : Bloodshot , say the Manhunt controversy caused them to remove some content from their game .
And Al Lowe , creator of the Leisure Suit Larry franchise , says that one of his naughtier classic games was left out of a recent collector 's edition package because of concerns that the ESRB would give it an AO rating .
It was rated M in 1996 .
At a conference in Germany this week , Factor 5 developer Julian Eggebrecht – the director of Lair for PlayStation 3 – gave voice to a concern simmering in the creative trenches of the industry .
The review process is a " charade , " he said , according to Eurogamer .
" If you cannot have satire about these things , ( it ) is approaching the realm of McCarthyism . "
While acknowledging an uptick in AO ratings , the ESRB insists its standards have n't changed , and argues that game developers are inviting the rebukes .
" As the capabilities of the systems become more complex and the types of content in games becomes much more varied , you 're going to find the creators of these games pushing the envelope in a variety of different ways , " says Patricia Vance , the ESRB 's president .
Vance also emphasizes that the ESRB never requires gamemakers to change their products .
Whether a game makes it onto shelves is " out of our control , " says Vance .
" These are business decisions that are being made by retailers and console manufacturers ....
We assign ratings and then the market determines what 's acceptable . "
Of course , the market can't vote on games that are not allowed to be released .
Sony spokesman David Karraker says the company simply does n't want the PlayStation brand associated with adults - only content , and is comfortable banning anything with an AO rating from its platform without further review .
" We want to offer age - appropriate entertainment for our consumers but do not want to be associated with material that is gratuitously violent or pornographic . "
Even if Sony did decide to allow Rockstar to put the uncut version of Manhunt 2 on PlayStation , there 'd be practically nowhere to sell it .
Wal - Mart , to name one giant example , does not sell AO - rated games – though it sells the " unrated " version of the movie Saw III .
It 's because the medium of the video game is so new that it gets evaluated more harshly , says Gerard Jones , author of the book Killing Monsters : Why Children Need Fantasy , Super Heroes , and Make - Believe Violence .
" Most new media tend to have a fair amount of violence and sensationalism in them .
But the very shock value that makes this stuff catch your attention also shocks other people , who see a social or psychological danger in it . "
Where this often leads , he says , is to proposals of legislation that are mostly symbolic .
" This is an old tradition in politics , this belief that the culture has gone out of control , and that the profiteers need to be reined in , " says Jones .
" The legislature will then try to nail down some cultural standards through law . "
It was talk of such regulation that prompted the formation of the ESRB in 1994 , in the days when even the most violent video games were still rendered with cartoonish and crude graphics .
It was assumed that the difference between the Mature and Adults Only rating was that the latter was for interactive porn .
" At the time , the focus was to protect the rather young industry from becoming a depository for pornography , " says Sony 's Karraker .
The video game sex controversy exploded again after Rockstar 's 2004 release of the blockbuster hit Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
Hackers found a scene that the designers had removed from the final game , but not deleted from the source code , and published instructions on how gamers could reactivate it .
In the scene , a female character invites the game 's hero into her house for some " hot coffee . "
What ensues is a poorly pantomimed cartoon sex scene in which the two characters bump polygonal uglies with all of their clothes still on .
Even though it was far less graphic than any given scene from American Pie , the ESRB changed the game 's rating to AO , which caused it to be recalled from shelves .
Sens .
Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman responded by introducing a bill in 2005 that would make it a federal crime to sell even Mature - rated games to minors .
States got into the act as well , and according to GamePolitics.com , 20 different states have recently attempted some form of video game legislation – many of which have already been ruled unconstitutional .
Financial analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities estimates that Rockstar will have to sink another $ 1 million in development time to clean up Manhunt 2 .
But he blames the company , which he says should have known better than to tempt the ESRB in the first place .
" The company should have recognized that it was under a microscope " after San Andreas , he says , " and should have edited the content accordingly . "
Representatives from Take - Two Interactive Software , Rockstar 's parent company , declined to speak with Wired News for this story .
But it was the company itself that went public with the AO rating , before announcing that it would retool the game to win an M rating .
Pachter said he thinks Rockstar should have stayed quiet .
" I recognize that Rockstar set out to create a horror genre classic , and the publicity could in some way help by driving awareness , " says Pachter .
" However , the game we end up seeing will have the stigma of being the edited version , and someone buying it will not be able to see the original uncut version . "

Check out the page one photo on the Thursday , Oct. 25 front page of the New York Times .
It shows two rows of completely destroyed homes in San Diego , and two virtually untouched homes right in the midst of them .
The caption makes no mention of it , and indeed in news story after news story , reporters talk about the seemingly whimsical way the fire destroys some houses while bypassing others , but what the two homes in that photo that are seemingly unscathed have in common is red tile roofs .
This is not fickle fate at work ; it is common sense .
When I worked as a reporter in Los Angeles back in the 1970s , it was common knowledge -- and was verified every time there was a wildfire -- that if your house had a tile roof , and stucco walls , it pretty much was immune to fires .
Yet developers and home buyers , to keep their costs down , continue to put shake ( wood ) or asphalt shingles on houses in places like Southern California , where grass and forest fires are predictable annual events .
It 's the western equivalent of homeowners and developers in the eastern US who persist in building homes on flood plains or along the coast at sea level .
You have to feel sorry for a family that loses their home , but really , how stupid can people be ?
How stupid can insurance companies be , when it comes to that ?
I 'm reading that there are complaints about lack of adequate fire - fighting equipment and personnel in San Diego , where there is no county fire department , but I have yet to see one article looking at how many of those houses that were lost had flammable roof materials .
In suburban Southern California , you do n't have deep forests , where burning trees will fall down on houses and spread fires .
Basically , fires spread there in two ways : grass fires bring flames up to a house , which if it is constructed of flammable wood , will then succumb to the flames , or else , burning cinders , sent aloft by a firestorm , will drop on rooftops and ignite the roofing material , burning down the house .
A house that has stucco on its walls and red tile shingles on its roof is not very vulnerable to either of those things .
Unless a car is left in the driveway and blows up , igniting the garage , or a tree falls on the house , it will sit there and the fire will sweep right by it .
So you have to wonder , why do n't all Californians all use tile roofing ?
Granted it 's more expensive , but over the life of a house , the difference in materials cost is n't that much .
Besides , tile lasts virtually forever , so you do n't have to replace it after 15 years the way you have to do with shingles .
The other thing , of course , is that we 're seeing a much more concerned Bush administration when the victims of a disaster live in a heavily Republican ( and white ) area like San Diego , than we saw when the disaster was in a heavily Democratic ( and black ) area like New Orleans .
This is true even though the black and poor victims of Katrina were living as best they could in a largely segregated city that kept most of them living below sea level , while many of the victims of the Southern California fires are wealthy people who made some bad choices in the design and construction of their homes .
I think it 's a scandal that fire fighters have to risk life and limb rescuing people and property when much of the risk to those people and homes has been self - inflicted .

The technology exists to save energy , the IEA says
That is the conclusion of a study from the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , which it says is the first global survey of lighting uses and costs .
The carbon dioxide emissions saved by such a switch would , it concludes , dwarf cuts so far achieved by adopting wind and solar power .
Better building regulations would boost uptake of efficient lighting , it says .
" Lighting is a major source of electricity consumption , " said Paul Waide , a senior policy analyst with the IEA and one of the report 's authors .
" Nineteen percent of global electricity generation is taken for lighting - that 's more than is produced by hydro or nuclear stations , and about the same that 's produced from natural gas , " he told the BBC News website .
The carbon dioxide produced by generating all of this electricity amounts to 70 % of global emissions from passenger vehicles , and is three times more than emissions from aviation , the IEA says .
Lounge departure
Not many inventions last for more than 100 years without major modifications .
The incandescent light bulb , developed a century and a quarter ago by luminaries including Sir Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison , is one , and still produces almost half of the light used in homes around the world .
The biggest consumer is the fluorescent tube .
Commercial and public sector buildings account for 43 % of the electricity used for lighting ; and here , fluorescents dominate .
The report notes that the efficiency of tubes can vary widely , between about 15 % and 60 % .
Regulations on their use vary widely , too .
Health and safety concerns dictate what light levels should be achieved in various buildings , but the IEA found the levels prescribed by regulatory authorities vary by a factor of 20 from one country to another .
The IEA reserves particular ire for that favourite of the western middle - class lounge , the halogen uplighter .
" This ... is the least efficient of all commonly used electric lighting systems , " it says .
" They add a large amount of heat into the living space as a by - product ... this heat might require additional air - conditioning energy for its removal . "
It is concerned too that a significant proportion of the world 's population has no access to electric lighting at all .
Instead , they rely on burning fuel , which is expensive , inefficient , produces poor light quality and contributes to respiratory disease .
Bright idea
Energy - efficient lighting can seem such an obviously good idea that it is hard to comprehend why it is not used everywhere .
EIGHT FOR THE SCRAPHEAP Incandescent bulbs Low - efficiency fluorescent tubes High- loss " ballasts " for fluorescent tubes Halogen uplighters High - loss halogen transformers Mercury discharge lamps ( often used in street lighting )
Low - efficiency vehicle lighting Fuel - based lighting in developing countries
" There is a strong case for introducing lighting measures into building codes .
Currently codes have a lot of energy measures in them , but with few exceptions there are n't specific provisions for lighting . "
Such codes could , for example , mandate the use of highly efficient fluorescent tubes and ballasts , the devices which regulate input voltages for the lamps ; at worst these can consume 40 % of the energy going into the system .
China , the IEA reports , has recently developed such codes .
If they are implemented in all new build , this would " ... offset the need for a new Three Gorges Dam project every eight years " .
For the individual , the most obvious switch to make is from incandescent bulbs to compact fluorescent systems ( CFLs ) , marketed in many countries as " energy - saving bulbs " .
The IEA calculated the total costs to the consumer associated with buying and then using the two types , and found a significant difference .
" The overall cost of 10,000 hours of light provision from incandescents is 85 euros , " said Paul Waide , " but for CFLs it 's 25 euros , because they use so much less energy , and because you might have to buy only one CFL for every 10 incandescents . "
He acknowledged there were concerns about the quality of light coming from some CFLs , and that some consumers reported lower lifetimes than manufacturers claimed ; the key here , he said , was better regulation of the product sector by governments .
" There is also a lot that governments could do to reduce the price differential between CFLs and incandescents ; it 's extremely efficient from a societal perspective . "
The future may see even more efficient systems .
LEDs hold out the most promise ; currently four times as efficient as incandescents , manufacturers are aiming for 80 % efficiency by the end of the decade , which would represent a 16 - fold improvement on the traditional bulb .
But , the IEA concludes , there is no need to wait for LEDs .
Policy measures and individual action to bring the switch would slash 38 % from the global electricity bill for lighting by 2030 .

As we discussed the other day , Facebook 's CEO , Mark Zuckerberg , was going after 02138 mag.com for publishing documents from his time at Harvard .
The social network founder was requesting the documents be pulled due to them violating his privacy .
According to the judge , the documents were part of the " core journalism " , and that they were made available by the magazine as a way for readers to further evaluate the story .
The documents were originally part of the court case between ConnectU and Zuckerburg .
This was the case where the smaller social network alleged that Zuckerburg had stolen ideas from them to begin Facebook .
During that case , Facebook 's CEO had requested that the documents be sealed , but somehow they still made their way to 02138 .
This was the basis of his case against the magazine , but he still lost .
In the wake of all the questions over privacy due to Facebook 's " Beacon " service , this is just endlessly amusing in how ironic it is .

Outside the UCEN ( student center plus bookstore plus food court ) at UC Santa Barbara , there were a number of people with cardboard clipboards soliciting people to sign ballot petitions for a proposal to spend $ 1 billion on cancer hospitals for kids .
If you agree to sign , they tell you " you need to sign 4 times . "
What they do not tell you is that the three pages after the ballot initiative on cancer hospitals are different ballot initiatives : the second proposes to abolish eminent domain , the third proposals to abolish rent control , and the fourth is the proposal to apportion California 's electoral votes by district ( the so - called Dirty Tricks Initiative ) .
I should note that the clipboard is arranged such that a rubber band holding the petitions to the cardboard is positioned on the top of the page , across the actual ballot language in question - thus , partially hiding the text of the ballot initiatives on pages 2 - 4 unless you actually stop and pull down the top of the page .
I agreed to sign the cancer initiative , but the comment about signing four times raised a red flag , because I 'm familiar with the structure of ballot petitions , so I paused before signing and looked at the other initiatives .
However , I 'm absolutely sure that most of the people signing , young college students on a rush to get their lunches and off to class , did not take this step .
What they are doing is getting people to sign for ballot initiatives without their knowledge or informed consent , using young peoples ' desire to do a good thing and their lack of familiarity with the legal paperwork of initiative petitions .
If this is not illegal it is certainly deeply unethical .
The moment I realized what was going on , I told the petitioners that they should n't be telling people to sign for ballot initiatives they 're not aware of .
Immediately after , I called the school newspaper , the Daily Nexus , the Courage Campaign , the Santa Barbara Democratic Central Committee , and the California Democratic Party .
I 'm posting this to further get the word out .
Why must we war ?
I wear high heels , skirts , make up and do all the girly stuff , but I do it for ME .
No one makes me , and I dont care what anyone else does .
Personally I dont care if a guy looks like BigFoot with 5 oclock shadow if he is intelligent and has a good sense of humor .

A Swiss woman who fell off her bicycle has yielded a unique insight into how auditory hallucinations are generated .
The woman suffered damage to the part of the brain where speech is generated and could speak only in short , stunted words and sentences .
Five months later , when she suddenly developed epilepsy , she began “ hearing ” voices with the same speech impediments as herself .
“ She initially heard her own voice speaking aloud , then the voices of hospital staff , ” says Daniela Hubl at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in Bern , Switzerland , a member of the team that treated her .
“ They had the same speech impediments as she did .

“ I.B.M. is jumping in with products that are backed by I.B.M. , with the I.B.M. brand and I.B.M. service , ” said Melissa Webster , an analyst for IDC , a research firm .
“ This is a major boost for open source on the desktop . ”
Image Steven A. Mills , senior vice president of I.B.M.s software group , said the programs promote an open - source document format .
Credit ... I.B.M.
I.B.M. executives compare this move with the push it gave Linux , the open - source operating system , into corporate data centers .
In 2000 , I.B.M. declared that it would forcefully back Linux with its engineers , its marketing and its dollars .
The support from I.B.M. helped make Linux a mainstream technology in corporations , where it competes with Microsoft ’s Windows server software .
I.B.M. is also joining forces with Google , which offers the open - source desktop productivity programs as part of its Google Pack of software .
Google supports the same document formats in its online word processor and spreadsheet service .
I.B.M. views its Symphony desktop offerings as part of a broader technology trend that will open the door to faster , more automated movement of information within and between organizations .
A crucial technical ingredient , they say , is the document format used in the open - source desktop software , called the OpenDocument Format .
It makes digital information independent of the program , like a word processor or spreadsheet , that is used to create and edit a document .
OpenDocument Format is based on an Internet - era protocol called XML , short for Extensible Markup Language , which enables automated machine - to - machine communication .
For example , an individual investor might create a spreadsheet with automated links to market information , and prices at which he or she wants to buy or sell shares in particular stocks .
The person would get an alert by e-mail or cellphone message of price swings , and could create the document for a buy or sell order with a keystroke .
Or , in a doctor ’s office , patient records could be linked to hospital , clinic and other databases and updated automatically .

最新安定 版Apache 2.2は、何が変わったのか？ 2.0からバージョンアップするメリットとは？ 最新のApacheを新機能の使い方とともに解説する。（編集部）
鶴長 鎮一（book@tsurunaga.jp ）
2006/3/14
開発バージョンであっ たApache 2.1が、2005年12月にApache 2.2としてリリースされました。パフォーマンス向上や機能拡張／改善が施されており、The Apache HTTP Server Projectは2.0から2.2へのバージョンアップを勧めています。ただし、2.0で使用していたモジュールや設定の中にはそのまま2.2で使用できないものもあり、2.2への移行に際して作業が必要になる場合もあることに注意しましょう。
Apache 2.2の主な変更点
Apache 2.2は2.0に対して何が変わっているのか。まずは全体像を概観してみましょう。The Apache HTTP Server Project の「 Overview of new features in Apache 2.2 」 （http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/new_features_2_2.html）で紹介されているApache 2.2の主な変更点は、以下のとおりです。
■認証モジュールの見直し
認証や承認のためのモジュールが見直され、機能ごとにモジュールを分割するなどの修正が行われました。例えばBASIC認証を提供するmod_auth_basicモジュールは単に認証や承認の手段のみを提供し、そのバックエンドとして「.htpasswd」ファイルを用いる場合は別途mod_authn_fileモジュールを利用することになりました。下位互換性が損なわれているため、mod_auth_pgsqlやmod_auth_mysqlなど、Apache 2.0で使用していた認証・承認モジュールが動作しない場合があります。
モジュール名は、次のような命名規則が用いられています。
mod_auth_XX ： 認証の方法を提供するモジュール mod_authn_XX ： 認証バックエンドをサポートするモジュール mod_authz_XX ： 承認（アクセス制御）を提供するモジュール mod_authnz_XX ： 認証と承認（アクセス制御）の両方をサポートするモジュール
■ドキュメントキャッシュ機能の見直し
メモリキャッシュやディスクキャッシュなど、HTTPコンテンツの動的キャッシュ機能が強化されました。開発バージョン時よりも安定性が向上し、Apache 2.2では実用的なレベルになっています。キャッシュ機能を用いることで、一般的にHTTPサービスの応答性を向上させることができます。
また 、Apacheをリバースプロキシサーバとして利用する場合もキャッシュ機能を利用可能です。
■プロキシ機能によるロードバランシングの実現
プロキシでロードバランス機能を実現するmod_proxy_balancerモジュールが追加されました。HTTPやFTPサービスはもちろん、Apache Tomcatなどのサーブレットコンテナとの通信で使われるAJP13プロトコルのロードバランス機能も提供します。
バランシングの制御は、 「 リクエスト回数 」 と「 トラフィック量」の2つのアルゴリズムが用意されています。また、Webベースのロードバランスマネージャが提供されており、Webブラウザで管理できます。バックエンドサーバが複数ある環境でも、JavaアプリケーションやPHPのセッション変数を永続的に利用できます。セッション変数を利用している場合、2回目以降のリクエストも最初に接続したバックエンドを使うスティッキーセッション方式が採用されているため、整合性を損なうことなくアプリケーションサーバの処理が行われます。
■ AJP1.3をサポートするモジュールの追加
Apache Tomcatのサーブレットコンテナとの通信で使われるAJP1.3プロトコル（Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3）を直接扱えるmod_proxy_ajpモジュールが追加されました。従来のmod_jkは設定ファイルを別途用意する必要がありましたが、mod_proxy_ajpではhttpd.conf中で設定を行うことができます。
■32bitシステムで2Gbytes超のファイルを実現
カーネル2.4以降は、32bitプラットフォーム上でも2Gbytesを超すファイルの取り扱いが可能になっていますが、Apacheが扱えるメッセージボディの最大値には、依然として2Gbytesの制約がありました。
Apache 2.2ではその制約がなくなりました。ただし、クライアント側でも同様の対応が必要になります。
なお 、Apache 2.0でも、2.0.53から2Gbytes超のファイルの取り扱いが可能になっています。
■mod_filterを使ったフィルタ機能の強化
Apache 2.0でもリクエストやレスポンスヘッダ、環境変数などの情報を基に動的に出力フィルタを適用できましたが、Apache 2.2では複数のフィルタを柔軟に組み合わせることができるmod_filterモジュールが追加されました。複雑な機能を実装したフィルタを1つ用意する代わりに、単機能のフィルタを複数組み合わせるといった運用が可能になっています。
■ RDBMSとの連携を可能にするmod_dbdモジュールの追加
PostgreSQLなどのデータベースをサポートするmod_dbdモジュールやapr_dbdフレームワークが用意されました。データベースとの効率的な接続を可能にするコネクションプーリングをmod_dbdモジュールで管理可能になります。
なお 、Apache 2.2ではRDBMSを認証・承認のバックエンドに指定できるmod_authn_dbdモジュールが提供されていますが、対応するRDBMSが限られているため注意が必要です。
■終了処理 「 graceful stop」の採用
処理中のリクエストの完結を待って再起動する「 graceful restart 」 はApache 2.0でも利用可能でしたが、2.2では「graceful stop」が新たに利用可能になりました。サービスを停止する際に、リクエスト処理中のクライアントの終了を待つため、ダウンロード途中で接続が解除されるような事態を防ぐことができます。
# /usr/local/apache2/bin/ apachectl -k graceful 再起動
# /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k graceful - stop 終了
■ Perl互換正規表現ライブラリ5.0の同梱
PCRE （Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library ） version 5.0が採用されたことで、「.htaccess」や「httpd.conf」のようなコンフィグレーションファイルで、より複雑な文字列パターンを、Perl 5.0互換の正規表現を用いて記述可能になりました。
■event MPM の追加
ApacheのコアであるMPM（Multi Processing Module）に、新たにevent MPMが追加されました。worker MPMのようなマルチスレッド処理に加え、event MPMではKeep Aliveリクエストの処理に、コネクションを処理するスレッドとは別のスレッドを使用します。よりスケーラビリティに優れた運用が可能になります。
■ ThreadStackSizeディレクティブの追加
MPM において、コネクション処理を受け持つスレッドのスタックサイズをThreadStackSizeディレクティブを用いて調整可能になりました。大抵の場合、OSが指定しているスタックサイズのデフォルト値で問題ありませんが、意図的に小さなサイズを設定し、スレッドをより多く立ち上げるような使い方をします。
■ロード済みモジュール一覧表示 がDSOモジュールに対応
これま で 「 httpd -l」で表示されるインストール済みモジュールの一覧は静的に組み込まれたもののみでしたが、新たに採用された「-M」オプションを使用することで、DSOを使って動的に組み込んだモジュールも表示できます。
# httpd -M
Loaded Modules :
core_module ( static ) ←静的に組み込まれている場合はstaticと表示
authn_file_module ( static )
authn_default_module ( static )
（省略）
deflate_module ( shared ) ← DSO で組み込まれている場合はsharedと表示
Syntax OK
■httxt2dbmコマンド
httxt2dbmコマンドで、テキストファイルからDBMファイルを生成します。DBMは古くからUNIXに実装されている簡単で高速なデータベースです。小規模なデータベースとして広く利用されており、ApacheではURLを書き換えるmod_rewriteモジュールのDBM
RewriteMapにも利用されています。
■mod_imagemapへの名称変更
イメージマップをサポートするmod_imapモジュールは混乱を回避するため、mod_imagemapへ名称変更しました。
■mod_sslモジュールのRFC 2817 対応
サービスポート80番に平文で接続してからTLS暗号化通信に移行するRFC
2817スタイルをサポートしています。ただし、これに対応したWebブラウザが皆無であるため、実際に使われるようになるのはまだ先の見通しです。
RFC 2817スタイルが広く使われるようになると、HTTPはサービスポート80番、HTTPSはサービスポート443番という区別が不要になり、名前ベースで設定されたバーチャルホストのHTTPSも可能になります。

Amazon.com may not offer free delivery on books in France , the high court in Versailles has ruled .
The action , brought in January 2004 by the French Booksellers ' Union ( Syndicat de la librairie française ) , accused Amazon of offering illegal discounts on books and even of selling some books below cost .
The court gave Amazon 10 days to start charging for the delivery of books , which should at least allow the company to maintain the offer through the end - of - year gift - giving season .
After that , it must pay a fine of € 1,000 ( US $ 1,470 ) per day that it continues to offer free delivery .
It must also pay € 100,000 in compensation to the booksellers ' union .
Retail prices , particularly of books , are tightly regulated in France .
Using " loss - leaders , " or selling products below cost to attract customers , is illegal .
Other restrictions apply to books retailers must not offer discounts of more than 5 percent on the publisher 's recommended price .
Many independent booksellers choose to offer this discount in the form of a loyalty bonus based on previous purchases .
Larger booksellers simply slash the sticker price of books .
But the free delivery offered by Amazon exceeded the legal limit in the case of cheaper books , the union charged .
The union said it was pleased with the court 's ruling , which would help protect vulnerable small bookshops from predatory pricing practices .
Amazon.com did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Earlier this year , the union won a similar legal victory against Alapage.com , an online bookseller with operations in France , Spain and the U.K .
The appeals court ruled that Alapage must pay a fine of € 50,000 for illegal pricing practices including the offer of free delivery .
It 's not been a good month for U.S. e-commerce sites doing business in France : last week , the French auction regulator sued eBay France for breaching rules on the conduct of auctions .
The regulator said that eBay 's failure to comply exposed consumers to the risk of fraud .
In its defense , eBay France maintained that it is not an auctioneer and that it has " invented another way of buying and selling " not covered by the rules .

Looking for a portable charger ?
The world of renewable energy has lately been flooded with gadgets of all kinds featuring solar panels and hand cranks offering you endless opportunities to stick it to the man and get your juice for free .
Up until now , wind energy has been left out in the breeze .
No longer .
Orange , the U.K. - based telecommunications firm , has announced plans to launch The Orange Mobile Wind Charger , a mini turbine that “ latches on to the top of a tent and stores power in a separate “ control box ” that users can plug into when their mobiles need juice . ”
The charger , which is small enough to be stuffed into a backpack , was developed at The University of Texas at Arlington and built by green energy enthusiasts over at GotWind.org .
A 12 - hour charge to a battery ( in about 12 mph winds ) can juice up a cell phone in 1 - 2 hours .
According to Got Wind , “ The turbine mounting system consists of four mounting ‘ legs ’ , which moves around a centre bolt allowing the frame to fit most modern dome tents .
The frame is secured to the tent with four adjustable guy ropes . ”
Obviously for immediate energy needs , this device would not be the most suitable choice .
However , for camping enthusiasts planning on spending a long time out in the wild without required energy — and consistent access to sunny days —
I could see a combination of this product and a solar charger fitting the bill .
For gadget geeks , having a wind turbine on top of your tent could also impress your friends — or attract angry bears .

Now we can add a new word : abandoned .

The business community that celebrated the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 by spending millions to prop it up for more than a decade is in full retreat .
All 10 of the top - giving industries tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan money and politics watchdog group , are now donating more cash to Democrats than Republicans .
A year ago , Republicans had the edge in six of the 10 sectors .
Financial powerhouse Goldman Sachs has sent 71 percent of its cash this year to Democrats while JPMorgan delivered 68 percent of its checks to the new majority .
Citigroup Inc. followed close behind , with 63 percent of its cash deposited in the accounts of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues .
Even the big drug companies are trying to warm up to their adversaries ; that sector is giving at a rate of 50 - 50 .
Only the old allies of President Bush and Vice President Cheney in the oil and gas sector are holding firm , giving 72 percent of their donations to Republicans and 28 percent to Democrats .
Of course , those numbers could change after the Democrats unveil a global warming bill and the industry ’s lobbyists seek to tweak the final language .
An obvious engine behind the shifting fortunes of the parties is the Democratic takeover of Congress .
Businesses that ignored minority members for years are now trying to build relationships with the new power players .
These new friendships could quickly turn prickly as Democrats zero in on new funding sources for their domestic agenda by closing tax loopholes and raising other taxes that impact the business community .
But there ’s more at work here .
In many ways , Republicans have nobody but themselves to blame for turning the mutually beneficial and philosophically aligned relationship between corporations and GOP caucuses into little more than a transactional one , easily discarded at first evidence of a market disruption .
Republican leaders threatened a freeze - out of business lobbyists who dared hire a Democrat or ignored the names on the leadership ’s private hiring tip sheet .
Pay - to - play became the insider mantra during the Republican reign .
But “ extortion ” was how many CEOs described the annual shakedowns by committee chairmen with jurisdiction over their industries .
No group expressed greater relief — privately and publicly — than the business community when the 2002 McCain - Feingold law banning unlimited corporate donations to politicians became law .
Even the GOP ’s agenda seems to have curled cruelly back on their erstwhile allies .
Sure , President Bush ’s big tax cuts and easing of regulatory oversight were roundly applauded .
But then there was the Sarbanes - Oxley law , a cumbersome set of new rules imposed on corporations after a spate of their own scandals .
As businesses begged for help on health care costs , Republicans staked out policy positions aimed more at defining partisan wedges than practical solutions .
Corporate chieftains disciplined in monitoring the bottom line witnessed Republican committee chairmen spending like divas on new government programs and earmarks .
Scandals and hypocrisy gave a tawdry air to the relationships , prompting some brand - conscious lobbyists to recoil from their political brethren .
And , even today , the White House and several Republican presidential candidates appear willing to try to boost their own political standing with their law - and - order ranks at the expense of their corporate allies .
Exhibit A : Leading Republicans argue a key way to solve the nation ’s illegal immigration problem is to make business owners face prison time unless they can verify their employees are legal .
Just last week the U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined with the ACLU to win a court order preventing the Bush administration from implementing a program that would subject farmers , landscapers , hoteliers and builders to fines and prison sentences if they ca n’t or wo n’t affirm the legal status of their employees .
The business community objected to the plan , arguing it could lead to discrimination and the denial of jobs to native - born U.S. workers .
The court agreed .
The Department of Homeland Security says it is considering an appeal .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said there is another solution — one that the business community agrees with — and that would be for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform .
But , excuse me , who blocked that this summer ?
Oh , yeah , Chertoff ’s own Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill .
The U.S. Chamber had already begun to hedge its bets last year , when a broader shift in corporate giving was detected late in the election season as Democrats gained momentum .
In January , a wholesale repositioning was in swing .
The list of top recipients of corporate political action committee donations in 2003 was dominated by House Speaker Dennis Hastert and endangered incumbents , including California Rep. Richard Pombo and Ohio Rep. Deborah Pryce .
Today , Hastert ’s sitting in the House cheap seats , Pombo’s at home fighting legal troubles and Pryce is bailing out of Congress before the Democrats can take another shot at her in 2008 .
Meanwhile , this year ’s third - quarter , top 10 corporate PAC recipients list leads with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) , House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) and Pelosi .
In the first nine months of 2003 , the top 25 financial services political action committees donated $ 6.8 million to members of Congress .
Of that , 38 percent went to Democrats and 62 percent to Republicans , according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics , done at the request of Politico .
During the same three - quarter period in 2005 , those percentages were roughly the same .
Between January and August of this year , the financial services committees donated $ 8.6 million — 51 percent went to Democrats and 49 percent to Republicans .
While that ratio reflects the partisan breakdown on Capitol Hill , the shift for some organizations has been more dramatic .
For instance , the Independent Community Bankers of America gave 67 percent of its donations to Republicans and just 33 percent to Democrats during the first three quarters of 2005 .
Today , Democrats get the lion ’s share — 53 percent — compared with a Republican take of 47 percent .
The association ’s spokesman , Bill Grassano , declined to comment on the reasons for the shift .
Mr. Wales and Mr. O’Reilly were inspired to act after a firestorm erupted late last month in the insular community of dedicated technology bloggers .
In an online shouting match that was widely reported , Kathy Sierra , a high - tech book author from Boulder County , Colo. , and a friend of Mr. O’Reilly , reported getting death threats that stemmed in part from a dispute over whether it was acceptable to delete the impolitic comments left by visitors to someone ’s personal Web site .
Distraught over the threats and manipulated photos of her that were posted on other critical sites — including one that depicted her head next to a noose — Ms. Sierra canceled a speaking appearance at a trade show and asked the local police for help in finding the source of the threats .
She also said that she was considering giving up blogging altogether .
In an interview , she dismissed the argument that cyberbullying is so common that she should overlook it .
“ I ca n’t believe how many people are saying to me , ‘ Get a life , this is the Internet , ’ ” she said .
“ If that ’s the case , how will we ever recognize a real threat ? ”
Ms. Sierra said she supported the new efforts to improve civility on the Web .
The police investigation into her case is pending .
Menacing behavior is certainly not unique to the Internet .
But since the Web offers the option of anonymity with no accountability , online conversations are often more prone to decay into ugliness than those in other media .
Nowadays , those conversations often take place on blogs .
At last count , there were 70 million of them , with more than 1.4 million entries being added daily , according to Technorati , a blog - indexing company .
For the last decade , these Web journals have offered writers a way to amplify their voices and engage with friends and readers .
But the same factors that make those unfiltered conversations so compelling , and impossible to replicate in the offline world , also allow them to spin out of control .
An injured demontsrator in Nairobi's Kibera slum is guarded by riot police
Enlarge Image
A BBC reporter at a mortuary in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu saw about 40 bodies with gunshot wounds .
A witness said police had opened fire .
There were running battles in Nairobi slums , and violence was reported in the coastal town of Mombasa .
Mwai Kibaki was officially re-elected president while Raila Odinga says he was robbed of victory by voting fraud .
Mr Odinga has called for a million - strong rally by supporters in Nairobi on Thursday .
Police banned his supporters from holding a mass alternative inauguration ceremony in the centre of the capital on Monday , a day after Mr Kibaki was sworn into office again .
In his New Year 's message , the president urged reconciliation but warned that his government would " deal decisively with those who breach the peace " .
On Sunday , Washington congratulated President Kibaki on his victory , but a state department official declined on Monday to repeat these congratulations when asked by reporters .
The US Ambassador to Nairobi , Michael Ranneberger , told the BBC there had been serious problems in a minority of constituencies but he said this did not necessarily mean the election had been rigged .
Live rounds
Shortly after first light , thousands of angry Odinga supporters started setting fire to buildings in Nairobi 's vast Kibera slum while gangs of youths blockaded a nearby main road .
Violence has spread to the resort city of Mombasa
Police fired live rounds and used tear gas and water cannon as thousands of protesters tried to move out towards the city , the BBC 's Josphat Makori said .
In the coastal town of Mombasa , angry crowds on the streets set fire to cars and buildings and at one point hundreds of frightened tourists were trapped at the airport , unable to leave by plane or road .
The situation there was going from " bad to worse " as hundreds of armed police poured into the streets to tackle marauding youths and angry demonstrators , the BBC's Odhiambo Joseph reported early on Monday evening , local time .
Our reporter said he had the impression that the security forces had actually been overwhelmed by the number of youths in the streets .
International news agencies have counted at least 100 deaths across Kenya - with some death tolls as high as 135 - either in clashes between protesters and security forces , or in ethnic violence .
A hospital in the north - western city of Eldoret told AFP news agency it had recorded 24 violent deaths since Saturday , with most victims either injured by gunfire or machetes
An AFP count puts the death toll in Kisumu at 53 and that in Nairobi 's slums at 48
Seven people were killed in Nakuru , in the Rift Valley , and three in the western city of Kakamega
At least four people were killed in Mombasa
At least two people were killed in the Nairobi slum of Korogocho
' Peaceful mass action '
Mr Odinga said he and his colleagues would not be intimidated by violence , and he urged people to join " peaceful mass action " .
He told the BBC that people had taken to the streets in protest because their " democratic right had been usurped by a small clique " .
Those killed in Kisumu include two women and three children , the BBC's Noel Mwakugu reports .
Police fired indiscriminately , even after the protesters started running away in the Kisumu suburbs of Manyatta and Nyamasira , an eye - witness told him .
Local police chief Grace Kahindi said she had no knowledge of any deaths .
A daytime curfew ( 0600 - 1800 local time , 0300 - 1500 GMT ) was imposed in the town .
Some of the violence took an ethnic dimension with the Luo community seen as pro-Odinga and the Kikuyus viewed as Kibaki supporters .
Results changed
European Union monitors were barred from counting centres in the Central Province , chief EU election observer Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told the BBC .

Results declared by the electoral commission in Nairobi from one constituency differed from those announced locally , he said .
He reported seeing altered voting forms where " all the changes favoured the same candidate " .
Anomalies amounted to 20,000 - 25,000 votes in one constituency alone , he continued .
Mr Kibaki 's national margin of victory was 230,000 votes .
Elections chief Samuel Kivuitu has admitted some problems , including a reported voter turnout of 115 % in one constituency , the Associated Press reports .

So I thought nothing of it until I noticed over the weekend that one of the two chandeliers on my porch that I had been using as a porch light had gone missing .
Putting two and two together , I now know what happened , and am trying to put together an accurate mental picture of you , the person who took them .
I like my stuff , and I like keeping it whenever possible .
That said , I understand some thefts .
If you are , persay , addicted to something , and you steal something from me because you need to buy that something and stealing is the only way to make that happen , then I get that .
I still wish you would n't do it , but I get it .
Or if you need to feed yourself or your family or your dog and and you need to steal something to do it , then I get that , too .
Those are crimes of necessity , however that necessity came about .
But that 's not the case here .
Not even close .
As I 'm sure you noticed when you got home / sobered up / looked more closely , the chandelier you stole was not a nice one .
I got them at a thrift store for a dollar , did a shitty job of painting them white ( it 's kind of peeling ) , and was forced to rewire it myself .
If memory serves , the one you took was even missing a bulb .
So they have no real value .
Nobody in their right mind would give you any money for them , and there are many more valuable things laying out in garbage cans or on dark porches all over my street .
You stole my porch light to use it .
You stole it to decorate .
If you were casually walking down my street at night ( as I doubt you came in from out of town or state to pull this ' heist ' ) , then chances are , you live around here .
Chances are equally good that you could very well afford to purchase your own chandelier instead of stealing mine .
Or , maybe you 're just trying it out for a bit , and I 'll one day find it reinstalled on my porch after you sadly discover that it just does n't look right in the bathroom , or really pull together the entryway like you 'd hoped it might .
This is fair warning you to you , then , that I 'm keeping my eyes open .
I made the damned thing , and I know what it looks like .
If I see it on your own porch , I 'm taking it back .
If i see it in your dining room through a window , you and I are going to have an unpleasant conversation ( unlike car thieves or bank robbers , I 'm not terribly intimidated by ' chandelier thieves ' ) .
Or maybe I 'll just take something of yours and use it at my place .
Tit for tat .
" Theft With Intent To Decorate " is something so unnecesarry , so achingly annoying ( and , let 's face it , so Victorian Village ) that I wish I could run into you someday , just so you could see the face I 'd make at you .
It 's the look on your grandmother 's face as you trip her on purpose .
It 's the look on your parents face when you tell them you were dropping out of college to focus on your " real spiritual development as a person " .
It 's like a whole host of angels coming down and singing " What The Fuck ? " all at once .
I 'm making the face right now , actually .
So Bravo ! , thief of the night .
You have my shitty chandelier .
As you bask in it 's glow , I hope you feel good about the kind of person you turned out to be ..
And if I might suggest it , perhaps remember that it was rewired by me , a less than skilled electrician .
So from now on I 'll be sitting out nights on my porch , with my one remaining chandelier , hoping that it 's partner is out there somewhere , burning your god - damned house down .
Sincerely yours ,
A Family 's Nightmare : Accident Photos of Their Beautiful Daughter Released Dad : " They were crime scene pictures that never , ever should have gone out . "
Nov. 16 , 2007  --
Not long after their 18 - year - old daughter died in a car accident , Christos and Lesli Catsouras were forced to relive their grief .
They soon began receiving anonymous e-mails and text messages that contained photographs of the accident , including pictures of Nicole Catsouras ' decapitated body , still strapped to the crumpled remains of her father 's Porsche .
A fake MySpace page was created , which at first looked like a tribute to Catsouras but also led to the horrific photos .
" What type of individual would do that ? " asked Christos .
The pictures , taken by California Highway Patrol officers and e-mailed outside the department , spread around the Internet , making their way to about 1,600 Web sites , according to an investigator hired by family .
The images became so persistent that Lesli Catsouras stopped checking her e-mail .
Nikki's three younger sisters were forbidden to use the Internet , and 16 - year - old Danielle was taken out of school to be home schooled out of fear that her peers might confront her with the pictures .
" There was threats that people were gonna put the pictures on my locker , in my locker , " said Danielle .
" I remember her in such a great way , I do n't wanna see it and have that image stuck in my head . "
" I 've stopped using my e-mail , " says Lesli Catsouras .
" I do n't want to see these every single day .
… And you know , I take a risk every time I go on the computer . "
We talk about Nikki all the time , " said Christos .
" We 've got pictures of her everywhere , We laugh about her , cry .
I always called her Angel . "
' A Life of Its Own '
A judge in California ruled that the Catsouras family 's lawsuit against the California Highway Patrol for allegedly releasing the accident scene pictures can go forward .
According to Catsouras family attorney Tyler Offenhauser , the ruling is a significant step toward getting justice for Nikki because a jury will now decide whether the CHP must take responsibility for its employees ' conduct of disseminating the graphic photos outside the agency .
" They were crime scene pictures that never , ever should have gone out , " Christos Catsouras said .
" There was a big mistake made by the California Highway Patrol that was never really acknowledged , or they never wanted to help us once that mistake had been made . "
The California Highway Patrol declined to comment on the case , citing the pending litigation .
Though the CHP has admitted in a letter to the Catsouras family that its dispatchers violated department policy , it has said it is not legally responsible for the Catsourases ' anguish .
According to state highway patrol reports , at approximately 1:45 p.m. last Halloween , 15 minutes after taking her father 's Porsche 911 for a drive without permission , Nikki Catsouras was traveling 100 mph on State Route 241 , near Lake Forest , Calif. , when she clipped another car and lost control , slamming into a concrete tollbooth , killing her instantly .
Photos of Catsouras ' decapitated body , still strapped into the car , were taken by highway patrol officers investigating the crash , as per departmental procedure .
According to Keith Bremer , an attorney for the Catsouras family , " One of the officers e-mails some of the photographs to a dispatcher and then the dispatcher e-mails them outside the Police Department .
And then from there , you know , it , it created a life of its own and created momentum and it just , it just exploded . "
" There is absolutely no public benefit pursuant to the investigation and the preparation of that police report for those photographs to go anywhere other than in the evidence locker , " he said . "
The pictures were passed around to thousands of sites , and the Catsourases began receiving the images masked behind anonymous e-mails and text messages .
A fake MySpace page was created , ostensibly as a tribute site to Nikki 's life .
But friends and family were again met with the horrific photos , captioned by " false and degrading labels " about Nikki and her family , according to the lawsuit .
" Everybody I know has either seen them or they know someone that 's seen them , " said Lesli .
" This was an expensive car and it was a young girl and she was also a very pretty girl .
It was also Halloween , so it was just the perfect recipe for something like this . "
" People say that she deserved to die , " said Christos .
" She was irresponsible , driving fast , we understand that .
But she did n't deserve to die , and especially in the manner that she died . "
' This Is In No One 's Interest
Though the Catsourases hired a company to remove the photos from the Internet , the images live on .
" It spreads in bursts , and when it spreads it happens very fast , " said Michael Fertik , the founder of ReputationDefender , a company that helps clients remove items from the Internet .
" We go at it by just direct human to human contact .
We reach out to the people who are posting them , or chiefly in these cases , hosting the website where they are posted , and saying ' Look , this is in no one 's interest .
You 're getting less pleasure out of this than these people are suffering pain . "
" We 've asked them to please take down the pictures , and they 've said , ' No , I do n't have to because I 've got my First Amendment rights , " says Lesli Catsouras of the Web sites that still carry the photos .
" But we have rights , you know , we 're living in the United States of America . "
One such Web site did not remove the photos .
It 's owner declined a request to be interviewed , but provided a statement to ABC News , which reads in part :
" Wanting to view photographs of tragic events is a part of human nature .
It 's a very rare person who does n't rubberneck as they pass the scene of an accident , because we 're all interested in a glimpse into death and misfortune .
When we look upon photographs , like those of a young girl who has been violently struck down in the prime of her life by a moment 's recklessness , we gaze upon our own mortality , and we think about how easily this could have been us .
… While I sympathize with the family and have no desire to perpetuate the pain of their loss , I also realize the reality of the internet .
Once photographs like these leak online , they spread like a virus . …
For those who find photographs of deceased individuals disturbing , they have the option of not visiting the sort of sites that display those images .
( Most of those sites have ample warnings before anything disturbing is shown . )
But the right of the rest of us to view such images should not be infringed upon . "
After an internal investigation , the California Highway Patrol identified two dispatchers , Thomas O'Donnell and Aaron Reich as being responsible for the leaked images .
Citing " pending litigation , " the highway patrol has yet to comment on the case , but it sent a letter to the family admitting the mistake .
" After a thorough and complete investigation we have determined that a CHP employee did violate departmental policy in this matter .
Appropriate action has taken place to preclude a similar occurrence in the future , " the letter , signed by Orange County Communications Center Lt. Cmdr.
Paul Depaola , states .
" Again , my sympathy to you and your family at this difficult time of loss , " Depaola wrote .
" The CHP has taken the position that plaintiffs do not have a civil case against them because the release of the photographs , while morally wrong , did not violate any governmental regulation or statute , " Bremer said .
Orange County Superior Court Judge Steven Perk refused to dismiss the case against the California Highway Patrol .
Bremer expects more challenges to the lawsuit from the dispatchers as well .
' She Was a Person '
Rex Parris , a lawyer for defendant Thomas O'Donnell , said his client is innocent of any wrongdoing and said that O'Donnell did not leak any of the photos .
He only received pictures and sent them to his own , personal e-mail , Parris said .
O'Donnell says that the agency is n't defending him in the lawsuit , and that he feels abandoned .
" I do n't understand why the department is n't sitting here with me , helping me , " he said .
" Other than looking at the photographs and forwarding them to his own private e-mail account , he did nothing , " Parris said .
" He was just a recipient of the digital photographs , he did n't forward them on to anyone , " Parris said .
Sharing photographs of accident scenes are a part of the job for highway patrol workers and dispatchers , and always have been , he said .
He claimed that as long as taking accident scene pictures remains part of CHP policy , incidents such as this one will continue to come up .
" There is n't anybody out there that would n't want to protect this family from seeing those photographs , " Parris said .
" This is an issue of technology , not morality or equal prohibition .
It 's one of those painful things that come along with technology . "
Parris and Bremer said the CHP should apologize .
" It is disappointing that the CHP acknowledges an internal error of this magnitude has occurred , " Bremer said , " but steadfastly refuses to acknowledge the ramifications and extent of pain it has caused the Catsouras family . "
" They 'd like the California Highway Patrol , which has admitted that internal policies were violated , to come and say that they are sorry . "
On the first anniversary of Nikki's death , the Catsouras family cut together a video tribute with their own pictures of Nikki , set to the song " Angel , " which is what her father always called her .
" I feel like no one really realized she was a person , and they in a sick way got really entertained by this photograph , and it 's just sad that someone can feel the need to put it out and keep it going on and harming others by putting it up , " said Danielle .
" We are a real family with real hearts , " said Christos .
" And it hurts what people are doing . "
Protecting Your Online Reputation : Advice from ReputationDefender

5 . If you see a problem , work hard to nip it in the bud by trying to get the person who posted it to remove the content immediately .
6 . Be wise about how you communicate with people online : Hesitate before engaging in online confrontation via IM , message boards or social networks .
7 . Even if you think a Web forum is anonymous , be careful what you say .
Sometimes the site owner may inadvertently or deliberately reveal your identity at some point in the future , for example , when the Web site changes hands or if someone hacks it .
EFFECT OF THE 'SURGE '
" The United States has increased the number of its forces in Baghdad and surrounding provinces in the past six months .
Please tell me if you think this increase of forces has made it better , worse , or had no effect ? "
The results of the poll reflect a great degree of dissatisfaction with the US " surge " , with a vast majority of respondents considering the move to have made the situation in the country worse rather than better .
WHO'S TO BLAME ?
" Who do you blame most for the violence that is occurring in the country ? "
The latest poll data reflects a slight increase in the number of respondents who consider al - Qaeda and foreign jihadis responsible for fomenting violence .
There was a significant reduction from February to August 2007 in the numbers who believe that the US and coalition forces are mainly to blame .
Poll analysts suggest this trend could be partially explained by a perceived backlash against the ' foreign ' presence of al - Qaeda and other jihadi elements in parts of the country where tribal allegiances are strong , such as Anbar province .
TROOP WITHDRAWAL
" How long do you think US and other Coalition forces should remain in Iraq ? "
The autumn 2007 poll reflects growing disillusionment with the occupying forces ' presence in Iraq .
There is a growing consensus among respondents that coalition troops should leave the country immediately .
Some 47 % of respondents now back an immediate withdrawal , compared with 35 % in February .
The poll also shows dwindling support for troops remaining in the country , even in support of the Iraqi government and security forces .
Only 10 % of those surveyed favour coalition forces remaining for that purpose .
IS VIOLENCE JUSTIFIED ?
" Thinking about the political action of other people , do you find each of these items to be acceptable or not acceptable ? "
Attacks on coalition forces
All Sunni Arab Shia Arab Kurds Acceptable 57 % 93 % 50 % 5 % Not acceptable 43 % 7 % 50 % 94 %
One of starkest statistics from the poll is the overwhelming support for attacks on coalition forces among Iraq 's minority Sunni population ; 93 % of those surveyed said they considered it acceptable .
Attacks on Iraqi forces
All Sunni Arab Shia Arab Kurds Acceptable 7 % 18 % 2 % 2 % Not acceptable 93 % 82 % 98 % 97 %
By the same majority - 93 % - respondents reject violence against Iraqi forces .
GOVERNMENT AND LEADERSHIP
" Thinking of the current national government of Iraq , how do you feel about the way in which it has carried out its responsibilities ? "
Iraqis polled in the latest survey are increasingly disillusioned with the government , figures suggest .
More than a quarter of those polled in 2005 said that they thought the government was doing a " very good job " , whereas by August 2007 , this figure has fallen to just over 5 % .
" Do you approve or disapprove of the way Nouri Kamel al - Maliki is handling his job as prime minister ? "
Shia politician Nouri al - Maliki became prime minister of Iraq in April 2006 , and before returning following the fall of Saddam Hussein spoke in favour of a pluralist country whose various ethnic and sectarian groups regarded each other as equals .
The latest polls however reflect dwindling support for him ; some 66 % of those polled registered their disapproval of the way he is handling his job .
THE FUTURE OF IRAQ
" Which of the following structures do you believe Iraq should have in the future ? "
Opinions on the future of the country vary widely by ethnic grouping .
Sunni Arabs remain strongly in favour of a single unified nation , while Kurds in northern Iraq overwhelmingly support a break - up of the country into indepedent nations - a move which would see the emergence of a separate Kurdistan .
REGIONAL DIVIDE
Iraq was divided into regions for the poll :
North : made up of the districts of Dahuk , Irbil , Nineveh , Sulaimaniya , Tamim .
Central : Baghdad , Anbar , Babil , Diyala , Salahuddin .
South : Basra , Karbala , Misan , Najaf , Muthanna , Qadisiya , Dhiqar , Wasit .
The results show that people in the northern and southern districts are generally happier with the conditions in which they live than those in the central regions and Baghdad .

Methodology :
The poll was conducted by D3 Systems and KA Research Ltd for the BBC , ABC News , and NHK of Japan .
Some 2,112 Iraqis were questioned in more than 450 neighbourhoods across all the 18 provinces of Iraq between August 17 and August 24 , 2007 .
The margin of error is + or - 2.5 % .
Azamar says :
I was googling around trying to figure out a system to lock up my pot so I would n't be tempted for a while , but to have it become available automatically after a set period of time .
I ended up stumbling into the subculture of chastity belt fetishists , people who derive pleasure from locking themselves up in high tech chastity belts and giving the keys to some person or machine that has power over them .
The site timelock.rules .it has a program [ Timelock , $ 20 ] that allows someone to use encryption to lock themselves up for a set or random amount of time , or even to send the key to their chastity belt over the internet to a trusted " keyholder " .
Let me start out by saying that I know of a lot of people that are doing MVC with WebForms , I am doing it myself right now , which put me in the position to talk about the pain that it brings .
Let us consider the traditional MVC pattern :
Now , in such a pattern , who is supposed to be in control ?
To drive the application ?
If you have guessed that the " Controller " is the one that is supposed to be in control , you got the jackpot , but missed the boat ( am I mixing methapors here ? ) as far as WebForms - based MVC platforms are concerned .
The WebForm model , a PageController with complex life cycle , has a direct affect on the structure of the rest of the application .
After trying to get true MVC working on WebForms , I now believe it to be impossible to get it to work in a way that would satisfy me .
My view on views is that they are :
Stupid
Presentation logic only
Do not affect the rest of the application
For the purpose of this dicussion , I am going to ignore the differences between MVC , MVP , Passive View , etc .
I do n't have an issue with the view doing data binding , UI logic , etc .
The problem is that there are only three models that can be used with WebForms & MVC :
Front Controller that later invokes the Page - Basically , the way that MonoRail integrates the WebForm view engine .
The problem with that is that ASPX is n't really that smart about stuff , so you end up having to do a lot of stuff in the code behind , which means that you usually need to call the controller for stuff .
This gives you wierd state issues , where the controller method has run , but then it is called again to get more information that the view is needed .
The main issue is with this are stuff like pressing a button , which is very hard to do in a web - nice way with WebForms , neccesiating to catch the event in the view and then call to the controller again .
Ugly .
This is probably the best approach , but unless you are doing it with MonoRail , it is also the most expensive one in terms of time and investment .
JB has some thoughts about this subject , from using MonoRail & WebForms .
Even when you are using MonoRail , this is awkward .

Even when you are using MonoRail , this is awkward .
The Page is calling the Controller 's methods .
This is what I am using currently , but I find that this introduce the same state based issues that I am trying to avoid ( orderring of method calls , etc ) and it still gives too much responsability to the view .
It basically make the view a semi controller , because it is what drives the controller .
The most painful parts are stuf like GetPolicies ( ) , GetUsers ( ) , etc , which are called directly on the controller by the view to get the data it needs .
I could do it the other way around , FillData ( IView ) , I suppose , but that gives me awkward model for the state changes that is required in most complex screens .
Basically , the FillData ( ) would need to get the purpose for this , so I would have FillDataForDefaultCustomer , FillDataForChangedCustomer , etc .
Another issue is that my controllers are inherintly multi-views capable .
That is mostly because of the architecture of WebForms & Atlas , this requires me to put some of the stuff that should respond to an Ajax call in a web service or HttpHandler .
Those are all going to the same controller ( same use case ) , but there have very different needs .

Registering to the view events in the controller .
This seems to be a fairly favoraite pattern for MVP in ASP .
Net .
I have issues with that because we now has strong ties from the view 's behavior to the controller behavior .
I think that methods like : " void OnLoad ( object sender , EventArgs e ) " are code smell , and they do n't give me much separation from the view .
In fact , they are Code Behind done right , without dealing with the UI at all .
To be clear , all three methods give me a few things very important that it is very hard to get from naked WebForms , namely : Separation of Concerns & Testability .
The most problamatic part in this is that it is very hard to get view - ignorance capabilities using the WebForm approach , it is much harder than it should , and the page lifecycle issue is paramount in both view and controller .
My current approach in WebForms MVC is the second approach , but it is very easy to add additonal concerns to the view without noticing , and my controllers looks more like a service class than a true controller .
As you can guess from the title , I do n't think that this is somethig that can be solved when using the WebForms framework .
The view is so centric to the very idea of WebForms that it is impossible to work without its influence .
I am probably going to do another screen cast on this , but at this point I am giving up .
I am fed up with approximations .
If you want to do MVC in ASP .
Net , you would n't be able to get the real thing with WebForms .
ICANN ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) , the people who manage domain names , yesterday announced that as of Monday 15th internet domain names would go international .
What this means is that rather than websites being forced to use Roman characters such as .com , .org , . net etc at the end of their domain , countries can now use their native alphabets .
This is great news and highlights the importance of recognising the need for people to browse the internet in their native language without resorting to the use of the Roman alphabet .
As ICANN themselves have stressed “ the internationalization of the Internet ’s domain name system must be accomplished through standards that are open , non-proprietary , and fully compatible with the Internet ’s existing end - to - end model and that preserve globally unique naming in a universally resolvable public name space ” .
This takes us a step closer to making the internet a truly global , accessible space although its no small irony that this will turn the browsing experience of those of us who do not read Arabic , Chinese or Tamil on its head .
For example Chinese users write Chinese characters by typing a phonetic version of words in Roman letters called pinyin .
Computer software programs then provide a list of associated characters that the user then chooses depending on the meaning of the word – a bit like predictive text on a mobile phone .
Without that know how or software a non Chinese speaker is n’t going to be able to type Chinese domain names .
Instead people are going to have to resort to using links from search engines and other sites to access websites with localised domain names .
ICANN is going cautiously though and is planning a set of test sites in eleven languages : Arabic , Persian , Chinese ( simplified and traditional ) , Russian , Hindi , Greek , Korean , Yiddish , Japanese , and Tamil .
This is partly to ensure that the roll out is both secure and stable .
Experts predict that while take up will be slow , ICANN does n’t expect working addresses in the new languages to be available until the end of next year , this will have a huge impact on the estimated 5 billion people who are not on the Internet and who come up against the barrier of language – just one aspect of the digital divide .
As Paul Hoffman , a Santa Cruz , Calif . - based programmer who created the standards behind the internationalized domain names said the new names “ are not for the current users , but for the next billion ” .
This has been echoed by an Egyptian Minister who says that in Egypt about seven million people , or 10 % of the population , use the internet .
Most of these users are well - educated and speak at least some English .
To get the next 10 % of the population online , however , having domain names in Arabic is critical .
As of Monday you can test the new domains yourself as ICANN will post links on its website to test sites in the 11 non-Roman languages .
You ’ll be able to test the sites , leave comments about them and create your own versions of web pages that use the non-Roman suffixes .
I love the fact that while the business world becomes ever more English - centric all this work is going on to make the web localised ; the towers of babel are have long way to go before they get rebuilt yet !
LAFFING IT UP …. THE SEQUEL ….
Remember that comical graph the Wall Street Journal editorial page ran a few weeks ago that tried to demonstrate a Laffer curve for corporate tax rates ?
The one that shot up from zero to Norway , and then headed down so steeply that it predicted the United States should get no revenue at all from its corporate income tax ?
You can refresh your memory on the WSJ ’s inanity here .
Well , here ’s the hilarious followup .
Brendan Nyhan , who clearly has too much time on his hands , took the raw data provided by Kevin Hassett and replotted it using standard tools .
The result is on the right : if you do a linear regression you get the red line , while if you apply a quadratic model you get the blue curve .
Here ’s the funny part :
For technical reasons Brendan thinks the linear regression is more likely to be correct , but still , the quadratic model is at least defensible .
And if you look at its high point , it peaks at about ….. 29 % .
Pretty much the same place as the kindergarten curve the WSJ drew .
In other words , if the WSJ editorial page had even a smidgen of intellectual honesty , they could have plotted a curve that was at least colorably defensible and would have made their same point , namely that the United States might benefit from lower corporate tax rates .
But they just could n’t bring themselves to treat the data with even the veneer of respect , and the result was to undermine their own cause .
A deserving fate , no ?
The faint ring is marked by a black cross
It appears to be composed of material blasted off the surface of two saturnian moons by meteoroid impacts .
The moons Janus and Epimetheus may be too small to hold on to dust kicked out by these impacts , so it escapes into space , spreading out into a ring .
The tenuous , wispy ring coincides with the orbits of these two moons , mission scientists noted .
Researchers expected meteoroid impacts on Janus and Epimetheus to kick particles off the moons ' surfaces and inject them into an orbit around Saturn .
But they were surprised to find such a well - defined ring at this location .
Cast in shadow
Scientists owe their discovery to a highly unusual event : a solar occultation which put Cassini in Saturn 's shadow for 12 hours .
The longest occultation of the four - year mission allowed the spacecraft to scrutinise the rings as they were strongly backlit by the Sun .
Cassini stares back at " home " - Earth as it looks from Saturn
These projections , which interact directly with the E ring , consist of tiny ice particles being ejected from geysers at the moon 's south pole .
Cassini also cast its eyes in our direction .
The spacecraft took a picture of Earth from nearly 1.5 billion km ( 930 million miles ) away .
Earth appears as a pale blue orb and there is a feature in the image which could be our Moon .
During the latest observations , scientists once again saw the bright , ghost - like features called " spokes " .
These are transient , unexplained " disturbances " that streak across the main rings of Saturn .
Cassini entered into orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004 .
Later that year , it released the piggybacked Huygens probe towards the planet 's largest moon , Titan .
Huygens touched down on Titan on 14 January 2005 , sending back data on the moon 's atmosphere , weather and its surface .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( Asi ) .
Although BenQ prefers to market its MP622 and MP622 c projectors to the suits , we see no reason these bad boys can't be carted home after the nine - to - five for a little fun .
Both DLP units sport a 1,024 x 768 ( XGA ) resolution , a 2,000: 1 contrast ratio , ultra - quiet 26 dB noise level whilst running in economy mode , and a sexy " midnight black high gloss exterior . "
The MP622 offers up 2,700 ANSI lumens while the MP622c musters just 2,200 , but you 'll find VGA / S - Video / composite video inputs on each to compliment the audio in jack and integrated speakers .
Word on the street puts these two units on store shelves later this month , with the MP622 ringing up at around $ 999 and the MP622c costing $ 849 . [ Via FarEastGizmos
PLEASE NOTE : click on the link below for the most recent oil forecast update http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3623 which includes forecasts for Kuwait and the UAE .
1. World Total Liquids Supply & Demand
Although crude oil & lease condensate ( C&C ) production is forecast to continue declining , the total liquids supply remains on a plateau until 2009 , due to offsetting production increases from natural gas plant liquids ( NGPLs ) , ethanol and XTL ( BTL - biomass to liquids , CTL - coal to liquids and GTL - gas to liquids ) .
Demand is forecast to continue growing but supply will start to fall forcing up prices to reduce demand .
Fig 1 - Total Liquids Supply & Demand to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
2. World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production
The largest component of total liquids is world C&C production .
The first part of the forecast to 2100 , in the figure below , is created using a bottom up forecast based on over 300 continuously updated regions / projects to 2012 ( Fig 3 ) .
After 2012 , two scenarios are shown .
The green line is a forecast using BP Annual Statistics Review 2006 proven reserves data .
The dark red line , the most likely scenario , is based partly on the BP data , but large downward revisions are made to OPEC reserves and small upward revisions are made to the reserves of many countries to derive a more accurate estimate of proven and probable reserves .
This estimate is assumed to be equal to the ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) .
Fig 2 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production to 2100 - click to enlarge
World C&C production continues to retain its May 2005 peak and is forecast to decline by 1 % / yr until 2009 .
The decline rate steepens to 4% / yr until 2012 .
The main reason for the end of the total liquids plateau in 2009 ( Fig 1 ) is that the C&C production decline rate changes from 1 % / yr to 4% / yr in 2009 .
Fig 3 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
3. Peak Production and Peak Discovery Time Lags
Although the forecast production decline rate in Fig 2 appears high , it is a natural time lagged response to the peak year for discoveries as shown below .
As the world uses more oil each year than is discovered , oil production must decline after a time lag from the peak discovery year .
The figure below shows a peak discovery year in 1965 , followed by a steady decline .
Since the mid 1980s , annual production has been greater than annual discoveries .
This is not sustainable and it is inevitable that world annual production will start to decline .
This timing of peak production and rate of decline is forecast by Fig 2 .
Fig 4 - World Discoveries ( source ASPO Ireland Newsletter No. 79 , July 2007 ) - click to enlarge
The figure below focuses on giant oil field discoveries and shows a similar shape to the figure above .
The number of giant oil fields discovered peaked in the 1960 - 69 decade and both the number of giant fields and their respective recoverable reserves have declined steadily .
The shape of the discovery decline curve below from 1960 to 2006 is similar to the production decline curve ( Fig 2 ) from 2005 to 2100 .
Fig 5 - World Discoveries , Giant Oil Fields ( source Giant Oil Fields – The Highway to Oil , Fredrik Robelius , March 2007 ) - click to enlarge
A very good example of the time lag between peak discovery and peak production is the USA ( Fig 6 ) .
Peak discovery was 1930 and peak production occurred 42 years later in 1972 .
Fig 4 shows peak discovery for the world occurred in 1965 .
Fig 3 predicts that peak production occurred in 2005 , which is 40 years later than peak discovery , a similar time lag to the USA .

4. World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production Changes
The green bars , representing year on year changes , in Figures 7 and 8 below , show the biggest declines for Mexico , North Sea and Saudi Arabia ; the biggest increases for Russia , Azerbaijan and Angola .
Angola has many projects which should continue to increase its production but Russia ’s mature field production will probably limit Russia ’s future production growth .
Militant action in Nigeria and maintenance in the North Sea decreased production from Feb 2007 to Mar 2007 .
Fig 7 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production Changes to March 2007 - click to enlarge
Both Nigeria and the North Sea reversed some of their Mar 2007 losses to show small increases in Apr 2007 .
However , Nigeria ’s production growth appears to have stalled and the North Sea shows continuing decline .
In Apr 2007 Canada decreased C&C production by almost 0.10 mbd .
On a year on year basis their production is only up by 0.10 mbd , as shown by the green bar in Fig 8 .
Given all the promise of the oil sands this increase is small .
Russia also showed a decrease in production from Mar 2007 to Apr 2007 of 0.10 mbd .
Could this mean that Russia ’s C&C production is on a plateau ?
Fig 8 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production Changes to April 2007 - click to enlarge
Both Figures 7 and 8 show world C&C production dropping on a year on year basis by about 0.30 mbd .
This is not a large decline but given that Russia is unlikely to increase production and that Saudi Arabia , North Sea and Mexico are unlikely to reverse their decline , this means that the world C&C production rate will continue to slowly decline ( Fig 3 ) .
5. Saudi Arabia Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production
Saudi Arabia remains a key producer in the world and continually reminds the world of its enormous reserves and surplus production capacity .
This paragraph on capacity in IEA 's 12 June 2007 Oil Market Report , page 15 , explains Saudi Arabia ’s current surplus capacity situation within an OPEC context .
Notional spare capacity stands at 4.0 mb/d , while our measure of effective spare capacity ( excluding Indonesia , Iraq , Nigeria and Venezuela ) stands at 2.85 mb/d .
Although these volumes are physically producible , even this lower figure likely overstates what OPEC could actually shift onto the market given current prices and shortages in refinery upgrading capacity .
Heavy , sour Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti crude accounts for 88 % of the effective spare capacity figure .
In the absence of substantial discounts , these volumes might struggle to find buyers while sizeable amounts of refinery upgrading capacity remain offline for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance .
Readily marketable spare crude capacity may therefore be much lower , and a more accurate reflection of current market tightness .
In other words , this IEA paragraph says that the world has only 0.35 mb/d spare capacity of readily marketable light sweet crude because the spare capacities of 2.20 mb/d from Saudi Arabia and 0.30 mb/d from Kuwait are hard to sell heavy sour crudes .
Given the statements in this IEA monthly market report , the following forecast assumes no effective spare capacity of easily marketable Saudi Arabia crude .
The new production capacities from AFK , Shaybah expansion , Nuayyim and Khurais are just enough to offset decline from existing fields .
Aramco has scheduled Manifa last because it will produce heavy oil which is less marketable than lighter grades .
It is also assumed that Saudi Arabia will produce their fields while maintaining the annual depletion rate of remaining reserves at less than about 5.3 % / yr , which should ensure that reservoir damage does not occur due to overproduction from their fields .
The figure of 5.3% / yr was selected because the annual depletion rate of remaining reserves reached a peak of 5.3 % / yr in the third quarter of 2006 ( Fig 9 ) , based upon estimated ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) of 175 Gb for Saudi Arabia .
The estimated URR of 175 Gb is equal to 155 Gb of non heavy crude plus 20 Gb of heavy crude .
Although the heavy sour crude fields of Safaniya and Manifa may ultimately produce much more than 20 Gb , only 20 Gb is assigned because this low quality crude is difficult to market and difficult to process by refineries .
The non heavy crude URR of 155 Gb includes 85 Gb for Ghawar ( light ) , 15 Gb for Abqaiq ( extra light ) , 8 Gb for Berri ( extra light ) and the remaining URR is assigned to Aramco ’s other non heavy crude fields including Marjan , Qatif , Khurais , Zuluf , Shaybah , Abu Safah and Khursaniyah .
The estimated URR is based mainly on the information sources about Saudi Arabia , located at the end of this article .
As of June 2007 , Aramco ’s total C&C production is 112 Gb , being 64 % of the URR 175 Gb .
Over half of the 112 Gb has been produced from the super giant Ghawar .
Abqaiq , Berri and Safaniya have also been significant producers .
As Aramco has produced over half of the estimated URR , the production curve is forecast to follow a typical post peak decline curve , shown by the red line in Fig 9 .
Fig 9 - Saudi Arabia Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production to 2020 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
Figs 9 and 10 have been updated for Aramco ’s most recent project schedule , released in June 2007 .
Due to both Al Khafji ( 0.30 mbd ) and Shaybah ph 2 expansion ( 0.25 mbd ) being removed from Aramco ’s recent project schedule , the probability that Aramco has passed peak production in 2005 is almost a certainty .
The solid red line shows a “ Do Nothing ” forecast scenario in Fig 10 .
This represents a production decline rate of 8%/ yr which is equivalent to ultimate recoverable reserves of 148 Gb ( billion barrels ) .
Of course this scenario is highly unlikely but serves as a lower bound for the production profile .
The “ New Peak ? ” dashed red line represents a scenario for which another peak is attained .
However , the inset in the chart explains that another 1.75 MB/ D would be required from other projects and infill drilling .
This is highly unlikely and confirms that a peak in 2005 has passed .
The “ Bottom Up ” dark blue line represents the most likely scenario and includes the forecast to 2020 from Fig 9 and a 5 % / yr decline thereafter .

6. Other Components of Total Liquids Production
Natural gas plant liquids show an increase in production due to OPEC projects from Saudi Arabia , Algeria , Iran and Qatar .
Fig 11 - World Natural Gas Plant Liquids Production to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
Ethanol and XTL ( BTL , CTL and GTL ) production is forecast to double to 2012 .
Unfortunately , the increased production of government subsidised corn based ethanol in the USA is increasing the prices of many other food products .
Fig 12 - World Ethanol & XTL Production to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
Processing gains are defined by the EIA as “ The volumetric amount by which total output is greater than input for a given period of time .
This difference is due to the processing of crude oil into products which , in total , have a lower specific gravity than the crude oil processed . ”
These gains are forecast to decline slowly based on the decline in C&C ( Fig 3 ) .

Bouncing back from Wednesday 's falls , investors were cheered by strong June trading figures from Wal - Mart and some of the other main retailers .
Further boosted by a rise in the shares of aluminium giant Alcoa , the Dow Jones ended up more than 2 % to over 13,800 .
The Dow has achieved a string of record closing highs this year .
' Surprise figures '
Analysts said the upbeat June sales figures was enough to make investors at least temporarily forget the recent woes in the housing sector that saw shares fall sharply on Wednesday
With weakness in the housing market ... the biggest concern was that we were going to see bad numbers from the retailers
Analyst Eric Kuby
Alcoa was the biggest riser on the Dow Jones , its shares adding 6.2 % after its bid for Canadian rival Alcan appeared to have been trumped by a higher offer from Anglo - Australian group Rio Tinto .
Analysts said losing out on Alcan could make Alcoa a takeover target itself .
" The surprise of the day is that the consumer is still spending at a healthy rate , " said Eric Kuby , chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management
" With weakness in the housing market ... the biggest concern was that we were going to see bad numbers from the retailers , but we 're seeing the opposite . "

“ You break it , you own it . ”
So goes the “ Pottery Barn rule ” that Colin Powell invoked in his last - ditch attempts to dissuade President Bush from invading Iraq .
“ You are going to be the proud owner of 25 million people .
You will own all their hopes , aspirations , and problems .
You ’ll own it all . ”
In the end , of course , Powell caved to Bush ’s geopolitical whims , played the good soldier , and did as much as anyone to lie to the world and sell the case for invasion — an invasion driven by blind ideology , wishful thinking , and a feckless refusal to consider the consequences .
Stupefyingly , the administration maintains that attitude to this day — refusing , for example , to address the plight of 2 million refugees because , you see , they ’ll all go home soon to a pacified Iraq .
Yet it ’s not just the administration that has its head in the sand ; to varying degrees , we all do .
For those of us who argued against invading , it is tempting to simply demand an end to “ Bush ’s War ” and wash our hands of it .
But as General Anthony Zinni , former head of U.S. forces in the Middle East , told us , “ Your conscience is not clean just because you ’re a peace demonstrator . ”
In other words , just because you were n’t in favor of going in does n’t mean you ’re not responsible for what happens when we pull out .
And pull out we will — if only because the military can’t sustain current troop levels .
Not that you ’d know it from listening to the debate in Washington , with its farcical focus on timetables and surges and benchmarks .
Take the grand unveiling of the Petraeus report , a PR blitz reminiscent of prewar opinion orchestration .
First , Brookings Institution scholars Kenneth Pollack and Michael O’Hanlon went on a Potemkin tour of Iraq and dutifully wrote an op - ed called “ A War We Just Might Win . ”
Only two qualifiers ?
No matter , the Washington commentariat took the cue and hastily fell in line .
As did the media , some of which even bought Dick Cheney ’s canard that these two were “ critics of the war . ”
( Actually , as Salon ‘s Glenn Greenwald forced O’Hanlon to acknowledge , “ I was a supporter . ” )
By the time General David Petraeus presented himself to Congress — his “ report ” long since leaked — the political theater had devolved into bad summer stock .
General Petraeus was the very model of a modern major general ; the Democratic candidates formed a spectral chorus ; MoveOn played to type as the shrill left .
And , most gratingly , Bush reprised his 2003 role : flinty - eyed , elbows on podium , warning of Al Qaeda evildoers on the one hand and genocide on the other .
Now , as then , this was a nice bit of political calculation designed to reconstitute the pro-invasion coalition of the worried , the gung - ho , and the humanitarian interventionists .
True , Bush was n’t completely lying .
Al Qaeda in Iraq is a threat — one entirely of Bush ’s making , but a threat nonetheless .
( See : Al Qaeda in Iraq : How Dangerous Is It ? )
And there ’s the very real chance that withdrawal will precipitate more , perhaps even apocalyptic , violence .
( See : Four Post - Occupation Scenarios )
There are no good options in Iraq , but the options narrow to the horrific the longer our leaders dawdle .
Bush seems content — whether out of delusional optimism or cynical “ strategery ” — to run out the clock and stick the next administration with this mess ; only 5 percent of Americans expect him to do otherwise .
And the Democrats are playing the other side of the same game — content to let the GOP go down with its man .
So what is to be done ?
First and foremost , anyone running for or holding national office must be forced to answer these questions :
What ’s your schedule for withdrawal , and what consequences do you foresee ?
Which comes first — withdrawal , a functioning Iraqi government , or a solid international peacekeeping force ?
What concessions would you make to get Iraq ’s neighbors to help ?
What degree of bloodshed are you prepared to stand by and watch ?
We put such questions to five dozen military men , think - tankers , peace activists , academics , and politicians .
Some of their responses follow , and we ’ll post the full interviews online , along with a list of those who refused to respond — including the architects of the war , leading presidential candidates , and the congressional leadership .
Some , it should be noted , begged off because they were taking a summer break , even as Iraqi politicians were being criticized for doing the same .
We hope that if we ca n’t force them to reckon with reality , you can .
As General Zinni notes , “ the government is us .
We made promises and commitments .
The administration proposed the war ; Congress — the voice of the people — authorized it ; we are responsible for it .
We ca n’t claim , ‘ I did n’t vote for him in the first place ’ or ‘ I changed my mind . ’
There has to be some sort of obligation that falls to us as a society for what our government does in our name . ”
Yes , Bush , a leader with all the impulse control of a petulant three - year - old , “ broke ” Iraq .
But we own it now .
Time to get ready with the apology , the checkbook , and whatever else is required .
I do n’t know about anybody else here , but I for one am a total sucker for Dr. Laura .
Thanks to a company department picnic , on my way home from work today I had a rare opportunity to partake in this particular indulgence , and I heard an interesting call .
Here ’s an excerpt :
If you ca n’t listen to the audio , here ’s a partial transcript :
Ryan :
When my husband comes home from work today — if he comes home , ’ cause he ’s calling and saying he ’s not going to come home — I ’m wondering how , or what to say to him .
He had like , a flip out last night that continued into the morning .
I actually had to leave with our kids because he was actually breaking things .
This is not typical behavior of his at all , and I ’m just really nervous —
Dr. Laura :
Was he drinking ?
Ryan :
He does n’t drink , no .
Dr. Laura :
What do you think caused this big flip out ?
Ryan :
Well , we bought a house two years ago , and ever since we bought the house it ’s always been “ we bought it because you wanted it , ” and every time we have financial struggles , it ’s my fault because we bought a house that he said we should n’t buy , so … that ’s …
I guess the stresses of the house are getting more intense because our interest is going up so it ’s been sort of like the past month I ’ve been hearing him talk a lot about that .
Dr. Laura :
Well , wait a minute .
You mean , you bought a house when you really could n’t afford it ?
Ryan :
There you go .
[ nervous laugh ]
Exactly .
Exactly .
And I kinda pushed to buy the house because I thought we could , even though I really should have listened to him …
You should take the time to listen to the entire three - and - a - half minute call ( player below ) .
Due to the format of Dr. Laura ’s show , we do n’t know where Ryan was calling from , but thanks to your friendly neighborhood housing bubble , situations like this are playing out across the country with increasing frequency .

Michael Collins : Thought Control on the Internet
By an Overwhelming Majority Congress Brings You ... Thought Control on the Internet By Michael Collins

Washington , D.C .
Part 1
Cracking the Code – Who's to Blame for " Violent Radicalization " ?
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 404 to 6 vote on Oct. 23 .
Not since the Iraq War Resolution have Democrats and Republicans found such a unifying cause .
We 're told that House Resolution 1955 ( H.R. 1955 ) will be an essential tool enabling law enforcement to peg the sources of " homegrown terrorism " on the Internet .
The overwhelming bipartisan support makes it no surprise that the legislation presents a significant danger to citizens and the nation .
This sentence is the new heart of darkness for free speech .
(2) VIOLENT RADICALIZATION -
The term `violent radicalization ' means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious , or social change .
( Author 's emphasis ) ( House Resolution 1955 )
That one word , " facilitating , " takes the bill beyond aiding the hunt for terrorists on the Internet .
It creates an emerging standard for wrongdoing that can be applied to everyone who exercises net - based free speech .
Senate 1959 , the equivalent of H.R. 1955 , is up for consideration now .
Here are some scenarios under the bill that could easily be called " thought crimes " , i.e. , " facilitating violent radicalization . "
You post one of these statements on the Internet …
You are extremely upset about what you see as the nation 's most serious problem – illegal immigration .
You go to your Internet forum of choice and write a barn burner stating clearly that this administration and Congress are attacking the nation , breaking laws , and a threat to the safety of the people .
You find the deaths of American soldiers and 1.1 million Iraqi civilians totally unacceptable .
You go to your Internet forum of choice and write a very strong post accusing the president and his henchmen with war crimes .
You 're a former Reagan official , a " paleo- conservative . "
You argue that this administration 's behavior represents tyrannical rule .
You write a column published on the Internet where you ask questions about 911 : " Who benefits ?
This question was conspicuously absent from the official investigation . "
You answer by naming Bush , Cheney , the Federalist Society and others .
You question the collapse of the WTC towers and conclude by arguing that a major casualty of 911 " is the civil liberties that protect Americans from tyranny .
President Bush and his corrupt Department of Justice ( sic ) have declared our constitutional protections to be null and void at the whim of the executive . "
Paul Craig Roberts , Sept. 10 , 2007
… and a terrorist reads it .
That terrorist subsequently commits a violent act .
You do n't know the person .
You 're not affiliated with him or her in any way .
You do n't advocate violence in your post nor do you approve of violence to achieve political goals .
None of that matters .
You can be accused of facilitating " violent radicalization , " which this bill specifically implies can be an outcome of flagrant opposition to the administration , even though you really just oppose the current or any future office holders .
You 're busted !
The scenario just mentioned is an outcome of H.R. 1955 and the yet - to - be- passed equivalent Senate Resolution 1959 .
Rep. Harman's
House committee just released a commentary on H.R. 1955 , apparently to stem concerns about their intentions .
On the opening page , the report states :
This legislation in no way restricts thought or speech .
Both of these are legal activities that should be encouraged by all segments of our society and are welcomed in our system of open debate and dialogue .
Radical thinking is not a crime and this legislation does not turn radical thinking into criminal behavior .
The next article on this topic will consider the full report .
This language and today 's report are no more convincing than the section of the bill on preserving civil rights .
The actual language and evidence used to justify it are the critical concerns .
The report does nothing to change those concerns other than to heighten concerns recalling Queen Gertrude 's line in Hamlet : " The lady doth protest too much , methinks . "
Congressional hearing : " … these are conspiracy theories … " and apparently " extremist belief systems . "
Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) is the chair of the House subcommittee that held hearings on H. R. 1955 ( Full video ) on Nov. 6 , 2007 .
The bill had already passed in the House by a lopsided vote of 404 to 6 on Oct. 23 , 2007 .
The committee met for just over an hour to consider this complex subject .
During the testimony , " think tank " activists portrayed the Internet as a vehicle capable of whipping domestic extremists into a violent frenzy .
Mark Weitzman ( right ) , of the Simon Wiesenthal Center lumped those who question official doctrine on post -2000 foul - ups with " pro-Iraqi " insurgents , a remarkable claim not supported by any evidence .
That 's right , by heavy - handed inference , those who seriously doubt the official explanation of 911 and speak up may be part of the domestic groups guilty of " adopting and promoting and extremist belief system . "
The witness said
Some of these are conspiracy theories that present a closed view of the world , such as blaming 9/11 as an " outside job " or blaming outside groups such as the U.S. government , or er the Jews etc. ; some of these are pro-Iraqi insurgency videos , some of them are media portals that people can enter into , ones that you saw earlier with the flags -- the U.S. flags show that thy were based on U.S. servers ... " ( Video at 1:20 )
Weitzman 's testimony was disorganized and not at all persuasive .
However , by his words , he associated " pro-Iraqi insurgency " with those who question the official story of 911 .
Weitzman then showed slides referencing Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth ( Video at 5:10 ) among slides noting real terrorist groups .
The architects and engineers are professionals who list their names and locations on the Web site referenced above .
The group seeks scientific inquiry and investigation .
The only conflict that they advocate is an open debate on the science of the official 911 story .
Weitzman failed to mention growing public opinion indicating that 45 % of citizens want 911 reinvestigated and that nearly as many , 42 % , doubt the official version explaining the events of 911 .
Political activists with strong stands against the administration and Congress understood what this attack on an activist group might mean to their efforts .
This resulted in immediate outrage on both right and left .
The Senate version of this bill was the subject of a committee hearing chaired by Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) in April .
This barely caused a stir .
But Harman 's maladroit witness created a major controversy in October of this year .
H.R. 1955 authorizes structure to study " homegrown terrorism " and report back to Congress .
Aside from the brief " definitions " and " findings " sections , just a few lines , the bill focuses on creating a commission which will , in turn , establish centers of " excellence " to study the supposed phenomenon .
Reading the title then the timelines for reporting raises a serious question .
If this is such a serious problem , how can Congress wait the 18 months the commission has to make its report ?
The architects and engineers group sent a lengthy demand for an apology to Weitzman , noting the stunning inappropriateness of associating their group with any who advocate violence .
In his reply , Weitzman backed away from any direct accusation but offered no apology .
We know how the game is played , do n't we ?
It 's a very crude but effective form of guilt by association and it works .
Bush did it before the Iraq invasion by mentioning 911 and Saddam Hussein 's name in the same speech over and over .
This caused many to believe Hussein was responsible for 911 and justifying their support for the invasion .
When you 're caught you just say , " I never said that ! "
By that time , the damage is done .
.
Who 's Really Behind " Violent Radicalization ? "
The irony of all this is that those who would fit this definition most clearly , " facilitating violent radicalization , " are the architects of the Iraq war and those in Congress who provide ongoing support through funding .
Here are the inevitable , empirically verified steps to radicalize individuals and groups .
Initiate trade sanctions against a nation resulting in the death of 300,000 or more children .
Then attack that nation because it has weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) , which are never found , thus negating the rationale for war .
Create and implement a policy that shows disregard to for the safety of its people and their national treasures .
Torture and humiliate citizens .
And all the while , prolong the conflict even though the war is responsible for the death of over 1.1 million civilians .
Are n't these the type of actions that would surely " facilitate violent radicalization ? "
Even with all this , there has been no documented " homegrown terrorism " as a result of political posts on the Internet .
However , there can be little doubt that this administration 's war on Iraq is the proximate cause explaining whatever potential exists .
What 's Congress Up To ?
Clearly law enforcement needs to go where criminals congregate and needs to investigate , and make arrests .
With or without this law , domestic and international criminals will continue to use the Internet for their goals and law enforcement will pursue them .
This bill seems more about those who harshly criticize those in power , elected officials .
Viewed from that perspective , there are at least two goals for this legislation :
1 ) Chill domestic free speech by loyal , law abiding individuals or as the authors might have thought : " We 're sick and tired of all these letters and accusations .
Let 's give them something to think about for a change .
Whenever they make these accusations , they 'll have to think about being tagged as a terrorist supporter . "
2 ) Provide a tool to defame those who get too far out of line .
They now have words to use against those Internet " trouble causers " who demand impeachment , say Congress is grossly negligent , call the war a travesty , etc. , or as they might have thought :
We 'll be able to use ' facilitating homegrown terrorism ' to shut down these people whenever we want .
Who wants to even log on to a site that 's associated with helping terrorists ?
All we have to do is make the charge . "
H.R.1955 is an affront to the intelligence of all citizens .
It 's a disgrace to those who conceived it and serious mistake by those who voted for it .
A majority of citizens now know the big lies about the Iraq War .
They 're also smart enough to know nonsense legislation with stealth intentions of a controlling kind , if they ever get to hear the full story .
There is still a last minute chance to stop this in the Senate ( S. 1959 ) .
The Senate " thought crimes " bill may be camouflaged in some other legislation , never debated , and passed before we know it .
But feedback tells the Senate that the public is aware of this latest step to dismantle Constitutional rights in the name of antiterrorism .
The Loyal Opposition
There was opposition to this bill that also constituted a bipartisan coalition .
The following six U.S. Representatives voted no in the face of assured criticism by their opponents in 2008 and no discernible political gain .
Voted " Nay " ( no ) on H. R. 1955
Neil Abercrombie ( D - HI ) , Jerry Costello ( D - IL ) , John Duncan ( R - TN ) ,
Jeff Flake ( R - AZ ) , Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA )
What disturbs me most about this legislation is that it leaves the door wide open for the broadest definition of what constitutes " radicalization . "
Could otherwise nonviolent anti-tax , anti-war , or anti-abortion groups fall under the watchful eye of this new government commission ?
Assurances otherwise in this legislation are unconvincing .
Ron Paul ( R - TX )
“ If you understand what his bill does , it really sets the stage for further criminalization of protest .
This is the way our democracy little , by little , by little , is being stripped away from us . ”
" It probably should have been H.R. 1984 .
Because what they were doing ... is they were trying to criminalize thought ...
Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH )

My mission is to find Matt Drudge , and I ’m failing .
I ’ve e-mailed the author of the Drudge Report countless times and written letters to him at the two places he owns in Miami to say I ’m coming to town and want to talk , but when I check into my hotel there ’s no note from him at the desk .
It ’s late Sunday night , and I turn on his weekly radio show in the room .
Drudge is on his favorite theme , surveillance cameras everywhere , his belief that Google wants to spy on us and pass it all on to the government .
At such times , Drudge comes off as a hunted man .
“ I just do n’t want to be watched when I ’m visiting the Lincoln Memorial , going through Penn Station , or walking down Hollywood Boulevard .
So many cameras everywhere .
And now you start feeding that into some kind of database and start linking it up with a Fascist company like Google ?
This is a serious issue .
And it ’s not given serious consideration — when it is a total transformation of our society and our liberties .
What gives you a right ?
Why are you watching me ?
People say , well , what do you have to hide , Drudge ?
What do you have to hide ?
You know what ?
The burden should be on them .
I think I have a right not to be watched . ”
I call in to the show a few times : 1-866-4-drudge .
Busy .
You can often hear Drudge at his keyboard even as he ’s on air , so I drop him another e-mail with a clever headline like something on the Drudge Report .
Then the next morning I go round to his two addresses .
It ’s breaking my word .
I ’d e-mailed Drudge , “ Not Stalking You ; Coming to Miami , ” because I know how feverish he is about the prying press .
When Lindsay Lohan had her accident in Beverly Hills in May , Drudge said it was caused by violent “ stalkerazzi . ”
He said , “ That ’s probably why she was drunk and higher than a kite … because she has no life and no privacy … they create their villains and then they report on them . ”
Not that this philosophy keeps Drudge from posting paparazzi pictures on the Drudge Report , or milking the Paris Hilton drama .
I ring and knock on two doors : the high - rise condo on the beach where Drudge first moved when he came to Miami in 2001 , then the $ 1.4 million Mediterranean - style stucco house he bought on Rivo Alto Island a couple years later .
There ’s a large , faded American flag hanging from a palisade and two cars in the driveway , but no sign of the Corvette that Drudge listed on old condo records in 2002 , or the black Mustang of more recent vintage .
The fact is , I ’m not even sure where Drudge lives .
A friend says that the 40 - year - old Drudge could n’t deal with the upkeep on the house and moved back to a condo on the beach , and the L.A .
Times says it slipped a note under Drudge ’s door at the Four Seasons tower , the tallest building on the bay .
On his radio show , Drudge tries to throw his pursuers off the scent .
“ I have not missed a day in nearly thirteen years .
They keep saying , ‘ Oh , the secret life of Matt Drudge …’
There is no secret life here .
It is found literally on the Website , because this is all I ’ve been doing . ”
Drudge ’s greatest notoriety , breaking the fact that Newsweek had killed a story on a White House intern ’s involvement with Bill Clinton and then breaking the name Monica Lewinsky a day later , occurred nearly ten years ago .
Back then he was a gossip ; today , notoriety has given way to something else : respect .
This respect derives from the fact that so many journalists , political operatives , financiers — just about anyone in public life — consult his Website , drudgereport .com , several times a day to know what others are talking about .
“ This is America ’s bulletin board , and much more than that , ” NBC ’s Brian Williams said recently .
“ Matt Drudge is just about the most powerful journalist in America , ” said Pat Buchanan .
That power is looming as the country readies for 2008 .
Drudge ’s status was underscored in the book The Way to Win : Taking the White House in 2008 , in which the authors Mark Halperin ( of Time ) and John Harris ( now editor in chief of Politico , formerly of the Washington Post ) said that Drudge was the “ Walter Cronkite of his era , ” in terms of his ability to steer the public agenda at a time when the “ freak show ” moments of a candidate ’s behavior or past can play such a large role in the political process .
That process has , of course , largely hurt Democrats .
“ He is the center of personality - obsessed , attack - based politics .
That is the content Drudge looks for , ” Glenn Greenwald says .
“ He ’s a right - wing hack . ”
Greenwald is a leader among the phalanx of left - wing Internet groups and voices , from Salon to Media Matters to Talking Points Memo , that is taking Drudge on as the snake in the Eden of American democracy , the guy who gets the media to take seriously trivial or scurrilous gossip , like John Edwards ’s $ 400 haircut , or the Swift Boat Veterans ’ attack on John Kerry three years ago .
The Drudge Report is an institution , the seventh - most - visited news Website , ahead of the New York Times , Fox News , and the Washington Post .
Getting linked on Drudge can unleash a tsunami of public mentions and e-mails , and journalists cater to Drudge to gain those links , alerting him when their stories have nasty anecdotes .
Drudge laughs that journalists “ kiss the ring . ”
Glenn Reynolds , the conservative Tennessee law professor famous as Instapundit , compares Drudge to Johnny Carson : “ How does a comic really make it big ?
He goes on The Tonight Show . ”
Greenwald echoes , “ A link from Matt Drudge is in a completely different universe in terms of the traffic it generates than any other link . ”
When Greenwald argues that Politico should not have reported on John Edwards ’s $ 400 haircut rather than alerting Drudge , it is n’t just an argument over news judgment , it reflects an ideological struggle over what role shadowy Drudge will play in the life of American journalism .
The left calls Drudge a right - winger , but Drudge calls himself an anti-government libertarian .
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul ’s positions are “ true to my heart … But I look at him and say , ‘ The guy ca n’t lead . ’ ”
But Drudge ’s political philosophy is more mysterious than that , given that , currently , the one person Drudge seems to believe can lead is Hillary Clinton .
Though Drudge often savages
Hillary , he is convinced that she will make history , and he seems determined , in spite of himself , to empower her .
HILLARY ON SURGE ?
“ IT ’S WORKING ” was a recent lead headline .
The Clinton scandals of yesteryear bore him , Drudge has said .
Right - wing fans have begun to complain about the pattern , calling him “ Hillary - obsessed . ”
What an irony that the gossip who almost destroyed Bill Clinton ’s presidency might propel his wife to the Oval Office .
“ That House is going pink , ” says Drudge .
Who is the man behind the Website ?
The more power Drudge has attained , the more reclusive he has become .
Drudge seems to despise his own fame with a Kurt Cobain–like intensity .
On radio he speaks of himself as a nobody and has referred to his fans as “ psychic vampires . ”
He has utterly compartmentalized his life , separating the personal and the public .
Acquaintances describe very brief , formal encounters , and even friends of Drudge ’s , if there is such a category , generally communicate with him by IM .
He ’s said by some to be gay , but he has thrown water on these speculations .
Those who know him guard his privacy .
Andrew Breitbart , a conservative writer living in Brentwood , California , who Drudge says is his only employee — “ Andrew does the afternoon shift ” — e- mailed me that “ I have n’t talked to him in over a year , ” then declined to talk .
“ Everything I ’ve said about Drudge is on lexis / nexis , ” e-mails Lucianne Goldberg .
Another of Drudge ’s power mamas , Camille Paglia , also sends her regrets .
“ In regard to my friendship with Matt , I think that anyone who provides private details to a journalist about a public figure is not a true friend .
I would certainly expect the same loyalty and discretion from my friends . ”
Ann Coulter does n’t respond .
John Fund says he ’ll call back and does n’t .
When Drudge turns on someone , that someone becomes a nonperson .
The one person who spoke of this process to me was the conservative California writer David Horowitz .
Horowitz had learned of Drudge back in the Clinton - hating days and got hooked .
The two became friends ; Horowitz still feels indebted to Drudge for helping to clear his reputation when Time magazine insulted him .
Then when Sidney Blumenthal sued Drudge , Horowitz ran to Drudge ’s side and helped get him a lawyer , Manny Klausner , and then set up a fund to help him .
He said he raised about $ 50,000 .
At that time , though , something Horowitz did ticked Drudge off , and his link vanished from the site .
Horowitz says in an agonized tone , “ He ’s never communicated to me , but I gather what happened is I did a fund - raising letter based on his case and he thought I was exploiting him .
I sent a letter without Matt ’s approval .
I regret not taking enough care to talk to him about it , but I was defending him .
I would apologize to him , but I get silence . ”
Drudge ’s radio persona is n’t very personal .
About all he ever let listeners know during the months I listened was that he used to sleep a lot until the Internet changed his life .
The old Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard was an icon of his youth .
He ’d been in Jerusalem , and Buenos Aires , and on a German train he wept listening to Kelly Clarkson ’s new record .
He has no cell phone but he does have a BlackBerry .
He hates taxes more than anything that the government does .
“ Give it back to the people you stole it from . ”
Lower taxes were a prime factor in Drudge ’s flight to Florida from California in 2001 .
Surveillance was another factor .
A photographer took pictures of him through his apartment window in Hollywood .
“ People are basically exhibitionists and voyeurs ; they ’re happy to be watched , ” he says scornfully .
Back when she was talking about him , Goldberg said that Drudge has so many personas , no one knew who the real Drudge was .
Acquaintances say that the brilliantly snide Drudge on radio is a character .
( “ You horny toad !
You horny toad , let me have some of your Viagra now , ” Drudge spat after Mike Wallace crossed the privacy line , in his view , by asking whether the Romneys had had premarital sex . )
Says one Drudge watcher , “ His demeanor off the air could not be more different than what it is on the radio , and explains why the Susan Estriches and Donna Braziles and Arianna Huffingtons all like him .
There ’s a profound sweetness to him ; he ’s got a delicate nature that allows him to win over the enemy when he ’s in the room with them . ”
Donna Brazile describes her first meeting with the Webmaster : “ What I remember is the graciousness of a Southern gentleman in him .
He gave me his card just like a good gossip writer would and he said , ‘ Keep in touch if you ever need something . ’
And I said , ‘ Yup , if I ever need something I ’m going to get in touch . ’ ”
Vulnerable , gracious Drudge has soft dark eyes and a quiet manner that seems to bring out a maternal quality in certain powerful women .
“ There is a very wounded - bird quality about this guy , ” says Doug Harbrecht , new - media editorial director at Kiplinger , who introduced Drudge to the National Press Club at his historic speech in 1998 , back when recognition from the mainstream media seemed important to him .
These days Drudge leads a life way outside all the Beltways .
“ He ’s tanned and buff , ” says a Drudge watcher .
“ He ’s in the best physical shape of his life .
And traveling at will .
I think he leads the perfect life . ”
But is he happy ?
This summer , Drudge choked up on his radio show reading a long passage from The Sheltering Sky .
“ How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood , an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you ca n’t even conceive of your life without it … ”
Its author , the late Paul Bowles , is someone Drudge would seem to emulate in his hatred of elites and complex sexuality .
In his own life , Drudge maintains ironbound privacy , but his Website has grown by seizing on incidental , personal actions of public figures and blowing them up , at times viciously .
In 2000 , he helped defeat Al Gore by turning up the volume on such stories as Al Gore ’s fund - raising appearance at a Buddhist temple .
In 2004 , he did more than anyone to upend Kerry by playing up a small ad buy by the Swift Boat Veterans .
In this campaign season , he has made a virus of the John Edwards $ 400 haircut .
At times he has served Hillary .
In April , he posted the exclusive that Hillary won the first - quarter fund - raising battle in a “ blowout with $ 36 million . ”
Insiders say the Clinton campaign leaked the figure to spin perceptions , because most of Hillary ’s contributions could n’t be spent until the general election .
“ The Hillary campaign leaks their numbers on Drudge because there is no follow - up question , ” says one former Democratic operative .
Outsider stylings aside , Drudge is now part of the establishment .
In their book , Halperin and Harris speculate that the New York Times has an unofficial policy of getting important stories to Drudge in advance of their publication on the Net.
A Times official denies this .
“ There is an implication that we somehow cooperate with Drudge to give him tips on our stories .
I want to be clear that that is not the case .
Drudge may receive information on the advance news schedules that go out to subscribers of our wire service , ” says Catherine J. Mathis , a Times spokesperson .
Possibly he gets his frequent Times exclusives ( often attributed to “ newsroom sources ” ) off the wire .
But Drudge would seem to have a symbiotic relationship with the paper he calls the “ Old Gray Lady ” and whose politics he says he despises .
Drudge says he does n’t read the L.A. Times or the Washington Post , but he calls the Times “ very influential . ”
The Times advertises on his site .
That reflects the fact that the two publications are going after the same audience : American leaders .
Drudge ’s own influence stems from the fact that he loves news , in a way that great newspeople do , and his news sensibility is extremely sophisticated .
When he was a kid , he figured out that though thousands of people get murdered , only a few murders are news .
One role model seems to be Rupert Murdoch , whom he praises for understanding that newspapers have to be fun .
“ [ Murdoch ] brings [ news ] alive .
It ’s not dull , ” Drudge says , his voice thrilling .
Paglia invokes an earlier idol , Andy Warhol .
“ He has extraordinary intuition , imagination , and improvisational energy .
He is a highly creative performance artist who has invented his own genre — which no one has been able to imitate or reproduce …
The Drudge Report is a kind of existentialist high - wire act . ”
Drudge enjoys the changing fashions in news , the plot shifts that he has a hand in engineering .
As he ’s entered middle age , something noir and futuristic has entered his sensibility , more Philip K. Dick ( on his show , he often invokes Blade Runner ) than Walter Winchell .
The site is obsessed with global warming , with the dangers of cell phones and cloning , with all manner of tabloid horrors .
He ’s a storyteller , and the stories are dark .
Matthew Nathan Drudge was born in 1966 and raised in suburban Washington , the only child of two liberal - Democrat parents who both worked for the federal government .
The parents separated when Drudge was 6 , and his father moved in with another woman and her kids before long .
Drudge ’s own version of his past is spotty .
He says that he “ failed bar mitzvah ” and barely graduated from high school in 1984 .
He told Playboy he was “ suspended a few times ” for such infractions as “ cheating … on tests . ”
The divorce and child - support papers in the Maryland State Archives offer a heartrending picture .
About the time Drudge failed bar mitzvah , his mother left her job as a staff attorney for Ted Kennedy , where she had worked on health issues , “ because of sickness ” and remained unemployed for at least two years .
The Washington Post ’s Howard Kurtz has reported that she was hospitalized for schizophrenia .
It appears that Drudge got his star power from his mom .
He has proudly described his mother as a pioneering lawyer .
She drove a Datsun 280Z .
She went by several first names and changed her last name from Kudish to Drudge to Star — the last apparently her invention .
“ He is a highly creative performance artist who has invented his own genre , ” says Camille Paglia .
“ The Drudge Report is a kind of existentialist high - wire act . ”
When Drudge was 15 , crisis rocked the family .
His mother was hospitalized , and a few weeks later Drudge was arrested .
“ Juvenile court told me that he was arrested on June 18 for making annoying phone calls , ” his father testified in a hearing on child support .
“ He ’s got a problem of making annoying phone calls to a girl , ” Drudge ’s mother testified .
After the arrest , Drudge went to live with his father on a farm on the eastern shore of Maryland and go to school there .
Robert Drudge was a therapist and social worker , but the boy was evidently too much for him , and Matt was n’t cut out for the sticks — he liked to hang out at video arcades with a Walkman , listening to tapes .
Robert Drudge sent Matt back to Washington .
Drudge ’s mother said his father “ resents ” the boy , and told this story in a diva ’s style that her son would admire : “ Robert Drudge rejected his natural son , Matthew , and returned him to my home , knowing that I am under doctor ’s care and unemployed .
His reason for returning Matthew to me after three weeks was that ‘ his wife comes first , her two boys come second , and Matthew comes third ’ ; that he did not want to assume any responsibility for him as his father because he has a new family ; and that he hopes everything turns out all right .
Robert Drudge has not communicated with his son or me since that time . ”
Young Drudge was placed in psychiatric treatment with Jewish Social Services .
It was recommended that the boy be sent to a boarding school , “ and if not the last choice will be a foster home . ”
( The court papers do n’t say whether this came to pass . )
Drudge must have been an uncomfortable kid .
He lost his books , he lost his glasses .
His mother said he had “ special education ” needs .
One friend says that Drudge started wearing the famous hat in high school to deal with premature hair loss .
“ This is an incredibly lonely kid .
He does n’t have a sister , his mother is in and out of hospitals , the father was beside himself .
In high school they treated him like shit .
He was starting to lose his hair in high school ; think what that does to a kid .
I find it so appealing when someone has nothing and gets somewhere . ”
Robert Drudge has said his son’s case proves that the schools are unequipped to deal with difficult talents .
The boy ’s genius winked out even then .
On his paper route , Drudge tore apart the Washington Star to see which stories and angles the editors had misplayed .
In his high - school yearbook ( unearthed by the Washington City Paper ) , he wrote , “ To everyone else who has helped and hindred [ sic ] me whether it be Staff or students , I leave a penny for each day I ’ve been here and cried here .
A penny rich in worthless memories . ”
Drudge ’s father ultimately changed his life .
After high school , the boy tried New York and Europe , then drifted to his father ’s hometown , Los Angeles , where he worked for years in the gift shop at CBS studios .
Worried about his son ’s aimlessness , Bob Drudge insisted on buying him a Packard - Bell computer in 1994 .
The Drudge Report began as an e-mail sent out to a few friends .
Drudge ’s interests were studio gossip , often plucked from trash cans at CBS , and right - wing politics .
Drudge has said that he first glimpsed the Internet ’s power when a police sketch of a rough - looking man seen near Vince Foster ’s body went flying around the Net.
Chris Ruddy , the reporter who worked that story for the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review ( he ’s now editor of Newsmax ) , says Drudge ’s e-mail list gave his work “ a national footprint , ” and when Ruddy came to L.A. , he got Drudge together with their shared icon , George Putnam , a conservative whose radio talk show in L.A.
Drudge often called in to as “ Matt from Hollywood . ”
Ruddy says , “ We went to an Italian restaurant in Burbank , and … Matt Drudge shows up with his hat , expounding on his views about the Clintons and the world .
I think George was a little thrown .
Someone he ’d never heard of in the media world had such strong views and tremendous vision .
I think Matt was gloating at that time that his e-mail list was 300,000 .
He said , ‘ Some time I ’m going to have a million , more than the Washington Post . ’ ”
Many in the vast right - wing conspiracy were thrown by Drudge ’s hybrid sensibility , including his obsession with Hollywood gossip and box office .
Hollywood scoops — including his report that Jerry Seinfeld was seeking $ 1 million an episode — got Drudge hired , first by Wired online in 1996 and later by America Online , which was paying him $ 3,000 a month as a “ runaway Internet gossip ” when he published , and quickly retracted , a rumor that Sidney Blumenthal had abused his wife .
The rumor was clearly false , but the lawsuit , which was ultimately settled , exalted Drudge .
For it appeared to have the backing of the Clinton White House , wanting to silence an enemy .
And Blumenthal ’s allegations of fact in the suit only played to the Webmaster ’s populist image :
“ 92 . Defendant Drudge never attended college .
“ 93 .
Prior to the time when defendant Drudge began to work full - time writing and publishing the Drudge Report , defendant Drudge ’s full - time job was as the manager of a gift - shop . ”
That was just a first act .
On January 18 , 1998 , barricaded in his Hollywood apartment with an entirely accurate sense of the historic moment , Drudge filed a breathless report claiming that Newsweek had , that week , held a story reporting that Bill Clinton had had a sexual affair with a 23 - year - old White House intern .
Today Drudge likes to distance himself from sexual gossip .
When former Florida congressman Mark Foley got busted for his sexual advances toward interns last year , Drudge empathized with Foley , describing the kids who flirted with him in e-mails and then turned the documents over as “ beasts . ”
On his radio show he claimed to be outraged , on invasion - of - privacy grounds , when Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes asked Mitt Romney whether he and his wife had had premarital sex .
“ We ’re in a new era of journalism , ” he said on his radio show .
“ I think it ’s a 60 Minutes first .
CBS News , the Tiffany network , Murrow , the crown jewel , Cronkite — they ’re going in and talking about a candidate ’s sex life , and no one ’s even getting impeached . ”
Drudge then speculated that reporters would ask Hillary when she had last had sex with her husband .
“ And who ’s going to ask her the L - word ? …
It ’s going to be a long , dirty campaign . ”
Drudge often has trouble stepping away from his own dirty streak .
In 2004 , he published a false and damaging rumor that John Kerry had had an affair with an aide .
Lately he suggested that Lance Armstrong may have left Sheryl Crow because she did n’t wipe enough ( Crow has called for limiting toilet - paper consumption on environmental grounds ) .
He has urged people to retaliate against Google Earth ’s invasions by photographing the “ Google geeks ” when they are having “ bowel movements . ”
Scatological imagery is a weakness for him .
Taking the side of former Bill Clinton secretary Betty Currie , he said , “ the highest ranking African - American in the Clinton administration .
Who cleaned the sink and picked up the panties .
Disgraceful . ”
Drudge was expressing sympathy for someone demeaned by a powerful male .
His mother has a creative , fiery nature , and many of his idols are women , from Mother Nature to the Old Gray Lady to Janis Joplin .
Enthused by Hillary ’s performance in a May debate , he called her “ butch ” several times .
“ She ’s on the fast track for this nomination , I can tell you , ” he said .
“ She butched it up , she butched it up ! ”
Today his muse in the political - philosophical realm is the ferocious , glamorous Camille Paglia .
“ She ’s one of the hippest people I ’ve come across … She goes for the deep stuff beyond the fast food . ”
During the Clinton days it was gravelly - voiced Lucianne Goldberg .
Drudge dedicated his 2000 autobiography Drudge Manifesto to Linda Tripp ( notwithstanding the fact that “ I have never met or spoken to Matt Drudge , ” Tripp says ) .
That book was co-written with another muse , brilliant , angry , gender - bending , Jewish lefty flameout Julia Phillips .
“ She got his head screwed on straight , ” says a Drudge friend .
The late producer and author of You ’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again , Phillips came to Hollywood as an insider and ultimately cratered .
“ As smart as she was , and she was really smart , ” says Bernie Weinraub , the playwright and former Times correspondent , “ she was also very angry .
She was angry at Hollywood , she was angry at the people of her generation , cynical about them .
I think she liked Matt Drudge ’s rebelliousness and his sense of anarchy .
She was brilliant and funny , and she was always conspiratorial .
She saw the hand of conspiracy . ”
Says her close friend Roz Heller : “ She was wildly entertaining , wildly smart , talented .
But also mean - spirited .
She identified with Drudge as an outsider and a rebel . ”
Like Drudge , Phillips had a complicated sexual persona .
Heller says she was n’t gay , but she affected a butch look and was drawn to lesbian clubs and careerists as emblems of female power in a male - dominated world .
When Phillips died , Drudge praised her for her love of youth culture and music .
Amid her snarls about privacy , Paglia offers the morsel that Drudge is “ deeply knowledgeable ” about dance music .
Phillips fashioned a public persona for Drudge in Drudge Manifesto , which states triumphantly that “ technology has finally caught up with liberated individuals . ”
Drudge comes off as a literary character in the book , an anomic Walter Winchell .
His only friend is a stray cat called Cat .
He talks news values with Cat and the ghost of William Paley , who tells him to go through the garbage cans at CBS for ratings figures .
Phillips and Drudge ’s greatest collaboration was the speech he gave at the National Press Club in June of 1998 .
Doug Harbrecht , then–press - club president , invited Drudge over the objections of many members who wondered how he could invite Drudge “ into the sanctum sanctorum of American journalism . ”
It was a staggering speech .
Drudge was both revolutionary Tom Paine and dreamy populist .
“ I used to walk these streets as an aimless teen , young adult .
Walk by ABC News over on DeSales .
Daydream .
Stare up at the Washington Post newsroom over on 15th Street , look up longingly , knowing I ’d never get in .
Did n’t go to the right schools .
Never enjoyed any school , as a matter of fact .
Did n’t come from a well - known family — nor was I even remotely connected to a powerful publishing dynasty …
I would never be granted any access , obtain any credentials …
There was n’t a likelihood for upward mobility in my swing - shift position at 7 - 11 . ”
The best line in that speech was Drudge ’s statement that “ It ’s more fun to talk about Godzilla than watch it . ”
He was introducing the reporters to the new hierarchies of the information age , when events , from Putin to Godzilla , would collapse into so much spectacle for a surfer on the Net.
Seriousness does n’t interest Drudge ; phenomena do .
As he wrote in his book , “ Politics is as Important as Hollywood .
Is as Important as Science . ”
Drudge flattens all hard news into collage , and it is this , more than anything , that angers the old guard .
“ I need Hillary Clinton , ” Matt Drudge said on his show .
“ You do n’t get it .
I need to be part of her world .
That ’s my bank . ”
And then there ’s the issue of his ideology .
The left hates Drudge for good reason ; he has helped kill one Democratic presidential aspirant after another and has started in on John Edwards this season .
But as Halperin and Harris note , Drudge only gained his power because liberals so dominated traditional media that they disdained the Internet .
Now that he ’s opened the territory , the left is doing pretty well itself .
“ There ’s a pretty healthy group of left - wing sites online , which tends to balance things , no doubt , ” says Donna Brazile .
“ But Matt is in a class by himself . ”
At times Drudge does sound like a conservative .
He hates big government , immigration , and abortion rights .
When Jimmy Carter criticized George Bush in the foreign press , Drudge questioned his loyalty .
But Drudge ’s ideological heart is libertarian , and many of his anti-corporate riffs would stir a left - wing anarchist .
Drudge has been highly critical of partnerships between Google and state governments , and he fears corporations .
He believes that people in surgery have had chips implanted without their knowledge , that the day will come when the government will “ dart ” a chip into you without your permission , and that DNA will be collected from spit on the street , “ and then they can impose any rule , even against smiling . ”
Republicans can’t count on Drudge .
He praises Rosie O’Donnell and Michael Moore for their independence and fight , and seems to despise Giuliani and McCain .
“ Breitbart is an intellectual , dyed - in - the - wool conservative , and educated .
Matt is not a book reader .
I think he probably struggles to make right - wing noises , ” says one Republican .
Drudge was a registered Republican in California , according to state records .
He then registered as “ no party affiliation ” in Florida .
But he does n’t vote .
The Los Angeles County Registrar says Drudge did n’t vote in 2000 while registered in L.A. Florida ’s Division of Elections says he did n’t vote in 2004 or ’06 while registered in Florida .
Those were big elections ; some people would have given eye teeth to cast a vote in Florida in 2004 .
On the radio , he ’s answered the left ’s critique .
“ The problem is , when half of my links already go left , that kind of dissolves their intellectual argument that they are needed .
Because I ’m already sitting here providing both sides of it . ”
Well , not really .
The Drudge Report has clear tilts .
His audience is decidedly right - wing .
According to the online advertising company linked to his site , the audience is 78 percent male , 60 percent Republican , only 8 percent Democratic .
“ Yes , he is right of center , but he is an equal - opportunity zinger , he will zing Republicans as well as Democrats , ” says Donna Brazile .
Her left - wing friends do n’t like to hear it , but she ’s given info to Drudge herself .
“ No one in politics has clean hands .
I do n’t have clean hands .
There ’s no question that everyone has called on Matt at some time to use the power of the Internet . ”
Apparently , even Hillary ’s campaign .
Drudge has a sneaker for the woman he calls “ the Senatress . ”
When Clinton started wheezing and coughing in a speech in New Orleans in May , Drudge expressed genuine concern for her .
“ Hillary , dear , take care of yourself .
We need you .
I need you personally …
Take a few days off , what ’s this frenetic pace ? ”
He added admiringly , “ She was professional .
She kept going .
She finished the speech . ”
After a left - wing listener IM ’d Drudge to say he wanted Hillary to drop dead onstage , Drudge said , “ I need Hillary Clinton .
You do n’t get it .
I need to be part of her world .
That ’s my bank .
Like Leo DiCaprio has the environment and Al Gore has the environment and Jimmy Carter has anti-Americanism … I have Hillary . ”
In the latest turn in his noir screenplay , she ’s the tough blonde .
Although he still throws insults her way .
Wowed by “ cold , chic ” French presidential candidate Ségolène Royal , Drudge said last spring that Hillary was so lacking in glamour she was n’t fit to hem Royal ’s pantsuit .
He called her “ big - boned , ” “ obese , ” and “ an out - of - shape middle - aged cow , ” then compared her rear - end shots to the derrière of Royal , “ who has birthed four children . ”
That was all in the moment .
A few weeks later , Drudge complimented Hillary on her new look , said she had taken his advice to hit the treadmill , and Donatella Versace ’s advice to lose the pantsuit .
“ What ’s wrong with a makeover , we ’re in a makeover society , ” he said .
Having once issued descriptions of Bill Clinton ’s penis on some pretext , Drudge ca n’t wait for Hillary to be president .
“ I ’m on the record that Hillary Clinton , she ’s already in . ”
There ’s a paranoid frisson to that fantasy .
On his radio show , Drudge has imagined the day that cameras will record image and audio on every street so that President Hillary can listen to conversations he had , even years later .
What if things take a dark turn , he says .
There ’s martial law .
Hillary ’s voice will go out to the people from bullhorns .
His words will be fed into a national database , and his opposition to global warming will make him a terrorist .
He will be arrested and a chip darted into his skin .
The government will meddle in our bodies .
“ Why do n’t they get this over with and start coming door to door and collecting our body liquids , ” he grumbled not long ago .
David Sheff of Playboy remembers the moment in a long interview with Drudge when tough questions about Drudge ’s sources on the right caused the Webmaster to become very emotional and defensive and get out of his seat .
“ Literally he stood up and grabbed his famous hat .
I wondered where it was coming from .
It did n’t seem provoked or consistent with the rest of the interview .
And I do n’t think that has emerged since then .
There ’s a lot more control if he ’s behind the curtain in the darkened room with all his sources and his e-mail . ”
Sheff ’s metaphor touches on the left ’s assertion that Drudge is gay and closeted .
In high school , Drudge was already in a gay scene , dating men , Jeannette Walls reported in Dish .
And in his memoir , Blinded by the Right , conservative - turned - liberal David Brock , who is gay , described Drudge coming on to him sexually in 1997 , including e-mailing Brock the suggestion that they be “ fuck buddies . ”
Michaelangelo Signorile , a journalist who has broken down many a closet door , calls Drudge “ a nasty faggot . ”
Drudge has denied that he is gay .
“ I go to straight bars , I go to gay bars , ” he told the Miami New Times .
The only thing you can say for sure is that Drudge has tried out many personas .
In a sense his journalistic achievement springs from these ambiguities .
Drudge upset the Establishment by mixing a very patriarchal and traditional idea of news ( Winchell / Cronkite ) with a feminine one ( box office and gossip ) .
The mistake his enemies have repeatedly made is reducing him and underestimating him .
On my visit to Miami , a neighbor said something interesting about Drudge ’s house .
The vibe had changed there recently .
The pool was on at a different time , at night , and she ’d heard Spanish voices in the dark .
Drudge might not speak Spanish , but he sure tried .
In his book , he used Spanish words .
He fulsomely praised European media values , while putting down the United States as tacky and superficial .
He knew the international club scene .
He ’d been in Buenos Aires , Germany , Israel , England .
When Argentina ’s First Lady announced for the presidency , Drudge headlined the story MOVETE HILLARY .
( “ Get out of the way , Hillary , ” though he misspelled the Spanish . )
In his high - school yearbook , his favorite color was “ Caribbean blue . ”
On radio , he pronounced the Mediterranean island playground Ibiza super - correctly , “ Ibitha , ” and did the same with Peru ( “ Pay - ru ” ) .
I wondered whether Drudge had a foreign lover .
More likely it was an escape fantasy .
One night , speaking of his fears of the coming crackdown , Drudge said , “ I ’m personally looking for a plan - B offshore that Hillary wo n’t have any kind of Interpol connections . ”
What a grim story line about America he was playing out : the candidates getting ugly with one another , the Google vampires surveilling , a hurricane bearing down , and Hillary at center stage , monitoring our thoughts .
Anyone else would shut their eyes .
Drudge could n’t wait to see what happened next .
The Philippines government has approved an Australian company 's plan to absorb excess CO2 by dumping massive amounts of urea in the Sulu Sea .
Environmental activists say the dumping is a potentially risky , scientifically unsound gamble that underscores the dangerous absence of international geoengineering regulations .
Like iron seeding , urea dumping is supposed to nourish blooms of greenhouse gas - gobbling plankton .
But iron seeding is controversial , with some scientists saying it might produce even more CO2 – and compared to urea dumping , iron seeding is well understood .
According to a statement issued by the Ottawa - based ETC Group , UK - based
Corporate Watch , Malaysia - based Third World Network and the
Philippines ' SEARICE ,
Urea and nitrogen fertilizer pollution caused by agricultural run-off has been linked to the creation of toxic algal blooms in the scientific literature , and raises the possibility of dead zones from oxygen depletion .
The groups called for regulators currently meeting to discuss the
London Convention to evaluate urea dumping as well as iron seeding .
The
Convention , enacted by the International Maritime Organization in 1972 , prohibits oceanic waste dumping – but while simply pouring urea into the sea would be illegal , doing so to absorb carbon dioxide is permitted , or at least not forbidden .
That regulatory loophole is symbolic of the general absence of international guidelines for large - scale climate modification projects , both at sea and on land ; and Sulu Sea urea dumping , proposed by the
Ocean Nourishment Corporation and planned in the future for Malaysia ,
Chile and the United Arab Emirates , is symbolic of projects that are only going to become more common as climate change and entrepreneurship collide .
I 've written a lot about geoengineering on WiSci , so check those posts out to learn more about the issues .
The bottom line :
geoengineering could work , and if the worst - case climate scenarios become more probable , we might need it .
But there are enough question marks and potential problems to demand that humanity do it as wisely as possible .

It took the jury in Capitol Records v. Thomas only five minutes to conclude 30 - year - old Jammie Thomas infringed recording industry copyrights on 24 music tracks , according to the first juror to speak out on the verdict .
The remaining five hours of deliberation was spent debating the appropriate financial penalty , with jurors haggling for both higher and lower awards , before settling last week on the final $ 222,000 figure , according to juror Michael Hegg , in an exclusive interview with THREAT LEVEL Tuesday .
At least two jurors , one of them a funeral home owner , wanted to award the Recording Industry Association of America the maximum $ 150,000 for each of the 24 copyright violations , while one juror held out hours for the $ 750 minimum for each violation of the Copyright Act , he said .
In the end , " after bickering , " they settled on $ 9,250 for each song .
" That is a compromise , yes , " said Hegg , a 38 - year - old steelworker from Duluth , Minnesota .
" We wanted to send a message that you do n't do this , that you have been warned . "
During a 45 - minute telephone interview , Hegg said jurors found that Thomas ' defense – that she was the victim of a spoof – was unbelievable .
" She should have settled out of court for a few thousand dollars , " Hegg said .
" Spoofing ?
We 're thinking , ' Oh my God , you got to be kidding . ' "
" She 's a liar , " added Hegg , who just returned home following his 14 - hour night shift .
Thomas is among 20,000 people the RIAA has sued , and was the first to go to trial .
Thomas and her attorney have announced they 're appealing the verdict , in part to contest a jury instruction that said Thomas could be found liable solely for sharing the music over the Kazaa file - sharing network , " regardless of whether actual distribution has been shown . "
But Hegg said the jury in U.S. District Court in Duluth would have found her liable even if the plaintiffs had been required to establish that Kazaa users had actually downloaded the music .
" It would have been a lot harder to make the decision , " he said .
" Yes , we would have reached the same result . "
He said the RIAA established that Kazaa existed for the sole purpose of file sharing .
Also , a screen shot repeatedly displayed to jurors during the three - day case showed that more than 2 million people were on Kazaa sharing hundreds of millions of songs on Feb. 21 , 2005 , the night RIAA investigators from Safenet locked on to Thomas ' share folder .
Hegg added that the jury believed Thomas ' liability was magnified because she turned over to RIAA investigators a different hard drive than the one used to share music .
" She lied , " he said .
" There was no defense .
Her defense sucked . "
Hegg , a married father of two who said he formerly raced snowmobiles , said he has never been on the internet .
He said his wife is an administrator at a local hospital and an " internet guru . "
The jury , he said , was convinced that Thomas was a pirate after hearing evidence that the Kazaa account RIAA investigators were monitoring matched Thomas ' internet protocol and modem addresses .
Expert testimony from an RIAA witness also showed that a wireless router was not used , casting doubt on her defense that a hacker lurking outside her apartment window with a laptop might have framed her , he said .
Hegg pointed out that Thomas ' Kazaa account username was " Tereastarr " – the same username Thomas chose for her e-mail , online shopping , online dating and MySpace accounts .
" I think she thought a jury from Duluth would be naïve .
We 're not that stupid up here , " he said .
" I do n't know what the fuck she was thinking , to tell you the truth . "

Could humanity 's observation of dark energy have shortened the life span of the universe ?
The answer is " yes " according to the author of a new scientific paper that has recently come to light .
Featured in the latest edition of New Scientist magazine , the subscriber - only story , " Has observing the universe hastened its end ? " , discusses the paper and its claims .
Now , before I go further , I must point out that this work has not yet appeared in any peer - reviewed journal .
It has been submitted to Physical Review Letters , and a pre-print can be found on arXiv.org .
Had Prof.
Lawrence Krauss not been one of the authors , I would have completely written it off .
Early on in the New Scientist article , Prof .
Krauss states that " incredible as it seems , our detection of the dark energy may have reduced the life expectancy of the universe . "
Incredible indeed — let 's examine how he and his colleague , James Dent , came to this conclusion .
Their official paper , titled " The Late Time Behavior of False Vacuum Decay : Possible Implications for Cosmology and Metastable Inflating States , " is far from grandiose .
It extends a body of work initiated in the 1950's by Soviet physicist L. A. Khalfin .
Khalfin determined that the long time behavior of a metastable quantum state is not described by the traditional exponential decay , but rather by a power - law type decay .
That determination is accurate , but has remained obscure because nearly all experimental systems will have decayed long before this transition becomes significant .
Krauss and Dent attempt to extend this idea from traditional quantum mechanics to quantum field theory , and look at its implications for cosmology .
To understand the potential implications of the calculations in the paper , one must start at the beginning — the Big Bang , and even before .
It is currently believed that the universe blinked into existence somewhere around 13.7 billion years ago .
This event — the Big Bang — is theorized to have been precipitated when a " bubble of weird high - energy ' false vacuum ' with repulsive gravity decayed into a zero- energy ' ordinary ' vacuum . "
The energy released during this transition would have created intense heat , and all the matter we see in the universe .
This idea was challenged in the late 1990's by the discovery of dark energy .
Dark energy , coupled with the fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating , suggests that the Big Bang did not produce a zero-energy vacuum , but another metastable false vacuum .
Using the analogy of a decaying radioactive atom where shifts in energy states occur at random , Professor Krauss says that " it is entirely possible [ the energy state of the universe ] could decay again , wiping the slate of our universe clean . "
In a nutshell , this would mean that we , and everything we know , would cease to exist .
How does this relate to the work in the research article ?
If the current false vacuum state that our universe exists in survives past a a certain point — the point where the decay switches from exponential to power - law — then it should become eternal .
This is explained by the assumption that the false vacuum state will grow at an exponential rate for all time .
If its decay suddenly becomes slower — as in the power law decay regime — then the false vacuum will grow faster than it could possibly decay and would never be destroyed .
According to calculations contained in the paper , the closer the false vacuum energy is to zero , the less time that will need to elapse before the decay rate switches from fast ( exponential ) to slow ( power law ) .
Given the fact that , in our universe , the vacuum energy is just above zero ( 0.01 eV ) , we could be well past the point at where the universe has switched from the fast decay to slow decay — although without an estimate of the current decay rate , this can not be known for sure .
However , since this is a quantum issue at its core , Krauss points out that measurements can affect the outcome of the system .
He suggests that our measurements of supernovae in 1998 , which detected the existence of dark energy , may have reset the false vacuum 's decay clock to zero , switching it back to the fast decay regime , and greatly decreasing the universe 's chance of surviving .
" In short , we may have snatched away the possibility of long - term survival for our universe and made it more likely it will decay , " says Krauss .
How could something like this possibly happen ?
In quantum mechanics , there is an effect known as the quantum Zeno effect — an oddity of the quantum world that suggests a system can be kept in an excited state simply by repeated measurements .
This can be described using a quantum system initially in state ' A ' .
After time begins , the system wants to decay to state ' B ' but , before it reaches state ' B ' , it will exist as a superposition of states ' A ' and ' B ' .
If one measures the system shortly after it begins , it would have a high probability of collapsing entirely to state ' A ' again , essentially resetting the system 's internal quantum clock .
Krauss is suggesting that , by observing the dark energy , we reset the internal quantum clock of the false vacuum universe , and that may have caused it to return to a point before it has switched from the fast decay to the slow decay — in the process greatly reducing the universe 's ultimate chance of survival .
Now , as I said at the beginning , the work has yet to be published in a peer - reviewed journal .
While the work in the paper seems sound to me — although I am admittedly far , far from an expert in this field — it barely touches on the larger picture that the New Scientist article focuses on .
In fact , the only mention of the possibility of disrupting our universe 's lifetime is written in the second to last sentence in the research article , where the authors state , " Have we ensured , by measuring the existence of dark energy in our own universe , that the quantum mechanical configuration of our own universe is such that late time decay is not relevant ? "
There are problems that need to be addressed in the research paper before this work can be extend to the real world ( or universe ) .
The most obvious — and the first addressed by the authors — is that gravity was ignored in this work .
They do say that in future work , they will examine whether this power - law time dependence even exists for the vacuum when the effects of a gravitational field are taken into account .
Even without that omission this claim is controversial .
For an opposing viewpoint , the New Scientist writer contacted Prof .
Max Tegmark of MIT who states that the quantum Zeno effects is not predicated on humans doing the observations of dark energy or light .
" Galaxies have ' observed ' the dark energy long before we evolved .
When we humans in turn observe the light from these galaxies , it changes nothing except our own knowledge , " says Tegmark .
While Krauss makes and interesting claim , it is still quite far out there and I honestly would not have given it the time of day except for the fact that it was Krauss who made it .
In the end , it is an extrapolation of sound work , but at the same time , work that is not 100 percent ready to be applied to the real world .
In the absence of any official information from police on the identity of the Virginia Tech killer , internet sleuths claiming to be in - the - know have been calling attention – on message boards and online aggregators like Digg – to the LiveJournal blog of a particular 23 - year - old gun nut in Virginia .
It 's easy to see why this rumor would get traction .
The man 's journal features copious photos of him holding firearms , big and small , as well as dark hints of obsessive love , and confirmation that he attends Virginia Tech .
So far , over 150 people have heaped wrath on his blog 's comment board , or gotten in messages like , " Just posting a comment in a potentially famous livejournal . "
( I 'm not naming him .
To the credit of the mainstream media , his name produces not a single hit in Google News , and Wired News will certainly not be the first . )
I found his phone number in an online resume and called it .
A guy who identified himself as " David , " and would n't give a last name , said he was handling media inquiries for the man .
" He has given me liberty to confirm that he is not the shooter , given that he is alive , " said David .
He added that the man is receiving non -stop press inquiries , but is holding out for the first media agency willing to make a donation to charity .
" Right now the entire internet thinks it is him .
He is really concerned with his safety . "
Nobody deserves to be wrongly tied to a crime of this nature .
But it 's unclear why this person would be concerned with his safety ; we know the actual killer is dead .
Maybe he thinks the internet will believe – mistakenly , no doubt – that he 's passively encouraging the rumor and enjoying his 15 minutes of fame .
That might piss people off .
So why has n't he put the matter to rest by updating his blog with a simple message like , " It 's not me . " ?
" David " would n't comment on that .
\—
Update : The LiveJournal gun-fan has now posted that message , and explained why he let the rumor live for so long .
My original intention was to wait until I got AdSense on my site and donating all the proceeds to Charity .
However , this situation has now spiraled out of control .
I am now confirming that I am not the shooter .

The brains of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder develop more slowly than those of other children but eventually catch up , according to a government study published Monday that suggests ADHD may be a transient condition , at least for some .
Using advanced imaging techniques , scientists found that the cortices of children with ADHD reach peak thickness an average of three years later than children without the disorder .
The cortex is involved in decision - making and supports the ability to focus attention , remember things moment to moment and suppress inappropriate actions -- functions often deficient in children with ADHD .
Dr. Philip Shaw of the National Institute of Mental Health , lead author of the report , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , said the results might help explain why many children with ADHD appear to grow out of the disorder and become less impulsive and fidgety as they mature .

Shaw said that although brain development was slower among those with ADHD , it followed a normal pattern , which should reassure parents .
“ There has been a debate about whether ADHD is a delay or deviance from normal brain development , ” he said .
“ This study comes down strongly in favor of delay . ”
About 4.4 million school - age children in the U.S. have ADHD , which can lead to poor school performance and behavior problems .
Half of children diagnosed with the disorder are treated with stimulants , such as Ritalin , or other medicines .
Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging equipment to scan the brains of 223 children and adolescents with ADHD and 223 youngsters without the disorder .
The scans were repeated two , three or four or more times at three - year intervals .

Scientists focused on the cortex , which becomes thicker as the brain builds new connections to process all the things children are learning -- a key milestone in brain development .
They measured cortical thickness at 40,000 points on each scan , creating a detailed map of brain development in the two groups .
In general , they found that the parts of the cortex involved in sensory and motor processing reached peak thickness earlier than the areas responsible for decision - making and other higher - order functions .
In children with ADHD , developmental lags were most pronounced in the prefrontal cortex , which supports attention and working memory , among other things .
Half of the cortical points in ADHD children reached peak thickness at an average age of 10.5 , contrasted with age 7.5 in children without the disorder .

The primary motor cortex reached peak thickness at age 7.4 in children with ADHD , about five months earlier than in normal children , researchers found .
Shaw said it was possible that the early maturation of the primary motor cortex contributed to the fidgety behavior characteristic of ADHD .
Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos of New York University said the research helps explain why children with ADHD often choose younger playmates , and it should reassure parents who are worried about their children fitting in .
“ They may be 11 but their brain is 8 .
They ca n’t act their chronological age , ” he said .
“ This lets parents know that having younger playmates is OK and to be expected , ” said Castellanos , a former National Institute of Mental Health researcher involved in the early stages of the study .
The study , which focused on one aspect of brain development , did not explain why some people continue to experience ADHD symptoms as adults .

Dr. Bradley S. Peterson of Columbia University , who was not connected to the study , said that although the brains of children with ADHD reached the appropriate thickness , there was no way of knowing from the study whether individual cells were normal .
“ Billions of cells make up brain tissue , and we cannot measure all the cells and all the connections between the cells , ” he said .
“ Subtle deficits could easily remain . ”
In addition , he said , the study did not examine the process of cortical thinning that takes place in late adolescence -- a second developmental milestone in which unneeded connections are pruned to shape the adult brain .
Government researchers plan to continue tracking some study participants through adulthood , Shaw said .

“ We have not captured this later transition , ” he said .
“ It is possible some people never quite get there and that is what accounts for the persistent ” ADHD .

Photo Gallery A History of Streaking
Whether they get jeered or cheered , they 're the best entertainment during a boring game .
And they 're only looking for one thing : 15 seconds of infamy .
They do n't even care about the legal trouble they face when they peel off their clothes -- streaking is their raison d'etre .
GPS is great .
Before handheld receivers became widespread , how did we ever find small boxes of random crap in the woods ?
Stalkers were among the first to see the technology 's potential , using it to track the movements of ex-girlfriends by sticking modified cell phones beneath their vehicles , but the state of California thinks that GPS is ready to enter a new market : the hood .
San Bernardino county wants to start tagging gangbangers with GPS transponders .
County commissioners have applied to the state to be part of a pilot program that would monitor all offenders who are released from jail after serving time for gang - related activities .
The program , which the county has started implementing on its own , is an innovative attempt to tackle the problem of gang violence , but it builds on similar California initiatives already underway .
Last year , for instance , California voters enacted Jessica 's Law , which forced all sex offenders to live more than 2,000 feet away from schools and parks .
The law also require that all felony sex offenders submit to GPS - based electronic monitoring — for the rest of their lives .
That 's right , the bracelets need to stay on even after sentences are served and parole is over .
GPS has found a home in prison systems across the country , which love the devices for their ability to ease overcrowding and to enforce parole conditions .
As long ago as 2002 , such programs were becoming popular and even received support from the ACLU , which likes them because the devices make it easier for less - violent criminals to get out of jail and work a job .
Such systems generally rely on private companies that handle the monitoring of the GPS signals , which are transmitted by a small tracking device worn on the belt .
A smaller wristwatch - type anklet is also worn by the prisoner at all times and cannot be removed without sending an alarm .
Texas uses both active and passive systems , which are passed out based on risk .
Parolees with higher risk factors get the active model , which allows for real - time tracking , while everyone else gets a passive version that downloads its data at the end of each day through a base station in the user 's home .
Such systems have revolutionized the parole system , making it much simpler to enforce compliance .
The Texas system , for instance , makes monitoring simple : " When TDCJ district parole officer Taylor Goodlett looks at his laptop computer screen each morning , he normally sees a lot of little green dots .
The dots tell him exactly where a high - risk offender on his caseload had gone the day before and that he was , in fact , authorized to travel to those locations .
Red dots , on the other hand , alert him that the offender might have gone astray . "
The system also displays the speed at which people are moving , meaning that parole officers can also find out if people were doing 95 mph down side streets the night before .
San Bernardino hopes that such technology will help the county to keep people from slipping back into gang activity by restricting movement into known gang - controlled areas .
For those who want to go straight , the knowledge that Big Brother is always watching should provide additional incentive .

A new book is causing a storm of controversy by labelling children as annoying and pointless - a charge made all the more inflammatory by the fact that its author is a mother .
Entitled No Kid : 40 Reasons Not To Have Children , Corinne Maier 's book has sparked fury in France , where it was published .
Here , Corinne argues her " no kid " case while another mum , Ursula Hirschkorn , stands firm for parenthood .
Corinne Maier , 43 , a writer , who lives with her boyfriend Yves , 45 , a psychiatrist , daughter Laure , 13 , and son Cyrille , 10 , in Brussels , argues her case .
Children are just too much work .
They just are n't worth the hassle .
Parents today are put under so much pressure to bring up perfect children , but what 's the point ?
They are just walking problems to which you constantly have to find solutions .
The world is in the grip of baby mania , with celebrities flaunting their pregnant bellies in magazines , live births on TV and everyone demanding the right to have a baby at any cost .
To be a la mode , the must - have accessory is a baby .
If you can't make your own , then a whole business has sprung up to service your needs and now as long as you 've got the cash , you can buy IVF , eggs , sperm or even children .
Anyone who dares to be different and suggest that being child - free is the better option is vilified as immature or selfish .
It 's a brave woman who will stand up for her right not to have children .
Let 's start at the beginning with my first reason for being anti-children : labour is torture .
Even with anaesthetic it 's the worst pain you 'll ever feel .
Anyone who tells you it will be a beautiful experience is lying .
It 's more like that scene from the film Alien , where the monster bursts from an astronaut 's stomach .
Then there 's breastfeeding .
Everyone tells you breast is best , but no one tells you it hurts like hell .
If you opt out and bottle - feed you 're made to feel guilty for " going against nature " .
Get over these early hurdles and you hit the big one : how to keep your child amused and happy .
This will fast become one of your most hated jobs .
The moment you give birth you can forget leisurely lie-ins , last - minute trips or a spontaneous roll in the hay with your partner .
Instead , your weekends revolve around being woken at the crack of dawn to traipse around the zoo or watch minimum wage actors cavort in cartoon costumes at Disneyland ; sitting through stupid kids ' films and eating in " child friendly " restaurants .
In my opinion this alone is reason enough not to have a child .
But perhaps the weekends are n't so bad when you look at the monotony that is the life of a working mother .
Your career is on hold in a dull job , because it 's the only way you can get out of work on time to pick up your children from school or take a day off when they get sick .
I stayed for years in a job that bored me - as an economist - just so I could get out early to pick my children up .
I worked all day , and then came home to shopping , cooking , cleaning and hours of homework , and all so my kids could treat me like a maid .
It was so boring .
Being a working mum is like being in prison , but there 's no time off for good behaviour and no electronic tags you can wear for a brief trip back to the freedom you 've given up for your offspring .
Scroll down for more ...
I found the hardest thing to give up when I had my children was my personal freedom .
There is no time left to be you any more .
If I had n't had them , I would have spent my money travelling the world .
I could enjoy my money , rather than being stuck at home waking them up every day in time for school .
Once you have children , there is no space for spontaneity any more .
We tried to go to an art exhibition last weekend which we'd been looking forward to for ages , but we had to take the kids along and they hate art .
They whined so much that we gave up and left without seeing anything .
If you thought your friends would help you get through parenthood , then you 've got another thing coming .
When your friends have children , conversation shrinks to how " Oscar 's using the potty now " or " Alice slept the whole night " .
Nothing is more mind - numbingly boring than " mummy talk " .
Make no mistake , bringing up children is war , and you 're on the losing side .
Every time you plan a little escape they will undermine you .
Just as you are off to bed with your partner , they 'll throw up ; the one night you book a babysitter they 'll come down with a fever ; on your birthday they 'll throw a tantrum as you 're stepping out of the door - you just can't win .
Perhaps this is why children are such effective passion killers .
Take my advice , if you want to stay together , avoid baby - making .
What hope is there of a fulfilling sex life when a woman is forced to turn into a fat , deformed animal decked out in sack - like dresses ?
Far from the beautiful images on the front of magazines , the ugly reality usually means a long cold spell between the sheets .
Even once the baby is born , nights punctuated by feeds and a crying baby leave you so exhausted that any thawing in that department is a long way off .
As you bid adieu to your sex life , your relationship is quick to follow .
You go from being a couple to being Mummy and Daddy .
Your job as a parent comes first , and the romance in your lives is replaced by DIY and dusting .
Now , my boyfriend Yves and I are parents first and a couple second .
Our relationship has n't been the same since we had children and I miss the romance .
Of course , millions of parents will read this and get all defensive and think that it's all worth it because those angels of theirs are sweethearts .
But they 're not : they 're little savages .
Just think back to your own childhood - the playground was a bear pit where children were bullied and toys stolen .
Things have n't changed and little children are just as unpleasant and annoying as they ever were , except that as a parent you 're not even allowed to fight back now .
I was in the library with my son when he was younger and he was playing up .
He was getting on my nerves and annoying everyone , so I gave him a slap to make him behave , but then everyone looked at me as if I were a bad mother .
Modern parents ' hands are tied .
While there is pressure to produce perfect children , you no longer have any power to say no to them , so you 're more likely to produce perfect brats .
Sometimes a slap is the only way to explain something to a child .
If you 've disagreed with me up to this point and you still think you can cope with the emotional cost of a child , then perhaps you should consider the financial one .
Kids cost a fortune .
First the family car and the house , then there 's basics like food and clothes , and that 's before they start pestering you for the latest toy .
A lot of people decide to have children to build a family around themselves , as a refuge from the world so they wo n't be lonely and will be loved for who they are .
Certainly , I often wonder why I had children .
I think it was because I am an only child I thought I would be less alone if I had a family .
Now I 've learned that being in a family can bring a new kind of loneliness .
People often ask me what my children think of the book , but they do n't give a damn .
They live in their own world and I live in mine .
I would never give my daughter advice on whether she should have children .
I do n't care if I have grandchildren or not , but I know that if I do , I do n't want to look after them too often .
The idea of a cosy picture postcard family is fantasy and the whole " loving family gathered around the Christmas tree " image is a lie .
More murders and child abuse happen within families than outside them - every family is a nest of vipers : all the more reason not to add to your own .
Even if you are savvy enough to realise that having children wo n't add up to having the perfect family , another parent trap is believing that it 's OK to put off your dreams in the hope that your kids will fulfil them .
But if you have no children you are free to make your own dreams come true now , surely a more attractive option .
If you can't bring yourself to give up on the idea of children as your future , what future do you see for them ?
Financial and job security are things of the past , housing is beyond expensive , the planet is suffering from over - population - do you still think it 's such a good idea to bring yet another baby into this world ?
They could end up being your problem for the rest of your life .
What a prospect .
Instead of pitying the child - free , we should be envying them , I know I do .
Because as a mother - of - two I know better than most why having children is a big mistake .
So Corinne Maier thinks motherhood gets too much good press - but I beg to differ .
I think most mums are only too happy to regale their scared single friends with tales of stretch marks , sleepless nights and sex - free relationships , if only to elicit a bit of sympathy .
I think most women go out of their way not to drone on and on about their children , especially when they 're with friends who do n't have a family .
To be honest , though , in the face of this vitriolic attack on the lifestyle I 've chosen , I say to hell with other people 's feelings .
I think the real secret of motherhood is that for all our griping about loss of personal freedom , dead - end careers and endless rounds of nappy - changing , being a mother is the best and most important job in the world .
As soon as you get pregnant , you finally realise the point of all those years of dealing with budding boobs and annoying periods .
As you body swells up with potential , you finally have a legitimate reason to spend hours drooling over baby clothes and the latest prams .
And you start to get what this baby - making business is all about .
Now I know that not all pregnancies are as rosy as mine , which were a round of cat naps and guilt - free chocolate scoffing , but the end result makes it all worthwhile even if you 've spent nine months fighting morning sickness .
The moment you look your baby in the eye , you know a love like no other you will ever feel .
Your feelings for your newborn baby are the very definition of unconditional love .
They are the cutest thing you 've ever seen , even as newborns when they are slicked in blood and look like Winston Churchill ( all new babies do ) .
Now I wo n't lie - yes , the early months are hard , but then does n't anything worth having take a bit of hard work and self - sacrifice ?
One of my most cherished memories is of a night feed with my son Jacob when he was all of two months old .
I plucked him screaming and red- faced from his cot , and started to feed him his milk .
After a few moments , he pulled away from his bottle , looked up at me and gave me his first , beautifully gummy smile .
I 've never felt being up at 2 am was so worthwhile - even when I was dancing away at some nightclub in my youth .
I remember reading when I was pregnant that once you have a child you will never be bored again .
I was sceptical to say the least .
In my experience , babies were grand masters at doing nothing , in between bouts of banshee screaming , but that was before I had my own to play with .
Even watching Jacob sleep held its own fascination , and when he started to do really interesting things such as eat solids , roll , crawl , walk , talk and boss me about , well that was when things really got fun .
My husband would come home from work and our entire dinner conversation would be about the milestones Jacob had reached , no matter how infinitesimal .

Parents know their world shrinks when children come along .
They are painfully aware they are missing out on films and plays and boozy nights out .
But is n't that what your 20s are for ?
Do you really want to go on living the same way until you 're 50 ?
The truth is that becoming a parent makes you less selfish - it forces you to devote yourself to another being more than to yourself .
It allows you to experience the joys and challenges of that little person 's life as they live it .
And it lets you reconnect with your own childhood by reliving the excitement of discovering the world all over again .
The first time my son Jacob kissed me and told me he loved me , it beat all my previous romantic trysts into a cocked hat .
When I was a new mum to Jacob , I remember saying to my husband that if I were to die then that it would n't matter so much because I had done the best thing I ever could in having my son .
These are the moments that I will remember and savour when I am old : watching the boys put on a show , complete with my posh make - up smeared all over their faces , beaming as we clap their tiny achievements ; my three - year - old boy genius asking me if we could come to a " compromise " about his excessive lolly consumption ; my beautiful little baby boy pointing out the " tittomotamus " ( read hippopotamus ) at Disneyworld .
I certainly wo n't be thinking about how well a particular business meeting went or how many times I went to the cinema .
And that to me is the best argument for motherhood there could be .

The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has triggered a diplomatic furore over his request to lay a wreath at the World Trade Centre site to commemorate the September 11 attacks .
Even before setting foot on US soil for the upcoming UN general assembly , the Iranian leader has managed to ruffle American feathers by asking to visit what is considered a sacred site .
Mr Ahmadinejad , who is to due to arrive on Sunday to address the assembly , had asked New York city and the US secret service earlier this month for permission to visit Ground Zero .
A statement by the New York police commissioner , Raymond Kelly , that said the city was considering the application , prompted outrage from politicians , quickly resulting in a refusal .
Rudy Giuliani , who was mayor during the attacks and is now a Republican presidential candidate , branded Mr Ahmadinejad 's request " outrageous " and described him as " a man who has made threats against America and Israel ; is harbouring [ Osama ] bin Laden 's son and other al - Qaida leaders ; is shipping arms to Iraqi insurgents ; and is pursuing the development of nuclear weapons " .
Hillary Clinton , the Democratic presidential candidate , said it was " unacceptable " for Mr Ahmadinejad " to visit the site of the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in our nation 's history " .
Mohammad Mir Ali Mohammadi , a spokesman for the Iranian mission to the UN , described the refusal as unfortunate .
" President Ahmadinejad intended to lay a wreath at the site of Ground Zero in order to pay tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 .
We are hopeful that we can still work something out with the police department . "
Mr Ahmadinejad is scheduled to speak at Columbia University on Monday at a forum of world leaders organised by the college 's school of international and public affairs .
It promises to be a raucous affair .
The Iranian leader has been dogged by protesters during past visits .
A year ago , after he was invited to address the same Columbia forum , the invitation was withdrawn because his appearance might not " reflect the academic values of the event " .
The president 's visit to the US comes amid intense speculation of a possible American strike at Iran 's nuclear facilities over Tehran 's refusal to halt its uranium enrichment programme .
The US is trying to drum up support for a third round of UN sanctions against Iran , with France on board , but with Russia and China reluctant to pressure Iran further .
Apart from the nuclear issue , Washington has stepped up accusations against Iran over its alleged support for Shia militants in Iraq who are targeting American soldiers with explosive devices .
In a television appearance earlier this week , Mr Ahmadinejad said his country wanted peace and friendship with the US , despite mounting tensions .
The US has also denied a visa to Iran 's UN ambassador in Geneva to attend next week 's general assembly meeting because he was allegedly involved in the 1979 US hostage crisis in Tehran , a UN official said .

BARCELONA , Spain —
With its soaring but impossibly slender columns and masonry that resembles heavy frosting , Antonio Gaudí ’s unfinished masterwork La Sagrada Familia seems as if it might suddenly collapse on itself , like a surreal cake .
But the architect in charge of efforts to complete the church , one of the most visited monuments in Spain , says the building is indeed threatened — by a train tunnel that , if built as planned , would be dug within a few feet of its foundations .
“ The project could cause irreparable damage to the Sagrada Familia , ” said the architect , Jordi Bonet , 81 , who leads a group of 20 architects .
“ The slightest shift could cause ceramics to fall from the vaults .
It could provoke cracks . ”
“ What would possess someone to build a tunnel like this next to the heaviest building in Barcelona , the most visited monument in Spain ? ” he asked .
In a workshop below the building , he paused next to a plaster model of the unbuilt facade and whipped out a tape measure to show how the tunnel , for a high - speed rail line , and a protective outer wall would pass about five feet from the church ’s foundations .
Mr. Bonet said the huge , delicately balanced structure was especially vulnerable to a major construction project .
A reader underlines the point I made here about the scant attention paid to WMD or weapons sites in the original invasion of Iraq .
The salience of it is either a ) rank incompetence , or b ) that the military leadership really did n't have reason to fear the WMDs the president had scared the rest of us about .
But even well - known nuclear sites were left to be raided by looters .
If the Bush administration really feared WMD programs , they had a funny way of invading .
A reader writes :
An important line of evidence indicating that the Bush administration did not believe their own WMD hype has been neglected .
Why did the administration do nothing to secure WMD during and after the invasion ?
They certainly were concerned with securing the oil fields but did nothing to prevent weapons from falling into terrorist and insurgent hands .
The following from the NY Times are in content chronological order .
Peter Galbraith in October 2004 : In 2003 I went to tell Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz what I had seen in Baghdad in the days following Saddam Hussein 's overthrow .
For nearly an hour , I described the catastrophic aftermath of the invasion -- the unchecked looting of every public institution in Baghdad , the devastation of Iraq 's cultural heritage , the anger of ordinary Iraqis who could n't understand why the world 's only superpower was letting this happen .
I also described two particularly disturbing incidents -- one I had witnessed and the other I had heard about .
On April 16 , 2003 , a mob attacked and looted the Iraqi equivalent of the Centers for Disease Control , taking live HIV and black fever virus among other potentially lethal materials .
US troops were stationed across the street but did not intervene because they did n't know the building was important .
When he found out , the young American lieutenant was devastated .
He shook his head and said , " I hope I am not responsible for Armageddon . "
About the same time , looters entered the warehouses at Iraq 's sprawling nuclear facilities at Tuwaitha on Baghdad 's outskirts .
They took barrels of yellowcake ( raw uranium ) , apparently dumping the uranium and using the barrels to hold water .
US troops were at Tuwaitha but did not interfere .
There was nothing secret about the Disease Center or the Tuwaitha warehouses .
Inspectors had repeatedly visited the center looking for evidence of a biological weapons program .
The Tuwaitha warehouses included materials from Iraq 's nuclear program , which had been dismantled after the 1991 Gulf War .
The United Nations had sealed the materials , and they remained untouched until the US troops arrived .
The looting that I observed was spontaneous .
Quite likely the looters had no idea they were stealing deadly biological agents or radioactive materials or that they were putting themselves in danger .
As I pointed out to Wolfowitz , as long as these sites remained unprotected , their deadly materials could end up not with ill - educated slum dwellers but with those who knew exactly what they were doing .
This is apparently what happened .
According to an International Atomic Energy Agency report issued earlier this month , there was " widespread and apparently systematic dismantlement that has taken place at sites previously relevant to Iraq 's nuclear program . "
This includes nearly 380 tons of high explosives suitable for detonating nuclear weapons or killing American troops .
Some of the looting continued for many months -- possibly into 2004 .
Using heavy machinery , organized gangs took apart , according to the IAEA , " entire buildings that housed high - precision equipment . "
This equipment could be anywhere .
But one good bet is Iran , which has had allies and agents in Iraq since shortly after the US - led forces arrived .
This was a preventable disaster .
Iraq 's nuclear weapons - related materials were stored in only a few locations , and these were known before the war began .
As even L. Paul Bremer III , the US administrator in Iraq , now admits , the United States had far too few troops to secure the country following the fall of Saddam Hussein .
But even with the troops we had , the United States could have protected the known nuclear sites .
It appears that troops did not receive relevant intelligence about Iraq 's WMD facilities , nor was there any plan to secure them .
Even after my briefing , the Pentagon leaders did nothing to safeguard Iraq 's nuclear sites .
Ray Bonner , October 2003 :
BAGHDAD , Iraq , Oct. 13 - The two most recent suicide bombings here and virtually every other attack on American soldiers and Iraqis were carried out with explosives and matériel taken from Saddam Hussein 's former weapons dumps , which are much larger than previously estimated and remain , for the most part , unguarded by American troops , allied officials said Monday .
The problem of uncounted and unguarded weapons sites is considerably greater than has previously been stated , a senior allied official said .
The American military now says that Iraq 's army had nearly one million tons of weapons and ammunition , which is half again as much as the 650,000 tons that Gen. John P. Abizaid , the senior American commander in the Persian Gulf region , estimated only two weeks ago .
In separate interviews , the officials , civilian and military and from different countries , expressed concern about the potential of attackers with access to the weapons dumps to nurture violence and insecurity .
The officials said they were receiving intelligence about the attacks - who is carrying them out and where they are getting their munitions - from a variety of sources .
Among the most fruitful , they said , have been would - be bombers who were stopped before carrying out their missions .
The officials were deliberately vague about how many attacks had been thwarted , for fear of alarming an already jumpy populace here .
But one of them said several car bombings had been prevented in recent weeks , suggesting that the number was more than just a handful .
Officials also say that Mr. Hussein stockpiled at least 5,000 shoulder - fired missiles , and that fewer than a third have been recovered .
They fear that many have been smuggled out of the country and may have fallen into the hands of terrorist organizations .
There are not enough American soldiers here to do the job of finding the weapons and securing them until they can be destroyed , the officials said .
A private American company , Raytheon , has been awarded a contract to destroy the weapons , but it will not begin work until December , one official said .
" There are more sites than we can guard , " an allied official said .
" We are destroying them as fast as we can , but we are finding more and more every day . "
One of the largest in the country , covering more than 10 square miles , is near Al Musaiyib , 20 miles south of Baghdad , and is still not adequately guarded , an official said this week .
Last month the Army began patrols of the site , and helicopters fly over occasionally .
But it is not guarded around the clock , and officials say they believe that weapons and munitions are still being removed - and probably being used in devices that are killing Americans and Iraqis .

The Vanderbilt family is selling a J.M.W. Turner masterpiece that was considered " one of the finest watercolour - drawings in the world . "
" Bamborough Castle "  which was believed by many in the art historical world to be lost  has been in the family 's collection since 1890 , when Cornelius Vanderbilt purchased it .
But at a time when art prices , especially prices for Turners , are soaring , the family has decided to sell .
Click Image to Enlarge Sothebys London J.M.W. Turners  Bamborough Castle ,  a detail of which is above , was thought to be lost .
It is now on view  for the first time in 118 years  prior to being auctioned at Sothebys in London .
The painting is in New York until November 7 .
Sotheby's , which will auction the painting in London on December 5 , is exhibiting the work at its York Avenue headquarters between Friday and November 7  making this the first time in 118 years that the Turner has been available for public viewing .
Though " Bamborough Castle " is estimated at between $ 3 million and $ 5 million , there is plenty of reason to suspect a higher hammer price .
A comparable work recently sold for $ 7.2 million , and the thrill of this sale is the picture 's secret life in hiding .
Unlike some lost treasures  unappreciated in their time , only to be esteemed highly later on  there was never any doubt about this Turner 's value .
Shortly after the work was painted , the Graphic Society described it in 1837 as among " the finest watercolour drawings in the world . "
And , in 1872 , the Earl of Dudley , an avid collector , validated the society 's opinion by paying a record price for any watercolor to own " Bamborough Castle . "
Eleven years later , the earl died .
His son and heir was a teenager and not the Turner enthusiast his father had been .
The second earl allowed the picture to be shown at the Royal Academy in 1889 , the last time it has been seen in public .
Then , in 1890 , Sophia and Cornelius Vanderbilt were on a trip to Europe , and in them , the young Earl soon found a home for his father 's Turners .
Indeed , the Vanderbilts bought several Turners from the earl , including a painting that the family eventually donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
The Vanderbilt family enjoyed its privacy , and four generations of them enjoyed the Turner as it went from being a famous work of art to a family heirloom .
Perhaps because the picture was acquired so long ago  and as a watercolor , it may not have been viewed with as much importance as an oil painting  its whereabouts were unknown to the art world .
The close - knit Vanderbilts did n't trumpet their possession , leaving scholars to wonder .
" I was one of many who knew it existed , " Sotheby 's expert , Henry Wemyss , said , " but did n't know what it looked like . "
Art historians resorted to reconstructing the work , and its powerful depiction of a storm , from Turner 's sketches , which might have made it hard for the original to live up to expectations .
But Mr. Wemyss was bowled over when he finally saw it .
" The various experts have all been speechless and in awe , " vice chairman of Sotheby 's , Benjamin Dollar , who saw the work for the first time 10 years ago , said .
" They were particularly struck by the vibrancy of the colors and the drama of the composition .
Each expert has spent a number of hours with it . "
" With most 19th - century artists you can admire their work , but you can see how they did it , " Mr. Wemyss said .
" With Turner , I can't understand how he did it .
You can spend a long time looking just at the brushstrokes . "
The brushstrokes show an artist who worked over the picture again and again .
One must work quickly with watercolors before the surface dries , but Turner found ways to add and subtract to create the effects he wanted .
There are brushstrokes on wet paper and brushstrokes on dry paper .
Turner went back and scratched into the surface of the paper , creating inflections of white in the already vibrant colors .
The vibrancy of the work is a testament to the care the Vanderbilt family gave the painting .
Though the later generations were not involved in the obsessive collection of Turners  or even that deeply connected to the art world  they kept the watercolor away from the light and in a dry spot .
The family may not have participated in the art world but they were savvy enough to check in every so often .
Ten years ago , they approached Mr. Dollar about a valuation .
He was so struck with the find that he kept the file on his desk for a decade , hoping one day the family would be willing to part with the masterful work .
And that day has come .
Earlier this year , a cache of Turner watercolors sold for record prices at Sotheby's .
The family called Mr. Dollar before he could pitch them that the timing was perfect .
The motivation to sell can be overwhelming for those in possession of highly valuable works .
There was a time when great families gave great works to great museums .
But even the redoubtable David Rockefeller sold a prized Rothko at Sotheby 's this spring , choosing to donate the proceeds , instead of the painting , to charity .
Why are n't the Vanderbilts donating ?
It could be that the family 's wealth , diluted with the generations , can't ignore the gain .
Or perhaps they just see the market as the most efficient way to transfer the burden of owning such a majestic work .
After all , it 's one thing to care for a treasured family piece .
It 's another thing to be responsible for what could soon be a $ 10 million masterpiece .
As prices rise , so does the burden of owning great works .
Insurance rates go up ; security is an issue ; with works on paper , there is additional care .
Most onerous is simply the stewardship .
And the family is ready to pass that along .
So now , 135 years after it was last sold , " Bamborough Castle " is ready for the market again .
The discovery was too late to have been included in the show of Turners currently up at the National Gallery in Washington , D.C. , but at least there 's no longer the mystery of whether the painting still exists .
And , with luck , whoever spends upward of $ 3 million on this finest of watercolors will be a little more show - offy about it .
As David Rohde reported in The Times today , Pakistan ’s president , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , speaking on Pakistani television about his decision to suspend his country ’s Constitution , compared himself to Abraham Lincoln .
The general , dressed in civilian clothes , quoted from Abraham Lincoln and cited the former president ’s suspension of some rights during the American Civil War as justification for his own state of emergency .
Speaking in English , General Musharraf began his discussion of Lincoln as follows :
“ I would at this time venture to read out an excerpt of President Abraham Lincoln , specially to all my listeners in the United States .
As an idealist , Abraham Lincoln had one consuming passion during that time of crisis , and this was to preserve the Union … towards that end , he broke laws , he violated the Constitution , he usurped arbitrary power , he trampled individual liberties .
His justification was necessity and explaining his sweeping violation of Constitutional limits he wrote in a letter in 1864 , and I quote , ‘ My oath to preserve the Constitution imposed on me the duty of preserving by every indispensable means that government , that Nation of which the Constitution was the organic law .
Was it possible to lose the Nation and yet preserve the Constitution ? ' ”
Below is video , posted on YouTube , of this part of Gen. Musharraf ’s address .
The full text of Abraham Lincoln ’s famous letter — in which he also wrote “ If slavery is not wrong , nothing is wrong ” — is posted on the Library of Congress Web site , in Lincoln ’s own handwriting , here , here and here .
Bill Clinton rewrites history on support for Iraq war
On the stump for his wife in Iowa , former President Bill Clinton voiced his long - felt displeasure for the war in Iraq .
" Even though I approved of Afghanistan and opposed Iraq from the beginning , " said Clinton , " I still resent that I was not asked or given the opportunity to support those soldiers . "
But the tapes show a history entirely different .
While Clinton has been critical of the U.S. - led invasion as far back as 2005 , even calling it a " big mistake , " ABC News reports that Bill , like his wife , supported giving President Bush the authority needed to launch an attack in 2002 .
To prove Clintons past support , ABC News dug up a transcript from remarks he delivered during 2003 commencement at Tougaloo College in Jackson , Mississippi .
" I supported the President when he asked the Congress for authority to stand up against weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , " he said .
Bill Clintons spokesperson attempted to explain the discrepancy by distinguishing between the authority to go to war -- which both Clintons supported -- and President Bush 's decision to use that authority when he did .
" As he said from the beginning and many times since , " said Clinton spokesperson Jay Carson , " President Clinton disagreed with taking the country to war in Iraq without allowing the weapons inspectors to finish their jobs . "

Lately , Barack Obama has been saying that major action is needed to avert what he keeps calling a “ crisis ” in Social Security — most recently in an interview with The National Journal .
Progressives who fought hard and successfully against the Bush administration ’s attempt to panic America into privatizing the New Deal ’s crown jewel are outraged , and rightly so .
But Mr. Obama ’s Social Security mistake was , in fact , exactly what you ’d expect from a candidate who promises to transcend partisanship in an age when that ’s neither possible nor desirable .
To understand the nature of Mr. Obama ’s mistake , you need to know something about the special role of Social Security in American political discourse .
Inside the Beltway , doomsaying about Social Security — declaring that the program as we know it ca n’t survive the onslaught of retiring baby boomers — is regarded as a sort of badge of seriousness , a way of showing how statesmanlike and tough - minded you are .
It took less than a month for Jason Francis to realize that he was not among allies at the so - called Fred Thompson Forum , a website purporting to support the candidacy of the Republican presidential contender .
Maybe it was the site 's tagline – " Hope for North America " – that made him doubtful of the forum 's legitimacy .
Or , the oddly bombastic tenor of his fellow forum members ' posts .
While Francis was posting thoughtful missives about his candidate 's positions , other purported Fred - heads seemed to hold a sinister view of the former senator .
A poster named " Chuck Manson , " for example , expressed confidence that a Thompson White House would deploy improvised explosive devices in Iraq .
" We 've got bigger and better ( IEDs ) , and we need to start using 'em !
We will not be defeated !
We will rule the Middle East ! "
After voicing some mild suspicions , Jason Francis finally threw his virtual hands up in the air .
" I am now convinced that this site is owned and operated by Ron Paul supporters with the express purpose of discrediting any and all presidential candidates , especially Fred Thompson , without reasoned debate or even relatively polite discussion , " he wrote in July .
" I have come to this conclusion after finding my posts ( not inflammatory or vulgar ) removed without a trace and my vote on the Ron Paul vs. Fred Thompson poll reversed . "
Welcome to the online house of mirrors that is the 2008 campaign : A growing bag of tricks employed by tech - savvy amateur political operatives now includes a collection of spoofed online forums purporting to support top candidates , while damning them with praise for extreme positions they have never voiced .
The operating principle :
The best way to undermine a candidate 's supporters is to pretend to be one of them .
FredThompsonForum.com is one of a small network of sites with prime domain names , like RudyGiulianiForum.com and MittRomneyforum.com , that have sprung up this year and share uncanny similarities .
They use the same forum software , are hidden behind anonymous domain - registration services and are served by the same hosting company with a common internet IP address .
The content is also similar , sometimes featuring posts under the impersonated names of popular political pundits and bloggers , or promoting misleading links to candidate sites that route to YouTube videos attacking them .
Most posts adopt the persona of a supporter of the candidate , while offering views that amount to over - the - top parodies of genuine boosters .
" A lot of it is sarcastic , and playing to stereotypical impressions , " says Bill Beutler , a senior online analyst with the political consulting group New Media Strategies in Arlington , Virginia .
" It is my impression that a majority of people on the ( FredThompsonForum.com ) board are Ron Paul supporters . "
Indeed , Texas lawmaker Ron Paul seems to have escaped the phenomenon .
A Ron Paul forum hosted from the same IP address , and with the same layout as the others , is packed with genuine supporters in earnest discussion .
The registered owner of that domain did not respond to interview requests from Wired News .
A careful examination of the parody sites makes the often - amusing spoofing apparent .
But casual readers or new forum members have sometimes missed the gag , putting the forums on a shaky boundary between parody and deception .
" I think it 's very difficult for the members of the public and the media to tell whether this is a joke , " says Christopher Soghoian , a graduate student who studies web psychology and fraud techniques at the Indiana University School of Informatics .
" If you hang out in any of the legitimate forums like Free Republic , some of the opinions are not so different from these illegitimate forums , where the opinions are just a bit over the top . "
Already known to a handful of political bloggers , Wired News learned about the forums last week , after outraging many Paulites by reporting on a flurry of deceptive spam promoting Ron Paul 's candidacy .
Apparently in retaliation , a RudyGiulianiForum.com member posed as this reporter and posted a message to the forum boasting that the story was a " fake , " and had supposedly been written in exchange for payment from Giuliani supporters .
" Hopefully , it will help accomplish your goals , " the post read , signing off with this reporter 's name .
Long - time forum members played along .
The message board thread was later deleted , but not before fooling other Ron Paul supporters , one of whom produced a YouTube video offering the spoofed post as proof that Wired News was on Rudy Giuliani 's payroll .
The video enjoyed wide circulation online ( including on Wired Digital 's own Reddit news - aggregation site ) and had been viewed more than 16,000 times by Monday afternoon .
While most of the posts on the spoof sites fall short of character assassination , Soghoian says the forums could result in damage to a candidate 's reputation .
In a worst - case scenario , he says , harried television producers could be fooled by the parody comments and take them out of context in a news program .
Fox News host Bill O'Reilly did that this summer with comments posted by readers on the leading progressive website DailyKos , Soghoian notes .
Asked whether he had heard of the fake forums , Ron Paul 's communication director Jesse Benton said that he had n't .
" There are some good , legitimate communities , " he says .
" And some hand - wringing goes on in some of them , and there are also the trolls . "
Soghoian believes fake websites and spam are just the beginning , in a political season that will be rife with technological shenanigans .
He envisions more complex scams unfolding :
What 's to stop someone from using a call center in India , for example , to phone U.S. voters in certain precincts and deliberately misinform them about election - day logistics ?
" The internet will increasingly be used for dirty tricks , " Soghoian says .
" It just makes perfect sense , " because of the ease and anonymity involved .
" It used to be people distributing pamphlets , but now you do n't even have to go out and hand them out anymore . "

For my work at Mozilla , I ’m gearing up to talk more about JavaScript 2.0 .
This involves a lot of things ( from reading up on the specification , looking at non-web - based uses of JavaScript , to teaching myself SML ) .
Perhaps most challengingly , however , is the struggle that I ’ve been facing to quantify and understand the shifts being made in the language – and how that relates to JavaScript programming in general .
I think we ’ve seen the JavaScript language move through many individual phases :
The “ We need scripting for web pages ” phase .
( Netscape )
The “ We should standardize this ” phase .
( ECMAScript )
The “ JavaScript is n’t a toy ” phase .
( Ajax )
The “ JavaScript as a programming language ” phase .
I ’m surmising that there ’s this new phase that we ’re starting to enter , one where JavaScript will be treated as a significant programming language – divorced from the concept of web development .
Two significant movements lead me to believe that we ’re at the start of a new era for JavaScript .
JavaScript Speed
A good deal of energy has been put into worrying about JavaScript performance .
This is a great sign .
It ’s sort of a natural progression for a language ( worry about implementation , then standardization and compliance , and finally speed ) .
For proof , look at the work that ’s being done by the different browser vendors :
Mozilla is working on Tamarin ( JIT JavaScript )
Apple is working on Webkit / Safari 3 ( Revamped JS Engine )
Opera is releasing a new JS Engine in Opera 9.5 ( New features and speed improvements )
Microsoft is working on Internet Explorer 8.0 ( A bunch of new JS work )
Non-Web - based Use
I ’ve been reading a lot about the use of JavaScript in non-“ traditional ” situations ; especially in relation to the use of Rhino ( the JavaScript implementation that sits on top of Java and the JVM ) .
Specifically , two projects have really stood out as having a lot of potential .
JavaScript on Rails – Granted , at this point , this project may as well be pure vaporware , but it ’s caught the attention of the right people .
When one of the most popular software bloggers talks about how there ’s a “ next big language ” coming up and then announces his massive re-write of the popular Ruby on Rails framework , in JavaScript , running on Rhino – people tend to pay attention .
Helma –
This web application framework is a long standing stalwart of server - side development with JavaScript ( again , using Rhino ) .
Surprisingly , it ’s managed to fall through the cracks with just about every JavaScript developer that I know .
I recently noticed it , and after some startup friends of mine revealed that they ’re developing an application based on it , I became convinced that we ’ll be hearing about this little framework in the upcoming months .
All of this leads me up to a point : JavaScript is actively advancing , as a language .
While it ’s most popular domain will probably always be in web browsers ( with new JavaScript engines pointing in that continued direction ) , the advancement of server - side uses of JavaScript will only make for a much larger area for possible development in the upcoming years .
This is all a convoluted way of saying that this is the perfect opportunity to introduce some much needed changes into the language – completing the extended transition of JavaScript from a toy to a professional development tool .
The recent threat by the Turks to invade Iraq in hot pursuit of PKK terrorists has the administration scrambling to appease Ankara and stave off a major blow to the claim that the U.S. occupation has provided “ stability ” to the region .
Kurdistan , after all , has been touted up until now as a model of peace , prosperity , and unalloyed happiness  a foretaste of the country ’s golden future , provided “ defeatists ” in the U.S. do n’t pull the rug out from under our imminent victory .
To see this veritable utopia smashed by Turkish force of arms would be a disaster for Washington  but even worse would be the revelation of how we got ourselves into this wholly untenable position to begin with .
Worse , that is , for whoever would be indicted and prosecuted for pulling off what may turn out to be one of the most ambitious , and dangerous , “ rogue ” operations since Iran - Contra .
The serial numbers of arms captured from PKK fighters have been traced back to U.S. shipments to Iraqi military and police units .
Responding to Turkish complaints , the Americans claim these arms were diverted by the Iraqis  presumably the Kurdish regional government  but the Turks are n’t buying it : if the large quantity of U.S. - made arms ( 1,260 seized so far ) turns out to have been directly provided to the PKK by the Americans , Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul warned , U.S. - Turkish “ relations would really break apart . ”
U.S. diplomats immediately rebuffed this suggestion , and Washington dispatched the Pentagon ’s general counsel , William J. Haynes , to the scene , where he met with top Turkish military leaders .
According to at least one report , “ The meeting discussed an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Defense into reports that U.S. arms were being sold by U.S. troops in Iraq . ”
Another clue to what is really going on here is provided by the news that the FBI has volunteered to help the Turks find out where the PKK is getting its funding and weapons  and does n’t that strike you as odd ?
FBI director Robert Mueller said , “ We are working with our counterparts elsewhere in Europe and in Turkey to address the PKK and work cooperatively , to find and cut off financing to terrorist groups , be it PKK , al - Qaeda , ” or whatever .
Yet why would the FBI get involved at all , unless , of course , Americans were somehow involved ?
Foreign Minister
Gul confirmed this to the Turkish media , stating :
“ 1,260 weapons captured from the PKK are American - made .
We documented it to the U.S.
These are of course not given directly to the PKK by the U.S.
These are the ones that were given to the Iraqi army .
Unfortunately some U.S. officers were corrupt .
The Department of Defense informed us that a serious investigation is underway . ”
Is it that a few bad apples are “ corrupt ”  or something else ?
As Seymour Hersh has reported , the U.S. and Israel are financing and otherwise aiding the Kurdish Party of Life , known as “ Pejak , ” founded to “ liberate ” western Iran , which has a large and restive Kurdish population .
Furthermore , the ties between the PKK and Pejak are more than merely fraternal : they are basically the same organization , sharing not only bases in the mountainous Quandil region of Kurdistan , but also common personnel and leadership .
The sudden outbreak of PKK violence  two spectacular ambushes , one of which resulted in the killing of 12 Turkish soldiers and the capture of eight , who are now being used as bargaining chips  also requires some explanation .
Up until this point , the PKK had carried out low - level operations , with groups of six to eight militants planting bombs and generally harassing the Turks on a small scale .
In recent months , however , the overall level of attacks has undergone a radical increase , with hundreds of PKK fighters deployed in a single attack and a new sophistication in terms of both firepower and the technical equipment required to pull off complex operations such as the recent ambush - and - capture .
Ever since the Syrians stopped supporting the PKK in the late 1990s , the group was largely incapable of launching major operations and had to content itself with terrorist actions directed at tourist facilities .
Membership was down , cut virtually in half , and the capture of their leader , Abdullah Ocalan , demoralized large sections of the PKK , amid reports of splits .
The revival of the group ’s fortunes coincided with news of the Pejak - U.S. connection and  tellingly  the disappearance of U.S. munitions and other equipment from Iraq .
Nearly one out of every 25 weapons provided to the Iraqis by the U.S. has disappeared .
Furthermore , the system for tracing them never functioned .
370,000 light weapons have been sent to Iraq by the U.S. since 2003 , yet just 3 percent had their serial numbers recorded by the U.S. Defense Department prior to being handed over .
For some unfathomable reason , the general who was in charge of that particular task  by the name of Petraeus  has never been held accountable for what is one of the biggest scandals of the war .
The idea that “ corrupt ” U.S. soldiers sold weapons on the black market to PKK guerrillas is not all that far - fetched , but the absence of any system to account for all these guns invites larger - scale suspicions .
Could it have been set up that way precisely because the Pentagon  or someone else  wanted to make sure the weapons could n’t be traced ?
This would certainly facilitate the arming of groups like Pejak , to put pressure on the Iranians and give the serial regime - changers in the Pentagon a huge weapons cache from which to draw at will .
We know that both the U.S. and Israel have been aiding Pejak , and surely this allowed the PKK to feed off of the arms pipeline , albeit “ indirectly . ”
The Israeli factor is yet another angle to this story : Seymour Hersh also reported that the Israelis have taken out a rather large stake in Kurdistan , not only investing in several major business operations but also involving themselves in the training of Kurdish “ commandos . ”
Could some of these commandos possibly be PKK operatives ?
Both Iran and Turkey have pledged to cooperate in eradicating the Kurdish threat , and this cooperation is yet another reason for the general decline in relations between Ankara on the one hand and Washington and Tel Aviv on the other .
What was once a tight alliance started to unravel when the Turks refused to let the U.S. use their territory as a launching pad for the invasion of Iraq , and things have gone rapidly downhill since .
The regime - changers inside the administration , centered around Dick Cheney ’s office and the civilian upper reaches of the Pentagon , may have decided that the Turks have to be thrown overboard now that the campaign to target Tehran is going full - gear .
If the Kurds ’ price for subverting the Iranian regime is covert aid for their continuing assault on Turkey , then it hardly beggars belief that the War Party is willing to pay it : loyalty is not one of their strong suits , as Iraq ’s Shi’ites can readily attest .
I have a great deal of difficulty believing that the large number of confiscated American weapons that apparently found their way into the hands of PKK fighters just happened to show up on the black market , without any knowledge or complicity by higher authorities .
How high the “ corruption ” goes , remains to be seen .
What we do know is this : the War Party is n’t shy about engaging in “ rogue ” operations and doing end - runs around the properly constituted authorities when it suits their purposes .
A recent demonstration by Turkish students against PKK terrorism had the protesters denouncing both the Kurds and the U.S. government : “ Down with the PKK ! ”  they shouted 
“ Down with the U.S. ! ”
In Turkey , at least , they seem to know who and what is behind the wave of terrorism that has shaken the country .
In America , however , it ’s a different story altogether : the “ news ” media has n’t really said anything about the FBI investigation and the possible involvement of Americans , nor do we hear much about the U.S.  or Israeli  connection to the Kurdish “ liberation ” groups , such as Pejak , except from Hersh and a few others .
As far as the “ mainstream ” media is concerned , what ’s going on between the Turks and the Kurds is just another of those ancient , endless Middle Eastern blood feuds .
No one bothers to ask :
Why is this old problem escalating now ?
That the PKK and Pejak have turned themselves into pawns of the War Party is quite understandable : after all , they want to liberate their people and unite them in the age - old dream of a “ Greater Kurdistan . ”
Like Ahmed Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress , they are ready , willing , and able to use the Americans in order to advance their own agenda .
The question for the U.S. Congress , however , is whether the American taxpayers are now subsidizing terrorism directed at the Turks in order to further the War Party ’s agenda .
Correction Appended
WILMINGTON , Del. , Oct. 5 - The Delaware Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that if an elected official claims he has been defamed by an anonymous blogger , he cannot use a lawsuit to unmask the writer unless he has substantial evidence to prove his claim .
That standard , the court said , " will more appropriately protect against the chilling effect on anonymous First Amendment Internet speech that can arise when plaintiffs bring trivial defamation lawsuits primarily to harass or unmask their critics . "
At issue was a defamation lawsuit filed last year by Patrick Cahill , a councilman in Smyrna , Del. Mr. Cahill said he needed the identity of a blogger who in a September 2004 posting praised the mayor but said Mr. Cahill was divisive and had " an obvious mental deterioration . "
In a second posting , the blogger , named John Doe in the suit , wrote that Mr. Cahill " is as paranoid as everyone in the town thinks he is , " according to court records .
Granted , we were admittedly taken aback when an off - kilter modder shoved a PC into a cow enclosure , but cramming a full - fledged computer into an actual animal takes things to a whole ' nother level .
Animal activism aside , this bizarre creation obviously utilizes a stuffed beaver in order to house the components of a fairly respectable PC , and while we can't be sure , we 're guessing the 2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor , 160GB hard drive , 1GB of RAM , Panasonic DVD writer , and AOpen motherboard are all enjoying their stay in the now - empty stomach region , while the 80 - millimeter Tornado fan is chillin ' right on the beaver 's backside ( shown after the break ) .

HOUSTON , Oct. 2 — Signaling an indefinite halt to executions in Texas , the state ’s highest criminal appeals court late Tuesday stayed the lethal injection of a 28 - year - old Honduran man who was scheduled to be put to death Wednesday .
The reprieve by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals was granted a week after the United States Supreme Court agreed to consider whether a form of lethal injection constituted cruel and unusual punishment barred under the Eighth Amendment .
On Thursday , the Supreme Court stepped in to halt a planned execution in Texas at the last minute , and though many legal experts interpreted that as a signal for all states to wait for a final ruling on lethal injection before any further executions , Texas officials said they planned to move ahead with more .
As a result , Tuesday ’s ruling by the Texas court was seen as a sign that judges in the nation ’s leading death penalty state were taking guidance from the Supreme Court and putting off imminent executions .
The Texas court order gave state authorities up to 30 days to explain in legal papers why the execution of the inmate , Heliberto Chi , should proceed .
With responses then certain from defense lawyers , the effect of the order was to put off the execution for months , lawyers said .
At first glance , this looks like a normal Aquafina bottle , but what you find inside is definitely more than meets the eye .

Intelligence sources contradict myth of ' Osama 's cave ' Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday September 11 , 2007
Print This Email This White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend hit the Sunday political talk circuit to dismiss the new video from Osama Bin Laden as an essentially empty threat , planned in the seclusion of a cave -- but journalist James Gordon Meek tells RAW STORY that his intelligence sources say the popular image of a cornered , cave - bound Bin Laden is a myth .
In a story by Meek posted early Sunday on the website of the New York Daily News -- hours before Townsend made the talk show rounds -- a dozen experts agreed that the top terror leader is more likely to be living in the relative comfort of a " cozy compound " than huddled in a mountainside cave network .
" A lot of people in the intelligence community have -- no surprise -- a very different view of the enemy and the battleground than the White House does , once again , " said Meek in a Monday email interview .
In his piece for the Daily News , Meek had cited a former Pakistan - based CIA station chief , Robert Grenier , who told him that Bin Laden was " probably not living in a cave , " but rather " living in a fairly comfortable , though Spartan , compound somewhere in northern Pakistan . "
" More than a dozen career counterterrorism sources painted essentially the same picture about how [ Bin Laden ] lives day to day , " Meek confirmed to RAW STORY .
Frances Townsend , however , in an appearance on Fox News Sunday , portrayed a weakened , faltering Bin Laden scratching out a harsh fugitive existence .
" This is about the best he can do , " she said .
This is a man on the run from a cave who is virtually impotent other than these tapes . "
Asked why the White House would employ the use of a cave image , even as intelligence officials deny its accuracy , Meek points to history .
" Go back to World War II and look at how we belittled our Japanese and German enemies to harden the national resolve for the fight , " Meek said , calling the language " hyperbole " that was " as old as war itself . "
" So who should we believe ?
This is the same White House that said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , " Meek said .
" If you believed that , then you might buy it that [ Bin Laden ] is living in a cave and too ' impotent ' to plan attacks on America . "
Contrasting the White House characterizations , Meek suggests that Bin Laden videos are actually an indicator of organizational strength .
" As the Daily News first reported over a year ago , the record tempo of Al Qaeda messaging from its top leadership is a major factor in assessing that they are anything but impotent when it comes to operational planning and communications , " he said .
" This was backed up by the recent [ National Intelligence Estimate ] . "
In his Sunday article , Meek noted that since the Fall of 2006 , President Bush and Vice President Cheney had not made public references to caves in connection to Bin Laden 's whereabouts -- a tack may have changed , as evidenced by Townsend 's comments on Sunday .
Townsend also seemed to downplay the threat posed by the Bin Laden tape .
" Capturing and killing Bin Laden is the number one priority , but it 's not our only priority .
We also have to be mindful of current ongoing threats against this country , " she told CNN .
On Fox , Townsend said " We take it seriously , but this tape appears to be nothing more than threats .
It 's propaganda on their part . "
Monday morning , following reports that a second Al Qaeda tape would be released , even normally friendly Fox News commentators questioned Townsend 's remarks .
One
Fox anchor wondered aloud whether it was wise for the White House to " taunt " Bin Laden .
As to the Bush administration 's charges that Bin Laden remains confined to a cave , Meek says it 's possible -- just unlikely .
" Of course [ Bin Laden ] could be hiding in a cave .
He built very impressive cave fortifications in Tora Bora many years before the 9/11 attacks .
But that 's beside the point , " Meek said .
" In almost a decade of covering terrorism , this is the first time that I can remember so many intel people agreeing on one thing , " he continued .
" The only disagreement among them was about which region in northwestern Pakistan [ he ] actually is hiding in and which Pakistani leaders are protecting him .
" That 's extraordinary , " said Meek .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. spy technology is expected to help law enforcement and immigration officials keep a closer watch on U.S. borders .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell will partly oversee the satellite program .
Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence , gave the Department of Homeland Security expanded authority to use spy satellites to monitor images on borders within the United States , officials tell CNN .
There are certain details these satellites cannot pick up , such as close - up images of someone 's face .
Verbal communication will not be picked up , officials said .
Charles Allen , chief intelligence officer with the Department of Homeland Security , said the move will also help with security during natural disasters .
Spy satellites were used for Hurricane Katrina efforts and have monitored the World Series , presidential inaugurals and the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah .
They mapped out damage at the World Trade Center , too .
" This is a development all Americans should have great pride in , because it expands and uses the national technical systems that we 've built for tens of billions of dollars over many decades , " Allen said .
" Now we 're going to use it to help us protect the homeland and also help the homeland respond and recover in case of hurricanes , earthquakes , natural disasters or man-made attacks upon the United States . "
Watch how officials plan to use satellites and critics ' concerns »
But civil rights advocates and others are concerned there is little unbiased oversight to a system they say is tantamount to domestic spying .
The Pentagon and CIA are not allowed to spy on U.S. residents .
" The government can wire - tap phone calls , the government can use infrared technology , the government can use X -ray and other devices , " said James Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" The question always comes down to , what are the standards , are there checks and balances ? "
McConnell and the Senate Intelligence Committee , which oversees all of the Department of Homeland Security 's operations , will monitor the satellite program .
In a May letter , McConnell gave Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff the authority to determine some of the priorities for the satellites , officials said .
The first phase , starting October 1 , will involve such missions as trying to detect illegal movement .
Because there are complicated issues regarding laws and civil liberties , the satellites will not be used for law enforcement purposes until next year , an official said .

LOS ANGELES , Aug. 20 — Hollywood ’s squabble over which of two technologies will replace standard DVDs reignited Monday with two studios throwing their weight behind one format and several rivals ramping up support for the other .
Paramount , part of Viacom , and the publicly held DreamWorks Animation said they would exclusively back the HD DVD format for the release of high - definition movies on disc .
Among the movies the studios plan to release in the format are “ Transformers ” and “ Shrek the Third . ”
Until now , Paramount has released titles in both HD DVD and a competing format , Blu-ray .
DreamWorks Animation has not released a movie in either .
The battle over the competing high - definition DVD technologies has sputtered in recent months as Blu-ray discs have emerged as the front - runner .
Blu-ray titles are sharply outselling HD offerings , major retailers like Target are stocking only Blu-ray players , and Blockbuster recently said it would carry Blu-ray exclusively .
A South Los Angeles woman told police Tuesday that her boyfriend tried to kill both of them when he drove their car into the path of a high - speed Metrolink train but later denied the allegation .
Michelle Wright , 23 , told detectives from her hospital bed that in the minutes before Brandon Julius Funches , 21 , also of South Los Angeles , drove onto the train tracks around noon Monday the couple had been arguing , said Lt. George Rock of the Los Angeles Police Department .
She said when they reached the crossing gate in Pacoima that , instead of stopping , Funches pulled around two other cars and parked on the tracks , placing the passenger side of the car in the path of the train , Rock said .
“ Her impression was he intentionally stopped there so they would both be killed , ” Rock said .
“ She could not recall if he said anything at that moment ....
She was terrified the train was bearing down on her . ”

Wright survived the crash but Funches was killed when he was hit with debris after he was ejected from the vehicle , police said .
Wright told investigators she did not remember her boyfriend making any effort to get out of the 2005 Dodge Magnum before the collision .
Based on Wright ’s statement and witness accounts , detectives have deemed the incident to be “ an attempted murder - suicide , ” Rock said .
But in a telephone interview with a Times reporter Tuesday afternoon , Wright said Funches never intended to kill her .
“ He was n’t trying to kill anybody , ” she said .
“ He was trying to outrun the train . ”

Wright said the couple had been rushing from one auto body shop to another looking for a car part .
She said she had an 18 - month old daughter waiting for her at home .
“ I did n’t tell them that my future husband was trying to kill me , ” she said .
“ He would n’t do that . ”
Wright , who also denied that the couple had been arguing at the time of the crash , said she was dazed when she talked to detectives .
“ I told them I did n’t remember nothing , ” she said .
“ I told them he was trying to outrun the train . ”
Wright said she had known
Funches for years and been romantically involved with him for three months .
But during her interview with a reporter she seemed unaware of his death .
“ Where is Brandon ? ” she asked at one point .
Several members of Funches ’ family also dismissed police accounts of what happened .

“ For them to say it was murder - suicide -- it was not right , ” said Michael Ashford , Funches ’ uncle .
“ That is not him .
It was just bad judgment . ”
Police said Wright survived because Funches might have pulled slightly askew onto the track , causing the train to hit the car ’s rear quarter panel and passenger door and sending it spinning into the guardrail .
When the train hit the car again , Funches was ejected , Rock said .
Wright , who remains hospitalized , suffered numerous cuts and a concussion .

Prosecutor HÃ¥kan Roswall announced that he plans to press charges against 5 people involved with The Pirate Bay before January 31 , 2008 .
The 5 are suspected of facilitating copyright infringement .
The Pirate Bay team does not believe that Roswall will be successful in his attempt to take down The Pirate Bay .
They keep repeating that they are just running a search engine and did not store any copyrighted material on their servers .
On top of that , information that leaked earlier this year showed that the Swedish police could n’t find any usable evidence on the servers they confiscated during the raid last year .
One of the biggest surprises is that the prosecutor plans to press charges against the well - known Swedish neo-fascist Carl Lundstrom , who is only remotely related to The Pirate Bay .
Tobias Andersson , one of the Pirate Bay admins , admitted that Lundstrom ’s hosting company Rix Telecom offered them cheap bandwidth in the past .
However , this was only because one of the Pirate Bay founders used to work for Rix Telecom , nothing more , nothing less .
It is not unlikely that Roswall decided to include Lundstrom in the list of suspects to manipulate public opinion .
LundstrÃ¶m did confirm to IDG.se that he is under investigation , but refuses to be interrogated by the police .
At this point we only know that Peter Sunde ( aka Brokep ) and Carl Lundstrom are identified as suspects , but the complete list will be published here as soon as it is known .
Whatever the outcome of this case will be , The Pirate Bay have already announced that they ’re here to stay .
They told us that they will simply move to another country if they are outlawed in Sweden , without downtime !

… the current dominant opinion supporting the war on drugs in general , and our antimarijuana laws in particular , is reminiscent of the opinion that supported the nationwide ban on alcohol consumption when I was a student .
While alcoholic beverages are now regarded as ordinary articles of commerce , their use was then condemned with the same moral fervor that now supports the war on drugs .
The ensuing change in public opinion occurred much more slowly than the relatively rapid shift in Americans ’ views on the Vietnam War , and progressed on a state - by - state basis over a period of many years .
But just as prohibition in the 1920’s and early 1930 ’s was secretly questioned by thousands of otherwise law - abiding patrons of bootleggers and speakeasies , today the actions of literally millions of otherwise law - abiding users of marijuana, 9 and of the majority of voters in each of the several States that tolerate medicinal uses of the product ,10 lead me to wonder whether the fear of disapproval by those in the majority is silencing opponents of the war on drugs .
Surely our national experience with alcohol should make us wary of dampening speech suggesting — however inarticulately — that it would be better to tax and regulate marijuana than to persevere in a futile effort to ban its use entirely .
Location :
As noted by Pete Guither in his excellent ' Bong Hits 4 Jesus ' coverage , this passage from Justice Stevens in his dissenting opinion is quite remarkable :
What a profound statement on the importance of publicly debating marijuana laws .
Rarely , if ever , has a member of the Court addressed this issue with such candor .
It 's also noteworthy that his colleagues , Souter and Ginsburg , signed onto this .
Stevens 's point can't reasonably be characterized as a direct critique of marijuana laws , but he certainly endeavors to legitimize that viewpoint in the marketplace of political ideas .
Although the ' Bong Hits 4 Jesus ' banner itself lost today , this case has provided a strong indication of the Court 's familiarity with the political debate over our nation 's drug laws .
What appears on the surface to be a victory in the anti-drug crusade has proven to be more nuanced , which may explain why ONDCP has remained silent today .
A magnetic map of emerging sunspot 10926 recorded by Hinode in Dec. 2006 .
" We 've never seen anything quite like it , " says solar physicist Lika Guhathakurta from NASA headquarters .
Last week she sat in an audience of nearly two hundred colleagues at the " Living with a Star " workshop in Boulder , Colorado , and watched in amazement as Saku Tsuneta of Japan played a movie of sunspot 10926 breaking through the turbulent surface of the sun .
Before their very eyes an object as big as a planet materialized , and no one was prepared for the form it took .
" It looks like a prehistoric trilobite , " said Marc De Rosa , a scientist from Lockheed Martin 's Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory in Palo Alto , Calif .
" To me it seemed more like cellular mitosis in which duplicated chromosomes self - assemble into two daughter cells , " countered Guhathakurta .
Click here and decide for yourself .
( From beginning to end , the movie spans 6 days .
The " trilobite " centered above is about the size of Earth . )
" This movie is a magnetogram — a dynamic map tracing the sunspot's intense magnetism , " Guhathakurta explains .
" Black represents negative ( S ) polarity , and white represents positive ( N ) . "
The data were gathered by the Japanese Space Agency 's Hinode spacecraft , launched in Sept. 2006 on a mission to study sunspots and solar storms .
" This is the highest resolution magnetogram ever taken from space , " says Tsuneta , Hinode 's chief scientist at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Tokyo .
" It 's showing us things we 've never seen before . "
Magnetograms are the best way to study sunspots .
Why ?
Although sunspots may appear solid and sturdy , they are not made of matter .
Sunspots are planet - sized knots of magnetism created by the sun 's inner dynamo .
Born in the depths , they bob to the solar surface where they can shift , merge , split and even appear to " swim . "
" Sometimes the shifting and merging gets out of hand , " says Guhathakurta .
" Magnetic fields become unstable and explode , producing a powerful solar flare . "
The effects are manifold : flares can disrupt communications on Earth , disable satellites , threaten astronauts with deadly radiation storms and ( on the bright side ) trigger lovely aurora borealis -- the Northern Lights .
Although researchers have been studying flares for more than a century , they still cannot issue accurate flare forecasts -- something astronauts in orbit or en route to the Moon would dearly love to have .
Improving this situation is a key goal of the Hinode mission .
Participants at the Living With A Star workshop were amazed by the quality of Hinode 's data .
" The sensitivity of Hinode 's Solar Optical Telescope is much higher than anything we 've ever launched before .
This allows Hinode to detect even the very faintest magnetic fields . "
By watching the ebb and flow of magnetism and the surprising forms that emerge , " we hope to understand the behavior of sunspots and predict their eruptions . "
But first they 've got to deal with the trilobites .
" We have a lot of work to do , " says Guhathakurta .
" But what a wonderful problem . "

Obama spokeswoman : ' We should be encouraging young people to participate in the political process — not looking for ways to shut them out . '
Young activists furious with Clinton , Dodd
Many youth activists are furious with the campaigns of Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) for suggesting that college students who did not grow up in Iowa should not caucus there in January — and they are delivering that message both publicly and privately .
“ It ’s terrible to have candidates making misleading statements about whether or not students can caucus , ” said Alexandra Acker , executive director of the Young Democrats of America .
Advertisement
“ I ’m very worried about the caucus - day implications of this , ” Acker said , concerned that discouraging students from caucusing will make an existing problem worse .
“ Students are disenfranchised at higher rates to begin with . ”
Young Voter PAC , another Democratic youth organization , has also responded aggressively .
The political action committee , which works with Democratic candidates to engage young voters , founded the Facebook group “ Hey Clinton , Stop Telling Young Voters to Stay Home . ”
Rock the Vote issued a statement encouraging students from out of state to vote .
Student PIRGs Young Voters Project put out a release from a number of its student leaders in Iowa saying , “ We live here in Iowa for the majority of the year . …
To say that students who did n’t grow up in Iowa , but who now live here , should n’t have the choice to participate in the caucuses is blatant voter disenfranchisement . ”
The argument centers on whether to encourage Iowa college students from out of state to caucus in Iowa — as the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) is doing — or to frown at it , as the Clinton and Dodd campaigns have hinted at .
Drawing an implicit contrast with the Obama campaign , Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee said , " We are not systematically trying to manipulate the Iowa caucuses with out - of - state people ; we do n't have literature recruiting out - of - state college students . ”
And Dodd ’s Iowa state Director Julie Andreeff Jensen accused Obama of “ scheming to evade either the spirit or the letter of the rules that guide the process . ”
By last week , it seemed that youth activists like Acker had made some headway when both campaigns released statements saying that all eligible voters should caucus .
But both candidates and their surrogates have continued to sound ambiguous notes since then .
Dodd declared that students who did not grow up in Iowa should not caucus , saying , " If you 're from Hartford , Conn. , and you 're going to school at the University of Iowa , and you 're paying out - of - state tuition , you 're [ unfairly ] casting yourself as an Iowan . "
David Yepsen , the influential Des Moines Register columnist , criticized the Obama campaign Dec. 1 for distributing a pamphlet informing student supporters that even if they are out of state on Jan. 3 they can return to Iowa and caucus at their school precinct .
Yepsen wrote , “ These are the Iowa caucuses .
Asking people who are ' not from Iowa ' to participate in them changes the nature of the event . ”
Yepsen himself admits that it ’s legal for any student at a four - year college in Iowa to vote .
The Iowa secretary of state posts information on how students can caucus from their campus address .
But the Clinton and Dodd campaigns seized on the opening to appeal to older Iowans ’ potential resentment of Obama ’s support from young people by issuing statements echoing Yepsen ’s sentiments .
And Sen. Joe Biden ( Del. ) said the Obama campaign was “ tamper[ing ] with the caucus . ”
Then on Monday former President Bill Clinton waffled in response to a question at Grinnell College in Iowa about whether Sen. Clinton wanted Grinnell students from out of state to caucus for her .
Clinton revealed the campaign ’s new line of attack on students from out of state by saying , “ If this is your primary political identity then you should vote , but if it is n’t and you ’re going to turn right back around and vote in a primary the next day then you should n’t because it means that your primary identity is not in Iowa . ”
The Hillary campaign has since issued a statement encouraging students to vote provided they do n’t fraudulently participate in both their home state primary and the caucuses .
The Clinton campaign did not provide evidence that this has ever happened , or explain the cause of their sudden concern about it , when asked by Politico .
Alec Schierenbeck , 20 , is the president of College and Young Democrats of Iowa and said he intends to caucus , though he is undecided on a candidate .
Schierenbeck , a junior at Grinnell who hails from Brooklyn , N.Y. , was in the audience and said he was horrified by Clinton ’s answer .
“ This is a Republican tactic , ” said Schierenbeck , citing the campaign of Danny Carroll , the former Republican state representative for Grinnell ’s district .
He sent a mailing in his 2004 reelection campaign that asked , " [ W ] hy would you let 1,000 east - coast liberal kids elect your representative ? ” in reference to Grinnell students .
( In fact , less than half Grinnell ’s 1,400 students are from East Coast states . )
Schierenbeck is hardly the only politically involved student from out of state in Iowa .
As Politico has reported , the co-chair of Hillary Clinton ’s University of Iowa student chapter , Nikki Dziuban , is from Illinois .
She intends to caucus for Clinton and will bring other Iowa students from Illinois back to school over winter break with her .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ’s campaign has drawn criticism from other campaigns for refusing to sign a pledge saying that campaign workers who moved to Iowa to work for him will not caucus .
But the Richardson camp has also said that it will not encourage student supporters who grew up out of state to come back for the caucuses .
Richardson ’s spokesman Tom Reynolds suggests that doing so violates “ the spirit of the law . ”
Obama , meanwhile , has not backed down .
Campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told Politico in an e-mail , “ We should be encouraging young people to participate in the political process — not looking for ways to shut them out . ”
Schierenbeck agreed .
“ We do n’t have a student over - engagement problem in this country , we have an under - engagement problem .
Every elected official should take every opportunity to encourage young people to vote . ”
EDITOR'S NOTE :
This article was updated on Dec. 13 to note that Bill Clinton ’s comments did include a remark specifying that he was talking about caucusing in Iowa and voting in another state 's primary election .
It was also updated to clarify details about the question posed to President Clinton .
The question was not asked by a Clinton - supporting student from Minnesota , but by a student from Nebraska who does not support Clinton .
The confusion arose because his question was about a friend of his from Minnesota who received an invitation to the event from the Clinton campaign .
Any extension of those measures into the rest of the country , known as the Red Zone , could quickly turn into armed confrontation .
Westerners are wary of Interior Ministry checkpoints , some of which have been fake , as well as of ministry units , which are sometimes militia - controlled and have been implicated in sectarian killings .
Western convoys routinely have to choose between the risk of stopping and the risk of accelerating past what appear to be official Iraqi forces .
Image Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani said Iraqi forces would ensure that new licensing rules were being observed .

And because Western convoys run by private security companies are often protecting senior American civilian and military officials , the Iraqi government ’s struggle with the companies has in some cases become a sort of proxy tug - of - war with the United States .
That dynamic was laid bare in the weeks immediately after the shooting on Sept. 16 in Nisour Square in Baghdad .
The Iraqi government at first suggested that it would ban Blackwater , which has a contract to protect American diplomats , from working in Iraq .
But the government was embarrassed when it discovered that its legal options were limited , and the United States — after placing a few new restrictions on the company — quickly sent it back onto the streets .
Based on its own investigation , the Iraqi government has concluded that the Blackwater guards who opened fire committed murder .
An American investigation led by the F.B.I. has not yet publicly announced any results .
The outlines of a struggle for primacy on the streets also seem apparent in what the Interior Ministry says is a decision to insist that weapons carried by members of Shiite - controlled militias that protect certain neighborhoods must also be registered .
Asked about the vast areas of Baghdad patrolled by the powerful Mahdi Army , which was founded by the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr , General Khalaf said that it too would be challenged .
“ In the near future there is a campaign that will happen , ” General Khalaf said .
“ We are delaying this campaign until we finish this database . ”
' Cheeseburger bill ' puts bite on lawsuits House passes legislation to curb fast - food obesity claims
The House passed a bill that would block class - action lawsuits against the makers of fast food on obesity claims .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS McDonald 's Corporation Lawsuits Food U.S. House of Representatives or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that would block lawsuits by people who blame fast - food chains for their obesity .
The " cheeseburger bill , " as it has been dubbed in Congress , stems from class - action litigation that accused McDonald 's of causing obesity in children .
The legislation 's backers say matters of personal responsibility do n't belong in the courts .
" As one judge put it , if a person knows or should know that eating copious orders of super - sized McDonald 's products is unhealthy and could result in weight gain , it is not the place of the law to protect them from their own excesses , " said Rep. James Sensenbrenner , R- Wisconsin , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
The bill seeks to thwart class - action obesity lawsuits against food manufacturers and restaurants .
In a lawsuit filed in 2002 , two Bronx teenagers accused McDonald 's of making them fat by serving them highly processed food that affected their health .
A judge tossed out the case a year later , but an appeals court reinstated part of the suit earlier this year , according to published reports .
The legislation does not block all legal action against the food industry .
A lawsuit would still be permitted if a person got sick from contaminated food .
Citing statistics that obesity among children has doubled in the past three decades , with one in three children currently overweight , some committee members argued that fast - food companies need to be held accountable for their harmful products .
" Congress has allowed the need of big corporations before the need of our children , " said Rep. Bob Filner , D - California .
The House bill passed 307- 119 , but it faces an uncertain future in the Senate .
A similar bill passed the House during the last Congress , but the Senate never acted on it .
About 20 states have passed similar legislation , according to reports .

Earlier long - necked pots would have been used for beer making .
Chemical evidence in a pot such as this is seen as proof that beer brewing involved fermenting cacao ( Illustration : PNAS / National Academy of Sciences )
Pots with shorter , wider necks were used for making the frothed chocolate drink after 900 BC ( Image : PNAS / National Academy of Sciences )
Chocolate was first produced by the ancients as a by - product of beer , suggests a new archaeological study .
And evidence from drinking vessels left by the Mesoamericans who developed chocolate suggests that the source of chocolate , cacao , was first used 500 years earlier than thought .
Mesoamericans – who flourished in central America before it was colonised by the Spanish – developed chocolate as a by - product of fermenting cacao fruit to make a beer - like drink called chicha still brewed by South American tribal people .

The Mesoamericans before Columbus ’s time , developed a taste for the chocolate , but their cousins down in South America stuck with the beer , says Cornell University archaeologist John Henderson , who led the new study .
Unsweetened chocolate drinks became a central element of Mesoamerican cultures including the Aztecs , from whom Europeans learned of chocolate in the 16th century .
Archaeologists have found pottery made to serve the frothed chocolate drink preferred by the pre-Columbians in earlier sites , and have found traces of chocolate in pots dating back to 600 BC .
But the origins of the drink had been unclear .
Chemical clues
Chocolate ’s unique flavour develops only when the watery pulp of raw cacao fruit and seeds are fermented together , colouring the seeds purple .
Grinding the seeds yields the chocolate .
“ It struck us that it was n’t obvious how to do this , ” says study co-author Rosemary Joyce at the University of California at Berkeley .
The involvement of fermentation led her and Henderson to speculate that cacao beer might have been the originating process
Only now has hard evidence come to light in the form of pot sherds dating from 200 BC to before 1100 BC that they found in the ruins of an ancient village called Puerto Escondido in the Ulúa Valley in Honduras .
Harnessing a technique developed by Patrick McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania , they were able to extract chocolate residues from the pores in the pottery .
Tests found theobromine – a chemical signature of cacao – in 11 of 13 fragments , including one that Joyce estimates dates from 1100 to 1200 BC .
‘ Smoking gun ’
That pushed evidence for cacao drinking back 500 years .
That pot , and others older than about 900 BC , also lacked any traces of the chilli pepper Mesoamericans used to spice up their chocolate .
Pots designed for making a frothed chocolate first appeared after this date , the researchers report .
The oldest fragment was the long neck of a bottle that could have held beer , but could not have been used to make the frothed chocolate beverage that became popular later .
Joyce called that “ the smoking gun ” showing that beer had come first .
She suggests that the key step in switching to chocolate came when ancient brewers ground up the cacao seeds remaining after fermentation and added them to thicken the beer – giving it a chocolate taste .

The United States Bridge Federation has dropped its effort to punish six members of the women ’s championship bridge team for holding up a sign that said “ We did not vote for Bush ” during an awards ceremony last month in Shanghai .
In exchange , the women have agreed to a statement recognizing the federation ’s right to request that bridge teams representing the country refrain from using awards ceremonies for anything other than accepting medals .
“ I feel vindicated , ” said Jill Levin , one of the players .
Jan Martel , the president of the federation , said the agreement ended an affair that had become “ divisive ” and “ polarizing . ”
“ We all believe it was in the best interests of bridge to have this resolved , ” Ms. Martel said , “ and we all care much more about those interests than our own egos . ”
She said she hoped publicity from the dispute would attract new players to the game .
What Kind of House Will $ 100 Million Buy ?
A growing population of billionaires is driving real estate prices sky - high .
June 01 , 2007 Special to ABCNEWS.com  --
Call it quaint , but there was a time when a $ 75 million house made news .
In 2005 , that 's what happened when the Three Ponds Estate in Bridgehampton N.Y. , landed at the top of our list of most expensive homes in the U.S .
No more .
That number is practically pocket change compared with what the market currently bears .
This year , the country 's priciest properties include a $ 135 million Aspen , Colo. , ranch and a $ 125 million Versailles - inspired estate in Beverly Hills , Calif .
Why such price acceleration in the top - flight market ?
The simple answer : a good mega-mansion is hard to find .
" Try to find eight or 10 acres in the middle of the Hollywood Hills , " says Mauricio Umansky , a broker at Hilton & Hyland .
" God 's not making any more land .
[ Trophy properties ] are a true microeconomy with much less supply than demand . "
In addition , the financial muscle of flush buyers allows for quite a bit of upward price flexibility .
Twenty percent of a household 's wealth consists of home equity , according to the National Association of Realtors .
Following that logic , steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal -- worth $ 32 billion -- could easily afford $ 6.4 billion in housing .
" The net worth of the buyers and the sellers is such that they can do whatever they want , " says Joshua Saslove of Joshua & Co. , an Aspen - based affiliate of Christie 's Great Estates .
" The rules of the regular real estate market do n't apply . "
Sellers who find themselves able to piece together huge pieces of land in desirable locations can expect large listings .
Gigantic Gems
The latest addition to the $ 100 million - plus club is Suzanne Saperstein 's Los Angeles jewel aptly named the Fleur de Lys. Listed at $ 125 million and built in the style of Louis XIV 's palace at Versailles , the 45,000 - square - foot home took five years to construct following the accumulation of five acres in Beverly Hills during the 1990s by Saperstein and her now ex-husband , billionaire David Saperstein .
In Florida , beachfront land drives the highest - end market .
" There 's nothing under $ 20 million that has 120 feet of ocean frontage in Palm Beach , " says Cristina Condon at Sotheby 's International Realty .
" [ Trump 's house ] has 475 feet on the ocean . "
While it 's not news that private jets and telecommunications make the world smaller , an increasing number of buyers for trophy properties are international .
This , says Peter Kozel , executive managing director of Newmark Knight Frank , an international real estate appraisal firm , " is easy to understand in light of the cheap dollar . "

What better place to develop a foothold in the U.S. than in the most desirable neighborhoods of Malibu , Aspen , Palm Beach or the Hamptons ?
" Trophy properties can serve as a branding for big , new money , " says Dolly Lenz , a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman .
" For a Russian oligarch , a trophy home in New York or Palm Beach is a way to brand themselves in the U.S. "
As a result , brokerage houses are ratcheting up their efforts to reach out to potential buyers all around the world .
" International marketing has been very good for our [ Florida ] properties , " says Condon .
" We advertise in Russia , Asia and the Middle East . "
But problems can arise when it comes to verifying those international buyers .
In order to schedule a showing of a $ 65 million or $ 125 million home , brokers need to know you can afford to buy the house beforehand .
If you do n't appear on the Forbes billionaires list , a simple note from a Swiss banker will do .
" The hardest thing for me is to differentiate the people who contact me , to find out if they 're real , " says Lenz .
" They can get very annoyed , but I need to know they can write the check . "
Ah , the check .
Sometimes there is no need .
After all , when an international jet - setter pays $ 100 million for a third or fourth home , why take out a mortgage ?
Many top - tier transactions are " done in cash , " says Condon .

As for which mega-mansion will sell first , it 's anyone 's guess .
The decision to purchase a home of such caliber comes down , more than anything , to personal preference .
" Think of it this way , " says Umansky .
" I could put three mega - yachts in a line -- one contemporary , one traditional and one Mediterranean .
I do n't know which one is going to sell because I do n't know which one Larry Ellison or Bill Gates is going to pick . "
While both groups used just four genes to reprogram human skin cells , two of the genes used differed from group to group .
All the genes in question , though , act in a similar way — they are master regulator genes whose role is to turn other genes on or off .
The reprogrammed cells , the scientists report , appear to behave very much like human embryonic stem cells but were called “ induced pluripotent stem cells , ” meaning cells that can change into many different types .
“ By any means we test them they are the same as embryonic stem cells , ” Dr. Thomson says .
He and Dr. Yamanaka caution , though , that they still must confirm that the reprogrammed human skin cells really are the same as stem cells they get from embryos .
And while those studies are under way , Dr. Thomson and others say , it would be premature to abandon research with stem cells taken from human embryos .
Another caveat is that , so far , scientists use a type of virus , a retrovirus , to insert the genes into the cells ’ chromosomes .
Retroviruses slip genes into chromosomes at random , sometimes causing mutations that can make normal cells turn into cancers .
One gene used by the Japanese scientists actually is a cancer gene .
The cancer risk means that the resulting stem cells would not be suitable for replacement cells or tissues for patients with diseases , like diabetes , in which their own cells die .
But they would be ideal for the sort of studies that many researchers say are the real promise of this endeavor — studying the causes and treatments of complex diseases .
For example , researchers could make stem cells from a person with a disease like Alzheimer ’s and turn the stem cells into nerve cells in a petri dish .
Then they might learn what goes awry in the brain and how to prevent or treat the disease .
But even the retrovirus drawback may be temporary , scientists say .
Dr. Yamanaka and several other researchers are trying to get the same effect by adding chemicals or using more benign viruses to get the genes into cells .
They say they are starting to see success .
The recent armed robbery of a Chicago - based co-location facility has customers hopping mad after learning it was at least the fourth forced intrusion in two years .
They want to know how C I Host , an operator that vaunts the security of its data centers , could allow the same one to be penetrated so many times .
" I can't believe a datacenter has been broken into that many times , " said Nick Krapf , president of Bloodservers.com , a startup game hosting provider , who said $ 15,000 worth of Dell servers were stolen in the October 2 heist .
" What do you got to do to secure your facility for it not to happen ?
We 're pulling all our equipment from all their other facilities . "
In recent years , many IT administrators have found religion about installing security patches and deploying other measures such as intrusion prevention systems to keep criminals from accessing their systems and the data stored on them .
The series of break - ins at C I Host is a reminder that safeguards must also extend to more mundane protections , including dead - bolt locks and steel cages .
CI Host likes to vaunt the security of its Chicago - based colocation facility , noting that safeguards include multiple layers of 24x7 security cameras , proximity card readers , biometric access controls and key pads , double - locking mantraps at data center entrance and 360 - degree perimeter and roof surveillance .
And yet , the same location has been the target of at least four burglaries or robberies since August 2005 , according to police reports and former customers , some of whom say they lost sensitive data and hundreds of thousands of dollars in hardware .
Representatives from C I Host did n't respond to emails requesting comment for this story .
In the most recent incident , " at least two masked intruders entered the suite after cutting into the reinforced walls with a power saw , " according to a letter C I Host officials sent customers .
" During the robbery , C I Host 's night manager was repeatedly tazered and struck with a blunt instrument .
After violently attacking the manager , the intruders stole equipment belonging to C I Host and its customers . "
At least 20 data servers were stolen , said Patrick Camden , deputy director of news affairs for the Chicago Police Department .
The Chicago location has been hit by similar breaches in the past , according to police reports .
One report detailing an occurrence on September 23 , 2005 , recounts a " hole cut through the wall coming out onto the hallway of third floor . "
During a September 20 , 2006 incident , an intruder " placed a silver + blk handgun to [ victim 's ] head and stated ' lay down on the floor . ' "
The victim , a C I Host employee , was then blindfolded , bound with black tape and struck on the head with a weapon , according to the report .
To add insult to injury , C I Host representatives have n't been particularly quick to alert customers of the robberies .
It took them several days to admit the most recent breach , according to several customers who say they lost equipment .
According to James F. Ruffer III , support people told him his server was down because the company had a problem with one of its routers .
Krapf , the Bloodservers.com president , said he was told the same thing , as did several people recounting their experience on this forum .
" From a business owner perspective , my reputation is worth more to me than money , " said Ruffer .
" The longer they waited the more money each particular person was losing .
They should have been upfront and right on the ball . " ®

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer ;
Things fall apart ; the centre cannot hold ;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world
In the aftermath of the First World War , William Butler Yeats wrote those words , the beginning of a dark and majestic gaze into his view of the world as it is , and how it should be .
Eighty - five years later , a lone figure stands in a train station , the corrupting image of a dictator staring down from above , speaking of necessities and consequences and the superior race that is only looking out for the people 's best interests .
These two events seem completely disconnected from one another , but perhaps they are more familiar than they seem .
Let 's concentrate on this lone figure .
The stuff of myth and legend in this tattered world , the man is called the only " free man " by the inhabitants of this desiccated plain .
His exploits at an uncertain time in the past at a scientific compound known as Black Mesa have spread to pockets of resistance members , the men , women and otherworldly creatures that seek to overthrow the dominion of the Combine , a race that has transported itself into the world , crippled its defenses and enslaved its species , all in a period of seven hours .
Signs of their destructive power litter the landscape , and even show themselves in the vast oceans , which are gradually receding into nothingness as they are sapped from the planet .
The resources of this once - vibrant world are being spirited away to some alien place , while the population is helpless to stop it .
Thus begins Half - Life 2 , which , according to the Metacritic score , is the best first - person shooter of all time ; and I think I would find few people to argue with that .
While not hailed with quite a revolutionary brush as the original , the sequel improves and builds upon every aspect of the genre it re-invented .
For those of you who 've been living under a gaming rock :
You are Gordon Freeman , a theoretical physicist at the top- secret Black Mesa Research Facility .
An experiment causes a portal to open in time and space , unleashing all sorts of alien hell on the world .
You explore the facility , occasionally guided by the hand of the G - Man , a mysterious gentleman in a business suit .
At the end of the first game , Gordon is put into a sort of stasis , and at an untold point in the future he is reawakened by the G - Man , now set upon a new and dangerous path .
The cultural significance of the Half - Life series has been woefully under -examined .
Most reviews and interpretations of the game have focused on the gameplay ( which is admittedly excellent ) , the realistic facial systems and its immersive qualities .
Less regarded are the plot 's purposefulness and its metaphorical importance .
Pedestrian comparisons to Orwell 's 1984 are unavoidable , but perhaps the real meat of the saga , which is mostly contained in the sequel , borrows its roots from other sources .
Two US Army deserters who fled to Canada and sought refugee status on grounds of their opposition to the war in Iraq have lost their bids to have the Supreme Court of Canada hear their cases .
The court refused to hear the appeals of Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey Thursday , who were rejected two years ago by Canada ’s immigration authorities .
The board ruled they would not be at risk of their lives if they returned to the United States , nor were they at risk of " cruel and unusual treatment or punishment . "
Hinzman and Hughey deserted the US Army in 2004 after learning their units were being deployed to Iraq to fight in a war they have called immoral and illegal .
The men argue that serving in Iraq would force them to commit crimes against civilians , and that they would be persecuted if forced to return to the United States .
There are currently about 200 US Army deserters in Canada .
Among them is Ryan Johnson of Visalia , California .
He fled to Canada in 2005 , the day his unit deployed to Iraq .
" The Canadian government decided not to fight an illegal war , " he told IPS .
" Canada was going to go into the war in Iraq , but then decided that because the UN did not sanction it , Canada would not participate in the war in Iraq .
That ’s a major reason that I came to Canada .
Canada felt the same way I did about the war in Iraq . "
Canadian immigration officials ruled , however , that " as mere footsoldiers , " US war resisters " could not be held responsible for the breach of international law committed by United States in going to Iraq . "
Immigration authorities also ruled that " ordinary footsoldiers are not expected to make own personal assessments as to the legality of any conflict they may be called upon to fight . "
They also said there is no internationally recognized right to object to a particular war .
" It ’s disappointing that the Supreme Court of Canada would not even go as far as to hear our case , " Johnson said .
" It is definitely not something that is pertinent .
They ’ve used legality of war in other refugee cases , I do n’t know why in our case they refused to use the legality of the war in evidence . "
A spokesperson for Canada ’s immigration minister put a different spin on the Supreme Court ’s decision .
" Canadians want a refugee system that helps true refugees , " spokesperson Mike Fraser told Reuters .
" All refugee claimants in Canada have the right to due process and when they have exhausted those legal avenues we expect them to respect our laws and leave the country , " he added .
During the Vietnam War , between 30,000 and 60,000 draft dodgers sought sanctuary in Canada .
Veterans of that fight say the atmosphere in Canada today is very different than it was during the 1960s and 70s .
" Our government is pretty clear that it is pro-[ George W. ]
Bush and [ wants to ] reassure Americans that the Canadian border is very secure , " said Leigh Zaslofsky , who fled the United States in 1970 and now coordinates Canada ’s War Resister Support Campaign .
" When I deserted I was able to apply for permanent residency and obtain it there if I passed a points assessment so that ’s what I did , " he said , " and I was readily admitted to Canada as a permanent resident and did n’t have to worry about being sent back to the United States . "
Even so , US war resisters in Canada are not facing immediate deportation .
After losing their appeal at the Supreme Court , Hinzman and Hughey will now receive a " pre-removal risk assessment , " which is designed to judge whether in the United States they would be at risk of torture , death or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment .
That ’s only the beginning of a drawn - out deportation process that could go on for years .
" We still have a bit of time before anyone is looking at getting sent back imminently , " Ryan Johnson said .
War resisters can also apply for permanent residency in Canada on humanitarian or compassionate grounds .
Meanwhile , supporters of US soldiers who fled across the northern border are turning their efforts toward the Canadian Parliament , which they hope will pass a law overruling existing policy  despite the opposition of Prime Minister Stephen Harper , the National Democratic Party and Bloc Quebecois .
If they can get the center - left Liberal Party to go along , supporters say , such a bill could become law without Harper ’s support .
" When I signed up for the Army in November 2003 , I was thinking there were weapons of mass destruction , that Iraq had ties to 9/11 , " Johnson said .
" Our president , our vice president , [ then defense secretary ] Donald Rumsfeld lied to us .
They betrayed the American people and they ’re betraying every soldier they send over there to fight a war based on false pretenses and greed . "
Johnson has not seen his parents since he fled to Canada more than two years ago .

Franken ' wins ' Ben Stein 's money for Senate run Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday June 20 , 2007 Print This Email
This A former Saturday Night Live writer and Air America host is beginning to pull in some big bucks from some big names for his Senate run , a Capitol Hill newspaper reports .
" Al Franken won Ben Steins money  and high - dollar contributions from scads of other celebrities in his bid for Minnesotas Democratic Senate nomination , according to Federal Election Commission reports , " Nicole Duran reports for Roll Call .
" Stein , who hosted the eponymous Comedy Central game show ' Win Ben Steins Money ' for six years , gave the former ' Saturday Night Live ' writer $ 1,000 . "
Stein , a former speechwriter and lawyer for Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford , received criticism from the right for his support of the left - leaning Franken , revealed in his campaign 's FEC report .
At the Radio Equalizer , Brian Mahoney wanted to know what was " behind Ben Stein 's bizarre contribution , " and points to a " a sharp - eyed blogger " at Fraters Libertas who wrote the longtime Republican to find out why .
The blogger asked Stein " why in the world do you want to stick up poor Minnesotans ( and the rest of the country ) with a comedian who fancies himself a second coming of secular St. Wellstone ? "
" Al is a close friend and one of the smartest people I have ever met , " Stein told the blogger .
The Roll Call article notes that " [ a ] lmost 40 other celebrities from ' Xena , Warrior Princess ' star Lucy Lawless to Larry Hagman  Major Nelson on ' I Dream of Jeannie ' and J.R. Ewing on ' Dallas , ' stoked Frankens campaign war chest .
Lawless gave Franken $ 2,000 and Hagman chipped in $ 500 .
Franken is competing with wealthy Minneapolis attorney Mike Ciresi ( D ) for the right to take on Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) next year . "
Franken 's campaign contributors include a long list of other former " Not - Ready - For - Prime - Time - Players " from SNL , along with actors Paul Newman , Tom Hanks , Kevin Bacon , and comic - turned - host Bill Maher .
Excerpts from article : # Not surprisingly , the man who used to implore SNL  audiences to send your money to me , Al Franken ,  has gotten help from his former  Saturday Night Live colleagues .
Jane Curtin gave Franken $ 4,600 , the most the law allows , while Donna Dixon , a blast - from - the - past sitcom star herself  she co-starred with Tom Hanks on  Bosom Buddies   kicked in $ 2,300 .
Dixon is married to Dan Aykroyd , who in the 70s routinely chided Curtin with :  Jane , you ignorant slut !  from the SNL  news desk .
Speaking of Hanks , he too gave the maximum , $ 4,600 .
 Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels also maxed out to his one - time employee .
Republicans have had fun pointing out all of Frankens celebrity donors and derided him as the  Hollywood  candidate , but Franken spokesman Andy Barr said that caricature is as made up as Frankens Stuart  Im smart enough , I m good enough and gosh darnit , people like me 

I was at MIT today and so I ended up going to an invited talk on computer architecture , Subtle Semantics and Unrestricted Implementation of Transactional Memory .
Transactional Memory is a very hot topic in systems and architecture .
It is perceived to be a better model for programmers , so language designers like it .
And there are a variety of options for pure - software and hardware - assisted implementations .
And because it enables optimistic concurrency control , transactional memory can help make programs faster and more scalable on new multi-core architectures .
There is every reason to believe that processor vendors will begin including some form of hardware support for transactional memory .
The focus of the talk was on the subtle issues that come from this .
It dismissed a few of the more positive myths about transactional memory :
Programs using locks cannot be trivially converted to use transactions .
In fact , a correctly behaving program using locks to manage things like inter - thread communication can easily deadlock or livelock when using transactions .
Transactions are not perfectly composable or nestable , as is often claimed .
This means heirarchical or nested transactions , where there is a program - level transaction wrapping several library - level transactions , can lead to deadlock or livelock .
Whether a transactional system is weak ( non-transactional code executes concurrently with transactional code , with side effects visible between ) or strong transactional ( a transaction is atomic not just from the perspective of other transactions , but also to other non-transactional code ) can have a significant effect on program behavior .
Not only can a program designed for strong transactions have problems under weak transactions , but a program that behaves correctly in a weak transactional system may deadlock in a strong transactional system .
This leads me to two primary conclusions , with which I think the speaker would agree : First , transactional memory can have significant confusing side effects , just like locks , and so it is not a solution to the difficulties of multithreaded programming .
Second , if processor vendors implement , and many programmers use , weak transactions then we may never get strong transactions .
I ’d like to take this one step further .
I think language designers and computer architects who are excited about transactional memory are missing the point .
They are trying to create a single concurrency control mechanism that can solve everyone ’s problems .
In fact , I think there are two separate classes of problem that are best addressed separately : Concurrency control for systems programming , and concurrency control for application programming .
Systems programmers are close to the hardware , inside or right on top of the operating system .
They are the people who are most comfortable with the concurrency control mechanisms of today ( pthreads and java.util.concurrent ) .
Transactional Memory should be targetting these users .
The goal is not to give them an easy way to do concurrency , but to make optimistic concurrency control possible and efficient .
Continuing to discuss the merits of strong and weak transactions is reasonable , but it should be in the context of what most efficiently represents the capabilities of the hardware .
Application programmers generally work on top of a platform , and do n’t have to think about concurrency in the same way .
if they do n’t work on a platform then they should .
For example , application programmers are often writing business applications as web services on top of J2EE .
By using platforms , they can work with much higher level management and concurrency control .
The most common idiom for concurrency control is the database transaction ( or distributed transaction ) .
It is able to handle most concurrency problems in traditional RPC - and - datastore systems .
To help application programmers , we need to develop additional idioms .
Not all programs can utilize the J2EE style of platform .
I expect to see a significant advance in scientific computing tools like MATLAB to take advantage of multiprocessor systems ( in my ideal world it would be by vectorizing based on static and dynamic analysis , but I digress ) .
Furthermore , there are a large set of event processing ( stream processing , complex event processing ) which are also not well served by J2EE - type platforms and database - transactions .
Which is why I work on StreamBase ( and on StreamSQL ) , which is creating next generation programming models for those kinds of applications , to enable parallelization , managability , and scalability .</shameless-plug >
TRENTON  Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed into law a measure repealing New Jersey ’s death penalty on Monday , making the state the first in a generation to abolish capital punishment .
Mr. Corzine also issued an order commuting the sentences of the eight men on New Jersey ’ death row to life in prison with no possibility of parole , ensuring that they will stay behind bars for the rest of their lives .
In an extended and often passionate speech from his office at the state capitol , Mr. Corzine declared an end to what he called “ state - endorsed killing , ” and said that New Jersey could serve as a model for other states .
“ Today New Jersey is truly evolving , ” he said .
“ I believe society first must determine if its endorsement of violence begets violence , and if violence undermines our commitment to the sanctity of life .
To these questions , I answer yes . ”
Children who do not get enough sleep may increase their risk for obesity , a new study has found .
The researchers recorded sleep times and body mass index of 785 children in third grade and then again in sixth .
Children slept an average of 9.45 hours a night in third grade and 8.78 in sixth .
After controlling for sex , race , maternal education , sleep problems like nightmares and other variables , the authors found that for every hour that sleep time declined over the three years , children were about 40 percent more likely to be overweight .
The protective effect came mostly from earlier bedtimes rather than later wake times .
The authors concede that some unmeasured variables could have affected the results .
For example , they write , parents may use food to pacify irritable sleep - deprived children , or sleep - deprived children may request and receive food more often .

The reason for the association is unclear , but parents are apparently not to blame .
“ We examined lax parenting , ” said Dr. Julie C. Lumeng , the lead author of the study , which appeared in the Nov. 5 issue of Pediatrics , “ and lax parenting is not the explanation . ”
Last night I nearly lost a dear friend of mine .
Now this is the sort of story most men , myself included , would understandably want keep to themselves .
Although this deviates from my normal content , I feel a duty to tell all in this age of transparency because while I was in the middle of the ordeal , I turned to Google for help and did n’t find the information I needed .
I write this in the hopes it helps some unfortunate guy in the future .
The story begins late last night around 1:15 AM as I turned in to bed for the night .
Tossing and turning , I started to feel a pain in my lower abdomen and right testicle .
I could feel that my right testicle was swollen and a bit harder than one would expect .
It felt like an impossibly bad case of blue balls .
The worst case imaginable .
Since I hate dealing with hospitals and such , I tried to sleep it off telling myself it would be fine in the morning , as if somehow the Nut - helper Fairy would come in the middle of the night and make it all better .
Suffice it to say , when your genital region is in pain , it ’s pretty damn difficult to get a good night ’s sleep .
You should n’t screw around ( forgive the pun ) when you have a pain in that region .
So I got up , Googled it , found nothing but scary stories about testicular cancer and painful hernias , and decided then I should go see a doctor .
I told my wife I had to go and I proceeded to walk over to the neighborhood Emergency Room at 2:30 AM .
During triage I explained that the pain was around a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 , it was a dull intense pain , not sharp , and it was constant , not coming in waves , centered around my testicle and my lower abdomen area .
After I was moved to a gurney , the doctor began black box testing on me .
It ’s not unlike debugging a bug in code for which you do n’t have any means to step through a debugger .
He ’d prod around narrowing down the possible diagnoses .
However , unlike debugging code , this process was excruciatingly painful .
After manhandling my right nut for a while , the doctor diagnosed me with Testicular Torsion .
Wikipedia defines it thusly …
In testicular torsion the spermatic cord that provides the blood supply to a testicle is twisted , cutting off the blood supply , often causing orchalgia .
Prolonged testicular torsion will result in the death of the testicle and surrounding tissues .
I define it as ow ! ow !
that fucking hurts !
So the doctor leaves to order an ultrasound and returns not long after to “ try one more thing . ”
He then proceeds to grab the nut and twist it around , asking me to let him know when the pain subsides .
Riiiiight .
A man with a latex glove is twisting my nut and asking me when it does n’t hurt ?
It does n’t hurt when you ’re not twisting it !
Exactly how I wanted to spend my Monday morning .
Amazingly enough though , the pain subsided quickly after he stopped .
I did n’t realize at the time that he was twisting it back .
I thought he was just being sadistic .
The male nurse on duty quipped afterwards …
Probably the first time that someone twisting your testicle made you feel better , eh ?
No , twisting my testicle normally elicits feelings of euphoria and joy .
Of course it ’s the first time !
And by Zeus ’s eye I hope it ’s the last .
Afterwards I was pushed on a gurney into the ultrasound room by a big burly Russian dude who proceeded to ultrasound my testicular nether regions .
At this point , there ’s really no point in having any shame or bashfulness .
I just tried to make small talk as he showed me the screen displaying blood flowing nicely .
As I was being discharged , the doctor told me it was a good thing I went in .
Left untreated for around six hours , I could have lost the testicle .
I later looked it up and this is what Wikipedia has to say on the subject ( emphasis mine ) .
Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment .
If treated within 6 hours , there is nearly a 100 % chance of saving the testicle .
Within 12 hours this rate decreases to 70 % , within 24 hours is 20 % , and after 24 hours the rate approaches 0 . ( eMedicineHealth )
Once the testicle is dead it must be removed to prevent gangrenous infection .
Yeah , I ’m going to be having nightmares too .
In any case , it seems that all is well .
I still have a slight bit of discomfort not unlike the feeling in your gut long after someone kicks you in the groin and I ’ve been walking around a bit gingerly , worried any sudden movement might cause a relapse .
The moral of this story is when you have an intense pain in the balls , do n’t be a tough guy about it .
Go to the emergency room and be safe about it .
No use trying to be stoic and losing a nut over it .
My next step now is to make an appointment with a Urologist so I can have yet another doctor see me in all my glory and make sure it ’s all good .
To the doctor at the local neighborhood Emergency Room , I owe you a big one .
Because of him , the next time someone asks me , “ Hey !
How ’s it hanging ” I can answer , “ Pointed in the right direction . ”
Nematode worms are a very basic life form
In the study , detailed in journal Nature , nematode worms were exposed to 88,000 chemicals in turn and mianserin extended lifespan by almost a third .
The drug seems to mimic the effects on the body of the only known animal long - life regime - virtual starvation .
Experts said the findings might point to there being genes in humans that could be targeted to increase lifespan .
It may be possible to identify additional genes important in ageing
Dr Linda Buck , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
For a little - understood reason , depriving the body of all but the minimum amount of calories needed to survive seems to enhance longevity .
However , this is not a practical solution for most people in the modern world and the team from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , in Seattle , believe they may have found an easier way to achieve the same effect .
Ideal subjects
While research using nematode worms might not seem to have much relevance to us , in many key ways they are similar , with a central nervous system and sexual reproduction .
In addition , they live for only a matter of weeks , making them ideal subjects for the study of lifespan .
A vast screening programme found that most chemicals had zero impact on the lifespan of the worms , but the antidepressant drug boosted their lives by an average of 30 % .
More interestingly , it may be doing this by mimicking the effects of starvation in the brain .
" We do n't have any explanation for this , " said Dr Linda Buck , one of the researchers .
" All we can say is that if we give the drug to calorific - restricted animals , it does n't increase their lifespan any further .
" That suggests the same mechanism may be involved . "
Food source
She said that it was possible the drug was disturbing the balance of two brain chemicals which help the nematode decide whether there is enough food around to justify laying eggs .
This , she said , might produce a " perceived , but not real " state of starvation .
Dr Buck said that finding a chemical that increased lifespan in animals might point to genes in humans that could be targeted to do the same .
" It may be possible to identify additional genes important in ageing .
" In addition , the chemical approach could point to drugs suitable for testing in mammals . "
Professor Janet Lord , from Birmingham University , and a former chair of the British Society for Ageing Research , said : " What 's exciting is that the lifespan extension effects we see extend right across the species , from worms and fruit flies to mammals .
" At the moment , there are interesting experiments in primates which , although the animals involved are only middle - aged so far , suggest that calorific restriction does have an effect on longevity . "
What 's wrong with cotton subsidies ?
Let 's count the ways , using information from the WSJ editorial today "
The Cotton Club
" :
1. Cotton subsidies primarily benefits large corporate farms and their wealthy owners .
Of the $ 19.1 billion that was paid out from 1995 - 2005 , the top 10 % of cotton - subsidy recipients got more than 80 % , or almost $ 15.5 billion .
The bottom 80 % of recipients had to make do with $ 1.4 billion .
2. Cotton subsidies are a brazen wealth transfer from the tax - paying middle class to fat cats , i.e. it 's a form of corporate welfare , which creates a damaging , corporate dependency on the public 's money .
3 . Because cotton subsidies eliminate risk and reward production , U.S. cotton growers produce so much cotton that we export 70 - 80 % of our cotton , which creates a glut on world markets and depresses world cotton prices .
4. Cotton subsidies in the U.S. have devastating effects on poor cotton farmers in Africa , because U.S. cotton farmers compete with them and dump so much subsidized cotton on the world market that it depresses world prices , and thereby depresses African farm income from cotton .
It is estimated that some 10 million Africans ( living on less than $ 1 per day ) could see their incomes from growing cotton increase 8 % to 20 % if the U.S. reformed its subsidies , and world supplies and the world price of cotton returned to market levels .
5 . Another price of cotton subsidies is damage to U.S. credibility in world trade talks .
For example , U.S. farm policies have guaranteed cotton exporters the artificially high domestic price of their crop , and at the same time guaranteed that U.S. mills could buy cotton at the lower world price of cotton , creating a protected U.S. market and worsening the problem of too much U.S. cotton being dumped on world markets .
And what 's good about cotton subsidies ?
Not much , unless you 're a ) part of the " Cotton Club " that will receive $ 3.3 billion of taxpayers ' money this year , b ) a politician receiving " subsidies " or " kickbacks " ( aka campaign contributions ) from the Cotton Club , or c ) a Department of Agriculture bureaucrat involved in the administration of the cotton subsidy program .
In other words , if you 're part of the " Iron Triangle , " which is behind all farm subsidy programs ( special interest farmers , politicians who cater to special interest farmers , and bureaucrats who administer the farmers ' subsidies ) .
Click to viewWhen scientists in some bunker in the year 2525 are trying to determine when humanity handed over the keys to the robot overlords , December 11 , 2007 , may be a good date , for on this day , Honda announced it had given its ASIMO servant robots three key abilities .
Here we break them down , and provide a " Future Shock " analysis of each :
• Autonomous battery charging - Honda developed a Borg - like charging bay for ASIMO .
When the robot's battery level drops to a certain point , it seeks out the closest bay .
Future Shock : Seeking a power source is the first step towards domination , Coppertop .

• Avoiding oncoming people - ASIMO sees an oncoming person through its eye camera , judges its inertia , guesses its speed and path , then either changes course to steer clear , or simply takes a step back .
Future Shock :
If they 're taught subservience , they start questioning their predestined role .
Also , does n't this sound a lot like targeting ?
• Working together -
This involves constant sharing of relevant data between networked ASIMOs , and a survey of which robot is closest to the most pressing task , and what his battery life status is .
Among them , they " decide " which one is best suited to go in and do the job .
Future Shock :
If I have to explain to you why robots working together could be a bad thing , well , you 're probably already dead .

What jythonc is ( sometimes ) used for :
jythonc is currently unsupported and is deprecated , although it might reappear in some future version of Jython .
Here is a message on this from the jython - users email list :
Create java class files that can be imported into Java :
Preparing Jython code for jythonc -- Create Java compatible Jython modules :
The Jython class must inherit from a Java class .
The name of the Jython module and the class in it must be the same .
For example , class
Foo must be in a module named Foo.py .
must be in a module named .
Add @sig directives to methods that you want to be able to call from Java .
Another view : Jython is the extension language for Java .
What is jythonc and what is its status ?
" jythonc transforms Python source code into Java source code then invokes a Java compiler to turn it into .class files .
This allows Python to be integrated into Java in several places that regular Jython currently does n't support .
It also processes special annotations in docstrings on methods in Python code to determine the static type information to expose when turning a dynmically typed Python method into a statically typed Java method .
" jythonc is unmaintained and will not be present in Jython - 2.3 .
While jythonc handles all of the language features present in Jython 2.2 , it does n't support 2.3 features such as generators .
As such , it is not recommended that new Jython projects make use of jythonc .
It is only included in Jython - 2.2 to support older users of jythonc and to allow access to a few features that are only provided by jythonc at the moment : Running in a JVM with a classloader that will not load dynamically created classes Declaring Java method signatures in Python code Loading Python classes dynamically from Java with Class .
forName
" While all of these features are planned for Jython - 2.3 , they are currently only available from jythonc .
Most uses of the second feature , adding method declarations to docstrings , can be handled by declaring a Java interface to implement with a Python class .
Each method in the Python implementation takes the types of the Java method it implements .
Exposing the Python class as an instance of that type to Java code can be done as explained in Accessing Jython from Java Without Using jythonc and its followup , Simple and Efficient Jython Object Factories . "
( See http://www.jython.org/Project/jythonc.html)
You can extend Java classes in your Jython code .
You can add ( J ) Python protocols to Java classes .
You will need to describe the signature of methods in order to make them callable from Java ( in addition to Jython ) .
What jythonc does -- jythonc translates .py files into .
java source code files , then compiles these to .class files .
With jythonc , you can also :
Compile Jython ( .py ) to Java class files ( .class ) .
Compile Jython to Java source , then stop without compiling to .class files .
Create standalone jar file containing your Jython code and that can be run on machines on which Java is installed but not Jython .
Use a Java compiler different from the default : javac .
See the help from jythonc : -- compiler path - C path Use a different compiler than `standard ' javac .
If this is set to ` NONE ' then compile ends with . java .
Alternatively , you can set the property python.jpythonc.compiler in the registry .
This option can also be set in your Jython registry file .
Java compatible classes -
In order to implement a Java compatible class ( that is , one that acts like a native Java class and can be called from Java ) , your Jython code must follow these rules :
Inherit from a Java class or interface .
Include only one class per module .
Give the Jython class and the source file that contains it the same name .
Place all code inside that Jython class .
Include method signature hints ( called sig- strings ) --
Add a @sig line in the doc-string for each method .
How to use jythonc :
Type jythonc -- help for help : $ jythonc -- help
Compile your Jython code with : jythonc mymodule.py
Some notes :
When your run jythonc , by default , the . java files are placed in a sub- directory ./ jpywork .
You can override this with the -- workdir command line option .
From jythonc -- help : -- workdir directory -w directory Specify working directory for compiler ( default is ./ jpywork )
When you run this resulting code from Java , the directory ./ jpywork and the Jython jar file must be on your classpath .
Example --
The following Jython code extends a Java class .
Compile it with jythonc :
# Foo.py import java class Foo(java.util.Date ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self.count = 0 def bar ( self , incr=1 ) : " " " @sig void bar ( int incr ) " " " self .
count += incr return self .
count def toString ( self ) : cnt = self .bar ( ) return " Foo [ " + java.util.Date.toString( self ) + " " + `cnt` + " ] "
Example , continued --
Here is Java code to test the above .
Compile it with javac and run it :
// FooTest.java public class FooTest { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { Foo foo = new Foo( ) ; System.out.println(foo ) ; foo.bar ( ) ; foo.bar ( 43 ) ; System.out.println( foo ) ; } }
Notes :
You will need to add jpywork on your classpath .
So , you can compile and run it as follows : $ jythonc Foo.py $ javac - cp jpywork : $CLASSPATH FooTest.
java $ java - cp jpywork : $CLASSPATH FooTest
In order to implement a Java compatible class ( that is , one that acts like a native Java class and can be called from Java ) , your Jython code must follow these rules :
Inherit from a Java class or interface .
If you do not need to inherit any additional capability , inherit from java.lang .
Object .
.
Include method signature hints ( called sig- strings ) .
Give the Jython class and the source file it is in the same name .
Here is another simple example :
" " " simpleclass.py
This is a simple class to demonstrate the use of jythonc . " " " import java.lang .Object class simpleclass ( java.lang.Object ) : def __init__( self , name= ' The Horse With No Name ' ) : " " " public simpleclass ( String name ) " " " self .
name = name self .size = - 1 def set_name ( self , name ) : " " " @sig public void set_name ( String name ) " " " self .
name = name def set_size ( self , size ) : " " " @sig public void set_size ( int size ) " " " self.size = size def show ( self ) : " " " @sig public String show ( ) " " " return ' name : %s size : %s ' % ( self.name , self.size , ) def test ( ) : sc = simpleclass ( ) s1 = sc.show ( ) print " 1. " , s1 sc.set_name ( " dave " ) sc.set_size ( 4321 ) s1 = sc.show ( ) print " 2. " , s1 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : test ( )
And , a Java test harness for this simple example :
// simpleclasstest.java public class simpleclasstest { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { String s1 ; simpleclass sc = new simpleclass ( ) ; s1 = sc.show ( ) ; System.out.println ( " 1. " + s1 ) ; sc.set_name ( " dave " ) ; sc.set_size ( 4321 ) ; s1 = sc.show ( ) ; System.out.println ( " 2. " + s1 ) ; } }
Notes :
Compile and run with something like the following : $ jythonc simpleclass .py $ javac - cp jpywork : $CLASSPATH simpleclasstest.java $ java - cp jpywork : $CLASSPATH simpleclasstest 1. name : The Horse With No Name size : - 1 2 . name : dave size : 4321
You will need to put jpywork on your CLASSPATH .
In order to produce a Java compatible class , our Jython class must inherit from a Java class .
In this case , we use java.lang .
Object , because we do not need to inherit any behavior .
The methods set_name , set_size , and show each have sig - strings .
In the following example , we create a stand - alone Jar file , that is , one that can be executed as a script on a machine where Jython is not installed .
Here is the Jython script :
# test_jythonc.py import sys def test ( words ) : msgs = [ ' hi ' , ' bye ' ] for word in words : msgs.append ( word ) for msg in msgs : print msg def main ( ) : args = sys.argv [ 1 :] test ( args ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : main ( )
Compile and build a Jar file with the following :
$ jythonc -- all -- jar mytest.jar test_jythonc.py
Run it as follows :
$ java - jar mytest .
jar hello goodbye hi bye hello goodbye
Notes :
Note that our Jython script contains no class .
jythonc will create a public class and a public static main function for us .
will create a public class and a public static main function for us .
The -- jar flag tells jythonc that we want the results placed in a Jar file ( as opposed to placing it in the work directory ./ jpywork ) .
flag tells that we want the results placed in a Jar file ( as opposed to placing it in the work directory ) .
The -- all flag tells jythonc to include all Jython support in the Jar file , making it stand - alone .
This enables us to run it on a system where Java is installed but Jython is not .
And the following example builds a standalone jar file from our simpleclass .
py module , above :
$ jythonc -j simpleclass.jar - a simpleclass.py $ java - jar simpleclass .jar 1 . name : The Horse With No Name size : - 1 2 . name : dave size : 4321
After reading where Democrats have put the Iraq War debate on hold .
I would like to know what debate and why even a debate should be held .
As stated previously all it takes are 41 senators to filibuster any bill related to the war in Iraq from coming to the floor which means the funding of it .
That is precisely how this senate can end the war .
The problem is they do not want to end it .
I want all to think of that since every minute of each day a soldier is being fired upon and in some cases their lives are ended and for what ?
The same thing is happening to innocent Iraqis and the same question should be asked , and for what ?
The answer is greed and power and those that lust after both .
I hold mainly the Democrats in contempt since we gave them this power to end this war last November and they erroneously state they need sixty or more votes to override the president ’s veto .
That his hogwash if you ask me .
The magic number is 41 .
Do not let them fool you .
As I was watching Lou Dobbs Tonight last night , Lou ’s guest was CNN’s , Jack Cafferty who came on to speak with Lou regarding his best selling novel , " It 's Getting Ugly Out There : The Frauds , Bunglers , Liars and Losers Who are Hurting America " .
The latter part of his book title best defines a great majority of members serving in both houses of congress .
Cafferty opined of the war , “ Seventy percent of the population thinks the country is going in the wrong direction .
The primary reason they feel that way is the war in Iraq . ”
He went onto say , “ And one of the reasons that they do n't support the war in Iraq is that we were -- they ran a game on us .
They lied to us , and they got us committed .
Powell was right . ”
While that is mainly directed towards the Republican led congress and a Republican president , the Democrats who voted for this war fell for these lies when the truth was out there .
So , I ask you ; if you are against this war , just how in blazes can you support the front - runner , Senator Hillary Clinton ?
She knows of this filibuster rule since she is in the senate , yet she has never brought this up to show any kind of leadership and to bring our soldiers back home .
Even President Bush advising her of how to handle the war is pretty telling .
As I stated before when confronted with this in the last debate by former Senator , Mike Gravel , she laughed .
I called it a moral deficit on her part .
In reading this telling article published on October 7th , by The Times Online , “ George Bush smooths path for Hillary ” this passage jumped out at me , “ In the clearest sign of a shift in gear , Gates is to appoint John Hamre , a former official in President Bill Clinton ’s administration , to chair the Defense Policy Board once led by Richard Perle , a leading neoconservative advocate of the invasion of Iraq .
The board ’s job will be to prepare for the transition to a new administration in 2008 , according to a Pentagon spokesman . ”
Is that a Clinton administration ?
This coziness between President Bush and Senator Clinton should be a red-flag to everyone .
Dobbs read a quote from Cafferty ’s book which reads , “ I have never been scared before , but I am scared now .
Scared that we 're losing our way , not because somebody is taking it away , because -- but because we 're giving it away . "
To this I add , is n’t about time that Americans especially those backing candidates like Clinton and other front - runners in both parties take back control of our government and choose other candidates that make sense ?
When Dobbs asked Cafferty this poignant question , “ You think the 2008 election could change it ? ” Cafferty ’s answer was , “ No . ” He even asked if he was excited about any candidate out there including all eighteen candidates and his answer was again , no .
I believe he stated no while including the lower - tier candidates is because he knows they stand little chance at making it to the final round .
All of this leads me to comment on a brief editorial by Andrew Sullivan The Threat of Ron Paul , he states , “ His constituency consists mainly of libertarian types who are either not Republicans or have not felt at home in the Republican Party for quite some time . ”
As a former Republican , I left that party back in the nineties not feeling at home within it .
They allowed it to be co-opted by Neo-conservatives and Evangelicals .
Through that move they pushed aside moderate Republicans who should have been given a voice of the party ’s direction .
Now through this co-option , many are seeing the demise of it .
Any political party shoots itself in the foot when they allow extremists to ultimately control it .
It was then , I switched to the Democratic Party in hopes life would be better there .
Wrong !
I saw the same party - power play going on within that party as well .
I guess party politics was not for me and I do suspect others feel that way .
As a person who just left the Democratic Party due to numerous reasons , I too am feeling drawn to Ron Paul .
At least he is telling the American people exactly what is wrong in Washington and how both parties have not served ‘ we the people ’ well .
The same can be said of former Senator , Mike Gravel on the Democratic side .
Both men have shown immense courage to tell it like it is as they confront the front - runners in both parties .
I feel myself equally drawn to Mike Gravel .
But sadly and angrily the powers that be within the hierarchy of both parties will not give us a candidate that we can truly support .
In both parties you have had some wishing to keep the lower - tier candidates out of debates and we the American people are not being served through this form of censorship .
Sullivan was correct as he stated , “ His support comes from people who are fed up with the two major parties and do n't feel represented by either of them . ”
What exactly will it take for both parties to realize this ?
More important , what will it take for you to realize it if you are a member of either party ?
Is being a part of the Republican and Democratic Party more important than the direction of this country ?
Is it more important than our soldiers who continue to die each and every day ?
As I have relayed in the past , I am now an independent without any party affiliation .
So , independents like me are forced to vote for candidates that go against our core beliefs .
I say forced because at this stage a viable third party candidate is not within our reach .
Back when I was a Republican , I voted for H. Ross Perot because his opinion on NAFTA .
As you will see with our jobs being outsourced and the products coming into this country from China , Perot was correct .
Two of our founding fathers , George Washington and Alexander Hamilton did not believe in political parties .
But , here we sit being ruled by both .

Dairy farming in New Zealand was not always this sophisticated .
But ever since a liberal but free - market government swept to power in 1984 and essentially canceled handouts to farmers — something that just about every other government in an advanced industrial nation has considered both politically and economically impossible — agriculture here has never been the same .
The farming community was devastated — but not for long .
Today , agriculture remains the lifeblood of New Zealand ’s economy .
There are still more sheep and cows here than people , their meat , milk and wool providing the country with its biggest source of export earnings .
Most farms are still owned by families , but their incomes have recovered and output has soared .
“ Farming in New Zealand is now a cold , hard business , ” said Mr. Lumsden , who at the time of the farming revolution was president of Federated Farmers in the Waikato region , the heart of New Zealand ’s dairy country .
“ I think we have benefited hugely . ”
New Zealand ’s farmers are not the only ones convinced that eliminating subsidies , or at least sharply cutting them , is a good idea .
As negotiators struggle to revive the failing global trade talks and Congress moves ahead on a new farm bill in the United States , New Zealand and Australia — which also cut subsidies but not as drastically — are being extolled by economists and advocates for poor countries as models for Americans and Europeans to follow .
“ They went cold turkey and in the process it was very rough on their farming economy , ” said Ray Goldberg , a retired professor of agriculture and business at Harvard Business School .
“ But they came out healthier and stronger .
They proved it could be done . ”
In theepisode " Peterotica , " Peter and his friends go to the local adult bookstore .
What happens next was apparently determined by the following sequence of events .
1.asks Carol Burnett if they can use the theme to her 1970s variety show .
2. Carol Burnett says no.3 .
They draw her into the cartoon as the adult bookstore 's cleaning woman .
And then comes # 4 — Carol Burnett sues them The Fox Network has expressed surprise , since she appears in the cartoon for only four seconds , but Burnett 's lawsuit reportedly claimed violations of copyright and trademark law , plus a misappropriation of her name and likeness .
This weekend a judge revealed what happens in step 5 : Carol Burnett loses that lawsuit .
According to news reports , a judge signed a ruling Friday that while the theepisode may offend her — the First Amendment allows parodies .
( After all , her original variety show was famous for its own parodies . )
Carol Burnett is a pioneer in celebrity lawsuits .
In 1981 she surprised legal observers with a successful lawsuit against the National Enquirer over a report that implied she 'd been drunk in a restaurant with Henry Kissinger .
( “ In a Washington restaurant , a boisterous Carol Burnett had a loud argument ...
But Carol really raised eyebrows when she accidentally knocked a glass of wine over one diner and started giggling instead of apologizing ... " )
She may have been vindicated over that slight to her public image , but as a public figure she 's also fair game for ridicule .
And thanks to , an animated likeness of the 74 - year - old comedienne can be glimpsed in some very unsavory company .
Like mostepisodes , this one was a series of loosely - connected jokes , but this time they were tied together by the theme of adult books .
Peter 's disappointment at the adult bookstore 's offerings drives him to write his own porn novels .
( Including , and . ) Ironically , in this episode of the cartoon , it 's the Family Guy himself who is eventually sued — though for different reasons .
Peter 's own erotic novels are so steamy that they prompt one driver to remove his shirt while driving .
( He 'd been listening to the book on tape version of Peter 's adult book , ) This scene may include another dig at Carol Burnett , since the tape version of that book is being read by a regular guest on the Carol Burnett Show — Betty White .
Peter 's career ends after the disgruntled motorist 's lawsuit — and he also gets a surprise visit from ...
Betty White .
Perhaps foreshadowing the legal showdowns to come , she tells him , " I just got a subpoena for an erotic novel , and I 'm looking for the son of a bitch responsible . "
What ho , world .
Blessay or blissertation number three coming up in a moment .
It has taken me a little longer than I had hoped to furnish the site with its third upload .
There are reasons and I shall go through them quickly .
Why So Late ?
My first blog entry , Devices and Desires ( see below ) went some way towards expressing my extreme passion for things digital .
It resulted in a very charming enquiry from the Guardian newspaper in London .
Would I be interested in providing a weekly column on the subject of the gadget , the electronic doo- dad and the world of the gismoidal ?
I thought about this longish and hardish .
I wrote newspaper columns through much of the eighties and nineties , and enjoyed it greatly .
But for all kinds of reasons I was more than happy to retire .
Feeling stale , tiring of the deadlines , hating myself for manufacturing cheap , easy rants – the line of least resistance when you rack your brains for weekly copy is to think of something you hate .
That way lies the death of the soul IM ( not so ) HO .
All those feature columns with titles like J’Accuse , Bile , Spleen and so on .
Nasty .
Wo n’t Do .
It all came to a head when an editor called me up and asked if I could do a “ 1200 word hate piece on Christmas ” .
Not a blush , not a murmur of apology .
Time to reach for my hat and streak for the horizon , I felt .
Plus , by this time I was pretty deeply into … ah , but wait , that ’s for the main body of the blessay .
Anyway , the upshot of my longish and hardish thinking the other day was to reply with a ‘ yes ’ .
Five hundred or so words a week for the Saturday Guardian on the subject of geeky dorky toys , digital advances , lordly overviews of the online scene – just my bag .
The ‘ lead times ’ for these magazines are bizarrely long , so I ’ve had to provide a longer introductory article and the first two columns proper in advance .
The writing of them has kept me from my blog table .
At the same time I have finished shooting the second series of Kingdom and now find myself in the United States of America on Day One of a great adventure : filming in every state of the union for a BBC documentary .
My mode of transport of choice is a black London cab .
American Sunrise I was possibly the first person in America to see the sun this morning .
There ’s a proud boast .
I was standing on the harbour wall at Eastport , Maine staring out across the bay at a beautiful , beautiful sunrise .
Eastport , Maine styles itself the easternmost city in America .
The Lowestoft of the USA , if you will .
There did n’t seem to be anyone else around so I allowed myself to believe that I was indeed the first to see the sun rise in America that day .
I took a picture to commemorate the event .
The land you see on the horizon there is actually Canada , where she twists round the topmost corner of Maine at Passamaquoddy Bay , so the picture is taken from as far east as you can go in the USA .
Actually , that ’s a moot point .
Part of Alaskan territory ( now water rather than ice ) actually crosses the dateline or Antimeridian so in theory Alaska can be called the easternmost and westernmost state in America which is rather naughty of it , but there you are .
Meanwhile , back in Maine on the first day of my documentary filming , the Motel East , where the crew and I are staying , may be out of range of cellular phones but , mirabile dictu , it has wi-fi , so I am able to send this to my site .
We start the actual filming this afternoon .
I shall be hauling in lobster pots and looking stylish in a sou ’wester .
That ’s the idea anyway .
Probably heaving my guts up over the taff - rail , if they have such a thing .
I really enjoy making documentaries .
Fearsome hard work , but deeply satisfying .
After Manic Depression , HIV / AIDS and the life and work of Gutenberg ( yet to be shown on BBC4 some time later in the year I think ) a jaunt around every state of America may seem rather trivial or self - indulgent , but I hope that wo n’t be how it comes across .
America is important .
We have seen perhaps a little too much of British people going over to sneer at rednecks , laugh at freaks and wring their hands at nutters .
The America I ’ve visited ( and I ’ve crossed it before in traditional fashion ; shiny red Mustang convertible , diner to diner , motel to motel .
Very Bruce Dern ) have always seemed to me to be more than ordinarily kind , friendly , hospitable , polite , thoughtful and honourable .
Well , I ’m visiting with an open mind but that has been my experience thus far .
Maine for four nights , then New Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York … you get the idea .
Little Competition
If you happen to be in America and you chance to see my cab … which as you can see is left - hand drive and proudly ( or perhaps stupidly ) bears my name …
… why not take a picture and tell me where and when it was taken .
I shall devise a worthy prize .
Note that I have n’t revealed its licence plate .
No photoshopped fraudulence please , only genuine pictures revealing the genuine cab can qualify .
Housekeeping
A thank you once more for all the extraordinary comments , criticisms and suggestions that have come to the site .
Your participation gladdens my heart inexpressibly .
We are working on the look and feel of the blog pages , fully aware that the style , colourways and user experience have n’t pleased everyone .
The server seems to have settled down and finds itself able to cope with the third of a million who have wiped their feet on its doorstep in the past two weeks .
Many thanks to all of you : you are very , very welcome .
I have already bumped into two readers of the Let Fame blessay who have made me giggle with the self - consciousness such a meeting was bound to engender , given all my stern observations and unkind proscriptions .
I fear I may have made life insupportably difficult for those who spot me in the street and want to speak to me .
That was n’t my intention .
Go on .
I do n’t bite and if I ’m in a tearing hurry I ’ll say so …
And now to the main body .
I Give Up A short blessay on addiction .
Have I an “ addictive personality ? ”
Am I an addiction addict ?
Is there some gene in me that predisposes me to dependency ?
Did I inherit a demonstrable physical tendency or was it a character flaw ?
Am I simply weak ?
Weak - willed , self - indulgent , lacking in character , moral fibre , decency , strength of mind , honesty and courage ?
Is that even a fair array of choices ?
Maybe there ’s an admixture of weakness , genetic propensity and hedonistic degradation in me .
Perhaps I should calm down and let myself off the hook in some areas while justly castigating myself in others .
Let ’s lay out the history first .
Incidentally , I know there is nothing quite so yawn - worthy as a ‘ my drugs hell ’ confessional , so I ’ll try and get it out of the way as swiftly as I can .
The Tuck Shop
It starts with sweets .
Candy as they say over here in America .
For most children these seemed to be just a pleasant experience .
‘ Oh great , sweets .
Mm .
Yes please !’
For me however it was quite different .
Sweets were by way of being a manifestation of the divine .
Chronologically sweets came before sex , but they came with the same monumental , heart - thumping significance .
Mouth parted , slight panting , eyes unfocussed … sweeeeeets .
A Homer Simpsony drool and murmur even though it had n’t been invented yet .
Sweets carried the same element of rush , thrill , disappointment and self - disgust as sex and as every subsequent addictive substance .
Even as they ’re in your hand , even as they move into your mouth you are dissatisfied because it means you will soon not have them .
They will be gone .
You will be sweetless and in despair .
There ’s colour and shape , there ’s mouthfeel : crunch , snap , melt , pop , fizz , burst , crack , chew and slither .
The textures : jelly , brittle , foamy , moussey , waxy , firm , hard , pappy .
Lick , swallow , suck , pump , bite , savour , roll .
Flavour : fruity , sour , salty , citric , deep , rich , wild , soft , bold , earthy , loud – and above all there ’s sugar .
Sugar , sugar , sugar .
Lust , desire , pleasure demanded , pleasure received , reward , punishment , deferral , delay , arrival , joy , rush , gorging , rush , rush , rush sickness , shame , guilt .
Crash .
Down .
Despair .
Need … more , more sugar , more rush , more reward .
Need it now .
No money left .
Help .
Steal .
Need .
Discovery .
Exposure .
Shame .
Well , there you have it .
A prepubescent drug addiction that has all the narrative shapes , dimensions , sensations and horrors of sex addiction , drug addiction , alcohol addiction , gambling addiction or any other damned addiction .
Result in my case ?
Missing teeth and a back jaw full of mercury amalgam .
Canings , and punishments for stealing and breaking bounds to visit the village sweetery .
Night time raids on the school tuck shop or the kitchens .
Fry=bad boy .
Fry=trouble .
Fry=mixed - up mess .
I became a rebel .
A miscreant .
I was churlish and truculent , occasionally high as a kite , other times lonely , slow and miserable .
The outlines of manic depression showed , but had the ruts been carved by three or four years of hopeless sugar addiction ?
Which was the chicken and which the egg ?
I already had manic depressive tendencies and therefore self - medicated on sugar ?
Or the highs and lows , rewards and punishments of sugar , did they trigger the neurons and prime the pumps of endocrines in a way that caused the first cyclings of what was then to become a bipolar disorder ?
And why ?
My brother never had it .
He liked sweets , sure , but to that extent ?
Never .
Genetic , then ?
My father never ate puddings ( does n’t to this day ) ; my mother prefers sour fruit to sweet .
My sister does n’t have a sweet tooth either .
I was the only one with this craving , this wild , transgressive , sexual lust for sweets .
As I go over my feelings about this , I wonder if sweets did n’t shape me entirely : the savage , gnawing yearning , the greed for them blended with romantic and sexual feelings .
Masturbation began , all that .
Sweets opened up a pathway , they established one thing and one thing hugely .
I must get pleasure .
I must reward myself .
That ’s the beast to which sugar gave birth .
These days we express the urge in the language of endocrines and neurotransmitters .
We talk now of endorphins , of serotonin , noradrenalin , tryptophan and dopamine .
Sweets began it .
They carved through the brain and left their imprint .
Pleasure , reward .
Rush , crash .
High low .
Mania .
Depression .
The cycle has to be fed .
Self - medication , we bipolar people call it .
The Leaf Arrives
At fifteen I find a new substance to feed the ravenous beast within .
Tobacco .
“ A cigarette is the perfect kind of perfect pleasure , ” Wilde said .
“ It is exquisite and leaves one unsatisfied . ” I thought at first that this was just Oscar talking all pretty and silly .
But of course he got it right .
A cigarette is the perfect instrument of addiction .
Perfect .
It has no function , no point , no quality other than to make itself needful to the smoker .
It does n’t taste pleasant , it does n’t modify mood ( except inasmuch as it quells the need for itself ) it does n’t offer texture , elation , hallucination , bouquet , nourishment , calorific value , anything .
And ultimately , as Wilde pointed out , it never satisfies : it is always necessary to have another .

Imagine that one day someone hit himself lightly on the head with a parsnip .
Instead of stopping ( for this is a foolish thing to do ) he carried on doing it .
When he eventually did stop he went about his business but discovered , much to his surprise , that he had a sudden unconquerable urge to hit himself lightly on the head with a parsnip all over again .
So he did .
And the more he did it , the more he needed to do it .
The act of doing it gave him a tiny surge of joy , a little rush of pleasure that had to be elicited , never mind what a twazzock he looked , parsnipping himself on the head all day .
Smoking is no less stupid than that .
In fact it is a whole bicycle - shed more stupid , because it ’s smelly , unsociable , carcinogenic etc etc etc .
But the principle is the same : smoking has absolutely no point other than to stop the misery of not smoking .
Smokers claim that it aids concentration , soothes the nerves and so on , but we know really that it only does those things because it ’s tobacco addiction that messes with concentration and jangles the nerves in the first place .
Tapping your head lightly with a parsnip would aid concentration too if not doing it made you all jumpy and desperate .
All this is obvious .
But when there ’s a beast inside you that wants , needs , insists upon feeding , a beast that knows how to press the little button in the brain that releases all those wonderful , surging delicious endorphins , when that beast is there , then new ways must be found to let him find and press the button .
Sugar is okay , self - abuse is jolly of course , but ca n’t really be done in the street without exciting comment .
Forward , tobacco .
So , I ’m fifteen .
I have bad teeth and I smoke .
Every half an hour or so I can guarantee the small release of bliss that the cigarette delivers .
That it achieves this by delivering a small release of agony that only another cigarette can alleviate is neither here nor there to me .
I credit the cigarette with healing powers and am proud to be a smoker .
It sits well with the unorthodox , maverick rebelliousness I fool myself is my style .
It ’s cooler , more radical and soulfully alienated than a Cadbury ’s Curly - Wurly and a foam shrimp .
Photographs of Jean Paul Sartre reveal that he has a cigarette dangling from his mouth , not a sherbet fountain .
It is revealing that amongst my favourite sweets were candy cigarettes , chocolate cigarettes , cigars and pipes and that strange shredded coconut wrapped in a wax paper and presented as a simulacrum of rolling tobacco .
Almost twenty years pass with me in this state .
I am not an alcoholic .
I like a drink from time to time , but I have never veered even close to alcoholism , I do n’t know why , it is just the case .
I ca n’t abide cannabis .
Makes me feel nauseous .
Maybe it ’s just that sugar has taught me to dislike downers : dope and drink are depressants , cigarettes and sugar are stimulants .
So I smoke like Sheffield in the 1850s .
I drink a great deal of coffee .
I still like sweets .
I am starting to become much more addicted to food in general .
From having been one who just scoffed the fuel he needed without thinking , I have started to become a gourmand , if not a gourmet .
My metabolism changes and I start to put on weight .
Hello , Charlie
On the documentary I made about manic depression I spoke to many about their experiences with alcohol and drugs ; I spoke too about my own use of cocaine .
What a strange thing to do , I think , to suck powder up into your nose .
A bit like tapping yourself lightly on the head with a parsnip , only sillier .
But … there ’s a difference .
Unlike parsnips and unlike tobacco , this substance alters mood and energy levels .
It ’s the new sugar .
There ’s a rush .
I did n’t like to ingest cocaine when working , either writing or performing .
Work provides its own buzz , its own reward , deeper and more satisfying than any drug I ’ve ever met .
But my down time , my play time was often fuelled by the sherbet of shame , ‘ the devil ’s dandruff ’ as Robin Williams called it .
To cut a long , meandering and tedious story short , I stopped all that some four years ago .
Took the decision one night .
‘ No more coke , ’ I said to myself and never touched the stuff again .
I never had the slightest withdrawal pang , nothing like the agonies of giving up smoking .
Now there ’s a brute …
Wrestling the leaf I tried to give up smoking on my thirtieth birthday .
That lasted less than a week and , dispirited , I did n’t try again until last year .
I had kicked coke , surely I could knock nicotine on the head with just as much insouciance and ease ?
A very nice man from the Allen Carr Institute gave me a free session .
I was out in the street firing up the old Marlboro Mediums ten minutes later , actually rather resentful of the ‘ technique ’ , which I ’m sure is splendid but certainly did n’t suit me .
Then , as I started filming the first series of Kingdom up in Norfolk I bought a shed - load of nicotine replacement itemries – the cigarette holder type , the mints and lozenges , the patches and the foul gum .
Bless my blimey , but that technique truly seemed to work !
It was agony and I slipped up a few times , but it really did seem to sever the tie .
I finished three months of filming a real live non-smoker .
I had even stopped chewing and sucking the nicotine therapy gunk too .
Then I had cause to go to America .
Now , you may think America is a pretty good place not to smoke and generally you ’d be right , but I had flown to Los Angeles specifically to do something I had n’t done in any major way during my new life as a non-smoker .
I had gone there to write .
It was a screenplay and I needed to be in LA for the meetings that accompanied this particular script .
So there I am , in a room of the Chateau Marmont , sitting in front of my laptop , stretching out my arms , cracking my knuckles and preparing to type the traditional
FADE IN : INT .
and … there ’s something terribly , terribly wrong .
A huge great hole has opened up in my interior , in my INT .
It takes me some time to realise what it is .
I cannot write without a cigarette .
But I ’ve given up !
This ca n’t be true .
But it was .
It had nothing to do with nicotine , that was long gone from my system .
It was some hard - wired problem deep inside me .
I had never been a writer without a cigarette and the act of writing and the act of smoking were so connected in my head that the former seemed impossible without the latter .
In fact I first started writing seriously and consistently ( albeit unpublishedly ) at the age of fifteen , just when I started smoking .
For thirty - five years the two had gone together .
You can believe I tried , I really did try that day in the Chateau Marmont , to conquer this nonsensical problem .
It was so clearly psychological and not physiological that surely it could n’t be beyond my powers to use my mind to free itself of its own self - imposed shackles ?
A bit of self - administered NLP , perhaps ?
( though do see the excellent Robert Todd Carroll ’s sceptical dictionary for another point of view … )
Well , there was a deadline and the clock was ticking .
I sweated out a day in which …
FADE IN : INT .
… was all I managed to write .
Then I called down for a packet of cigs and the script was finished in three weeks .
Damn .
I was a smoker again .
This year , a week into the E series of the QI programme I do for the BBC , I tried again .
This time I enlisted the help of a drug : Zyban .
It started life as an antidepressant and is marketed as such in America , I believe , under the brand name Welbutrin .
I began a course of that and within a week was stubbing out cigarettes .
Eleven days in and I lit my last .
Of course I was n’t writing much then , but I was prepared to believe that this time I could do it .
And then along came a new quitting drug , called , in the UK at least , Champix ( Chantix in the US ? ) .
This was supposed to be even better at helping smokers stop , and although I had stopped I enlisted on a course of this too , just to make assurance doubly sure as Macbeth liked to say .
And here I am , some five months later , still not smoking .
I ’ve also managed at the same time to start controlling my weight a bit better , more or less cutting out sugar .
But … So. Goodbye ciggies .
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off , in Basil Fawlty ’s great phrase .
And so have just about all the other avenues .
Coke , sweets , eating .
Forty years of expecting bursts of pleasure to come as punctuation marks during the day , as rewards for work being done or work being finished , all that is over .
No line of coke to signal the end of labours , no smoke between set - ups when filming , no sweeties of any kind .
No rushes and therefore fewer daily highs and lows and therefore fewer triggerings of manic episodes or depressions .
Which is good .
And yet … is that it now ?
A life on a plateau ?
It ’s possible I will live longer ( but so possible too that I ’ll keel over or be run over or stabbed or poisoned anyway and then what will have been the point of living the joyless life ? ) and it ’s certain that I feel physically better now than I have for decades , but oh the ache inside .
Sorry
What a whinge .
What a dreadful self - pitying whine .
I do apologise , everyone .
But I have the writer ’s primary vanity which is to suppose that if I have experienced something and been somewhere then others will have too .
I have the feeling that my generation might have been the first to be set on this path of sugar addiction .
Subsequent generations may have taken it further and have certainly been quicker to leap from sugar to narcotics , but I think we baby - boomers were the pioneers .
There ’s a personal irony here .
My maternal grandfather was one of a handful of men responsible for developing the cultivation of sugar beet and its refinery in the United Kingdom .
His British Sugar Corporation became Silver Spoon and successfully marketed its drug to me and my peers .
Anyway .
I have my work and I seem to be able to write now without smoking .
I have absolutely no desire for a cigarette , I have successfully characterised them as smelly and noxious in my mind : but oh , I do have a need for that surging wave of bliss , that hit of heaven that once they gave .
Well , not a need , but a want .
And wants are greater than needs .
I shall leave you now and toddle down the hill to the Moose Island Grocery Store and see if they sell parsnips .
I 've made some changes to my parser combinator library written in Javascript that I wrote about previously .
I was extending the example code from that post to parse more of the ECMAScript 3 grammar to test it out and was hitting performance issues .
I ended up modifying the combinator library to be a Packrat style parser .
The Parsing Expression Grammar Wikipedia page has a description of PEGs and what a Packrat parser does .
Basically results of each parse step are memoized to prevent reparsing after backtracing , sacrificing memory for speed :
Any parsing expression grammar can be converted directly into a recursive descent parser [ citation needed ] .
Due to the unlimited lookahead capability that the grammar formalism provides , however , the resulting parser could exhibit exponential time performance in the worst case .
By memoizing the results of intermediate parsing steps and ensuring that each parsing function is only invoked at most once at a given input position , however , it is possible to convert any parsing expression grammar into a packrat parser , which always runs in linear time at the cost of substantially greater storage space requirements .
A packrat parser [ 1 ] is a form of parser similar to a recursive descent parser in construction , except that during the parsing process it memoizes the intermediate results of all invocations of the mutually recursive parsing functions .
Because of this memoization , a packrat parser has the ability to parse many context - free grammars and any parsing expression grammar ( including some that do not represent context - free languages ) in linear time .
I changed a few other things in the library to more closely map to the vocabulary of PEGs.
' alternative ' is now called ' choice ' for example .
There are still quite a few loose ends to tidy up and documentation of course .
The updated library can be retrieved from my git repository :
git clone git://github.com/doublec/jsparse.git
It can run in a browser but I 've mostly been testing it using Mozilla Rhino .
I 've included three basic examples .
They all operate on the example expression grammar from the wikipedia article :
Value := [ 0 - 9 ] + / '(' Expr ' ) '
Product := Value ( ( '*' / '/') Value ) * Sum := Product ( ( '+' / '-') Product ) * Expr := Sum
The first , example1.js , is a direct translation of that grammer .
It produces a pretty ugly default Abstract Syntax Tree however :
var Value = choice ( repeat1 ( range ( ' 0 ' , ' 9 ' ) ) , Expr ) ; var Product = sequence ( Value , repeat0 ( sequence ( choice ( '*' , '/' ) , Value ) ) ) ; var Sum = sequence ( Product , repeat0 ( sequence ( choice ( '+' , '-' ) , Product ) ) ) ; var Expr = Sum ;
The Expr parser can be called by passing it a string to be parsed wrapped in a ' ParserState ' object .
This object is used to keep track of the current parse position and the memoized results .
A helper function , ' ps ' , can be used to construct it :
var result = Expr( ps ( " 1+2*3 " ) ) ;
The second example , example2.js adds to this to produce a better AST .
It also uses the ' chainl ' parser combinator to handle grouping correctly .
A quick online page demonstrating this example is here .
Enter an expression matching the grammar ( there is no error checking yet ) , and press the button to see the AST in JSON format .
The third example , example3.js , evaluates the expression as it parses instead of generating an AST .
This is also available online to try .
I 've also included in the repository the work in progress of the ECMAScript 3 grammar .
It is not complete or correct yet but I use it for testing the library .
Based on what I 've learnt from doing this I plan to revisit the way I did Parser Combinators in Factor .
Many companies can be clearly divided into one of these two classes : art or science .
But in the line of marketing , this is a bit vague .
Also , you may get different answers depending on the person you ask .
For instance , if you are asking investors that buy houses , you may get a different answer if you are asking entrepreneurs who are selling goods and services online .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjW16k9qblU
This could appear like a totally philosophical discussion , however the ideas at the back of it could get marketing experts to do their everyday job in totally different approaches .
This technique impacts not just individual initiatives , but even the marketing path of the entire company .
In what path must the approach preferably go ?
Many marketing experts in the industry make use of both .
The Science of Marketing
After all , the main function of marketing is to draw in customers and create income .
With this thought , some marketers recommend focusing entirely on measurement and analysis .
When it comes to money , it ’s crucial to make an educated decision .
With all the analytics available to online marketers , it ’s easier to monitor all data applicable to your market .
You could immediately see the bounce rate of conversion rates by accessing data from your website traffic .
This data is very useful because it helps you run tests to understand what works and what does n’t and try new methods .
Improving the site requires most of the guesswork and is easy to quantify .
That said , you can easily justify the reasons for yourself or for someone who is responsible for the company ’s finances .
If you are a logical analyst , you must have good reason to base all your marketing decisions solely on scientific thinking .
But before doing so , let ’s first understand where the sense of art is in the equation .
The artistic side of marketing
Have you heard “ You know your audience ” many times ?
It can be too many to count .
But in this case , it means in the broadest sense .
No matter what industry you ’re in , you ’re marketing to people who are n’t robots , so marketing decisions cannot be made solely from data .
Think of a marketing campaign to become a consumer and drive purchases .
If you ’re like most people , you ’re going to be very innovative or think of someone who matches your feelings .
Outstanding sports are not created by science .
They are the product of human creativity and usually involve skillful storytelling , amazing images , or new ways to describe a product .
More importantly , you need a certain amount of artwork to create a brand for your business .
If you want to stand out from your competitors , your logo , message , and overall identity must be unique , and no data and analysis can generate original ideas .
Another area where science can’t do the job for you is customer loyalty .
While this is a relatively new development in marketing , social media has the potential to build relationships with current and potential customers .
However , this is only true if you are actually interacting with the customer and there is no scientific formula .
How to combine art and science to develop an effective marketing strategy
Both the arts and sciences are positioned in successful marketing strategies .
However , if you are overly dependent or unfamiliar with marketing , it can be difficult to balance .
Data without creativity can behave like a robot , while data without creativity is interesting but ineffective .
If so , how to merge the two ?
Your best bet is to use research and analytics as a framework for your marketing strategy , but use artistic methods to create real content .
Say you are writing a new blog post or article for your website .
How does a hybrid approach to content marketing work ?
You can use analytics tools to conduct keyword research and select topics .
You can find interesting statistics or research .
Then give some freedom to style , content , and graphics .
Or you can think of it as a three - step process .
1. Determine the subject and basic content using scientific methods .
2 . Use art to influence the delivery method .
3 . Then go back to science and determine if your efforts are successful .
You can use the same process for almost any aspect of your marketing strategy .
In order to find an effective method ( ineffective method ) , we review previous work and use it as a starting point for brainstorming .
When new and exciting content comes to mind , try it unless it directly contradicts your understanding of your audience or industry .
The Housing Crisis is turning Republicans into Democrats .
For Republican strategists , the change is particularly troubling because , as recently as 2004 , high - growth exurban areas like Loudoun County were fertile ground for GOP organizers , who rallied conservative volunteers from churches and community groups to turn out new voters .
It was primarily in such areas that Republican strategists beat Democrats at their own game -- registration and voter turnout .
In 2004 , Loudoun County voted to reelect President Bush by 56 % , compared with 44 % for Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) .
The nine - member County Board of Supervisors consists of six Republicans , one Democrat and two independents , both of whom are former Republicans .
With local elections scheduled for today , however , the ranks of independents and Democrats appear to be growing .
There are as many lawn placards supporting Democrats as Republicans in Schroeder 's neighborhood .
The shift away from the GOP is partly the result of more liberal voters moving into the county from Washington and Democratic suburbs .
But the housing crisis is also playing a substantial role , eroding the loyalty of some longtime Republicans .
As Schroeder assays today 's vote for members of the county board , she says that for the first time in her life , she is considering voting for a Democrat .
And one of the things she 's unhappy about is those foreclosure signs and the threat she sees in them to her family 's financial security .
" I do n't like seeing that , " Schroeder said recently .
" We think about moving , and I worry about whether we could sell our house . "
John Cole Tim F. over at John Cole 's place is properly derisive :
To recap , these people were Republicans when they had a steady job , health insurance , a suburban house and a SUV , but switched to the social welfare party as soon as times went bad .
I ’m sorry if this sounds insensitive , but that ’s pathetic .
If you spend your life voting to force people in hard times to get off their ass and take some responsibility for their lives then suck it up and practice what you preach when the bottle stops on you .
My wife 's Cuban grandparents were lifelong Republicans ( as is usually the case in that community ) .
My grandfather - in - law used to forward to me Republican direct - mail pieces to tweak me .
Then he got sick , his medicines were costing over one grand per month , and suddenly , the whole family was railing about the costs and expecting the government to pick up the slack .
He 'd spent his lifetime sending money to the GOP -- the same GOP that claimed the government has no role in making people 's lives better and which had enabled the pharmaceutical industry 's egregious business practices -- yet suddenly he expected the government to bail him out , and was outraged that more help was n't available !
Everyone has stories like this one .
Now , it 's never a bad thing when people realize that government can play a positive role in our society .
And while it would be nice if such conversions could happen like John 's and mine did -- based on reason and analysis and not personal hardship -- fact is , a lapsed Republican is a lapsed Republican .
And the more of those we have , the closer we are to a solid , generational , progressive majority .
I 'm at a loss for words :
( Note : Clicking the picture will take you to a larger - sized image that , not unexpectedly , is even more , how you say ... disturbing . )

The pure products of America go crazy , " wrote William Carlos Williams -- antipoet of " the thing itself " -- but Dr. Williams was from north Jersey , and as far as I know never strayed to Cleveland , whose own pure products long have been flame tempered , union made , and born batshit insane .
So when I tell you that Dennis Kucinich is first of all a sane , sane man , and secondly , fit to be president -- and thirdly :
It 's Kucinich time , now , because what this blue - balled , war - thwacked nation needs is not another scleroid corporate whore but a sixty - one - year - old vegan peacemonger , poor beyond corruption and honest as spit , hauling balls big enough to both choke Dick Cheney and keep a smile like a woozy kitten's on the love - lit face of a twenty - nine - year - old heartthrob wife ; and if not now , when ?
and if not Dennis , who ? -- when I tell you this hand over heart and cheek untongued , then it behooves me also to say that I am a son of the same crooked flaming river , Cleveland - born and - bred and unashamed .
But this is another pungent river in another town -- the slate - gray Piscataqua in Portsmouth , New Hampshire -- on a cool May Saturday morning gravid with rain , where five hundred or so union members , families in tow , have gathered in a small park to protest a proposed $ 2.7 billion deal that would let Verizon spin off its rural New England landline customers to a much smaller outfit in North Carolina , saving Verizon a sweet half billion tax dollars , plus the bother of an expiring union contract , plus the cost of pensions , not to mention the messy , unprofitable matter of bringing broadband to the rubes .
It 'll also hand Verizon six of the nine directors ' seats on the little company 's board -- the pickpocket 's bump that bares the scam .
It is , in short , the sort of humdrum money grab that makes shareholders drool and Kucinich spew lava .
He looks small as he strolls through the crowd and takes the makeshift plywood stage , standing short and thin under a blue awning , wearing a ratty tan raincoat , a twelve - year - old boy 's haircut , and a crooked grin as he lowers the microphone and barks , " Good morning ! "
A few in the crowd answer , but it 's a safe bet that even they know nothing but his name , if that , and have never heard his voice .
It is not the voice of a presidential hopeful -- it does n't emit Hillary 's frozen cheer , drip Edwards 's honey , or ooze Obamanic earnestness .
It 's a four - seam fastball , high and tight , buzzing straight at the ear .
" It 's great to be here with brothers and sisters of labor , " he says -- Kucinich himself is a stagehands ' union member -- before turning to the woman standing to his left .
She is lush and lean and six feet tall , dressed in a short black jacket , a pale - gold - and - red blouse , and black pants .
Her hair falls in twin auburn cascades -- one over her shoulder and down her back , the other curving just beneath her bosom .
" Joining me on the stage is my wife , Elizabeth , " says Kucinich .
He does n't mention that they met in his congressional office when she came to visit as part of a delegation from the American Monetary Institute two and a half years ago , or that they got engaged a few weeks later down at Shirley MacLaine 's spread in New Mexico , or that she boasts a graduate degree in International Conflict Analysis and a silver tongue stud , or that she is the third Mrs. Dennis Kucinich .
" It was actually more than thirty years ago , " he says , " that I first gained the experience that brings me to this stage today , " and then Kucinich tells them the nutshelled version of the Battle of Muny Light , the climax of a yearlong war that began when Dennis was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1977 at the age of thirty - one .
It was a dying Rust Belt city by then , a national punch line , hapless and backward in a way that Pittsburgh and Detroit never were .
That river -- the Cuyahoga -- had caught fire in 1969 , Lake Erie stank of death , the previous mayor had set his own hair ablaze with a welding torch at a ribbon cutting , and his wife had declined a White House dinner invite so as not to miss her bowling night .
What had been a boomtown for a century had shrunk to the Mistake on the Lake .
Then came Kucinich .
Although he had been in city government for nearly eight years before becoming mayor , it felt like Che Guevara had ridden down from the hills to reform the land and free the peasantry .
Because he was so young , his election made news all over the world -- good news .
Because he filled City Hall with compadres -- some key staffers were in their twenties with no experience in government -- it felt like revolution .
And because it was Cleveland , the whole shebang was doomed .
If it had n't been Muny Light -- Municipal Light and Power , the city - owned electric plant -- it would have been something else .
The men who had run corporate Cleveland for decades were n't about to hand their power over to a bare - knuckled urban populist who believed that funding city schools and services was more vital than tax abatements for developers , who held court at Tony 's Diner on West 117th Street , not the Union Club downtown , and who called them blackmailers and con men in public .
Within a year of his election , using his public firing of a police chief as an excuse , they funded a recall election that Kucinich barely survived .
But it was Muny Light that did Kucinich in .
It was Muny Light that the private utility company in northeast Ohio wanted to swipe from the city , because Muny kept the rates down , killing profit .
Before Kucinich took office , the deal had been sealed .
All of the pillars who had long ago fled to the suburbs but still owned and bled the town as it withered and grew poor had agreed to strip Cleveland of one of its last real assets .
Then this same dinky SOB now up on the stage in his shabby raincoat , running for the White House , told 'em all -- the lawyers and the bankers and the private utility company -- to go pound salt .
" Lemme tell ya a little bit about myself , " he shouts at the union crowd .
" And once you know about me , you 'll know why when I tell you what I intend to do about this sale , it 's the real thing .
I 'm the oldest of seven kids , and my parents never owned a home .
We lived in twenty - one different places by the time I was seventeen , including a coupla cars .
I have this vivid memory of my parents sitting at the kitchen table in one apartment on St. Clair Avenue , one of those old white metal - topped tables that when it 's chipped , there 's black underneath .
I remember them sitting at this table counting the pennies to pay the utility bill .
" When I was in a room with the lead banker in Cleveland on December 15 , 1978 , and he was telling me that I had to sell the city - owned electric system , suddenly I was transported back in time and space to this little boy listening to and watching his parents count the pennies to pay the utility bill " -- and here Kucinich 's voice softens -- " I was sitting there with this banker , and I could hear the pennies dropping again -- click...click...click ... "
Then he reaches back and hurls the four - seamer , up and in .
" And because I remembered where I came from , I said no to the sale .
I can't be bullied , I can't be bossed , I can't be intimidated , and I can't be tricked .
I 'm there on behalf of your families -- I 'm there on behalf of your jobs .
I 'm there -- the same person who as a child listened to his parents count the pennies at the table -- "
Shouting now , Kucinich pumps his right fist up and down as the crowd cheers .
" Mom and Dad !
I 'm there for all the mothers and fathers who are worried about what they 're paying , who are worried about their jobs , who want to make sure that they can claim that this country still belongs to working people , still belongs to the people , and there 's someone who will stand for that principle . "
Michael Edwards
The folks who know that Dennis Kucinich cannot be elected president of the United States understand that while principle is nice , an excellent and desirable concept , practical politics is the art of the possible .
Democracy requires compromise , and principle at times must yield to necessity .
Being a Clevelander , Kucinich yields to nothing .
Ever .
When he said no to the sale of Muny Light , the city 's banks , led by Cleveland Trust , made good on their ultimatum and refused to extend the city credit on $ 14 million worth of short - term notes .
And by so doing , they deliberately flushed the city down the fiscal toilet and into default , which made more news around the world -- awful news -- and brought Dennis Kucinich 's political career to an apparent end .
But not immediately .
On December 18 , 1978 , Mayor Kucinich , surrounded by the media , strode from City Hall to the main branch of Cleveland Trust downtown and withdrew his paltry life savings in protest .
And because it was Cleveland , on the very same day , blocks away , his youngest brother , Perry Kucinich , robbed a different bank .
Perry was n't really a criminal ; he was literally insane .
But it sure looked bad for Dennis .
Because it was Cleveland , though , it could 've been worse .
The local mob , for reasons that have never been clear -- some say it was because Kucinich disconnected the city 's garbage - hauling contract from the Mafia -- hired an out - of - state hitman to whack the mayor at a Columbus Day parade .
When Kucinich got sick two days before the parade , the hit was relocated to Tony 's Diner at a later date -- and after the default , when it was clear that Kucinich shortly would be out of office , it was called off altogether .
Kucinich , meanwhile , on the advice of the police , had long since begun wearing a bulletproof vest , and kept a gun at home .
By saving Muny Light -- it 's called Cleveland Public Power now -- Kucinich wound up saving Clevelanders hundreds of millions of dollars .
In return for his foresight and political courage , he got thrashed a year later , when he ran for a second term , by George Voinovich , the current U.S. senator , who summed up his ' 79 campaign platform by telling The New York Times , " I like fat cats -- I want as many in Cleveland as I can get . "
Shattered by the loss , Kucinich limped back into the hills , unemployed and unemployable , a virtual pariah .
The union crowd knows none of this , of course .
They 're cheering because , first of all , Kucinich showed up .
All the Democrats zipping through New Hampshire trying to build a base for the primary were invited ; only Kucinich came .
They 're cheering too because Kucinich promises to hold hearings on the Verizon sale -- a six - term congressman now , he chairs the Domestic Policy Subcommittee -- and also to ask the FCC and SEC to look into it .
And they 're cheering because , what the hell , the guy at the microphone with the hot wife and the drab raincoat is yelling and pumping his arm like Huey Long in an old newsreel .
But when the speech is finished and Kucinich and Elizabeth wind their way through the crowd and up the street -- his arm around her waist , hers around his shoulders -- to a Portsmouth restaurant where his campaign manager has scheduled a news conference , the place is nearly empty .
There 's a photographer with an online business based entirely on photos of presidential candidates touring New Hampshire -- he got Obama earlier this morning in Manchester -- and two pimply young students from nearby Franklin Pierce University who 've brought a digital videocam to interview Kucinich for their Website .
That 's it .
Kucinich sits on a stool near the front window of the restaurant as the college kids line up their shot .
Elizabeth smooths his hair -- he has a hint of gray just by his sizable ears , and the stubborn cowlick of a 1920s street - corner newsboy -- and then she levels the angle of the kids ' camera so that Dennis does n't look too wee .
In real life , he 's five seven , not really all that short , but his diet -- no animal products of any kind : no meat , no fish , no eggs , no cheese , no milk -- has thinned him to 130 pounds , and the fact that he looks decades younger than his age , combined with his buzz - saw voice and Sears wardrobe , not to mention his general level of intensity , makes him seem onscreen like a high school debater , or an embittered elf .
The camera does not love him ; luckily , Elizabeth does .
" So what are we doing here ? "
Dennis asks after the college boys depart ; he 's itching to hit the road .
He has another meet - and - greet at a bar up the street , and then it's on to Portland , Maine , an hour away , for a sit - down with a grassroots impeachment group -- last April , Kucinich formally filed articles of impeachment in the House against Dick Cheney -- then a speech to the Maine Lawyers for Democracy , followed by a keynote address at the Maine People 's Alliance annual Rising Tide Dinner .
Tomorrow morning , he 'll catch a 5:00 a.m. flight to Cleveland , where he 'll deliver a commencement address at Case Western Reserve University on Sunday afternoon .
Kucinich is running for the presidency as if he believes that he can win because he truly does .
When I ask him , in the empty restaurant , if he prepped his Verizon speech , he goes gimlet - eyed and snaps , " Yeah , I prepared it -- forty years in the making . "
And when I ask why he did n't close the sale and ask them for their votes , he smiles sourly .
" Because they know I 'm there for them .
Because I think it 's appropriate for people to know , first of all , what I 'm capable of doing , to show them what I 'm capable of doing .
Once I 've shown them what I 've done , shown them what I know , shown them what I 'm capable of doing , and go and do it , then their decision becomes easy .
I close the sale by delivering on what I said -- and nobody else can or will do that . "

I did not know Dennis Kucinich in Cleveland .
I did not know anyone like Dennis Kucinich .
Cleveland is divided by the Cuyahoga River into East and West sides , and even in the salad days of yore , their folk did not mix .
It goes thus : white ethnics , West ; Jews , Italians , and blacks , East ; auto plants , West ; museums , East ; Drew Carey , West ; Paul Newman , East .
West Siders had the airport and the zoo ; East Siders had the money and the money .
This was true when I was born , true when I left for good in 1984 , and true now .
I am from the East Side .
We were Jews with no real money , but we were not poor .
Kucinich is from the West Side , half Croat , half Irish .
He was dirt poor and knew it .
He shined shoes in barrooms to get a few coins to carry home .
Nuns took pity on his clothes and scrounged up better ones for him .
He lives in a real house today , but it is the same small West Side house that he bought in 1971 for $ 22,500 .
It is a miracle -- and no small paean to the American dream -- that Dennis Kucinich now not only sits in the House of Representatives , with a big fancy office in the Rayburn Building in Washington , D.C. , but also believes that he will be elected president in 2008 .
" I 'm ready , " he says .
" I 'm ready to be president today .
I can feel it .
The attempt to settle the election so early is something that I think is probably tension reduction on the part of people in the media , but I 'm not subject to their rules .
There 's time to do this . "
We are in his Rayburn Building office .
In the reception area , there 's an old black - and - white photo of the congressman in a sweater - vest and bow tie , pointing to a poster listing the three pillars of West Side civilization : polka , bowling , and kielbasa .
But in his office proper , the burgundy velvet drapes are tied back with thick white cord , sunlight pours in , and the ceiling is sky - high .
Here , in his slim blue suit , blue shirt , and red tie , Kucinich indeed looks ready for the Oval Office .
Still , to the extent that Kucinich is subject to the mainstream media 's rules about who matters , he hardly exists .
His hour - long speech on the House floor detailing how the hydrocarbon bill being rammed down the Iraqis ' throats by the Bush administration is really a ruse to grab the vast bulk of Iraq 's oil made no news .
He routinely is cropped out of debate group photos .
He is almost always put at the far end of the stage and invariably ignored for long stretches .
When finally called upon , he tends to yelp .
He neither looks nor sounds like a man who could be cast to play the president of the United States .
And , perhaps because he is from Cleveland , he yields nothing to his opponents for the sake of unity , nicety , or sales appeal .
Onstage , his scorn is plain .
His opposition to the Iraq war dates to late 2002 ; his position is simple : no timetables or benchmarks -- just stop the flow of money .
He says that fellow Democrats either wish to end the war , in which case they can just stop passing appropriations bills to fund it , or they 're just playing charades by funding the war even as they moan about not having enough votes to override a veto -- thereby preserving the war as an issue for 2008 .
His health - care plan is even simpler : universal , essentially free care under a single - payer , government - run system -- more or less how every other industrialized nation on the planet provides for people 's well - being .
To Kucinich , a candidate 's plan either unseats the health - insurance companies or plows even more tax dollars into a for - profit industry that pays politicians millions of dollars to do its bidding .
The folks who know that Dennis Kucinich cannot be elected president understand that his positions on these two issues alone , while principled and in accord with what tens of millions of Americans say they want , are nonetheless reducible to the sort of sound bites -- " Socialized medicine ! "
" Abandoning the troops ! " -- that would hamstring any candidate , much less one with Kucinich 's yap and look .
Thus Obama , Edwards , and Clinton stand center stage at each debate and get the lion 's share of the time .
But Kucinich has a plan to raise his profile :
He 's writing a book , too .
" It 's gonna be a series of stories about how throughout my life I 've come into circumstances where everyone would say , ' It 's too late -- there 's nothin ' you can do about it , ' and I decided to get involved , and changed the outcome .
There 's almost like a -- not almost , there is a spiritual mechanics to this .
And that 's what the book 's gonna be about . "
Spiritual mechanics ?
He nods .
" Doctrine of transubstantiation , " he says .
" That 's spirit into matter , okay ?
And then matter extends to spirit . "
He slaps his hands together .
" This is basic physics . "
Not on the East Side .
A lot of us over there were n't big on that whole transubstantiation thing .
" But I 'm talking about it as -- the church has its doctrine , and the doctrine has many different possibilities within .
It 's theology , but it 's also about things seen and unseen .
It 's not just a matter of faith -- there are things that the physicist David Bohm writes about in Wholeness and the Implicate Order .
There 's a reality " -- another hand - slap -- " that stands within existent reality , what 's apparent .
But there 's something just behind it that holds that reality together , kind of in those interstitial spaces .
There 's another reality there .
The way I look at it , translating it into social action , is that that other reality is waiting to be called forward , and made , and set into motion . "
Kucinich is just warming up .
Next come Shelley 's Prometheus Unbound , the encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII , Rerum Novarum , the Apostle 's Creed -- in Latin -- and the " nexus where spirit infuses matter and transforms it .
That 's where I live , " he says , bringing together the tips of his fingers -- " there at that connect - pole . "
The air in the office is already humming with the music of the spheres when Elizabeth walks in .
Kucinich nearly levitates out of his chair as he moves to kiss her hello .
" You look great , " he crows .
He 's right .
Great oogly - moogly , is he right .
Her hair 's pulled back tight from her scalp , she 's wearing a thrift - store summer dress that she just bought -- a flimsy , low - cut , flowery thing whose thin straps leave her shoulders and back bared -- and she has tied some kind of scarf around her slender neck .
Her clavicles alone are heart stopping .
And Dennis can't stop grinning , a schoolboy lost in love .
" I was just telling him about what I learned about how to change things , " he says .
" The spiritual mechanics of it . "
A staffer opens the door to let Kucinich know that ABC Radio is on the phone for an interview .
" Elizabeth , " he says , " what time should we be getting ready to leave ? "
" Well , the train 's at five past two .
We 've got to go back to the apartment and close the bags up , and I 'd like to eat something , too . "
She has the good British accent , light with laughter -- not the plummy , stuffy one .
While Kucinich takes the call from ABC , she tells me that she sat for her last college final -- in a course called Conflict Resolution in World Politics -- on 9/11/01 .
" I came to America for a number of reasons .
One , to work on monetary reform , which is something I really feel passionately about , but really with this in my heart : that I wanted somehow to help with the healing process -- for America to be integrated with the rest of the world .
The second week I was in America , I met Dennis .
I did n't know his politics .
I walked into his office with my boss to talk about monetary reform . "
Love at first sight ?
" It was soul recognition . "
Behind her , meanwhile , on the phone , Kucinich tells ABC , " Obama , for example -- he says he opposed the war from the start , yet 100 percent of the time , he votes to fund it .
I do n't think the American people , by the time we get to the primaries and the caucuses , are gonna be able to square that .
I think they 're gonna say , ' Wait a minute -- quit sayin ' one thing and doin ' another . '
The truth is the truth -- it 's not necessary to try to recut it for the convenience of the moment . "
Truth is , I 'm proud of the guy .
Electable or no , homeboy 's talking presidential smack and getting laid .
They probably even do it tantric style -- lifting Kucinich to interstitial pleasure planes no Clevelander , East or West , has visited before .

Prowling New Hampshire -- next stop , Manchester , where CNN is staging a debate at St. Anselm College -- the Kucinich Kampaign Karavan , heavy with Japanese pears and watermelon chunks but light on its feet , rolls one car long , with two aides up front and Dennis and Elizabeth in the back uploading press releases from a laptop to his Website .
Lunch usually means between - speech takeout from a local Asian joint , Thai much preferred .
I have seen Kucinich disappear a foil takeout basin of pad thai in five minutes flat with a white plastic fork -- because he is from Cleveland , the chopsticks never leave their paper sleeve -- as he simultaneously works the phone on behalf of a constituent in Cleveland needing help to get a passport expedited .
And I have heard him issue instructions in painstaking detail to a fresh young intern on her way to an organic market to locate exactly the right coconut sorbet for his dessert .
He may be a vegan , but he eats like a Clydesdale .
" This might be the best pad thai yet , " he says between forkfuls .
" That place in Iowa is pretty good , but this may be the best . "
Where in Iowa -- Des Moines ?
" No , I think in Cedar Rapids . "
How long have you been a vegan ?
" Ninety - five . "
Some kind of epiphany ?
" I met someone who was a vegan , so I tried it , and it worked for me .
I just decided I 'd do it -- and just like that , it changed everything . "
Does it give you more energy ?
" Energy , clarity , health -- everything . "
Elizabeth sings out to the intern about to hunt down sorbet , " Be careful that it does n't have any milk in it . "
" If they do n't have the sorbet , " Dennis says , " you can get some vanilla Rice Dream . "
" You like the orange one , " Elizabeth reminds him .
" Oh , yeah , " he says .
" And see if they have any vegan cookies .
That would be great . "
Says the aide , " And get a receipt . "
" This is an exciting way to spend my first day , quite honestly , " the intern says .
" I worked for a campaign four years ago and never got this sort of access . "
" And if you come back with the coconut sorbet , " Kucinich tells her , " you could end up being an ambassador . "
" I think I 'd have to graduate from college , " says the intern .
" You do n't in the Bush administration . "
" Do n't forget the receipt , " says the aide .
Each of the candidates has a greenroom in the basement of St. Anselm 's hockey arena , where the debate will start in a half hour or so , but not all greenrooms are created equal .
As far as I can tell -- not nearly far enough , thanks to the perimeters set up by the CNN underlings , campus police , and Obama 's Secret Service detachment -- Christopher Dodd's is a nice - sized meeting room , clean and well lit , and John Edwards 's boasts a spread whose vestibule alone is nearly as large as Dodd 's room .
The Kucinich greenroom is an oversized janitor 's closet , literally a utility room , no cinder - block wall of which is free from some sort of fire standpipe , exhaust vent , or fuse box .
Metal conduit runs across the gray unpainted ceiling , just above two trays of fruit and cheese and raw vegetables going limp under their plastic domes .
I fear that poor Mike Gravel must be at the dim far end of the hall , asquat in a men 's - room stall marked by a placard with his name on it .
Dennis Kucinich does n't care about his greenroom :
He lives for moments like this , when the West Side Croat with the bad haircut , the runt whose family had to pack up and split when the rent came due , gets to duke it out on national television with the anointed and the electable .
His eyes are bright , his best black suit is pressed , and his white shirt is as crisp as a new twenty .
Even the dimple in his tie looks ready to rumble .
" Okay , " he barks .
" Where 's my ball ? "
" Elizabeth had it , " says an aide .
" Your what ? " she asks , sitting folded into a battered dorm - room chair beneath a fire - red alarm box , wearing a black - and - white print dress , a black jacket with a pin on the lapel that reads PEACE in large sequined letters , and a pair of open - toed pumps .
" My ball . "
" No , I did n't , " says Elizabeth .
" You gave it to Andy .
Andy , have you got the ball ? "
" Andy , " Kucinich says , " where 's that ball ? "
" The what ? "
Andy Juniewicz is a crusty West Sider , variously Dennis 's friend , press secretary , and consigliere going back to the days when they were copyboys at the Cleveland Plain Dealer , forty - plus years ago .
He stays mainly behind the scenes , consulting from home , but he 'll make the occasional road trip .
" The ball .
Where is it ? "
" Might still be in your room , " Juniewicz tells him .
" No , " says Elizabeth .
" You took it . "
" No , " says Dennis .
" I gave it to ya on the way out the door .
I said , ' Take it . ' "
Juniewicz shrugs .
" We could wad up some paper , " he says .
" We can play rock - paper - scissors if ya want . "
So Kucinich wads up a couple of sheets ripped from a white legal pad , and everyone in the small room stands in a ragged circle .
" Okay , " he says .
" So the basic focus is the war . "
Suddenly he tosses the paper ball at Elizabeth , who snags it and hurls it at Juniewicz , who holds it for a few seconds before tossing it to another aide , who flings it at Kucinich , who 's rehearsing a line he 'll try to use during the debate when the subject of Iraq comes up .
" Let 's make this a productive evening -- let 's all agree that we 're gonna bring the troops home . "
Around and around goes the paper ball as Kucinich girds himself .
" Bring the troops home , peace , stop trying to steal the Iraqis ' oil , fair trade , workers ' rights , human rights , environmental principles -- end global warming and global warring .
Tie those together . "
" And health care , " says Elizabeth .
" Peace at home . "
" Right , right . "
" And when you say Department of Peace , include nonviolence , too . "
Kucinich nods .
" Absolutely .
All the way down the line .
Make it a productive evening , all of you commit right now .
Health care , make it a productive evening , all of you commit " -- and he bangs his hand into his palm as he finishes -- " right now . "
He 's ready -- almost .
" What I would like to do is just have a few moments with Elizabeth , " he says .
" I want to start to get into my zone , if I may .
But wait outside so we can do our do widzenias . "
This is Polish for " good - bye , farewell , until we meet again . "
But because they are from Cleveland , they must join hands and chant it , prefaced with kishka , kishka , which , on the West Side , denotes a blood sausage .
It goes , " Kishka , kishka , do widzenia .
" Repeat as necessary .
Loudly .
If , that is , you are from Cleveland .
And echoing down the long basement corridor swathed in mausoleum gloom , it rings almost like victory .
Almost .
Michael Edwards
Blitzer .
Blitzer is not from Cleveland .
Blitzer hails from Buffalo .
I do n't like pissing on a landsman , or on Buffalo , but Wolf Blitzer is a windbag , a smug , self - important sack of shit whose Situation Room shtick is the dreariest three hours in broadcasting history .
And I say this with all due respect , both to Wolf and to professional golf .
I say this also because Wolf Blitzer is hosting the debate , and because during the first hour , only Hillary Clinton gets more time to bloviate than Blitzer .
After Blitzer comes Obama , then , due mainly to his astounding incoherence , Bill Richardson , followed by Edwards and the rest of the pack ; Kucinich is dead last -- behind even Mike Gravel -- with two and one - half minutes .
Blitzer himself speaks for eight and a half , total .
He asks for Obama ,
Clinton , and Edwards to comment a combined twenty - six times ; the other five candidates get , en masse , twenty - three shots , including six chances for Richardson to shake his jowls while making wordlike sounds .
At halftime , while the stagehands set up chairs for a good old - fashioned pretend town - hall session -- with real questions !
from real New Hampshirites ! -- Juniewicz stomps off to find someone with CNN he can bitch at .
While he 's gone , another Kucinich strategist in the greenroom , a tall , goateed gent named Michael Carmichael , paints me the big picture .
" He 's going to win the nomination .
He 's going to sweep the boards , and he is going to have momentum going into Super Tuesday .
That is our strategy .
We 're not trying to lead this campaign now on the basis of any political metric that preexists . "
Which is probably a very good thing , since by all existing political metrics , Kucinich 's presidential candidacy lives at the nexus of 2 percent and No Preference .
And if Mr. Carmichael does not have Karl Rove 's firm grasp of realpolitik , he has done extensive research into alchemy , shamanism , and the use of psychoactive substances .
Juniewicz is still steaming when he returns .
" I just told one of their producers , ' This is bullshit , ' " he says on his return .
" She said , ' Well , Wolf is trying to hurry them up . '
I told her , ' Edwards says something , he then asks Clinton to respond , then he asks Obama to respond , then he asks Edwards to respond to what Obama said , then Hillary has to respond to what Edwards said -- this is bullshit . ' "
The second half proves even worse for Kucinich .
First ,
Wolf tosses Dennis a schoolteacher whose husband is in Iraq -- " We gotta finish the mission , " she says , " and we 're all Army - strong " -- and then sucker - punches him with an Osama hypothetical :
You can blow bin Laden to Allah with a Hellfire missile , but innocent civilians will be killed along with him .
Do you give the order to fire , Mr. President ?
Because he is from Cleveland , Kucinich wo n't duck and , worse , can't say no without throwing his own punch .
" I do n't think that a president of the United States who believes in peace and wants to create peace in the world is going to be using assassination as a tool , " he begins , then adds that bin Laden " oughta be held to account in an international court of law , and so should any other person " -- he means Dick Cheney -- " who 's been involved in a violation of international law which has resulted in the deaths of many people . "
It 's a perfectly awful answer , right or wrong .
Obama says , " I do n't believe in assassinations , " but " under existing law , including international law , when you 've got a military target like bin Laden , you take him out . "
Then Wolf asks for a show of hands .
Joe Biden protests , " It would depend on how many innocent civilians , " and Hillary squeaks , " This is one of these hypotheticals , Wolf , " but everyone raises his or her trembling hand .
Except Kucinich -- and maybe Mike Gravel , who might just be scratching his ear .
How 'd it feel to you out there ?
" Huh ? " says Kucinich , back in the greenroom , looking glum .
How 'd it feel ?
" Cold as ice the first part .
I could n't get in . "
Is it kosher to say , " Look , Wolf , this format is a sham " ?
" It 's not out of bounds , " he says , shaking his head .
" But I did n't do it .
I had three chances -- three cracks at the war . "
Elizabeth takes his arm .
" Should n't we get to the Spin Room quite quickly ? " she asks .
" Okay , " Dennis tells her .
" Are we ready to go ? "
The Spin Room is actually a gym , and more of the same .
The anointed candidates do n't bother to show up , so the mainstream media crowds around their strategists , asking about poll numbers .
Kucinich stands on the riser under his sign in his suit and tie , talking issues with stray professors and bloggers who 've managed to score media credentials .
" I do n't know why it is , " Elizabeth says when I ask her why she thinks her man is marginalized , " but it 's just a complete and utter disservice to the American people . "
I mention that lately she 's getting more press coverage than Kucinich -- which is true .
In the last few days , The Tampa Tribune ( " Kucinich 's Words , Wife Are Turning Heads " ) , ABC News ( " Kucinich 's Secret Weapon " ) , and the Sunday Times of London ( " Essex Girl Fills White House Race With Lurve " ) have all introduced Elizabeth and her pierced tongue to their public .
" The way I see it is I 'm really pleased that they realize that I 'm alive , " she says , " and I 'm glad that from that , I 've actually had a lot of media requests that have been more serious , more substantial . "
Not tongue studs ?
" Not tongue studs . "
It 's still in there ?
" Of course , yeah .
It 's been there for nine years . "
Can I get a quick look ?
" No . "
Please .
" No .
You 're not getting one . "
I try a different tack .
Hey , this campaign stuff must tire out a young gal , no ?
" The thing is that neither Dennis nor I run from ego -- we really run because we have the concerns of the American people at heart .
And there needs to be somebody there who is pushing on these issues -- pushing about the troops , Iraq , peace , diplomacy .
And with respect to the health - care plan , Dennis has had a health - care plan since year 2000 , and it 's the same plan .
It is endorsed by the New Hampshire Democratic Party , 14,000 physicians , 150 union locals -- everybody endorses it , but would they bring him into the debate on it ?
No . "
Well , since you wo n't show me your tongue stud , here 's my big question :
Can you describe a scenario whereby Dennis gains enough traction to become more than a fringe candidate whose only role is to push the other candidates to the left ?
And Elizabeth Kucinich smiles like an angel .
There is nothing silly in her smile .
There is no hidden anger .
No stand - by - your - man bravado .
It is the smile of a creature whose origins are somewhere beyond -- and I do n't mean the outskirts of London , where she grew up -- and who knows something no one else knows .
" Dennis will be the next president of the United States , " she says .
" Period .
And I can't wait for that day .
You just watch this space -- really .
He 'll be there . "
Michael Edwards
If Mrs. K's analysis sounds unreal -- starry - eyed and wishful unto raving -- I still prefer it to the cynicism of clubby assclowns like Blitzer .
But I try , while at Saint Anselm , to glean the wisdom of CNN 's correspondent Candy Crowley , whose considerable girth is matched only by her plus - sized brain .
I find her a few hours before the debate , standing by the arena in a misting rain , waiting for a golf cart to come lug her up the path to the Media Center .
I ask Candy if she can foresee a scenario whereby Kucinich gains enough traction ....
" Dennis serves a very useful purpose for a certain brand of Democrat , " she says .
" He pushes the other candidates -- "
Uh-oh .
Candy has spotted a CNN intern and rumbles over to accost her .
" I do n't want to be a bitch , " she snarls , " but I 've been waiting here an hour and a half for a cart . "
I do n't have the heart to tell her Blitzer zipped by earlier in a rickshaw pulled by a squadron of Saint Anselm cheerleaders .
Later , I phone MSNBC's Philly Phoghorn , Chris Matthews , for some Dennis - traction - scenario insight .
Matthews knows things .
He wrote speeches for Jimmy Carter .
He clipped Tip O'Neill 's cigar tips .
He once ran for a House seat and lost .
Four years ago , he dismissed Kucinich as a twit .
Now , he 's not so sure .
" He may have found his time , " says Matthews .
" He has to decide if he wants to ride the trail all the way to the end .
There will be a tremendous prize -- a trophy for the person who 's willing to stay in the race and debate Hillary from February to the end of the route .
There is an incentive to still be in the race , just to have a lottery ticket in case something happens .
Whoever 's got the ticket -- if Hillary has a problem , and we can all imagine that -- " I chuckle , imagining Bill wandering that lonely trail .
" You 're laughing , " Matthews says , " and I know it , too -- it 's the obvious imaginable problem , which we 've had before .
But anything can happen -- and whoever 's out there on the stump and still active as a candidate might be able to be the Cinderella candidate . "
Dennis Kucinich 's home has no number anywhere to indicate its address -- a leftover precaution from his days as mayor , when he had the $ 25,000 bull 's - eye on his back -- but you can't miss it :
It 's the only house on its lower - middle - class West Side street painted a strange shade of blue -- cornflower ?
Periwinkle ?
" This is the color you get when you mix red , white , and blue , " Kucinich explains .
" We were painting it on 9/11 .
We 're painting it again . "
Elizabeth calls down from upstairs , " We 're going to paint it white . "
" I was elected to city council from this house , " Kucinich says .
" Clerk of courts .
Mayor .
State senator , congressman .
My brother and his family lived in this house .
My mom lived in this house .
This is kind of a family homestead here . "
It is a small house -- eighteen hundred square feet , tops .
If you could find a buyer for it -- this street and the streets nearby have plenty of FOR SALE signs planted on the lawns -- you 'd ask maybe seventy grand , and be happy to settle for sixty - five .
" It 's a nice neighborhood , " Kucinich says .
" The neighbor to the right 's a mechanic .
Across the street 's a mechanic .
The fella just sold his home -- his mom went into a nursing home .
The people are nice .
It 's a nice feel . "
It 's a summer Sunday morning , quiet and slow .
The curtains are pulled back on the living - room bay window .
The couch and chair are covered with old bedspreads .
Someone 's crooning " Baubles , Bangles , and Beads " from a small boom box playing softly on a low table near the window .
Kucinich is right :
It 's nice .
Sinatra ?
He is n't sure .
" This is a compilation tape that Willie Nelson left , " Elizabeth calls down .
Once upon a brief time , the Boy Mayor was as famous as any country singer .
Tom Snyder did a whole Tomorrow show sitting in Tony 's Diner with Kucinich , back when the Tomorrow show followed Johnny Carson on NBC , and Charlie Rose and Bill Moyers , the PBS Logorrhea Duet , still had straw between their teeth .
Playboy ran its Kucinich Interview in its 1979 " Playmate of the Year " issue .
He was the Man .
When Cleveland spit him out -- Kucinich lost his reelection bid by more than twenty thousand votes -- Hollywood took him in , in the person of Shirley MacLaine .
They met at Elaine's , in New York City , a couple of weeks after the election .
Kucinich walks into the place with Jerry Brown ; Shirley 's at the table behind theirs , with Bella Abzug -- and boom !
" There was a recognition that went beyond the connection of the news or celebrity , " Dennis says now .
" We closed down the place -- and when we left , we agreed we'd talk the next day .
And it started a conversation that continues to this day .
Shirley introduced me to a whole different range of people , some of the biggest names , not just in show business , but in the arts , in literature , all kinds of things .
She just literally opened the world to me . "
Hence Willie , I guess .
It would be easier to make fun of this -- hell , it would be fucking irresistible -- if not for a few fairly simple truths that go deeper than where Dennis Kucinich stands on health care , Iraq , and the verities of soul recognition .
Truth number one is what happened to Kucinich after he lost the mayor 's office .
Nobody in Cleveland would hire him .
Nobody .
Ten years in city government , a master 's from Case Western Reserve , and he could n't find a job .
At first there were offers , says Kucinich , but those offers all were rescinded -- " the business establishment effectively blackballed me , " he explains -- and to make his mortgage , he had to cash in on his pension .
When that was gone , he borrowed money from MacLaine to save his home .
To save his home -- that 's truth number two .
Let me tell you something truly ugly about Cleveland , a city I will love with all my heart until I die :
It eats its own .
It has , over the last forty years , so deeply internalized the worst aspects of its image -- as a joke , as a shithole , as a place that anyone with any means and half a hope will leave behind -- that the locals scorn anyone who has n't fled as a loser .
And for Kucinich , this contempt was multiplied by the furious humiliation of default .
To this day , the only Cleveland mayor in its history whose portrait does n't hang in city hall is Dennis .
Still , Dennis Kucinich clung to this homestead .
And in 1993 , the city announced a $ 146 million expansion of Muny Light , and the Plain Dealer reported that he'd been right all along .
Right about scotching the 1978 sale .
Right about the banks and the private utility company .
Right about the city 's long - term fiscal health .
Kucinich was on the beach at Shirley 's place in Malibu when the PD reporter called , but he had this home to come home to , and so he did .
He came home , to Cleveland .
But the deepest truth of all is also the most simple and most plain :
The mark of the boy 's poverty etched into the man 's face .
It is n't any sort of metaphor .
It is n't shame and it is n't anger and it is n't hunger and it is n't need .
It 's all of those -- and more : the fire to make things right for those who truly suffer -- and it is n't going away .
No pity -- it 's a matter of respect and gratitude .
Whatever helped to make that boy grow up into this man , making fun of it means only that you never knew a kid as poor as this guy was -- and that you 're too bereft of soul yourself to count your own blessings .
Michael Edwards
Elizabeth comes downstairs , and while Dennis talks , she unwraps a gift from the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists -- Dennis gave the keynote speech at their recent convention -- a big framed poster , signed by all of them , of a cartoon by the Plain Dealer 's Jeff Darcy , showing the Kuciniches as John and Yoko , enjoying a Lincoln bed - in as a knot of cartoonists stands outside their window singing " All We Are Saying Is Give Dennis a Chance . "
Kucinich roars .
" This is really great !
Is n't that great ?
I do n't know where we 're gonna put it .
That 's a treasure .
That 's hilarious . "
Elizabeth is deadpan as she stares at the wide - mouthed , lank - haired caricature of the woman holding a tambourine .
" I think they captured me well , " she sniffs .
And then -- be still my heart -- she giggles and flicks forth the pink slip of her tongue , and there it is -- the rounded silver stud .
Just a giggle , just a flash , a sliver of a second , and yet it is enough .
" We 're gonna ask ya to take a ride with us , " Kucinich says .
" How much time have you got ? " asks Elizabeth .
" We want to go and see his sister .
It 's very rare that we get a weekend at home . "
Elizabeth drives -- a new Ford Focus , cherry - red .
Our first stop is a few blocks away , where we pick up Dennis 's brother Perry .
The bank robber .
" Perry 's a paranoid schizophrenic , " Dennis says as we park at the curb outside Perry 's apartment building .
It 's not an explanation , not a warning -- it 's a flat statement of fact .
Which is exactly what it is :
Perry could n't be a nicer guy or any more nuts .
He squeezes into the backseat of the Focus , next to me , and starts to show me his art , colored - pencil drawings , mainly geometric shapes .
" I like the air - conditioning , " Perry says , too loud .
He 's breathing like a dray horse .
" It 's comfortable .
It 's nice and cool . "
Kucinich turns to him from the front seat .
" What do they tell you about getting your teeth fixed ?
What 's the latest ? "
" What ? "
Perry shouts .
" What 's the latest on your teeth ? " Kucinich shouts back .
Perry opens wide .
Not good .
We 're on I - 71 southbound , heading to Medina , where Kucinich 's sister Beth lives .
I note that Linndale , whose border overlaps a hundred - yard stretch of the highway , still puts a speed - trap cop right at the underpass .
When we pass the Brook Park engine plant , Kucinich turns again .
" Ford is talking about closing two plants here , " he says .
" The casting plant , and they 're talking about closing an engine plant as well .
When you think about how they 're still sellin ' cars -- and people are buying cars -- why are n't we makin ' 'em here ?
This is where the Democratic Party is not right on trade -- they sold the American people out . "
What about a third party ?
" I do n't know , " he says .
" I 'm still makin ' my effort inside this party , but I can tell you that there 's such deep disappointment -- because of the war , because of health care , because of trade .... "
What is it Nader calls the Dems ?
Corporatists ?
" Ralph Nader ? "
Perry shouts .
" I think he 's a liberal , is n't he ?
Dennis was famous for goin ' to Tony 's Diner , and then Ralph Nader caught on that he was goin ' there .
And then after Ralph Nader went there , they closed it . "
Huh .
" Their hamburgers were good . "
" Perry , " says Dennis .
" I have to defend Ralph Nader . "
" I can't hear .
What ? "
" I have to defend Ralph Nader -- he had nothing to do with Tony 's Diner closing . "
" Wait -- I can't hear what you 're saying . "
Kucinich turns fully around in his seat with a wolf 's grin on his face .
In the rearview mirror I can see that Elizabeth is holding in her laughter .
" Ralph Nader did not close Tony's Diner . "
" No , " says Perry in a quiet , matter - of - fact voice .
" He went there once .
I remember . "
" He did n't close it , though .
There 's no connection . "
" Are you sure ? "
" Positive . "
" Oh . Oh , well .
Must 've been a misconception . "
" Yes , " Dennis says .
We pick up Beth at the foster home where she lives -- she 's not as gone as Perry , but she ain't right -- and eat lunch at a Hunan place in Medina 's town square .
Braised tofu , avocado rolls , Singapore noodles -- everything 's delicious .
Elizabeth allows herself a rare glass of plum wine , Kucinich has his usual hot tea , and Beth and Perry drink sodas .
As we sit digesting , I ask Kucinich the same question I asked Elizabeth at St. Anselm : Can you describe a scenario where you gain enough traction to become more than a fringe candidate ?
" Sure , " Kucinich says , and he grabs a paper place mat and the pen from his shirt pocket .
He turns the place mat over and writes " HC " and " 40 " next to the initials .
Below that , " BO " and " 30 , " and below that , " JE " and " 15 . "
He squares off " HC " and " BO " and their shares of the polling pie -- they 're out of reach for now -- and circles " JE " and his " 15 . "
Then he draws a thick arrow piercing that circle .
" If I can get there , " he says , going over and over the arrow 's point until it touches the " 1 " in John Edwards 's 15 percent .
" If I can get there , " he says again .
That would take a miracle , Dennis .
He shakes his head .
" More and more , people are paying attention -- they 're saying that I 'm coming across very clear and direct and steady .
I do n't need for somebody to re-create me .
I do n't need to be prettified .
I do n't need image - makers working with me .
That 's not where I come from . "
" Dennis , " Perry says .
" You have to come up with campaign slogans . "
" We 're workin ' on some of 'em , " says Dennis .
I offer mine : " Get A Receipt . "
Kucinich laughs .
" Very funny , " he says .
" Today 's Ma's birthday , Dennis , " says Perry .
" I know it is . "
" She woulda been seventy - eight . "
" Actually , Perry , eighty - three .
She was born in ' 24 .
Perry ?
She 'da been eighty - three today . "
" Well , " says Elizabeth .
" That 's special . "
It could be any family anywhere , but it 's not .
It 's Dennis Kucinich 's family -- and it's America , where even a poor pure product of the West Side of Cleveland can grow up to be president someday , if only he believes it hard enough .

Ms. Ghuman is certainly not alone in her frustration .
Academic and civil liberties groups point to other foreign scholars who have been denied entry without explanation at an airport , or refused a visa when they applied .
A pending lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that the Bush administration is using heightened security measures to keep foreign scholars out on ideological grounds in violation of the First Amendment rights of American scholars to hear them .
But Ms. Ghuman ’s case does not seem to fit such a pattern .
Few believe that her book in progress , “ India in the English Musical Imagination , 1890 - 1940 , ” or her work on Elgar , best known by Americans for “ Pomp and Circumstance , ” could have raised red flags in Washington .
And if it were a question of security profiling , nothing in her background fits .
She was born in Wales .
Her mother is a British homemaker , and her father , an emeritus professor of educational psychology at the University of Wales , was born in India to a Sikh family and moved to Britain in the 1960s .
Last semester , Ms. Ghuman tried to teach her students by video link .
This academic year , she is on an unpaid leave of absence .
“ The arbitrary and inexplicable exclusion of Dr. Ghuman has been a personal tragedy for her and a cause of distress to Mills and to American higher education , ” said Janet L. Holmgren , the president of Mills College , who called her “ one of our most distinguished faculty members . ”
“ She seems to be in this limbo , ” said Ms. Ghuman ’s fiancé , Paul Flight , 47 , who has visited her three times in Britain and is considering a move there .
Mr. Flight , a countertenor , co-directed Darius Milhaud ’s opera about Orpheus and Eurydice with Ms. Ghuman at Mills three years ago .
Ms. Ghuman ’s descent into the bureaucratic netherworld began on Aug. 8 , 2006 , when she and Mr. Flight returned to San Francisco from a research trip to Britain .
Armed immigration officers met them at the airplane door and escorted Ms. Ghuman away .
In a written account of the next eight hours that she prepared for her lawyer , Ms. Ghuman said that officers tore up her H - 1B visa , which was valid through May 2008 , defaced her British passport , and seemed suspicious of everything from her music cassettes to the fact that she had listed Welsh as a language she speaks .
A redacted government report about the episode obtained by her lawyer under the Freedom of Information
Act erroneously described her as “ Hispanic . ”
More than two - thirds of the world 's large cities are in areas vulnerable to global warming and rising sea levels , and millions of people are at risk of being swamped by flooding and intense storms , according to a study released Wednesday .
In all , 634 million people live in the threatened coastal areas worldwide — defined as those lying at less than 10.05 metresabove sea level — and the number is growing , said the study , which waspublished in the journal Environment and Urbanization .
More than 180 countries have populations in low - elevation coastal zones , and about 70 per cent of those have urban areas of more thanfive million people that are under threat .
Among them : Tokyo , New York , Mumbai , India ; Shanghai , China ; Jakarta , Indonesia ; and Dhaka , Bangladesh .
Asia most - threatened area
The peer - reviewed scientific study said it is the first to identify the world 's low - lying coastal areas that are vulnerable to global warming and rising sea levels .
It said 75 per cent of all people living in vulnerable areas are in Asia , with poorer nations most at risk .
The study gives no time frame for rising sea levels or the potential flooding in individual countries .
It warns , however , the solution to the problem will not be cheap and may involve relocating many people and building protective engineering structures .
And , it adds , nations should consider halting or reducing population growth in coastal areas .
" Migration away from the zone at risk will be necessary but costly and hard to implement , so coastal settlements will also need to be modified to protect residents , " said Gordon McGranahan of the International Institute for Environment and Development in London , a co-author of the study .
IIED publishes the journal Environment and Urbanization .
The other two co-authors of the study are Deborah Balk of the City University of New York and Bridget Anderson of Columbia University .
Separately , the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a draft copy of a report expected to be released next week that coastlines are already showing the impact of sea - level rise .
The draft copy , which was obtained by the Associated Press , said about 100 million people each year could be flooded by rising seas by 2080 .
The draft copy warned that two of the biggest cities in North America — Los Angeles and New York — are at risk of a combination of sea - level rise and violent storms .
By 2090 , under a worst - case scenario , megafloods that normally would hit North America once every 100 years " could occur as frequently as everythree to fouryears , " the draft said .
In February , the IPCC warned of sea - level rises of 45.7 centimetres to148.6 centimetres by the end of the century due to global warming , making coastal populations vulnerable to flooding and more intense hurricanes and typhoons .
The five nations with the largest total population living in endangered coastal areas are all in Asia : China , India , Bangladesh , Vietnam and Indonesia .
Between 1994 and 2004 , about one - third of the world 's 1,562 flood disasters occurred in Asia , with half of the total 120,000 people killed by floods living in that region , the study said .
In addition , more than 200,000 people were killed by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 .
Small shifts can make big difference
" Migration away from lowest elevation coastal zones will be important , but can be costly and difficult to implement without causing severe disruptions , " the study said .
Still , it said , " relatively small shifts in settlement location , out of a coastal plain onto more elevated ground , can make a major difference . "
That is especially true in China , a country with an export - oriented economy that has created special economic zones in coastal locations , such as Shanghai .
Fast economic growth has been associated with very rapid coastward migration , with the population in low - lying areas growing at almost twice the national population growth rate between 1990 and 2000 , the study said .
" Unless something is done , there is the possibility that , as well as the people living in the low - elevation coastal zone , China 's economic success will be placed at risk , " it said .
The men had been involved in a protest rally last month
The men belong to the Hindu Rights Action Force ( Hindraf ) , which organised a mass rally last month alleging discrimination against ethnic Indians .
Analysts say the arrests are likely to stoke more racial tension .
The five men are being held under the Internal Security Act ( ISA ) , which human rights groups want to abolish .
The act is not thought to have been used against government critics since 2001 .
Ethnic Indians - mainly Hindus - form one of Malaysia 's largest minority groups .
Activists say that many Hindus live in poverty , partly because of policies granting jobs and economic advantages to the ethnic Malay Muslim majority .
But the government rejects claims of unfair discrimination .
' Indefensible '
The five detained activists were involved in a peaceful rally last month - the biggest protest involving ethnic Indians in more than a decade .
Police used tear gas and batons to break up the protest .
Deputy Internal Security Minister Johari Baharom said the five men had been arrested because their actions threatened national security .
" They can be held for two years for sedition and also for carrying out activities that threaten national security , " he told the state Bernama news agency .
The ISA provides for a two - year detention , which can be extended further at the government 's discretion .
Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang condemned the government 's move , telling the French news agency AFP that the use of the ISA against the men was " completely indefensible " .
Earlier this week Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi said the government would not tolerate street demonstrations , and warned that if necessary he would resort to using the ISA " without feeling guilty , without feeling sad " .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Lightning crackles in the atmosphere of Earth ’s “ evil twin ” Venus , while the meager remnants of suspected bygone oceans continue to be whipped off the planet and lost to space , scientists said on Wednesday .

Lightning crackles in the atmosphere of Earth 's " evil twin " Venus , while the meager remnants of suspected bygone oceans continue to be whipped off the planet and lost to space , scientists said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / European Space Agency / handout
They unveiled a series of findings from the European Space Agency ’s Venus Express mission to the planet closest to Earth not just in distance , but also in size .
Venus , the second planet from the Sun , and Earth , the third , started out as virtual twins , according to scientists .
But at some point in their 4.5 - billion - year histories , something went horribly wrong on Venus .
The greenhouse effect ran amok , making Venus a hellish kiln -- its surface hot and dry , its crushing atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide permeated by clouds of sulfuric acid that cloak the planet .
“ The findings show , of course , that the planet as it stands now is different from the Earth -- the high temperatures , the high pressures and the composition .
But the processes , we now understand , are much more Earth - like , ” Hakan Svedhem , Venus Express team project scientist , said in a telephone interview .
“ The two planets were , in fact , very similar in the earlier days of the solar system .
And they have then evolved in different directions , but according to the same rules and explanations , ” Svedhem said .
The findings were published in the journal Nature .
OCEANS BOILED OFF
A previous mission to Venus had detected hints that lightning was flashing through the planet ’s atmosphere .
The instruments aboard Venus Express were able to unambiguously confirm the presence of lightning , the scientists said .
“ They look like lightning bursts , very short discharges of electrical energy , ” said Christopher Russell of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Long ago , Svedhem said , Venus was a much wetter place , probably with liquid water oceans like those on Earth and like those that scientists think once existed on Mars .
“ Eventually the oceans boiled off , and all the water ended up as water vapor in the atmosphere , ” Svedhem said .
Equipment aboard the spacecraft allowed scientists to observe how particles are escaping from the atmosphere .
The dominant escaping ions , the scientists found , include oxygen and hydrogen in the ratio that corresponds to water , which may help to explain how Venus lost its original water to space .
Venus , unlike Earth , lacks a magnetic field to protect its atmosphere from the solar wind , the stream of electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun .
Thus , the solar wind interacts directly with the upper atmosphere of Venus , causing Venus ’s atmosphere to lose its gases in the form of ionized particles , the scientists said .
Liquid water oceans may have been present on Venus as recently as 1 billion to 3 billion years ago , Svedhem said .
The scientists also gathered three - dimensional images of a vast rotating vortex of clouds at the south pole and compiled the best global map of atmospheric temperatures to date .
Some scientists dub Venus Earth ’s “ evil twin . ”
Its surface temperatures top 750 degrees F ( 400 degrees Celsius ) and its surface pressure is a hundred times that of Earth .
“ How did it all go wrong ? ” asked Andrew Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology in a commentary accompanying the findings .
Venus Express was launched from Kazakhstan in November 2005 and reached orbit around Venus in April 2006 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. stocks rebounded on Wednesday but equity markets across Europe and Asia were still swooning a day after Wall Street ’s blue chips suffered their biggest daily point loss since the September 11 , 2001 attacks .

U.S. investors appeared to be taking advantage of cheap equity prices , helping to push all three major indexes higher .
But trading remained fairly volatile after Tuesday ’s equity - led sell - off .
The Dow Jones industrial has traded in a range exceeding 160 points over the day ..
The equity market ’s rebound hit its stride after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress there did n’t appear to be a single trigger for the global stock slump on Tuesday .
Bernanke also said he expects moderate U.S. economic growth to continue .
Those remarks weighed on U.S. Treasury debt prices , already lower on the day as investors took a breather after bidding bonds up to their biggest daily gains in two years on Tuesday .
“ I think the majority of people viewed yesterday ’s move as not surprising but a little overdone , and some of the comments from the Fed chairman are certainly helping to restore confidence in the markets today , ” said Michael James , senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles .
Lou Brien , strategist with DRW Trading Group in Chicago , said , “ you are seeing some of the safe - haven trade being taken out of the long end of the Treasury market . ”
The Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI was up 55.68 points , or 0.46 percent , at 12,271.92 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX was up 8.45 points , or 0.60 percent , at 1,407.49 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 9.25 points , or 0.38 percent , at 2,417.11 .
Benchmark U.S. 10 year Treasury notes were down 14/32 in price to yield 4.57 percent .
China 's main Shanghai stock index .
SSEC , whose 9 percent dive on Tuesday on regulatory concerns was cited by some as sparking the global selloff , bounced back almost 4 percent , but it stood alone among Asian markets .
Currency markets also steadied after one of the most volatile sessions in years , with the yen trading modestly lower against the dollar .
The previous session the Japanese currency had staged a lightning rally to 10 - week highs versus the dollar when investors unwound yield - dependent yen carry trades in a bid to avert risk .
The dollar was up 0.4 percent to 118.40 yen after falling below 118 a day ago .
Bernanke ’s remarks also helped it shake off data showing a decline in January new home sales , sending the euro down to $ 1.3220 compared with $ 1.3240 late Tuesday .
But a report on Wednesday showing the U.S. economy expanded at a weaker - than - expected 2.2 percent rate in the final three months of last year may keep investors wary of the dollar .
“ The truth is that weakening in the currency will probably continue .
Good data is clearly becoming more sparse and today ’s reports , if anything , just reinforce the view the Fed is done tightening , ” said Mark Meadows , currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington D.C .
U.S. crude oil also fell amid anxiety about growth in the world ’s biggest oil consumer , slipping 83 cents , or 1.35 percent , to $ 60.63 per barrel .
Gold for April delivery on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange was down $ 17.40 , or 2.6 percent , at $ 669.80 an ounce .

ASIAN , EUROPEAN EQUITIES STILL HURTING
European stocks fell for a second straight day , with oil majors and mining shares among the top decliners .
The FTSEurofirst 300 index .
FTEU3 of top European shares unofficially closed down 1.36 percent at 1,485.58 points , its lowest close since January 10 , although it was above an intraday low of 1,473.66 .
The two - day sell - off around the world saw the MSCI world stock market .
MSCIWD index -- which had risen more than 4 percent this year as recently as Monday -- lose all its gains for the year .
Tuesday 's equities sell off also catapulted a key measure of equity market volatility .
VIX -- known as the " fear index " and a closely - watched gauge of market risk aversion -- more than 64 percent higher .
With nerves more settled by Wednesday , however , the VIX was more subdued , dropping by nearly 20 percent in midday trading .
Emerging stock markets continued to weaken .
After falling 3.07 percent on Tuesday , the MSCI emerging markets stock index .
MSCIEF lost 1.79 percent to hit its lowest since January 19 .
It hit a record high as recently as February 22 .
Earlier , Asian stock indexes mirrored the decline in the U.S. , with Hong Kong 's Hang Seng Index .HSI down 2.1 percent and the H - share index .HSCE of Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong off 3 percent , well above the lows .
Japan 's Nikkei average .
N225 lost 2.9 percent , Australia 's benchmark S&P / ASX 200 index .
AXJO fell 2.7 percent and Seoul 's KOSPI . KS11 shed 2.6 percent .
The news came out yesterday when few would notice .
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - OPEC is likely to discuss creating a basket of currencies for oil pricing at its next summit due to the steady decline in the dollar , Venezuela 's Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said on Friday .
" The need to establish a basket of currencies ... will probably be a point of discussion in the next OPEC summit , " Ramirez told reporters during an evening event in the presidential palace .
" The dollar as a benchmark currency has been weakening quite a lot and it creates distortions in oil markets . "
While disturbing , it would n't mean much except for the fact that this is merely the latest step in a trend away from the dollar by OPEC nations .
For example :
* UAE central bank diversifies away from dollars
* Kuwait unhooks the currency peg to the dollar
* Syria ( not an OPEC nation ) unhooks currency peg to the dollar
* Saudi Arabia refuses to cut interest rates with Federal Reserve
* Iran sells oil in Euros
* Venezuela currency peg is in danger , and plans to sell oil priced in Euros
The question is : why does this matter ?
History of the PetroDollar
The petrodollar is an interesting historical , economic , phenomena not likely to ever be repeated .
A petrodollar ( a term coined in 1973 ) is an American dollar earned by a foreign nation from the sale of its own oil .
The significance of the petrodollar revolves around the concept of " what is money ? "
Money is any marketable good or token used by a society as a store of value , a medium of exchange , and a unit of account .
Since the needs arise naturally , societies organically create a money object when none exists .
Through almost all of human history , and through all of American history until 1971 , money was based on a precious metal .
In other words , if someone asked you what a dollar was your answer would be " 1/44th of an ounce of gold " .
You see , before 1971 money was n't a piece of paper that only held value because the government said it did .
Paper money was something backed by a tangible asset .
It 's the gold ( or silver ) backing that gave the paper money its value ( and after WWII America held 80 % of the gold in the world ) .
If it was n't for some sort of commodity backing America 's paper dollars would n't have any more real value than Weimar Reichmarchs .
So what commodity backed the dollar after Nixon defaulted on our international debts and took America off the gold standard ?
Oil was that commodity .
" Government is the only agency that can take a valuable commodity like paper , slap some ink on it , and make it totally worthless . "
-- Ludwig von Mises
1971 was significant for two reasons directly related to America 's default on its international debts and the petrodollar .
One reason was that it marked the start of increasing price inflation ( due to the devaluation of the dollar ) .
The second reason is 1971 marked the peak in America 's oil production .
Until 1971 America had been the leading crude oil producer in the world .
The allies war machine in WWII ran largely on Texas crude .
But after 1971 the world 's oil production shifted from Texas to the Persian Gulf .
Fortunately for America , OPEC nations all sold their oil in dollars , and pegged their currencies to the dollar .
Meaning that if Japan wanted to buy oil from Saudi Arabia they needed American dollars to make that purchase .
This created an external , artificial demand for our pretty , green pieces of paper .
The world 's economy runs on oil , and as long as all the oil producing nations demanded dollars for their crude then American dollars were in reality backed by oil .
In other words , it was Bretton Woods II .
The advantages are obvious .
For instance , America does not need to have a foreign currency reserve like other nations do because it prints the ultimate " hard currency " .
What other currency would other nations want other than the one that bought the commodity their economy depended on ?
Being able to print the world 's reserve currency at no cost also means that interest rates are kept at an artificially low level because foreigners need our dollars more than we need their savings .
It also means that massive trade deficits are not an important issue because we can always print more dollars to pay for the goods that other nations produce .
Like oil , most other commodities traded in the world are traded in dollars .
Bretton Woods II in Danger ?
However , there are significant differences between Bretton Woods I and Bretton Woods II .
In Bretton Woods I , the dollar was fixed to a certain amount of gold .
Other nations could either have dollars , or gold , in exchange for trade surpluses .
When America spent too much money on the Vietnam War , other nations decided they wanted gold instead of paper dollars .
The Nixon Administration realized it did n't have enough gold to back all those dollars it was printing , and the system collapsed .
In Bretton Woods II , there is no limit to the amount of dollars America can print , hence the massive amount of price inflation ( aka currency devaluation ) we 've seen since 1971 .
But unlike Bretton Woods I , we rely on the kindness of other national leaders .
OPEC nations must sell their oil priced in dollars .
If they do n't then the dollar becomes worth nothing more than a Euro or a Yen , except with massive trade and budget deficits .
Those trade deficits are currently funded by simply printing more dollars , but if other nations did n't need dollars to purchase oil what would we fund our trade deficits with ?
" The U.S. dollar is a ' faith - based currency ' dependent on the credibility of a central bank "
-- Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher
Hence you can see the problem of when Iraq started selling its oil in Euros rather than dollars in 2000 .
Within a few years we have invaded Iraq .
Now Iran is pricing their oil in Euros and the war drums are beating again .
This brings us to a new term worth knowing - Petrodollar Warfare .
Most OPEC governments are being propped up by our military might .
Most OPEC nations recycle their massive trade surpluses back into American debt rather than invest in their own people .
It 's a sick symbiotic relationship that requires our troops having their blood spilled to defend corrupt monarchs .
A relationship this dysfunctional can't last for long .
It 's also extremely expensive for America , and those costs are what is driving the dollar down in value .
It 's the dollar 's drop in value is what is causing the OPEC nations to move away from the dollar .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 31  An independent panel has sharply criticized the Army for failing to train enough experienced contracting officers , deploy them quickly to war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan and ensure that they properly manage billions of dollars in contracts to supply American troops in the field , according to officials briefed on its findings .
In a wide - ranging report to be made public on Thursday , the panel said these and other shortcomings had contributed to an environment in Iraq and Kuwait that allowed waste , fraud and other corruption to take hold and flourish .
The report does not address any suspected crimes by soldiers or civilian contractors ; those are being pursued by investigators from the Army and the Justice Department .
Nor does it single out individuals for blame .
But the six - member panel , appointed in August by Army Secretary Pete Geren , levels a stinging indictment of how the Army oversees $ 4 billion a year in contracts for food , water , shelter and other supplies to sustain United States forces in Iraq , Kuwait and Afghanistan .
The panel also blames senior Army leaders for not responding more swiftly to the problems , despite warning signs like severe shortages of contracting officers in the field .
“ The Iraq - Kuwait - Afghanistan contracting problems have created a crisis , ” the report states .
It ’s no wonder the Republican voters are veering back and forth , rejecting one candidate after another .
Fred Thompson , who was supposed to be likable once upon a time , has gotten so desperate that he submitted a four - minute candidate profile that was composed almost entirely of attacks on Romney and Huckabee .
Lately , Thompson has also been busying himself attacking the Fox network for bias against his alleged campaign .
McCain and Huckabee , the candidates who seemed to speak from the heart did best , even though their hearts occasionally seemed to be completely nutty .
McCain absolutely dismembered Romney on the question of torture .
( Mitt refused to denounce waterboarding because he said he did n’t want the terrorists to know what we were up to . )
“ It ’s in violation of the Geneva Convention ... how in the world anybody could think that that kind of thing could be inflicted by Americans on people who are held in our custody is absolutely beyond me , ” he said .
Having whipped his opponent good , McCain then turned right around and started refighting Vietnam .
( “ We never lost a battle ... ” )
It was suspenseful , waiting for the next shoe to drop , for the next candidate to go whacky .
Rounding out the field was Representative Duncan Hunter , who has  well , he has a grandson who says cute things to his teacher .
Hunter appears to have done his hardest campaigning in Florida , which means he has made approximately as many stops over the last six months as a low - energy tourist on a single weekend .
Every sign points to the party nominees being chosen by the first week in February .
( If given the choice , would you prefer to see your Christmas stocking filled with a lump of coal or 10 months of Clinton vs. Romney ? )
But on the Republican side , it ’s not hard to imagine the poor voters veering from one to the other .
( Him ? 
Oh , god no .
How about  him !
No , wait , what were we thinking ? )
Maybe they ’ll vacillate until the bitter end , leaving it all up to the final primary in South Dakota in June .
And that would be great .
Finally , instead of allowing a few thousand corn farmers to decide the fate of the nation , we could place the power where it rightfully belongs , with a few thousand wheat farmers .
The cost of college has increased faster than prices in general over recent decades .
After spending eight days visiting four colleges -- all good liberal arts schools -- that my daughter is interested in , I have at least two pieces of an answer as to why .
1 . Such schools practice extensive price discrimination , I think more than in the past , so tuition substantially overstates the real cost .
Judging by some figures I got at one school , the average student receives scholarship support equal to about a quarter of tuition .
2 . The quality of what students get , and thus the cost of providing it , has gone up .
I should add that I have no idea whether the quality of the education has gone up -- knowing that would require some reasonable measure of what students know coming in and what they know going out .
But the environment in which they are educated is more luxurious , and more costly , than it was .
A few examples :
All of the schools , so far as I could tell , provide the equivalent of free taxi service in and near campus , usually from the security department , to any student who calls in and says that he is worried about his safety -- and in some cases to any student for any reason .
Details vary , and in one case the service was provided by the town rather than the college .
The food service ranges from better than I remember to luxurious .
At one college , practically every floor has not only a resident assistant ( student ) but a " Wellness advisor " ( also student -- these are jobs with which students help pay tuition ) .
The same college had both an " Office of the Consultant for Sexual Misconduct Services " and a " Gender and Sexuality Center , " in different buildings .
At one college , when I asked about help for students finding summer jobs in their field , I was told that students could volunteer as unpaid interns -- and receive a stipend from the college .
The college athletic facilities were more like a high end athletic club / fitness center than what I remember -- and I went to Harvard , the richest school in the country then and now .
Expenditure on services arguably related to education has increased too .
There are writing centers , where students doing papers can go to get help from ( paid ) upper classmen .
There is the equivalent for math .
Class sizes are very small .
How much good this does in terms of outcomes I do n't know .
But I expect it makes the learning experience pleasanter .
To be fair , all of these were high end schools -- six top liberal arts colleges , one top university ( not all visited on this trip ) .
The general impression was of a gold plated education -- cost no object .
It is n't surprising that it 's expensive .
Most Americans Moderately Upbeat About Family Finances in 2007
Most Americans are moderately upbeat about their family ’s financial prospects in the coming year , with 57 % expecting some improvement in their financial situation and another 10 % expecting a lot of improvement , according to a new Pew Research Center survey .
These findings are in line with Pew surveys taken throughout this decade that have shown that most members of the public expect to see at least some improvements in their financial situation in the coming year .
At the same time , however , the survey also finds wide variances in the way Americans assess their financial situation right now .
About four - in - ten ( 38 % ) adults in this country say they are living comfortably ; another three - in - ten ( 28 % ) say they have enough money to meet expenses with a little left over for extras ; and about one - in - three ( 32 % ) say either that they are just meeting basic living expenses or that they do n’t have even enough for the basics .
A similarly stark division emerges when employed Americans are asked whether they earn enough money to lead the life they want .
Just under half ( 46 % ) say they do , while 53 % say they do n’t .
Among the group that says they do n’t earn enough now , most expect to earn enough in the future to lead the life they want .
Just 18 % of all employed respondents in the survey say both that they do n’t make enough now and that they do n’t expect ever to make enough to have the life they want .
These findings are from a new Pew Research Center survey on personal finances conducted by telephone from October 18 through November 9 , 2006 among a randomly – selected nationally – representative sample of 2,000 adults .
Other key findings include :
Youth , or at least relative youth , is strongly correlated with expectations of brighter financial prospects in the coming year .
Adults under age 50 are more optimistic than their elders that financial improvements are coming their way .
Those ages 65 and older , most of whom are retired , are the least optimistic ; this group is more likely to volunteer that their financial situation will stay - the - course or get worse .
When survey respondents report “ the biggest problem facing you and your family ” in an open - ended question , the single most common problem mentioned ( by 25 % of all respondents ) is not having enough money to pay the bills and meet expenses .
A total of 36 % mention a broader array of financial problems , whether it is bill - paying , cost of living , unemployment , low - paying jobs , gas prices , taxes or the like .
Nearly four - in - ten ( 38 % ) adults and 32 % of American workers say they have no retirement plan other than Social Security .
The groups least likely to have a retirement plan include : adults under age 30 ; Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks , and those with annual family incomes under $ 30,000 .
A majority of Americans report that their family ’s income is either keeping up with the cost of living ( 44 % ) or doing better than that ( 12 % ) .
But fully four - in - ten say their family ’s income is falling behind the cost of living .
These figures are a bit less downbeat than they were in January 2006 when 47 % said they were falling behind .
Married adults ( 43 % ) are more likely to report living comfortably than the unmarried ( 31 % ) .
Those not married — especially unmarried women — are more likely to report having trouble meeting their basic expenses .
Optimism for the Year Ahead
Two - thirds of Americans expect their family ’s financial situation to improve over the next year by a lot ( 10 % ) or some ( 57 % ) , while 16 % think their financial situation will get worse and a similar portion ( 14 % ) volunteer that they expect to stay the same financially .
These figures come from a separate Pew survey conducted December 6 - 10 , 2006 with 1,502 randomly - selected and nationally representative sample of adults .
( The margin of sampling error for this survey is +/- 3 percentage points . )
Financial expectations vary by age .
Adults on the younger side ( ages 18 to 49 ) are more likely than those ages 50 and older to expect their finances to improve .
Those ages 65 and older , many of whom are retired from the work force , are more likely than other age groups to either volunteer that they expect their financial situation to remain about the same or to expect it to get worse in the coming year .
Older men ( ages 50 and older ) are a bit more optimistic than are older women but there is no gender difference among younger adults .
And , those with lower family incomes ( under $ 30,000 a year ) are less optimistic than those with higher incomes .
Optimism for the Life Ahead
When looking over a broader horizon American workers are roughly split between those reporting they now earn enough money to lead the kind of life they want ( 46 % ) and those who do n’t ( 53 % ) .
Among workers who report not earning enough money now , the optimists outnumber the pessimists by 2:1 that at some point in the future they will earn enough to support their desired lifestyle .
A similar divide exists among those not in the labor force ; 48 % of this group says they now have enough income to lead the kind of life they want while 49 % does not .
There are fewer optimists about the future among this group .
Those not employed are almost evenly divided between those who expect to have enough in the future and those who do n’t expect to have enough income to lead the kind of life they want .
Age and life stage are strongly related to responses on this question .
Older workers ( 56 % ) are more likely than younger ones ( 36 % ) to say they now earn enough to lead the kind of life they want .
But younger workers are considerably more optimistic than their elders that they ’ll make enough at some point in the future to do this .
Finances Top List of Family Concerns
The optimism most Americans show for their pocketbooks in the coming year does not mean that financial concerns are unimportant .
In fact , when survey respondents are asked to put in their own words the biggest problem they and their families face , financial concerns dominate the list .
About 36 % of responses explicitly focus on personal finances and economic issues .
An equal portion ( 36 % ) of responses focuses on other kinds of problems , but some of these include a financial component , such as the cost of health care and education .
Another three - in - ten indicate they either do n’t know or see no particular problems facing their families .
The dominance of concerns about making ends meet is consistent with previous surveys asking this question since the early 1990’s .
About a quarter ( 26 % ) of responses to a Pew survey conducted in May 2005 mentioned the high cost of living or trouble making ends meet compared with 28 % in this survey .
In past surveys , respondents were somewhat more likely to also cite a broader array of concerns related to the national economy such as unemployment and recession .
As expected , those with higher family incomes are less likely to mention financial concerns while those with incomes under $ 50,000 are more likely to do so .
Similarly , older adults are more likely to cite health and aging - related concerns than are those in their younger years ( ages 18 to 49 ) .
Personal Financial Situation
When it comes to assessing their current financial situation , Americans are roughly divided among those living comfortably ( 38 % ) , those who are meeting their living expenses with a little left over for extras ( 28 % ) and those for whom their basic living expenses meet or outstrip their resources ( 32 % ) .
Not surprisingly , this assessment of personal finances is correlated with income and education .
Those with higher family incomes are more likely to see their financial situation as one that allows them to “ live comfortably . ”
Further , more college graduates than those with less education say they “ live comfortably . ”
Adults ages 50 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say they live comfortably .
Employment status is also important , of course .
Retirees and workers are more likely to report living comfortably than are non-retirees who are not employed .
Non-Hispanic whites , more so than either Hispanics or non-Hispanic blacks , report living comfortably .
Married couples ( 43 % ) are more inclined than the unmarried ( 31 % ) to describe themselves as living comfortably .
When it comes to gender , there is a slight tendency for more men than women to report living comfortably .
However , the gender gap is stronger at the other end of the financial spectrum ; women ( 37 % ) are more likely than men ( 28 % ) to say they are not meeting or are just meeting their basic living expenses .
This pattern is especially strong for unmarried women — both for those who have never married and for those who are widowed , divorced , or separated .
Nearly half ( 47 % ) of unmarried women , compared with just 27 % of married women , say they are not or are just meeting their basic living expense ; a marriage gap among women of 20 points .
The pattern is the same among men but not as strong ; 35 % of unmarried men compared with 22 % of married men describe themselves as either not having enough or having just enough to meet their basic living expenses .
Do You Need a COLA ?
A majority of Americans report that their family ’s income is either keeping up with the cost of living ( 44 % ) or doing better than that ( 12 % ) .
But fully four - in - ten say their family ’s income is falling behind the cost of living .
These figures are a bit less downbeat than they were in January 2006 when 47 % said they were falling behind .
As expected , those at the lower ends of the income spectrum are especially likely to feel they are falling behind .
More than half ( 54 % ) of those with incomes under $ 30,000 a year say their income is falling behind the cost of living and 47 % of those earning between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 say the same .
Adults ages 50 to 64 are more likely than their older or younger counterparts to feel they are falling behind .
There is some variance in this assessment by marital status .
Marrieds ( 38 % ) and singles who have never married ( 33 % ) are less likely than those who are widowed , divorced or separated ( 49 % ) to say their income is falling behind inflation .
This figure climbs to 61 % among those ages 50 to 64 who are widowed , divorced or separated compared with 38 % among those ages 65 and older and 49 % among those 18 to 49 who are widowed , divorced or separated .
These responses come at a time when the non seasonally - adjusted Consumer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics rose about 2 % over the past year ( November 2005 to November 2006 ) .
Back in January , when Americans were a bit more downbeat , prices rose about 4 % over the previous year ( January 2005 to January 2006 ) .
Financial Plans for Retirement
A majority ( 59 % ) of Americans have some kind of retirement plan apart from Social Security , but nearly four - in - ten ( 38 % ) adults and 32 % of all workers say they have no retirement plan other than Social Security .
Among those who are not employed and not currently retired , nearly two - thirds ( 63 % ) say they have no retirement plan other than Social Security .
Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to say they have no retirement plan other than Social Security .
These findings are consistent with other reports showing wide disparities along racial and ethnic lines in financial assets .
Young adults ( ages 18 to 29 ) are less likely than their elders to have any kind of retirement plan besides Social Security .
As expected , retirement finances are related to income .
Fully two - thirds ( 67 % ) of those with family incomes under $ 30,000 per year have no retirement plan other than Social Security .
Similarly , among those who describe their personal financial situation as either just enough or not enough to meet their basic living expenses , some 61 % report that they have no retirement plan other than Social Security .
This compares with 24 % among those who report living comfortably and 32 % among those who are meeting their expenses with a little extra .
Satisfaction with Life
More than a third ( 34 % ) of Americans rate the overall quality of their life as excellent , while 47 % consider it good and just 18 % rate the quality of their life as only fair or poor .
There is no difference on this rating between men and women , although among those ages 50 and older , women are less likely to rate their quality of life as excellent ( 29 % ) compared with men in the same age group ( 36 % ) .
Those who are married are more likely than the unmarried to give the quality of their life an excellent rating .
And workers are more likely than retirees or non-retirees who are not employed to see their overall life quality as excellent .
Income figures into these calculations as well .
A majority ( 57 % ) of those with family incomes of $ 100,000 and above rate their lives as excellent .
By comparison , just 19 % of those with family incomes under $ 30,000 rate the quality of their lives as excellent .

I was meeting with a very successful VC firm in Boston today reviewing new companies and ideas .
One of the partners asked me to characterize Web 2.0 startups .
I said , half jokingly , " I think Web 2.0 stands for a web app , 2 founders and zero revenue . "
But , they all have an advertising model in mind .
Read Techmeme any day and you know what I mean .
The Wall Street Journal has a story today " Investors to Web startups : Where 's the advertising ? "
The story basically says that VCs are nervous about funding anything other than ad supported consumer applications .
Venture capitalists tend to be fans of ad - driven sites since advertising revenue theoretically covers the cost of giving away a Web service free , and free sites attract users much faster than sites that charge money .
Such sites are typically also cheap to run because there is often no need for customer - service agents or costs for physical goods .
So such companies can have high profit margins if they succeed .
Many of today 's hottest Web properties are based on the online - ad model , including Google Inc. , which pairs ads with search results , and social - networking site Facebook Inc .
Do n't get me wrong , I love Web 2.0 apps , social networks , widgets , and UGC ( User Generated Content ) sites .
I use lots of them everyday .
But applying a one - size - fits - all revenue model to these ideas is just wrong .
The first thing to remember is that not all page views and users are created equal .
Meaning , some page views like SERPs ( Search Engine Result Pages ) are very valuable and can be effectively monetized with CPC ads , but other page views are essentially worthless or low margin .
Simply counting up page views or unique users does n't necessarily translate to revenue .
There are lots of other revenue models that can make sense for web based applications and services .
Freemium - The Freemium model , upselling from free to premium services is a good model .
Many of the widgets provide a free service with options to buy premium services such as more detailed traffic statistics , more powerful services , enhanced customization , or higher levels of service .
Transactions - Direct selling to your audience , affiliate marketing ala Amazon.com , finders fees , or percentage of sales , are all good models for certain types of services .
Subscriptions -
Yes , people will buy subscriptions to software , services , and high quality content .
There are some great businesses built on subscribers .
Advertising can be a component of any revenue model that includes a large targeted audience , but it should n't be the only path .
There are only so many ways to split the advertising budget pie ... and the big guys are getting most of it .
Web 2.0 entrepreneurs need to think creatively about all the possible revenue streams .

http://www.impeachcheney.org, By David Swanson
Congressman Dennis Kucinich said on a conference call Monday evening that after moving to impeach Vice President Cheney on Tuesday he will also introduce , at a future date , a resolution to impeach President Bush .
Or rather , he would have said that on the conference call if not for several technical SNAFUs .
The call was advertised as a one - way call on which only Kucinich could speak , but Kucinich was unable to get through because of the incredible number of people on the call ( I have no count yet , but the dings of the new people coming on were a steady stream of noise for half an hour ) .
So Kucinich phoned me , and I held one of my phones up to another so that everyone on the call could hear him .
That was working fine for about 20 seconds , until the geniuses running the call chose that moment to mute everyone except Dennis ( without stopping to realize that by muting me they were muting Dennis ) .
So , Kucinich gave a nice speech through my phones , but I was the only one listening .
Here ’s what he said :
He is going to introduce a privileged resolution on the floor of the U.S. House Tuesday morning to force a vote on his resolution to impeach Cheney ( H Res 333 ) .
While that bill includes offenses related to Iraq and Iran , Kucinich plans to focus his remarks on Iran and the fact that the current Pentagon bill includes funding to retrofit bombers to carry 15 - ton bombs .
Kucinich said he would hold a press conference at 3 p.m. in 2456 Rayburn House Office Building , Washington , D.C. , and would post on his House website and at http://impeachcheney.org an account of what transpired on the floor .
He said that there might be an actual debate on the substance of the charges , for which he said he was prepared , or there might be a motion to table the matter ( effectively killing it if successful ) , or it might be referred to a committee .
If it is sent to committee , Kucinich said , it will be the House Judiciary Committee .
I asked whether ( as has been done with impeachment resolutions in the past ) he would be able to insist on a time limit for the committee to report back .
Kucinich seemed unsure whether that could be done , but proposed that whether or not the matter is sent to committee he might start a discharge petition as another tool for forcing real action on the floor of the House .
Currently H Res 333 sits in the Constitution Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee , where Chairman Jerrold Nadler has done nothing with it for months .
Kucinich expressed great appreciation for what all the activist groups and individuals on the call are doing to help promote impeachment .
He also wanted to let everyone know that he will not only continue pushing for the impeachment of Cheney but will also take up the impeachment of Bush with a new resolution .
This was terrific to hear .
I wish I had not been the only one to hear it .
Original Article
The Free Flow of Information
Act has just cleared the House by a vote of 398 - 21 , but that does n't mean President Bush has any interest in signing it .
The bill would offer protection of sources and documents to journalists ( including professional bloggers ) caught up in federal investigations , and could put an end to images of reporters led from court in handcuffs after refusing to testify .
The Bush administration sees it as carte blanche to leak government information without penalty , though .
A federal media shield has broad bipartisan support , as the vote indicates , drawing support both from civil liberties advocates and limited - government conservatives who believe the federal government needs a critical eye fixed on it to prevent problems .
The Act was cosponsored by Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) and Mike Pence ( R - IN ) , who are both concerned that no media shield law currently exists at the federal level .
More than thirty states have such laws , and Boucher argued after the vote that the very prevalence of such laws showed just important they were .
" Such overwhelming support for assuring the confidentiality of journalists ' sources at the state level lays bare the glaring lack of similar protections at the federal level , " he said .
In its current form , the law protects only " a person who , for financial gain or livelihood , is engaged in journalism , " which involves the " gathering , preparing , collecting , photographing , recording , writing , editing , reporting , or publishing of news or information that concerns local , national , or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public . "
Bloggers ?
Some certainly seem to be swathed in the bill 's warm orange force field , but it certainly wo n't apply to everyone .
This definition of journalism , should it become law , will no doubt be parsed at length in court .
Recall that when Apple filed its lawsuit against AppleInsider and PowerPage a few years back over a product leak , it claimed that the bloggers were not journalists .
In addition , the bill does n't seem to offer any protection to amateurs .
The Society of Professional Journalists praised the bill 's passage , calling it " a victory for a free press and for the American people as much as journalists " and also noting that it appears to cover both bloggers and freelancers .
The bill is opposed by the Bush administration , which issued a statement today outlining its objections based on the " overriding imperative to protect national security . "
Investigating terrorism is , of course , mentioned .
Also at issue are government leak investigations , and the new bill " would make it extremely difficult to prosecute cases involving leaks of classified information . "
The statement threatens a veto , which ( if it happens ) would mean that since taking office , Bush will have only vetoed bills supporting stem cell research , cutting Iraq war funding , boosting children 's health care , and now instituting a media shield ( five bills total ) .
The Senate is considering a similar measure .
Risky business ?
Even as the US ponders protection for bloggers and other journalists , Reporters Without Borders notes that blogging has become a dangerous occupation in several parts of the world .
" Bloggers are now being harassed as much as journalists working for the traditional media , " says a new report out today from the group .
26 bloggers and online journalists have been jailed since September 2006 , with China topping the list , and 64 " cyber - dissidents " are also in jail .
The finding emerges from RWB 's Worldwide Press Freedom Index , which now puts the US in the 48th place after countries such as Mauritius , Ghana , and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Iceland comes first in press freedom .

Is there an objective , biological basis for the experience of beauty in art ?
Or is aesthetic experience entirely subjective ?
Using fMRI technique , we addressed this question by presenting viewers , naïve to art criticism , with images of masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance sculpture .
Employing proportion as the independent variable , we produced two sets of stimuli : one composed of images of original sculptures ; the other of a modified version of the same images .
The stimuli were presented in three conditions : observation , aesthetic judgment , and proportion judgment .
In the observation condition , the viewers were required to observe the images with the same mind - set as if they were in a museum .
In the other two conditions they were required to give an aesthetic or proportion judgment on the same images .
Two types of analyses were carried out : one which contrasted brain response to the canonical and the modified sculptures , and one which contrasted beautiful vs. ugly sculptures as judged by each volunteer .
The most striking result was that the observation of original sculptures , relative to the modified ones , produced activation of the right insula as well as of some lateral and medial cortical areas ( lateral occipital gyrus , precuneus and prefrontal areas ) .
The activation of the insula was particularly strong during the observation condition .
Most interestingly , when volunteers were required to give an overt aesthetic judgment , the images judged as beautiful selectively activated the right amygdala , relative to those judged as ugly .
We conclude that , in observers naïve to art criticism , the sense of beauty is mediated by two non-mutually exclusive processes : one based on a joint activation of sets of cortical neurons , triggered by parameters intrinsic to the stimuli , and the insula ( objective beauty ) ; the other based on the activation of the amygdala , driven by one 's own emotional experiences ( subjective beauty ) .

In order to assess both “ objective ” and “ subjective ” aesthetic values , two types of analysis were carried out .
In the first one , aimed at establishing the neural responses to objective beauty parameters , we contrasted brain activations during the presentation of the canonical sculptures vs. their modified counterparts .
The underlying rationale was that the canonical proportions intrinsic to the original works of art would elicit enhanced activity in areas mediating pleasure and , in particular , in the insula , the cortical region known to be involved in the feeling of emotion ( see [ 11 ] – [ 15 ] ) .
We also expected signal increase to be particularly strong during the observation condition , where brain response to the artworks was not interfered with by additional cognitive requests ( i.e. aesthetic or proportion judgment ) .
The second type of analysis , on the other hand , was aimed at the evaluation of brain responses related to the overt subjective appreciation of the stimuli by contrasting the brain activations obtained during the presentation of the judged - as - beautiful against the judged - as - ugly images .
In this analysis , we expected the judged - as - beautiful images to produce a stronger activation , than the judged - as - ugly images , in areas involved in the subjective emotional appraisal of the stimuli .
In this case , however , we did not bring forward any specific prediction due to the divergent existing evidence in the field .
The original image ( Doryphoros by Polykleitos ) is shown at the centre of the figure .
This sculpture obeys to canonical proportion ( golden ratio = 1∶1.618 ) .
Two modified versions of the same sculpture are presented on its left and right sides .
The left image was modified by creating a short legs∶long trunk relation ( ratio = 1∶0.74 ) ; the right image by creating the opposite relation pattern ( ratio = 1∶0.36 ) .
All images were used in behavioral testing .
The central image ( judged - as - beautiful on 100 % ) and left one ( judged - as - ugly on 64 % ) were employed in the fMRI study .
In the present study we investigated the aesthetic effect of objective parameters in the works of art by studying brain activations ( fMRI ) in viewers naïve to art criticism who observed images of sculptures selected from masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance art that are commonly accepted as normative Western representations of beauty .
An important feature that characterized the present study distinguishing it from others that also have attempted to clarify the neural correlates of aesthetic perception [ 5 ] – [ 8 ] was the use of two sets of stimuli that were identical in every aspects but one : proportion .
More specifically , a parameter that is considered to represent the ideal beauty , namely the golden ratio ( 1:0.618 ; for reviews see [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ) , was modified to create a degraded aesthetic value of the same stimuli in a controlled fashion ( Figure 1 ) .
Stimulus manipulation was very contained and in no cases were the modified sculptures judged as deformed representations of the human body , as assessed in post - scanning debriefing .
Another important feature of the present study was that the same stimuli were presented in experimental conditions that varied in the instructions given to the participants .
In one condition - observation ( O ) –viewers were asked to observe the sculptures as if they were in a museum , without any explicit request to judge them .
By inducing a “ simply enjoy ” contextual frame and without having the volunteers perform any specific cognitive task , we meant to elicit a most spontaneous / unbiased brain response to the artworks .
In a second - aesthetic judgment ( AJ ) - and third - proportion judgment ( PJ ) - condition , on the other hand , the viewers had to judge the stimuli on the basis of their aesthetic or proportion quality , respectively .
Therefore , in both these conditions the participants were involved in an additional cognitive evaluation of the stimuli .
Whereas the aesthetic judgment condition allowed us to determine brain activations in response to the volunteer 's subjective evaluation of the stimuli , the PJ condition was used to observe brain response during a task of overt proportion evaluation .
Although it is commonly accepted that subjective criteria play a major role in one 's aesthetic experience ( see [ 3 ] ) , it is also reasonable to accept that there exist specific biologically - based principles which may facilitate the perception of beauty in the beholder .
After all , new artists typically first master the ability to represent standard principles of beauty , such as symmetry and proportion , and only then eventually bend these rules to represent their overall vision of the world ( see [ 4 ] ) .
One of the most debated issues in aesthetics is whether beauty may be defined by some objective parameters or whether it merely depends on subjective factors .
The first perspective goes back to Plato 's objectivist view of aesthetic perception , in which beauty is regarded as a property of an object that produces a pleasurable experience in any suitable viewer .
This stance may be rephrased in biological terms by stating that human beings are endowed with species - specific mechanisms that resonate in response to certain parameters present in works of art .
The alternative stance is that the viewers ' evaluation of art is fully subjective .
It is determined by experience and personal values ( see [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ) .
In addition , because of our prior hypothesis concerning the possible involvement of the insula in aesthetic appreciation , we used a small volume correction procedure [ 21 ] to test for the effect of ‘ objective beauty ’
( C - M ; within and across O / AJ / PJ conditions ) specifically in this region .
The search volume was derived from [ 10 ] ( see also [ 14 ] – [ 15 ] ) centering a sphere at MNI x , y , z = 30 , 18 , 18 ; with a radius of 10 mm .
The following contrasts were tested .
First , within the “ common effects ” , ANOVA ( C+M vs. rest ) averaging across all experimental conditions ( O , AJ , PJ ) .
For this , the SPM - maps were thresholded at P - corrected = 0.05 ( voxel - level ) .
The other two ANOVAs assessed any stimulus - specific effect ( ‘ objective ’ : C-M , M- C ; or ‘ subjective ’ : B - U , U - B ) .
We tested for main effects of stimulus across the three experimental conditions ( O , AJ , PJ ) ; and for interactions between stimulus and condition .
Additional contrasts explored simple effects separately for the different conditions ( e.g. B - U , during AJ only ) .
For all these stimulus - specific effects , we used P - corrected = 0.05 at the cluster - level ( cluster size estimated with a voxel - level threshold of P - uncorrected = 0.001 , extent threshold = 10 voxels ) .
These contrast - images then underwent the second step that comprised three separate ANOVAs .
One considering overall pattern of activation ‘ C+M vs. rest ’ modeled for each condition ; one considering ‘ objective beauty ’ ( C vs. M ) modeled for each condition ; and one considering ‘ subjective beauty ’ ( B vs. U ) for each condition .
Finally , for each of the three separate ANOVAs , linear compounds were used to compare these effects , now using between - subjects variance .
Correction for non-sphericity [ 20 ] was used to account for possible differences in error variance across conditions and any non-independent error terms for the repeated measures .
Statistical inference was based on a random effects approach [ 19 ] .
This comprised two steps .
First , for each subject , the data were best - fitted ( least - square fit ) at every voxel using a linear combination of the effects of interest .
The effects of interest were the timing of the fixation point onsets , the presentation times of the sculptures ( C & M ; or B & U ) , and the presentation times of the question mark that cued overt responses .
All event - types were convolved with the SPM2 standard haemodynamic response function ( HRF ) .
Linear compounds ( contrasts ) were used to determine common effect ( C+M vs. rest ) and differential effects associated with the presentation of the sculptures ( C - M and M - C ; or B - U and U - B ) , separately for each of the three conditions ( O , AJ and PJ ) .
For each subject , this led to the creation of six contrast - images , that is three contrasts C+M vs. rest–one for each condition , and three contrasts C - M vs. rest , again one for each condition .
Additionally , three contrast - images were also created , which contrasted judged - as - beautiful vs. judged - as - ugly images for each condition .
Event - related fMRI data were processed with SPM2 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk ) .
The first four image volumes of each run were discarded to allow for stabilization of longitudinal magnetization .
For each participant , the remaining 162 volumes were realigned with the first volume , and the acquisition timing was corrected using the middle slice as reference [ 17 ] .
To allow inter-subject analysis , images were normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) standard space [ 18 ] , using the mean of the 162 functional images .
All images were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel ( full width at half maximum = 10 mm ) .
Two types of analyses of fMRI data were performed .
A stimulus - based analysis ( ‘ objective beauty ’ ) considered only the type of image that was presented to the participants : i.e. with canonical ( C ) or modified ( M ) proportions .
The second analysis ( ‘ subjective beauty ’ ) categorized each sculpture image according to the behavioral responses measured during AJ runs .
For this analysis , we included only images that were consistently judged either beautiful ( B ) or ugly ( U ) in both runs requiring aesthetic judgment .
Functional images were acquired with a Magnetom Vision MRI scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) operating at 3T .
Blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) contrast was obtained using echo - planar T2 * weighted imaging ( EPI ) .
The acquisition of 32 transverse slices with an effective repetition time of 2.08 s , provided coverage of the whole cerebral cortex .
The in - plane resolution was 3×3 mm .
During observation condition ( O ) , the volunteers were required to observe the images as if they were in a museum and , when the question mark appeared , they had to indicate whether they paid attention to the picture or not .
During the aesthetic and proportion judgment conditions , the volunteers were required to decide whether they liked the image ( AJ ) or whether they found it proportional ( PJ ) , respectively .
Thus , all 3 conditions required a response from the participants .
Using the index or middle finger of the right hand , the participants answered yes or no , according to the instruction presented at the start of each run .
Specifically , before the observation sessions , the participants were instructed to answer ‘ yes ’ if they paid attention to the stimulus just presented , whereas to press ‘ no ’ to indicate that they did not pay attention to the stimulus .
The question ‘ did you pay attention to the image ? ’ was introduced to make sure that participants were actually looking at the stimuli during fMRI scanning .
During AJ condition , participants were required to indicate ‘ yes ’ if they aesthetically liked the image and ‘ no ’ if they did not .
Finally , PJ condition required the observers to explicitly indicate whether they thought that the image was proportional by pressing ‘ yes ’ or if they thought that the image was disproportionate by pressing ‘ no ’ .
Participants lay in the scanner in a dimly lit environment .
The stimuli were presented on a black background and were displayed on a screen visible through a mirror mounted on the interior of the head coil .
At the beginning of each session , a 5 s visual instruction informed the volunteers about the upcoming condition / task .
On each trial , a 400 ms central fixation point plus 1000 ms blank - screen interval preceded the presentation of the sculpture stimulus .
The stimulus then appeared at the centre of the screen for 2 s ( see also [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] ) and it was followed by another 4 s blank - screen interval .
After this , a question mark instructed the observer to respond to the stimulus ( see below ) .
The question mark remained on screen for 400 ms and was followed by a jittered interval ranging 2 – 5 s , with a uniform distribution .
Within each run we presented 30 stimuli ( 15 canonical and 15 modified ) in a randomized order , but never repeating the same image within a run .
A question mark instructed the participants to respond to the images after a 4s - fix interval following each stimulus presentation by using a response box placed inside the scanner .
The stimuli were presented in three experimental conditions : observation ( O ) , aesthetic judgment ( AJ ) , and proportion judgment ( PJ ) .
Each participant underwent 6 separate fMRI runs , repeating each condition twice .
The condition order was maintained fixed across all participants , with observation condition first , explicit aesthetic judgment second , and explicit proportion judgment , last .
By keeping the observation runs first , we aimed at measuring unbiased ( spontaneous ) brain responses to the type of the stimuli ( canonical and modified ) .
To make sure that volunteers were not biased in their aesthetic judgment by explicit proportion evaluation , the aesthetic judgment condition always preceded the proportion judgment runs .
Fifteen 2 - dimentional images of Classical and Renaissance sculptures were chosen following the selection method described in Supporting Information ( Text S1 ) .
All the original pictures met the criteria of canonical proportions defined by the ratio 1:1.618 between body parts ; among the 15 modified image - versions , 7 presented a ‘ long - trunk , short - legs ’ modification ( range = 1∶1.47-1∶1.59 ) , whereas the remaining 8 images presented the opposite pattern of modification ( range = 1∶1.64-1∶1.82 ) .
Twenty sculptures represented male bodies and 10 female bodies .
Fourteen healthy right - handed volunteers ( 8 males , 6 females ; mean age 24.5 , range 12 years ) participated in this study .
They were educated undergraduate or graduate students , with no experience in art theory .
After receiving an explanation of the experimental procedure , participants gave their written informed consent .
The study was approved by the independent Ethics Committee of the Santa Lucia Foundation ( Scientific Institute for Research Hospitalization and Health Care ) .
Results and Discussion
fMRI behavioral data
The viewers ' evaluation of the stimuli , as expressed in the aesthetic judgment condition , showed that the canonical images were mostly evaluated positively ( 76 % , sd = 0.18 ) , whereas the modified images were generally scored with a negative rating ( 63 % , sd = 0.25 ) .
This finding was in accord with a preliminary behavioral testing used for images selection that also showed the relevance of proportion in aesthetic evaluation .
In this test violation of canonical proportions accounted for 77 % of the variance in aesthetic rating ( partial Eta2 ; see Supporting Information Text S1 for details on the preliminary behavioral experiment ) .
Overall effect of viewing the sculptures MRI analysis was carried out by first assessing the overall effect of viewing the sculptures contrasting canonical ( C ) and modified ( M ) images ( pooled together , C+M ) with rest , across all three conditions ( O , AJ , PJ ; P - corrected < 0.05 ) .
As shown in Figure 2 , activations were found in occipital and temporal visual areas , including lingual and fusiform gyri .
Additionally , activations were observed in the inferior parietal lobule ( IPL ) bilaterally , in the SMA / pre-SMA complex , ventral premotor areas , and in the posterior part of right inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) .
Signal increase was also found in the insula and hippocampus .
Most of the activations were bilateral , although stronger in the right hemisphere .
These results are summarized in Table 1 .

Among the visual activations , besides the primary visual cortex , signal increase was found in the lateral occipital cortex and the inferior temporal lobe ( shape sensitive areas ) , as well as in the MT / MST complex .
This last finding , although surprising at first considering that the MT / MST complex is involved in the analysis of motion [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] , is consistent with previous data showing that activation of these areas may be elicited by static images that imply motion [ 25 ] .
Most noteworthy was the activation of the inferior parietal lobule and especially of the premotor cortex .
These areas are known to become active during the observation of actions done by others ( see [ 26 ] ) .
It is likely that their activation was dependent on the intrinsic dynamic properties of the sculptures used in this study and the sense of action that they evoked in the observer ( see [ 27 ] ) .
Canonical vs. Modified Sculptures : “ Objective Beauty ”
The direct contrast of canonical vs. modified images across the three experimental conditions revealed signal increase for the canonical stimuli in the right occipital cortex extending into lingual gyrus ; in the precuneus bilaterally ; in the right posterior cingulate gyrus ; and in the depth of right inferior frontal sulcus extending to the adjacent convexity of the middle frontal gyrus ( P - corrected < 0.05 ; Figure 3a ; see also Table 2a ) .

The lateral occipital cortex ( LOC , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] ) and the temporal visual areas are known to be responsive to the presentation of body parts or even the whole human body [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
Signal increase within these areas may be therefore due to a greater representation of canonical body structures relative to the disproportionate ones .
The activation of the medial parietal areas and of the prefrontal lobe , on the other hand , might be related to mnemonic functions ( e.g. [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] ; for review see [ 34 ] ) , possibly elicited by the retrieval of plausible motor configurations , better represented by the proportional material .
The central hypothesis underlying the present study was that the contrast of canonical vs. modified stimuli would produce signal enhancement within the insula .
Accordingly , we carried out a small volume correction within the main effects analysis ( C - M ) using the anatomical coordinates reported in [ 12 ] on the feeling of emotion ( see also [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] ) .
The results revealed a significant signal increase in the anterior sector of the right insular cortex extending to the operculum region ( maxima x , y , z = 30 , 26 , 12 ; Figure 3 b , P < 0.05 , corrected for small volume ) .
This effect was particularly strong during observation condition ( P<0.02 , corrected for the whole brain volume , Table 2 b ; P = 0.005 , corrected for small volume ) , that is in the condition in which the volunteers were in a merely observational ( museum - like ) context ( see Figure 3 c ) .
Signal increase in AJ and PJ conditions , on the other hand , was virtually the same .
The most likely interpretation for this result stands in the different cognitive demands between the first ( O ) and the last two ( AJ , PJ ) conditions .
In the latter , in fact , the explicit request of overtly judging the stimuli diverted the volunteers ' attention resources towards a specific cognitive demand , thus lessening the natural neural response within the insula .
These data are in apparent contrast with some previous findings where symmetry was employed as an objective parameter of aesthetic evaluation [ 8 ] .
In this study , the authors did find significant activation in the anterior insula in the comparison of aesthetic judgment vs. control condition as well as in symmetry judgment vs. control condition .
However , they considered those areas that were activated by both aesthetic and symmetry judgment to be not involved in pure aesthetic judgment and hence omitted them from the analysis that directly contrasted brain activity for the judged - as - beautiful vs. the judged - as - ugly stimuli .
In this way , therefore , they also disregarded the insular activation elicited by objective parameters ( i.e. symmetry ) intrinsic to the stimuli and involved in mediating the sense of beauty .
The question now arises of what possible mechanisms are responsible for the insula activation during the observation of canonical sculptures .
The anterior sector of the insula has an agranular / disgranular cytoarchitectonic organization and is characterized by extensive connections with limbic structures and with centers involved in autonomic functions [ 35 ] – [ 37 ] .
Functionally , anterior insula is thought to mediate feelings associated with specific emotional states [ 38 ] , [ 11 ] – [ 15 ] .
Now , considering the pattern of activity described in the main effect ( C+M vs. rest ) , there are two concurrent possibilities that may explain insula activation .
One is that in LOC and in the parietal cortex there are neurons specifically sensitive to the canonic body images and that have privileged access to the insula .
Alternatively , one may suppose that the canonical sculptures simply determined a stronger activation of cortical neurons sending their output to the insula .
Another possible explanation , based on both main and simple effect analyses ( C - M ) , is that the insula was activated , not by simplest aspects of the visual stimuli ( e.g. shape or motion ) , but rather by higher order information coming from prefrontal areas 45 and 46 .
Studies in primates [ 39 ] showed that area 45 integrates information about object shape with that about actions .
While human left area 45 subserves language functions , it is plausible that human right area 45 , selectively activated in the present experiment , could be involved in action / shape integration as well .
In this light , canonical stimuli could be more efficiently coded in this area and determined , therefore , a stronger activation of the insula relative to the modified one .
In this context , also the functional role of prefrontal area 46 could be noteworthy in confronting information from memory ( e.g. standard body configuration ) with online incoming information ( observation of canonical and modified stimuli ) .
To summarize , we propose that the positive emotional feeling elicited in the viewer by the canonical images was determined by a preferential coding of these images , relative to the modified ones , by various cortical areas and by a concurrent , joint activation of the anterior insula .

Mark down another Metal Gear finished without knowing why I even started in the first place .
Was I curious about the new capture & convert feature , used to build and command an entire team for pseudo - turn - based strategic resource management ?
Not particularly , and it turns out the real reason you recruit enemy soldiers to walk unnoticed amongst the enemies is because the 3rd - person camera is so gropingly myopic as to render stealth a futile joke .
And though having to predict , without so much as a shred of context , which uniform will let you blend in on any given level may reduce Portable Ops to a three - dimensional prescient put - the - round - peg - in - the - round - hole game where the greatest challenge is running around without bumping into people , it 's still Metal Gear , right ?
God damn right .

Was I curious about how this installment would bridge the gap between Metal Gear Solid 3 and the original Metal Gear Solid , not to mention the highly anticipated Metal Gear Solid 4 ?
Fuck no .
All you need to know is there are some guys called the Patriots who used to be called the Philosophers who want to use Metal Gear REX or Metal Gear RAY or Metal Gear RAXA , D , or TX - 55 to launch a nuke at America or at Russia or at America and Russia and only Solid Snake or Naked Snake or The Boss or Big Boss or Raiden can stop them , but only acting actually as pawns of a larger plot orchestrated by Revolver Ocelot , formerly known as just Ocelet or as codename ADAM and eventually known as Liquid Ocelot , who is secretly in league with the CIA or the KGB or the President but really works for the Patriots .
Also you wear a sneaking suit .
So why did I clog up my 4 gig PSP memstick with this game when I could have been playing Final Fantasy Tactics or Field Commander ?
Because sooner or later the well runs dry and leaves you with nothing but the choice of starting Harvest Moon Boy & Girl or finally finishing Exit and when that day comes it's not gonna be pretty so by god I 'm gonna do what I can to make it last ...
... Maybe it 's about time I got a good book ...

Up in a fifth floor classroom , David Romer , a Cal - Berkeley professor of economics , writes a series of hieroglyphs on the board -- with a Sharpie , which , unlike a certain wide receiver from across the Bay , he did not pull from his khaki sock : Ei Di( gt ) Vi = Pgt + Bgt Ei Di( gt+1 )

This , in the unimpeachable terms of the Bellman Equation , is the definitive proof that NFL head coaches should go for it more on fourth down .
Really , no kidding .
Bill Belichick is one of several NFL head coaches who has studied David Romer 's work .
" Teams should be a lot more aggressive on fourth down , " Romer says with the precise air of a scientist .
" On average , you'd be better off going for it , essentially , in any short - yardage situation , and then there are some cases even in longer yardage when you 're in that position where neither punting nor a field goal looks very attractive .
" The usual assumption of profit - maximization implies that in their on - field behavior , teams should act to maximize their probabilities of winning .
This is n't happening . "
This , of course , is heresy .
In the button - down world of the NFL -- the last bastion of fascism , according to one enlightened former player -- a conservative approach is almost mandatory .
Survival of the safest , if you will .
Fourth down , the ultimate push - comes - to - shove , all - or - nothing moment in football , is not generally judged to be worth the gamble .
Not only are points often at stake -- passing on a three - point field goal is sacrilege in Coaching 101 -- but there is also the momentous matter of field position , roughly 40 yards worth .
Coaches are terminally terrified of risking that stretch of precious real estate .
But the risk , Romer insists , is almost always worth the potential reward .
" This is a professor from Cal - Berzerkely ? " asked Giants head coach Jim Fassel , in the true tradition of a former Stanford man .
Fassel turned a sheet with the equation on it sideways , then upside down in a humorous attempt to absorb its subtleties .
" What does the professor coach ? " Fassel asked .
" Maybe , " he added , " he needs a few more classes to teach .
Too much free time ? "
Steve Mariucci , the 49ers head coach , has considered Romer 's thesis .
The difficulty , according to Mariucci , is maintaining a level head when everyone in the stadium wants you to go for it .
" The crowd is going ' Go for it , ' and they 're just drinking beers and just going for it , " Mariucci said .
" Sometimes you get swayed a little bit .
So you 've got to block them out and you 've got to make sense of it all .
" So then you start thinking about that article the guy from Cal wrote and then you say , ' Well , what would he do in this situation ? ' " Along with Mariucci , Bill Belichick of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots is one of several NFL head coaches who has actually studied Romer 's working paper , which , with references and tables , runs a stout 33 pages .
Maybe it 's because Belichick graduated from Wesleyan University with a bachelor 's degree in economics .
" I think , basically , he was saying that if you get down there and do n't score , you 're putting the other team 80 , 90 yards away from the goal line anyway , and the chances of them scoring are n't very good , " Belichick said .
" You 'll probably get the ball back in good field position .
And the percentages added up to his conclusion , which was to go for it . "
Bill Walsh , another Bay Area professor with some serious tenure , is a believer .
" To this day , I can close my eyes and see 22 players , " he said in his San Francisco 49ers office , where he still serves the team as a consultant .
" I can see them moving and I can see the equation .
My indicators would be somewhat different than ( Romer's ) , but this ( equation ) is what it takes . "
Walsh looked closely at the tangle of letters and numbers .
" It would be fine if I completely understood it , " he said .
" But I do n't think you can get all the variables on one page .
I do n't care what the equation is , you can't get them all . "
That said , Walsh agrees with Romer 's basic premise .
" I think ( coaches ) can tend to be too conservative , " Walsh said .
" They can tend not to trust themselves -- in a sense , take the easy way out and , in this case , punt the ball . "
Not the ' obvious ' call
About five years ago , Romer was listening to a Raiders game on the radio when a pivotal fourth - down situation came up .
" The team kicked a field goal and the announcers discussed it long enough to say , ' It 's obvious , it was clearly the right call , ' " Romer said .
" That bothered me .
I was thinking about it some and then I realized that some of the tools I use in my economics work were going to be useful . "
NFL Countdown ESPN 's Greg Garber spent time talking to David Romer and went around the NFL talking to coaches about the professor 's study .
Tune in to ESPN at 11 a.m. ET Sunday to watch .
Romer applied the Bellman Equation , which is used in economics and math to help simplify dynamic , long - term problems into the immediate payoff and the future ramifications of the situation .
Based on statistics from actual NFL games from 1998 through 2000 , Romer assigned a value to having the ball first - and - 10 on each of the yard lines of the football field in terms of points scored .
Since teams rarely go for it on fourth down -- last year , the league 's 31 teams went for it a collective 468 times , an average of less than once per game -- Romer decided it was not a representative sample .
He elected instead to use third - down statistics in assessing probability .
In addition , he used only first - quarter statistics because , generally speaking , score and time left did not influence decisions that early in a game .
The findings of Romer 's analysis :
A team facing fourth - and - goal within five yards of the end zone is better off , on average , trying for a touchdown .
At midfield , on average , there is an argument to go for any fourth down within five yards of a first down .
Even on its own 10 - yard - line -- 90 yards from the end zone -- a team within three yards of a first down is marginally better off , on average , going for it .
Of the 1,575 fourth downs in the sample where the analysis implied that teams were , on average , better off kicking , teams went for it only seven times .
However , on the 1,100 fourth downs where the analysis implied that teams were , on average , better off going for it , they kicked 992 times .
Translated , in the 1,100 instances where teams had more to gain in Romer 's estimation by going for it , they did so only 108 times , or less than 10 percent .
The primary objection to the concept revolves around field position .
A punt will generally net around 40 yards , and that 's a solid number coaches feel is worth that decision not to gamble .
As Tampa Bay 's Warren Sapp says , " I 'd rather defend an 80 - yard field than a 40 - yard field . "
Romer freely admits there are many variables he does n't account for .
This is the area football coaches wonder about .
" Where are you in the game ? " Fassel asked .
" What 's the score of the game ?
Are you running the ball or passing ? " “
It 's easy to sit there and apply a formula , but it 's not always the easiest thing to do on a Sunday .
There 's so much more involved with the game than just sitting there , looking at the numbers and saying , ' OK , these are my percentages , then I 'm going to do it this way , ' because that one time it does n't work could cost your team a football game , and that 's the thing a head coach has to live with , not the professor .
” — Bill Cowher , Steelers head coach " Do we have the personnel to get that yard ? "
Walsh asked .
" Do we have the personnel to stop the play they may run ? "
" Do we punt and use our timeouts ? "
Belichick asked .
" Do we have confidence in our field - goal kicker ?
Are they going to blitz or not ?
" If I do n't get the first down , what are the repercussions ? " asked Packers head coach Mike Sherman .
" Are they moving the football ?
If you 're on the road and do n't get that fourth down the momentum is going to change over to the other team . "
Momentum , according to coaches ( see sidebar ) , is a matter of some consequence in fourth - down situations .
But Romer -- a man as serious as an economist can be -- doesnt ' pretend to offer an infallible system , just a guideline .
That 's why he couches his conclusions with the words " on average . "
The skepticism , he allowed , does not surprise him .
" That makes sense , " Romer said .
" If they came to me and said they could use their ability to design plays to run monetary policy better , I would be skeptical .
" I can't tell them specifically what to do in particular cases , but on average they would be better off if they went for it in some cases where they now are always punting . "
An intuitive sense
On fourth down , it 's either - or , in or out , liberty or death .
It 's the ultimate game of chicken .
" Everybody sitting in the stadium knows , hey , this is a big play , " Belichick said .
" If you go for it , that you 're going to maintain possession and it's going to give you another opportunity to score , or you 're going to give the ball to the other team and then you 're going to have to go through another series of plays to get it back -- if you get it back . "
Brian Billick , the cerebral head coach of the Baltimore Ravens , is n't so sure about all of the professor 's numbers .
" There are only two numbers , " Billick said .
" And those are 50 - 50 .
You either make it , or you do n't . "
And believe it or not , 50 - 50 is almost exactly the success / failure rate .
Last year , teams made 203 of their 468 attempts on fourth down , or 43.4 percent .
This year the number is up .
Teams have converted 97 of their 191 fourth - down attempts , a .508 success rate .
The number suggests Romer might be onto something .
Nineteen of the league 's 32 teams are at 50 percent or better , and 23 teams have a better conversion rate on fourth down than third down .
As you might expect , teams with their backs against the wall tend to go for it more often .
As Miami head coach Dave Wannstedt says , " The key is to go on fourth down early in the game -- when you do n't have to . "
The winless Cincinnati Bengals , for instance , lead all teams with 15 tries ( and only four successes ) on fourth down .
The Washington Redskins are second with 11 attempts on fourth down and five conversions , while Minnesota ( 5 - for - 10 ) is next .
The quality of a team has a lot to do with its success rate .
Last year , the St. Louis Rams , at 8 - for - 11 , were the league 's best , with an astounding percentage of 72.7 .
The Tennessee Titans , at 2 - for - 15 ( 13.3 ) were the worst .
Some teams are more aggressive than others .
Under head coach Tom Coughlin , Jacksonville has gone for it 10 times and made seven .
Philadelphia 's Andy Reid has already made six of nine tries .
Last year he was an impressive 9 - for - 13 .
Only two AFC teams went for it more than Belichick 's Patriots a year ago .
This year , the Patriots have already converted four of seven tries .
What it really comes down to , Belichick said , is confidence .
Confidence that your offense can get that yard or two , confidence that your defense can hold the opponent if the offense fails .
" The more third - and - ones you make , the more likely you are to go for it on fourth - and - 1 , " Belichick said .
" You also factor in the defensive side of the ball .
How good of a short - yardage or goal - line team is your opponent ?
When you add those two up and you 're real good and you do n't think the other team is that proficient at it , that 's one thing .
If it 's vice versa , then maybe that skews you .
" In the end , it 's about intuition and recalling all of the experiences you 've been through . "
Said Billick , " It 's all about matchups .
Can you win that matchup and get the yard or yards you need to ?
Do they have the wherewithal to stop you ?
In the end , it 's how good do you feel about your team that 's on the field executing . "
Fourth - Down Decisions Editor 's note :
Here are a few big fourth - down plays so far this season : Week 1 -- Rams at Broncos : Trailing the Broncos 16 - 13 in the third quarter with the ball on Denver 's 9 - yard line , the Rams went for it on 4th - and - 1 . Kurt Warner 's pass was incomplete and the Rams ended up losing their opener 23 - 16 .
" We will be aggressive in our approach , '' Rams coach Mike Martz said .
" Some may question it , but that 's how I 'm going to approach it . ''
Week 2 -- Giants at Rams : Facing fourth - and - inches with 2:53 left in the game , the Rams trailed the Cowboys 26 - 21 .
Despite the absence of starting left guard Tom Nutten , the Rams ran Marshall Faulk straight up the middle and he was stuffed for no gain before fumbling .
The Rams did get the ball back but ended up losing 26 - 21 .
Week 5 -- Giants at Cowboys : Trailing 21 - 17 and facing fourth - and - nine from the Giants 48 with 2:03 left in the game , Cowboys coach Dave Campo elected to punt .
Dallas never got the ball back , losing 21 - 17 .
" I 'm a little surprised they punted .
I did n't expect them to put it on their defense like that , '' Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said .
Week 8 -- Bengals at Titans :
There was no controversial decision involved here , but this fourth down decided the game .
Trailing 30 - 24 with 1:08 left and facing fourth - and - one with a yard to go for a touchdown , Corey Dillon had a clear path to the end zone but tripped on pulling guard Matt O'Dwyer , coming up short as the Bengals remained winless .
Week 8 -- Bills at Lions : Trailing 24 - 17 and facing fourth - and - inches at the Buffalo 20 with 1:52 left in the game , Lions running back James Stewart was stuffed for no gain .
The Bills took over , converted a first down and ran out the clock .
Already this season , there have been some classic fourth - down decisions .
When the Broncos decided to try a long Jason Elam field goal on Monday Night Football , Ravens cornerback Chris McAlister returned the miss 107 yards for a touchdown and an NFL record .
Remember when Rams coach Mike Martz was looking at a field goal to tie a game in Week 1 against the Broncos and elected ( unsuccessfully ) to go for the touchdown ?
He 's still hearing about it .
Caught in the nether region between the Patriots ' 30 - and 40 - yard lines , the Packers went for it on fouth - and - three .
Brett Favre made it .
Another advertisement for going for it ?
The Tennessee Titans , up by only two points , went for it on fourth - and - goal at the Jacksonville 1 .
Eddie George scored what turned out to be the clincher .
" A lot of economics is about optimization , " Romer explained .
" A lot of our models say that people are good optimizers , and we do n't think that people all know the Bellman Equation and they can't all do calculus in their heads .
We think that trial and error , survival of the fittest , imitation is going to cause people to get toward optimizing behavior .
So the question is , why does n't it seem to be working here ?
Why are they being so much too conservative ?
" There 's got to be some force pushing them the other way .
And what it looks like is there 's a natural human tendency , it may be a genetic one , to worry about the worse case .
If you 're teaching your kid about crossing the street or you 're hunting a saber - tooth tiger a few thousand years ago , the worst case is really something terrible .
" In this situation , the worst case really is n't that bad -- you go for it and you do n't get it , so they have the ball in better field position .
There 's a medium - sized cost to failure and there 's a medium - sized reward to success -- mainly , you get to keep the ball and the drive keeps going .
Sometimes , what you need to say is , ' Let 's just step back and look at the probabilities , look at the cost and the benefits . '
Work it all out and see what you get .
Sometimes , your intuition is leading you very far astray . "
The Steelers ' Bill Cowher , in his 11th season , has enjoyed the longest consecutive tenure of any NFL head coach .
He has made the playoffs seven of his first 10 seasons and looks like a good bet for eight of 11 .
He did n't get this far by randomly adapting the flavor of the month in the fashion - conscious NFL .
" It 's easy to sit there and apply a formula , but it 's not always the easiest thing to do on a Sunday , " Cowher said .
" There 's so much more involved with the game than just sitting there , looking at the numbers and saying , ' OK , these are my percentages , then I 'm going to do it this way , ' because that one time it does n't work could cost your team a football game , and that 's the thing a head coach has to live with , not the professor .
" If we all listened to the professor , we may be all looking for professor jobs . "
Greg Garber is a senior writer at ESPN.com .
Two graduate students at MIT 's School of Architecture and Planning want to harvest the energy of human movement in urban settings , like commuters in a train station or fans at a concert .
The so - called " Crowd Farm , " as envisioned by James Graham and Thaddeus Jusczyk , both M.Arch candidates , would turn the mechanical energy of people walking or jumping into a source of electricity .
Their proposal took first place in the Japan - based Holcim Foundation 's Sustainable Construction competition this year .
A Crowd Farm in Boston 's South Station railway terminal would work like this : A responsive sub - flooring system made up of blocks that depress slightly under the force of human steps would be installed beneath the station 's main lobby .
The slippage of the blocks against one another as people walked would generate power through the principle of the dynamo , a device that converts the energy of motion into that of an electric current .
The electric current generated by the Crowd Farm could then be used for educational purposes , such as lighting up a sign about energy .
" We want people to understand the direct relationship between their movement and the energy produced , " says Jusczyk .
The Crowd Farm is not intended for home use .
According to Graham and Jusczyk , a single human step can only power two 60W light bulbs for one flickering second .
But get a crowd in motion , multiply that single step by 28,527 steps , for example , and the result is enough energy to power a moving train for one second . Â
And while the farm is an urban vision , the dynamo - floor principle can also be applied to capturing energy at places like rock concerts , too .
" Greater movement of people could make the music louder , " suggests Jusczyk .
The students ' test case , displayed at the Venice Biennale and in a train station in Torino , Italy , was a prototype stool that exploits the passive act of sitting to generate power .
Â
The weight of the body on the seat causes a flywheel to spin , which powers a dynamo that , in turn , lights four LEDs .
" People tended to be delighted by sitting on the stool and would get up and down repeatedly , " recalls Graham .
Other people have developed piezo - electric ( mechanical - to - electrical ) surfaces in the past , but the Crowd Farm has the potential to redefine urban space by adding a sense of fluidity and encouraging people to activate spaces with their movement .
" Our intention was to think of it not as a high - tech mat that would be laid down somewhere , but to really integrate it into a new sort of building system , " Graham says .
The Crowd Farm floor is composed of standard parts that are easily replicated but it is expensive to produce at this stage , they said .
" Only through experimentation - which can be expensive - do technologies become practical , " Graham says .
Graham and Jusczyk rely on bicycles , rather than trains or buses , for their commute to MIT .
But , both students were impressed enough by recent experiences in large crowds - for Graham , the 2003 New York City blackout ; for Jusczyk , Boston 's World Cup celebration in City Hall Plaza - to start work on the Farm .
The students were inspired as well by an " ingenious little device by Thomas Edison .
When visitors came to his house , they passed through a turnstile that pumped water into his holding tank , " says Graham .
In addition , they were guided by their advisor , Associate Professor J. Meejin Yoon , who helped them take their proposal from the power - stool to the Crowd Farm .

In Alabama , you can sell guns on any street corner but you can't sell sex toys .
That 's right .
Alabama is a vibrator - free state !
Well , technically you can go across state lines and buy sex toys in Georgia and Tennessee and carry them home .
But the Alabama Legislature , in its infinite wisdom and in the spirit of protecting citizens from moral turpitude , a while back banned the sale of sex toys ( or " marital aids " as some lawmakers coyly call them ) .
Today , the U.S. Supreme Court has shown a gleam of interest in this controversial state law , which has been challenged in Alabama courts by adult toy retailer Sherri Williams .
She has been fighting the law for nearly 10 years .
Williams has been in district court three times on this issue and has won twice .
But both times her victories were struck down by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals .
She filed a petition to the Supremes and has hired well - known First Amendment rights attorney Paul Cambria .
Also joining in the appeal petition with Williams are the Free Speech Coalition and the First Amendment Lawyers Association .

I recently wrote about using sub - networks within a blog network .
Well , today I ’ll tackle blog themes in a blog network , and the issues with using a general one .
First of all , there ’s no obvious winner in the battle between general blog network themes versus an unique one , both can work .
I know what I prefer and recommend when asked , but that ’s not the definite truth either , since situations can warrant or not warrant unique themes for every blog .
So yes , that ’s my default answer – your blog network ’s blogs deserve a true identity , and that includes a unique theme just for them .
However , some blog networks are just too extensive to use that method .
Enter the general blog themes , pimped up to fit the blog ’s niche , with header graphics , color choices , and even different fonts .
This works , my friends .
A theme can , if it ’s designed for it , be altered in such a fashion that it can maintain its identity .
Just look at the Gawker Media blogs , a great example .
Jezebel is more stylish and magazine , than the product focused gaming blog Kotaku , for instance .
It helps that the Gawker Media network have developed a blog design that at least somewhat differs from the norm .
No rounded Kubrick corners here , thank you very much .
Overall , I like the Gawker Media blogs – they use images in a good way and stand out in their layout decisions .
Weblogs Inc. is n’t as good .
Take a look at Engadget or Blogging Stocks – neither are very good , and you can see they are hacks of the same design , a very blocky and crowded one at that .
Then again , Green Daily shows that the theme can be given that extra little twist , so I guess not all is lost design - wise over at Weblogs Inc.
Besides , it used to be a lot worse .
Then there ’s the blog networks who just does n’t spend enough time , money , or talent when it comes to customizing the general blog network theme of choice .
I ’m surprised that b5 media , a blog network rushing forward , is n’t doing more to profile their blogs in a positive manner .
Their basic theme ’s got those things you expect for a general one , but it ’s poor theme to start with .
A crowded sidebar , a really blocky feel , crazy contrasts – just look at the boxes within the black sidebar column on Film Gecko , for instance .
That particular blog have at least gotten a decent logo treatment , while SF Universe get a clipped thingy on top .
These two blogs are by far not the worst I ’ve seen bearing the b5 media flag , but they are not pretty at all .
It ’s a shame , because at a glance they look like pretty decent publications , so they deserve a better treatment , do n’t they ?
Using a general theme across the network ’s got benefits .
You can easily launch a new blog , and the fact that all blogs have the same basic structure adds to the network ’s feel and brand .
But when it goes wrong , it hurts both the blogs within , and the network itself .
Blog network owners , listen up !
If you want to use a general theme for your whole , huge network of kick - ass blogs , then make sure it ’s a theme that can be customized to really profile the blogs .
Even better , go down the sub - network route and buy a customizable theme for each sub- network , it might be a little more expensive , but it ’s definitely worth it .
I still believe that the best way is to have an unique design for each blog , that helps the site ’s brand which in turn will rub off on the network .
However , when that just is n’t possible , make sure you take the right route .
Otherwise , it ’ll look amateurish , boring , or even ugly .
That ’s not something you want your precious blog network to be associated with , is it ?
A Senate panel found former presidential advisor Karl Rove and current White House Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten in contempt of Congress on Thursday for refusing to testify and turn over documents in the investigation of the firings of nine U.S. attorneys last year .
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved contempt citations against Rove and Bolten on a 12 - 7 vote , rejecting the White House position that their work is covered by executive privilege .
Six months ago , the Senate Judiciary Committee requested Rove ’s public testimony on the firings and issued subpoenas for internal White House documents .
As custodian of such documents , Bolten was cited for refusing to hand them in .
It is important , in whatever country or company you may be in , to toast appropriately .
Study these and learn them , for they will serve you well one day as you down that chang in the Sherpa tent or hang with the locals at a Scottish pub .
If you can offer a drink and toast a person in his / her own language , you 've made a friend !
If you can sing the local songs after tossing a few , you 'll doubtless be buddies for life .
Standard Toasts in Various Languages
Dutch : Proost !
Op je gezondheid !
English : Cheers !
English : Bottoms up !
French : À votre santé ( French Toast is also available at IHOP )
( French Toast is also available at IHOP ) German : Prost !
German : " Hopfen und Malz , Gott erhalt's ! "
( Long live hops and malt ! )
Greek :
Ade yamas !
Hebrew : L'chaim !
Irish : Slainte !
Italian : Cin Cin !
Japanese : Kanpai !
Korean : Guhn - Bae !
Mandarin : Ganbei !
Maori : Kia Ora !
Norwegian : Skoll !
Polish : Na Zdrowie !
Russian : Za vashe zdorov'ye !
Spanish : Salud !
Swedish : Skål !
Turkish : Sherefe !
Hungarian : Egesegedre ! ( Egg-esh - sheg - edra )
Toasting Etiquette
Western Europeans from the Netherlands to Bulgaria seem to have a thing about making eye contact when toasting they apparently find Americans fairly vulgar for not doing so , among myriad other reasons .
The first toast should be made by the host .
The person receiving the toast should remain seated and should not drink to the toast .
When a guest of honor is being toasted , they stand when the toast is finished and thank the one who gave the toast .
German rules :
It is good toasting style to clink the glass of every single person at the table ; however , have eye contact while toasting , else it means bad luck .
If two people are toasting , do not toast across them to another person ( so that the line of your arm and the other persons ' arms would form a cross ) , because that also means bad luck and is considered rude .
And most importantly :
Do not , under any circumstances , fill up your ( or any other ) glass if it is not completely empty yet !
If you do so , that means seven years of really bad sex !
( Although some people fill up the non-empty glasses anyhow , figuring that seven years of bad sex is better than no sex at all )
Clean but Amusing Toasts
" Arriba , abajo , al centro y adentro ! "
" As you slide down the banister of life , may the splinters never face the wrong way . "
" Champagne for real friends , and real pain for sham friends ! " — DanFisher ( my grandfather 's favorite toast )
" Cheers to you and cheers to me , the best of friends we 'll always be .
But just in case we disagree , to Hell with you and cheers to me "
" Everybody should believe in something — I believe I 'll have another drink . "
" May the grass on your road to hell grow long for lack of use . "
" Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish , and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts .
Let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more . "
( Proverbs 31:6 -7 )
" Here 's to the old lady up the hill .
If she wo n't drink it , I will ! " - Irish blessing
" Here 's to those who wish us well , all the rest can go to hell . "
" Here 's to you as good as you are ;
And here 's to me as bad as I am ; But as good as you are ;
And as bad as I am ; I 'm as good as you are — as bad as I am . " — ss's Poppa
" In heaven there is no beer that 's why we drink ours here . "
" May for better or worse be far better than worse . "
" May misfortune follow you the rest of your life , but never catch up . "
" May our house always be too small to hold all our friends . "
" May the people who dance on your grave get cramps in their legs . " — from the book , The Joys of Yiddish
" May we never have friends who , like shadows , follow us in sunshine only to desert us on a cloudy day . "
" May you live all the days of your life . "
— Jonathan Swift
" To more friends and less need of them . "
" To the head - brewer — may his wort never clear up ! "
" We 'll think of all the friends we know and drink to all worth drinking to . "
Downright Nasty Ones in Any Language
" May you always come more than you go . "
" May your love be a thousand miles long but come in six inch installments . "
" Here 's to birthdays ... they come only once a year !
Are n't you glad you 're not a birthday ? ? "
" Here 's to the top , And here 's to the middle .
Let 's hope tonight we all get a little . "
" I want to thank you all for coming , especially my parents , ( X ) years ago . "
" Here 's to heat !
Not the kind that ignites and burns down shanties , but the kind that excites and slides down panties ! "
" Here 's to you , here 's to me , together as friends we 'll always be .
And if we ever disagree , F—k you , here 's to me . "
" May your beer always be dry and your women always moist . "
" Here 's to honor ( on her ) .
To getting honor , keeping honor , and not getting off her ' til you get off honor . "
" Here 's to honor — cause if you can't come in her , come on her ! " ( maybe a little more vulgar , but flows much better . )
" Here 's to honor — get on 'er , stay on 'er , and if you can't come in 'er , come on ' er " ( the way I 've always heard it )
" Here 's to those we love the best , we love them best when they 're undressed .
We love them sitting , standing , lying ; if they had wings we 'd love them flying .
And when they 're dead , buried , forgotten - we 'll dig them up and fuck them rotting ! "
" Here 's to the lady in the white shoes : she 'll steal all your money , she 'll drink all your booze .
She ain't got a cherry , but that ain't no sin , ' cuz she 's still got the box that the cherry came in ! "
" I 've drank from the cup of life : from the rim , to the brim , to the dregs ... but all I ever wanted to taste is what 's in - between your legs . "

Banksy : Caught In The Act And Unmasked
Reader Chloe sends us these images of what is surely a new Banksy piece in Bethnal Green .
And she seems to have captured the face of the artist , hitherto unseen .
( However , we 've seen that flower shape before , around Shoreditch — perhaps Banksy is here teaming up with someone else . )
The work seems to be some kind of riposte to Tower Hamlets council , which recently declared it would erase all of Banksy 's graffiti in the borough .

ICFP Programming Contest
最終結果が出ています。 サイトにはまだ出てないかなーですが今年の言語は
2D is the programming language of choice for discriminative hackers !
いやまったく。くあー。やられた。 " RML is a fine programming tool for many applications ! "
ってことにすればよかった。今は反省している。マジレス禁止。
その2Dで20点差を付けられるとは思わなかったのだけど
なんか秘技があるんですか、とSmartassの人に聞いてみたら「手で超頑張った 」 とのことでした。ちなみにUMの実装は最初C++で後でCに換えたらしいです。
あらためてご紹 介
さて、最近 Haskell やら OCaml やらで人気 の 「 関数型言語」に関する世界一の学会として、
ICFP ( International Conference of Functional Programming ) というのがあります。 今年の学会の内容については別の記事でそのうち書こうかと思っていますが、それはともかく、
そのICFP が主催するプログラミングコンテストがありまして、それが
ICFP Programming Contest です。毎年学会の２ヶ月くらい前に開催されてます。
今年のコンテストについての感想は参戦した直後に書いたのでそちらを参照して下さい。一言で言うと、
とても楽しかったです。コンテスト終了後も挑戦したい人がいつでも挑戦できるように
問題セットは公開されていますので、まだの方は是非是非 ご挑戦を。おすすめです。
で
言わば 「 メイキング・オブ ・ICFP コンテスト 」 の
スピーチが学会での結果発表と同時にありまして、自分が「楽しい」と感じた理由を
ちゃんと狙って作っていたんだなあと思って改めて楽しくなったので、
ここに引用しまくります。
Fun first .
The contest should be fun for participants and , hopefully , for the organizers as well .
The contest is ultimately a diversion ; its success should be judged like ay other game or pastime .
The majority of entrants should make substantal progress , and problems should be interesting , not tadeous .
とか、まあ↑は置いておくとしても、特に
Community Service . ...( 略 )...
The contest draws significant attention from outside the functional programming community .
Consequently , it should make use of the opportunity to advertise the ideas and techniques developed by programming languages research .
There are a plethora of interesting problems in our field , and the contest tasks should draw from them .
ですね。関数型言語の研究＆プログラミングの世界には面白いテーマや技術が転がっていて、 せっかくICFPでやるコンテストなんだから、そういうところから面白さを取ってこれると いいね、と。
頭っからどっぷり関数型言語 な人には当たり前すぎるのかもしれないですけど、例えば最初の方に当たる
「 書き換え可 能 な変数なし、appendなしでリストの並び順を逆転する簡潔なコードは？ 」 や 「 自然数を SS..SZ で表して、足し算を項書き換え系で表現 」 のような問題は、慣れない人には なかなか面白い最初の一歩でした。先に進む とsubstructural logicの定理証明 をそのまんまネタにしたゲームが用意されていたり、情報流検査の典型的な 穴をついてシステムを破れ！というクラッキングステージがあったり。そもそも プログラミング言語を扱う問題が多いので、必要な作業がどれもメタプログラミング っぽくならざるを得なかったり。他にもCPS 変換を応用した問題もあったのだけど 時間の都合で削除したらしく。解いてみたかった…。
といっても、毎年そういう方針で行くのも難しそうでもあり。はてさて。
Question :
When it comes to the innocent children of undocumented immigrants , who is less caring , less thoughtful , and more willing to pander to the extreme right than Orrin Hatch , Sam Brownback and Trent Lott ?
Answer : Oregon Senator Gordon Smith .
On Wednesday , Gordon Smith filibustered the DREAM
Act , designed to give a limited group of children of undocumented immigrants a chance to go to college , serve in the military and perhaps earn legal status .
Even some usually hard right conservatives like Orrin Hatch , Sam Brownback and Trent Lott supported giving these children , graduates of American high schools , an opportunity to go to college , serve in the military , and perhaps earn citizenship .
Whatever your views on immigration , these children are no threat to the American way of life .
But in order to have some red meat to pander to the far right , Gordon Smith voted to punish these children .
As the New York Times explained , the DREAM Act would have only affected “ children who entered the country before age 16 , lived here continuously for at least five years and can show good moral character and a high school diploma .
They would receive conditional legal status for six years , during which they could work , go to college and serve in the military .
If they completed at least two years of college or military service , they would be eligible for legalization . ”
In contrast to this week ’s vote , Smith in the past has supported legislation ( such as S. 1814 , introduced in 1999 ) to allow undocumented agricultural workers to obtain legal status .
It 's easy to find the perfect gift for that special gadget - head in your life , right ?
Just go to the local Megamart , cruise to electronics , and pick out an iPod or a cool cell phone , a nice digital SLR camera or the latest game console , a giant HDTV or , if you 're feeling really generous , head over to auto row for a hybrid .
Just one problem — a true gear hound probably has all that stuff already .
But the great thing about technology is that there 's always another widget to buy , an add - on that can breathe new life into your loved ones ' familiar toys .

homepage : philibuster joined on May 16 , 2008 and owns solar system NAG621 homepage : https://galaxiki.org/users/philibuster
The online galaxy consists of millions of stars , plants and moons that can all be edited .
Many planets in our galaxy offer conditions that may allow life - the idea behind Galaxiki is that users can create fictional life forms and write about their histories on their planets .
Some people also call this site a " Wikipedia out of space " , which pretty well describes what it does .
As a site member you can name & edit community stars , planets and moons for free , but you can also purchase your own , personal solar system that only you will be able to edit .
This is , of course , only an option - you do not have to buy anything to become an active member on this site .
Our online galaxy is completely managed by its community - new stars , planets and moons are being named and described every day , science fiction stories are published and updated on a regular basis .
The ease of use attracts all kinds of users , so that the target audience is not limited to science fiction and astronomy addicts - in fact everone may become an active member on this site , and you can enjoy all features even if you do n't know anything about physics and if you are n't a good writer .
Community features also include user homepages , a discussion forum as well as a community library where users can show off their movies and books .
One of the goals of this site is to connect people - no matter if you are into science , space , astronomy , sci- fi or fantasy , on this site you will find other people that share your hobbies and interests .
Recently purchased solar systems
Some proud star owners Buy a star
Therefore we also have a community blog , which is in fact a blog which allows all users to post news .
You may write about anything you like , as long as it's related to stories on Galaxiki , space news , astronomical events , general information about space , aliens , science fiction , movies , books ... well , as long as it has anything to do with science and space .
Of course you can also use the blog ( and / or the forum ) to promote your own solar systems and stories .
One really cool feature on this site is the star buying option - you can purchase your own solar system that only you will be able to name and edit .
By buying a star you get your own , personal solar system in our online galaxy , and you 're supporting this project so that we can further improve the site .
Of course you can also purchase mutiple solar systems and build your own , local starfleet or empire , it 's all up to you .
You may also read some really cool science fiction stories written by our users on our wiki page .
Do n't like to write ?
When you buy a solar system you may allow others user to edit it .
But there are even more options : you may offer a star to someone else ( a cool gift for friends , birthdays and sci- fi Lovers ) or donate a solar system to the community for example ( greatly appreciated ) .
Recently freed community stars Solar systems donated by our users Quintel by wolffenrir • Alatariel by andr0m3da • Epheran by merrymoll Donate a star
Usually we try to respect the known physical laws , but the Galaxiki science fiction universe explicitely allows traveling faster than light - which means that you may allow your own alien life forms to travel to distant stars and planets , to explore them and to even meet other intelligent life forms .
This becomes every interesting if you allow you own species to travel to stars edited by other users , as you 'll have to make sure that the histories of all species remain consistent .
New stars that can be edited by the community are being released every hour , which means that our science fiction galaxy can be continuously expanded .
New users are purchasing solar systems on a regular basis , and some users even decide to donate stars to the community - which is great as it both helps us to keep running and improving this site and offers new opportunities to the science fiction community .
Back in February , Ralph Green asked me to speak at the North Texas Linux Users ' Group .
I discussed Linux administration and then took questions .
Some one in the audience asked me about Mono .
I gave a cavalier answer having a bias against it .
Then someone else in the audience said that I needed to get my facts straight .
So , I asked him to elaborate and he did in an intelligent and enlightening way .
He explained that he had a day job as a .NET developer and that 's how he made his living .
He worked in the evenings porting projects from one platform to the other .
I found him convincing as did most of the LUG members in attendance .
Even so , I still left with a bias .
You can probably guess what happened next .
I wound up with my foot in my mouth working on setting up a Sourceforge style hosting environment for a client .
The only free Open Source project I could find had a BSD license .
The project is SharpForge
And you got it , the author wrote the project in C# .
That 's about the time I had to look deeper into MonoDev , an IDE that reminds me of Visual Studio .
I also researched Mono looking for people 's comments in various Open Source forums and community mailing lists .
I saw some negative comments , but I saw more positive ones and I saw plenty of new projects programmed in .NET .
Maybe people have a positive attitude in general about Mono because the code can run on Linux , FreeBSD , UNIX , Mac OS X , Solaris and Windows .
More Investigation
I decided to join the SharpForge project to investigate this Mono thing further .
Now I 'm coding again - only instead of using C , I 'm using C# .
That 's OK with me at the moment since I 'm learning and having fun .
Joining an Open Source project always feels satisfying to me .
But , I 'm wondering if my bias will re-emerge .
Here 's a run down on the bias :
When Miguel de Icaza began touting .NET technology in late 2000 , I immediately considered him a traitor .
He was the recipient of the Free Software Foundation 's Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1999 for his work on GNU Network Object Model Environment ( GNOME ) - the Windows - like desktop environment .
Then FSF kicked him out for failing to adhere to the policy of referring to the Linux operating system as GNU / Linux and referencing it that way in any interviews that he gave .
As I have researched C# I found that Miguel has some legitimate intentions .
Legend has it that the Mono project began when Miguel looked at the byte code interpreter and found no specifications for the metadata .
In February 2001 , Miguel looked for the metadata file format by going on .NET mailing lists .
He must have gotten enough information because he began to work on a C# compiler .
In April 2001 , Emca ( formerly European Computer Manufacturers Association ) published the missing file format , and at the Gnome User 's Conference in April , 2001 Miguel demonstrated his compiler .
I have not read or heard any negative comments about Miguel or .NET in Linux from the informed community .
To the contrary , people who understand the technology and what Miguel has accomplished hold him and the project in high esteem .
That says more than enough for me .
Where are We Headed ?
This may sound pessimistic , but I have seen so many Open Source advocates start projects that thought they had the next Microsoft killer .
But , the vast majority started with enthusiasm and have n't touched their code out on Sourceforge for years .
So , Kudos to Miguel and his support system at Novell .
Almost eight years have passed and the project continues its progress and innovative development .
You may know it or not , but .NET applications are probably running on your Gnome desktop right now .
Do you use Beagle , F - Spot , Tomboy .
Banshee , SkyNet. Maemo , NUnit and so forth .
Then you 're using Mono applications .
Do I know where we 're heading ?
No .
But , the Open Source community is expanding exponentially because developers from various platforms have started working together .
If you rather align with Red Hat , the biggest Linux company according to them , they have a $ 400 million investment in JBoss , a Java centric technology .
We 're in the early stages of digital convergence and people want cross platform compatibilities .
If we can use a tool to achieve cross platform compatibility I 'm for it .
For those readers who have a bias toward Mono , I understand .
I mean , I feel your pain .
In the mean time , it might help to get off it and take a real look at what Miguel and his development team have accomplish .
Download MonoDev and grab the source code to SharpForge .
It 's all free and it's all good
This post follows on from a post I wrote a couple of years back called Why Service Architectures Should Focus on Workflows .
In that post I attempted to describe the fragility of microservice systems that were simply translating object - oriented patterns to the new paradigm .
These systems were migrating domain models and their interactions from in - memory objects to separate networked processes .
They were replacing in - process function calls with cross - network rpc calls , adding latency and infrastructure complexity .
The goal was scalability and flexibility but , I argued , the entity modelling approach introduced new failure modes .
I suggested a solution :
Instead of carving up the domain by entity , focus on the workflows .
If I was writing that post today I would say “ focus on the functions ” because the future is serverless functions , not microservices .
Or , more brashly :
microfunctions > microservices
The industry has moved apace in the last 3 years with a focus on solving the infrastructure challenges caused by running hundreds of intercommunicating microservices .
Containers have matured and become the de-facto standard for the unit of microservice deployment with management platforms such as Kubernetes to orchestrate them and frameworks like GRPC for robust interservice communication .
The focus still tends to be on interacting entities though : when placing an order the “ order service ” talks to the “ customer service ” which reserves items by talking to the “ stock service ” and the “ payment service ” which talks to the “ payment gateway ” after first checking with the “ fraud service ” .
When the order needs to be shipped the “ shipping service ” asks the “ order service ” for orders that need to be fulfilled and tells the “ stock service ” to remove the reservation , then to the “ customer service ” to locate the customer etc .
All of these services are likely to be persisting state in various backend databases .
Microservices are organized as vertical slices through the domain :
The same problems still exist : if the customer service is overwhelmed by the shipping service then the order service can’t take new orders .
The container manager will , of course , scale up the number of customer service instances and register them with the appropriate load balancers , discovery servers , monitoring and logging .
However , it cannot easily cope with a critical failure in this service , perhaps caused by a repeated bad request that panics the service and prevents multiple dependent services from operating properly .
Failures and slowdowns in response times are handled within client services through backoff strategies , circuit breakers and retries .
The system as a whole increases in complexity but remains fragile .
By contrast , in a serverless architecture , the emphasis is on the functions of the system .
For this reason serverless is sometimes called FaaS – Functions as a Service .
Systems are decomposed into functions that encapsulate a single task in a single process .
Instead of each request involving the orchestration of multiple services the request uses an instance of the appropriate function .
Rather than the domain model being exploded into separate networked processes its entities are provided in code libraries compiled into the function at build time .
Calls to entity methods are in - process so do n’t pay the network latency or reliability taxes .
In this paradigm the “ place order ” function simply calls methods on customer , stock and payment objects , which may then interact with the various backend databases directly .
Instead of a dozen networked RPC calls , the function relies on 2 - 3 database calls .
Additionally , if a function is particularly hot it can be scaled directly without affecting the operation of other functions and , crucially , it can fail completely without taking down other functions .
( Modulo the reliability of databases which affect both styles of architecture identically . )
Microfunctions are horizontal slices through the domain :
The advantages I wrote last time still hold up when translated to serverless terminology :
Deploying or retiring a function becomes as simple as switching it on or off which leads to greater freedom to experiment .
Scaling a function is limited to scaling a single type of process horizontally and the costs of doing this can be cleanly evaluated .
The system as a whole becomes much more robust .
When a function encounters problems it is limited to a single workflow such as issuing invoices .
Other functions can continue to operate independently .
Latency , bandwidth use and reliability are all improved because there are fewer network calls .
The function still relies on the database and other support systems such as lock servers , but most of the data flow is controlled in - process .
The unit of testing and deployment is a single function which reduces the complexity and cost of maintenance .
One major advantage that I missed is the potential for extreme cost savings through scale , particularly the scale attainable by running on public shared infrastructure .
Since all the variability of microservice deployment configurations is abstracted away into a simple request / response interface the microfunctions can be run as isolated shared - nothing processes , billed only for the resources they use in their short lifetime .
Anyone who has costed for redundant microservices simply for basic resilience will appreciate the potential here .
Although there are number of cloud providers in this space ( AWS Lambda , Google Cloud Functions , Azure Functions ) serverless is still an emerging paradigm with the problems that come with immaturity .
Adrian Coyler recently summarized an excellent paper and presentation dealing with the challenges of building serverless systems which highlights many of these , including the lack of service level agreements and loose performance guarantees .
It seems almost certain though that these will improve as the space matures and overtakes the microservice paradigm .
Letters Jerry Taylor , the now famous city manager of Tuttle , Oklahoma , who last week threatened to call the FBI to stop Linux maker CentOS from helping him configure a web server has presented The Register with a massive request .
Taylor wants us to shut down the internet .
For those of you who are not up to speed with this popular story , here 's a brief recap .
Taylor went to Tuttle city 's web site , hoping to make some changes .
Upon arriving at the site , he discovered the boilerplate Apache web server configuration page and mistook this for a possible hack attempt on Tuttle .
Instead of contacting a server administrator about the problem , Taylor initiated a tirade with a CentOS support staffer in which he repeatedly threatened to have the FBI investigate the Linux maker for attacking Tuttle 's municipal web site .
Eventually , CentOS showed Taylor that it had nothing to do with the web site other than providing the operating system software for the web server .
The fury of Tuttle 's e-mails made plenty of you laugh as our story was picked up by Slashdot , Digg and others .
It would seem that we made too many of you laugh .
Taylor - who once proclaimed to the CentOS staff , " I have no fear of the media , in fact I welcome this publicity " - has asked us to put a halt to the publicity .
Taylor declined to respond to this reporter 's request for comment but did write to a member of El Reg 's marketing team .
I do not follow instructions that show up when a website that I am not familiar with appears on my computer and I do not think anyone with experience would do so either .
Once the Centos site appeared on four computers at one site I contacted our web service provider .
The web service provider did not know what could cause the problem and had never heard of " CentOS " .
I then contacted the internet provider 's local office and was told that they did nothing to cause the problem .
I checked the building 's server and found nothing relating to CentOS on the server .
I was then left with only the web page email address to contact .
I asked for the strange website to be removed because it blocked my City web site and I could not post public information .
I only got help after threatening to contact the FBI .
Now I am being flooded with emails from CentOS users that after knowing the answer say the problem was simple .
I think this is unjustified and would like for this to stop .
Your website should provide useful information and be a credit to the IT world .
I do not believe it should be used to incite the users .
Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated .
So stop , now .
Please .
It should be noted that Taylor failed to thank many of you for improving Tuttle 's web site .
About 100 of you noticed the spelling error in Taylor 's bio page where he wrote , " I am please [ sic ] to serve the citizens of the City of Tuttle . "
That line now reads " I am pleased to serve the citizens of the City of Tuttle . "
The site , however , continues to misspell Heisman - or Hiesman according to Tuttle - despite being the home of Heisman Trophy winning football star Jason White .
Plenty of you noticed this mistake , and we guess Taylor will fix the problem soon .
The fact that Taylor cannot handle the abuse of Linux fan boys may be surprising given that he has faced off against a tiger in tong - to - fence combat - a story captured by The Tuttle Times - note the granddad 's pride and joy sweater .
( In an unrelated item , you can find a Tuttle police officer preparing for a party here . )
Now , more from our beloved readers .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
It 's been described as the closest thing to being buried alive -- complete paralysis of the body , except for controlled movement of the eyes .
Erik Ramsey shortly before a car crash left him " locked - in , " able to think and reason but paralyzed except for his eyes
That 's how 24 - year - old Erik Ramsey has spent the last eight years of his life .
He suffered a brain stem stroke after a car accident when he was 16 , leaving him with " locked - in " syndrome .
This condition is not the same as other forms of paralysis where you feel nothing in the affected areas .
Ramsey has 100 percent sensation all over his body .
An itch can become excruciating with no way to communicate that he needs it scratched .
He has frequent muscle spasms as well , which can be painful .
" Even sweat rolling down his skin or something , there 's nothing he can do about it , " said Eddie Ramsey , 57 , Erik 's father .
" So he feels everything in the environment , but there is really just nothing he could do about it . "
Doctors told the Ramseys that their son has no chance of getting better .
" There 's always hope , but a large portion of it is in the category of miracles , " said Eddie Ramsey .
But new research may give Erik Ramsey the miracle he has been waiting for .
Dr. Phil Kennedy , chief scientist at Neural Signals Inc. , a company he founded to conduct research on the brain and communication .
He came up with a revolutionary idea that he believed could turn Ramsey 's thoughts into speech .
Do n't Miss Neural Signals , Inc. : Brain - computer interface research
He invented an electrode that detects the neural signals in the speech motor area of Ramsey 's brain .
In December 2004 , the electrode was implanted , and Kennedy , along with four independent labs , began decoding the signals in Ramsey 's brain .
The researchers asked him to think of specific vowel sounds , then mapped his brain activity .
By knowing what his brain looked like when he thought each specific sound , scientists could translate the activity into a language that a voice synthesizer could read .
Dr. Frank Guenther , associate professor of cognitive and neural systems at Boston University , said his lab , one of three others pursuing neural signal translation , had a breakthrough recently :
They were able to hear the sounds Ramsey was trying to say using the decoder they built .
" That was a very exciting moment , where we knew this process of taking neural signals and driving a synthesizer was going to work , " Guenther said .
In the next two months , researchers will hook up the synthesizer .
Ramsey will produce his first vowel sounds then .
The next phase is getting him to produce consonants , which are much harder to synthesize .
Conversations , they say , are still about two years away .
For Ramsey , this will mean expressing himself beyond just one word answers .
The only way he can indicate what he wants is by moving his eyes up for " yes " and down for " no . "
But even this method only goes so far .
He gets so tired that he can answer only about six questions before he has to stop .
Former Elle magazine editor Jean - Dominque Bauby suffered from the same syndrome and was also able to communicate using only one eye .
He wrote about the horror of having locked - in syndrome in his book " The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , " which was made into a film released November 30 .
Bauby 's writing was an exceedingly slow process .
He dictated the book by blinking his left eye when the correct letter was presented to him .
He described his mind as a butterfly flying freely inside a diving bell -- a chamber that is placed underwater , trapping the air inside .
His descriptions of life as a man who is paralyzed and mute gave Eddie Ramsey the first detailed account of what it must be for his son to live with locked - in syndrome .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
" He had to blink that book with one eye , " Eddie Ramsey said tearfully .
" Had he never done that , no one would ever understand what locked - in means . "
Asked if ever wanted to end his life , Erik Ramsey looked up , his way of saying yes .
Asked if he still felt that way , he looked up again .
But he has n't lost all hope .
Asked if he believes Kennedy 's research will allow him to communicate again , he answered " yes . "
Eddie Ramsey thinks so too .
" Dr. Kennedy said he believes Erik will be able to speak again either through a voice synthesizer or through some other means .
I believe him and I agree with him , " he said .
It may do the same for tens of thousands of people living with Lou Gehrig 's disease , muscular dystrophy or even Alzheimer 's who have lost their ability to speak .
E-mail to a friend
Mark at Anecdote has a telling story of how a collaboration space was successfully undermined .
Here ’s how his client explained it :
Early on this place was used all the time .
I loved it and brought my team here for regular meetings and with the shortage of formal meeting rooms , I had lots of my smaller meetings here as well .
The place always had a great ‘ buzz ’ about it .
But the design had a big flaw , the executive offices were all positioned overlooking the atrium .
One day I was called into the office of an executive who told me they considered I was spending too much of my time in the atrium ( collaboration space ) .
Apparently others had similar experiences .
Nowadays hardly anyone comes here .
We feel we are being watched .
This reminds me of the excellent ChangeThis manifesto by Matthew May .
He explains an experiment he ran .
At the off - site , there were about 75 people of varying degrees of seniority , ranging from field supervisors to senior execs .
I gave the assignment , one of those group priority exercises whereby you rank a list of items individually and then as a group and compare ( sort of a “ wisdom of crowds ” exercise to show that “ we ” is smarter than “ me ” ) .
This specific exercise required you to rank 25 items with which you ’ve crashed on the moon in relation to how important they were to your survival .
NASA had compiled the correct ranking , so there was a clear answer .
I did the exercise with a twist .
At each table I put a ringer .
I gave the lowest - ranking person the answer .
It was their job to convince the command - control types they knew the right answer .
During the group exercise , NOT A SINGLE CORRECT ANSWER GOT HEARD .
Speaking truth to power .
It ai n’t easy , is it ?
Complaints about Transportation Security Administration screening at airports have surged in the past several months -- and the reason depends on whom you ask .
The often - maligned TSA says the increase has occurred because it was n't counting all the complaints before :
The agency concedes that until May this year , it was losing customer complaints and under - reporting traveler gripes .
But in the view of some travelers , security screening remains as big a hassle as ever , and screeners can be even grumpier these days -- sentiments ...
We ’ve paid a heavy price .
The president who got such high marks as a barbecue companion does n’t seem to know up from down .
He ’s hurled the nation into a ruinous war that has cost countless lives and spawned a whole new generation of terrorists .
He continues to sit idly by as a historic American city , New Orleans , remains wounded and on its knees .
He ’s blithely steered the nation into a bottomless pit of debt .

I could go on .
Mr. Gore actually polled the most votes in 2000 , but he was criticized for not having whipped Mr. Bush decisively enough to have avoided the madness in Florida .
Mr. Gore knows the system is in trouble , and not just because of the way he lost in 2000 .
The last time I spoke to him , a few months ago , he said : “ Having served in the White House with the Gingrich Congress , and having watched the best of intentions so often turned into small changes ballyhooed as revolutionary , sometimes having no lasting mark , I really do believe that fixing the dynamic of democracy is an urgent task . ”
That ’s just the kind of thoughtful comment that ca n’t get a real hearing in our sound - bite politics .
The result is that reality , untidy and complex , is almost always trumped by well - crafted phoniness .
Which brings us to Mr. Giuliani .
The entire basis for this former mayor ’s candidacy is his contention that he is some kind of expert , a veritable guru , on matters related to terrorism .
“ I understand terrorism , ” he says , “ in a way that is equal to or exceeds anyone else . ”
And yet in the two most important decisions he has made with regard to terror , he has miserably failed .
Mr. Giuliani foolishly insisted , against expert advice , on placing New York City ’s state - of - the - art emergency command center on the 27th floor of a 47 - story building that was known to be a terror target and that was destroyed in the World Trade Center attack .

( AP )  President Bush suffered the first veto override of his seven - year - old presidency Thursday as the Senate enacted a $ 23 billion water resources bill despite his protest that it was filled with unnecessary projects .
The vote was 79 - 14 to pass the bill .
Enactment was a foregone conclusion , but it still marked a milestone for a president who spent his first six years with a much friendlier Congress controlled by his Republican Party .
Now he confronts a more hostile , Democratic - controlled legislature , and Thursday 's vote showed that even many Republicans will defy him on spending matters dear to their political careers .
The bill funds hundreds of Army Corps of Engineers projects , such as dams , sewage plants and beach restoration , that are important to local communities and their representatives .
It also includes money for the hurricane - hit Gulf Coast and for Florida Everglades restoration efforts .
The House voted 361 - 54 to override the veto Tuesday .
Both votes easily exceeded the two - thirds majority needed in each chamber to negate a presidential veto .
The last such veto override happened when Congress dealt President Clinton the second of his two overrides in November 1998 .
Bush vetoed no bills during his first five years in office .
He has since vetoed a stem cell research bill twice , an Iraq spending bill that set guidelines for troop withdrawals , and a children 's health insurance bill .
House and Senate Republicans managed to sustain those vetoes .
But he had vehemently objected to the water bill .
But they broke ranks on the Water Resources Development Act , or WRDA , which Bush vetoed on Nov. 2 , calling it too expensive .
His supporters have noted that the Army Corps has a backlog of $ 58 billion worth of projects and an annual budget of about $ 2 billion to address them .
VIDEO : Senators defend veto override
The bill , the first water system restoration and flood control authorization passed by Congress since 2000 , would cost $ 11.2 billion over the next four years , and $ 12 billion in the 10 years after that , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Flood protection projects along the Gulf Coast , including 100 - year levee protection in New Orleans , would cost about $ 7 billion if fully funded .
The bill approves projects but does not fund them .
Some of Bush 's most ardent allies argued for the override .
" This bill is enormously important , and it has been a long time coming , " said Sen.
David Vitter , R - La. , whose state was hammered by Hurricane Katrina two years ago .
The bill " is one of the few areas where we actually do something constructive , " said Senate Minority Whip Trent Lott .
R-Miss .
What Bush sees as pork barrel items , Lott said , " are good , deserved , justified projects . "
" Almost every president opposes this type of bill , " he said .
Democrats are sure to remind such Republicans of their rejection of Bush 's budgetary concerns when debate turns to several spending bills he also vows to veto .
The bill among other things would authorize the construction of navigation improvements for the Upper Mississippi River , at an estimated federal cost of $ 1.9 billion , and an ecosystem restoration project for the Upper Mississippi costing $ 1.7 billion .
The Indian River Lagoon project in the Florida Everglades would be funded at about $ 700 million .
The bill calls for an independent peer review process of all Army Corps projects costing $ 45 million or more , a bid to cut down on wasteful spending .

So , you 've just installed Ubuntu 7.04 , otherwise known as the " Feisty Fawn " release of everyone 's favorite ( for now ) flavor of Linux .
You booted the installation disc , looked around the test environment to discover that your hardware was working , and double - clicked the Install icon on the desktop .
The Ubuntu installer helped you make room for Linux on your hard drive , and even copied over some of your documents and settings from Windows .
Half an hour ago , you had only Windows on your PC , but now you have a choice at boot time , and a whole new world to explore .
Congratulations !
But wait -- before you dive in too deeply , here are seven steps you can take right away to prevent common headaches and help yourself enjoy your new surroundings .
1 . Fix your right
Alt key .
U.S. users may notice before too long that the right - hand Alt key on their keyboard does n't work in Ubuntu .
This will drive you nuts if you frequently use that key .
( I use mine constantly for the Alt - F2 Run command in Gnome . )
By default Ubuntu assigns the right
Alt key ( but not the left one ) to " third level " character input -- that is , the key is reserved for entering extended and international symbols .
This is good for our Ubuntu- using friends in places where third - level characters are in use , but the Gnome Keyboard Indicator applet shows that the U.S. English keyboard layout contains no third - level symbols .
So for us statesiders , our right
Alt key has been mapped to a function that we cannot use in the first place .
To get the right
Alt key to behave like the left Alt key , select System , Preferences , Keyboard .
On the Layout Options tab , open the ' Third level choosers ' branch , and reassign the third - level chooser to another key .
( I prefer the right Windows key -- my laptop does n't even have one of these , so I am actually assigning a useless function to a nonexistent key ! )
2 . Fix your screen resolution .
You 've booted into Ubuntu and your expensive high - res display is running at a paltry 1024 by 768 resolution instead of the 1280 by 1024 or 1600 by 1200 you 're accustomed to .
So you click System , Preferences , Screen Resolution , only to find that the higher resolutions you know your display can support are not offered in the drop - down list .
What the heck ?
This is usually an indication that Ubuntu has failed to suss out the characteristics of your monitor .
( Graphics card woes are also possible in this case , but in my experience monitor trouble is more common . )
Luckily , a helpful Fix Video Resolution Howto in the Ubuntu wiki has solved this issue every time I 've encountered it .
The instructions there should be enough to get your display in gear .
3. Install Automatix .
Automatix is a gem that I 've discussed before :
It 's the easiest way to add certain components to your system that are not included in a default Ubuntu installation for legal reasons .
Automatix makes enabling DVD support , for example , a very simple point - and - click process .
Head to the Automatix installation page and follow the download and installation instructions for Feisty .
Once that 's done , you 'll find Automatix under Applications , System Tools , Automatix .
See my previous coverage of Automatix for pointers that are still relevant with this latest version .
4 . Make sure all your media files play .
Start double - clicking your various audio and video files to see if they play .
( You 'll find links to your Home folder and your Windows partition -- if you have one -- in the Places menu , so start there to find your media collection . )
When Feisty encounters a file type it does n't know how to handle , an automated codec installer will pop up to try to help you download and install support for the file in question .
If you find video files in your collection that do not play properly no matter what you try , use Automatix ( see above ) to install the AUD - DVD Codecs collection of packages ; then use Synaptic ( see below ) to install the Totem - xine package , and try your videos again .
( This procedure disables Feisty 's ability to automatically search for codecs , but you 're taking this step only if that functionality fails you in the first place . )
5. Give Desktop Effects a shot .
In my last column , I looked at Feisty 's Desktop Effects -- an experimental feature set that brings gee - whiz 3D effects to the Linux desktop .
If you have a decent graphics card with 3D capabilities , it 's totally worth your while to see if Desktop Effects will run well on your system .
( The features work reliably on some machines , crash after a while on others , and completely garble the display on particularly unlucky PCs -- hence the designation " experimental . " )
To try out Desktop Effects , select System , Preferences , Desktop Effects .
When the ' Enable the driver ? ' dialog box pops up , click Enable Driver .
You 'll now be prompted to restart your computer ( a rare thing in Linux land ) .
Once you do , log back in and select System , Preferences , Desktop Effects again .
In the new dialog box , click the Enable Desktop Effects button .
After a few moments of on - screen craziness , your desktop should reappear , looking as it did before .
But you 'll notice a difference the moment you drag a window or open a drop - down menu .
( Yowza , look at that ! )
If everything looks good , click Keep Settings in the dialog box asking you to confirm the change .
( If things look bad , this is your first chance to bail out .
If things are so poor you can't even see the dialog box , have no fear : Feisty will automatically revert to your former settings after 30 seconds . )
Try enabling the workspace - switching effect back in the Desktop Effects box ; when you click to a different workspace ( via the widget in the lower right of your screen ) , you should see a nifty effect .
Also note the altered behavior when you press Alt - Tab .
If you do n't like what you see with Desktop Effects ( or if you find that your system becomes crash - prone or otherwise behaves oddly with the Effects , uh , in effect ) , you can turn them off by once again summoning the Desktop Effects dialog box and clicking Enable Desktop Effects .
Yes , you read that right :
The button behaves as a toggle -- though , alas , at this point in time its label does n't change to ' Disable Desktop Effects ' to indicate this to the user .
But clicking the button when effects are enabled disables them , as you will see if you click the button and then move a window around .
6 . Try Beryl for unbeatable eye candy .
Feisty 's Desktop Effects are driven by software called Compiz , originally developed at Novell .
Last year some enterprising hackers working on Compiz decided to fork ( that is , split off from , using existing code as a starting point ) the project , and came up with their own offering , Beryl .
The two projects are actually slated to merge their efforts back into one program later this year , but in the meantime , if Desktop Effects work reliably on your machine , chances are the latest version of Beryl will work too .
And Beryl is far more impressive -- and far more configurable -- than Desktop Effects .
To test - drive Beryl , first disable Desktop Effects by using the oddball toggle button I described at the end of tip # 5 .
Now open a Terminal window ( Applications , Accessories , Terminal ) and enter the following command :
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
Add the following line to the top of the text file that comes up for editing :
deb http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org feisty main
Save the file and quit .
Now back on the command line , issue the following four commands , one at a time :
wget http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/root@lupine.me.uk.gpg
- O- | sudo apt - key add -
sudo apt - get update
sudo apt - get install beryl beryl - manager emerald - themes heliodor beryl - manager
beryl - manager
There should now be a shiny red gem appearing in the notification area ( Windows refugees , think " system tray " ) near the upper right of your screen .
Right - clicking that icon gives you several useful options .
Select Window Manager lets you switch among Beryl , Compiz , or Metacity ( the default , plain - vanilla window manager for Gnome ) .
Select Window Decorator affects how the frames of windows are drawn .
Select Emerald , and you 'll get window frames designed with Beryl in mind .
( See Emerald Theme Manager , also in the red gem 's menu , for more of these . )
Select Heliodor , and you 'll get plain window borders imported from Metacity .
Selecting Beryl Settings Manager will bring up the labyrinthine configuration dialog box for Beryl .
Warning :
If you 're a settings geek , you will lose a few hours of your life here .
Take note of where you can assign functions to the corners of the screen : Select General Options along the top and Shortcuts along the right , and then click the Screen Edges tab .
The horribly named ' Initiate Window Picker for All Workspaces ' function is the equivalent of Mac OS X's Expos é feature -- task - switching nirvana , if you ask me .
If Beryl runs stably and you 'd like it enabled every time you log in , select System , Preferences , Sessions .
On the Startup Programs tab , click New .
Enter beryl - manager in both text - entry fields and click OK .
Now click Close .
7 . Make friends with the package managers .
An entire planet 's worth of Free Software is out there for Ubuntu systems , and you do n't have to trek across the Web and back to find it all .
In the last tip , we interacted with a command - line package manager ( the part of a Linux system that tracks what is and what is not installed ) just for expediency 's sake .
But now it 's time to meet two friendlier interfaces for package management .
First off , there 's the Add / Remove Applications dialog box , reached via Applications , Add / Remove .
Unlike its Windows counterpart , this tool is very good at downloading and installing new applications .
You 'll be surprised by the number of offerings , and in some cases you 'll even be downright shocked by the high quality of the software you retrieve .
If you want to see a geekier , more fleshed - out listing of all available packages , select System , Administration , Synaptic Package Manager .
Whereas Add / Remove Applications is a friendly little forklift of a package manager , Synaptic is a heavy - duty earthmover .
If you 're interested in learning more about the packages that make up your system ( and the ones waiting to be discovered ) , Synaptic 's various views are good places to explore .
I could spend a whole ' nother column telling you about all the great packages that are not installed by default , but for now I 'll just leave you with this bonus tip :
If you 're running Ubuntu on a laptop and your Wi-Fi card is not detected or supported , try installing the Ndisgtk package ( listed as such in Synaptic , but as ' Wireless Windows Drivers ' in Add / Remove Applications ) .
Then select the new System , Administration , Windows Wireless Drivers entry in Ubuntu 's menu bar .
The ensuing dialog box asks for the location of an INF file that represents the Windows driver for your wireless adapter .
Have a driver disc ?
Find the INF file on there and see if Ndisgtk can get you up and running .

URLConf tips and tricks
I ’ve written a couple of things recently talking about useful things to be aware of when you ’re putting together the URL configuration for a Django application — one covering a pitfall you should watch out for with regular expressions and one touching on the utility of the “ url ” tag and the “ permalink ” decorator , and the “ reverse ” utility — but you can never have too much useful information about URL configuration , because for a lot of people it seems to be one of the trickier parts of Django .
So let ’s look at a few more things you might not know about .
Be careful with module globals
Fairly regularly , someone pops up complaining that a value seems to be magically “ cached ” somehow , because a variable whose value is supposed to change over time is n’t changing at all .
For example , someone might have a URLConf like this :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from blog.models import Entry , Link info_dict = { ' queryset ' : Entry . objects . all ( ) , ' date_field ' : ' pub_date ' , ' extra_context ' : { ' latest_link ' : Link .
objects .
latest ( ) } , } urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r'^$ ' , ' django.views.generic.date_based.archive_index ' , info_dict ) , )
In theory , this will set up an index of the latest entries , and also populate the latest link into the context of the generic view .
Except it wo n’t , really ; if you publish a new link you ’ll find that it takes a while before the latest_link variable in the template context updates to reflect that .
The explanation for this is the way it was assigned ; as we saw last time , any variable assigned at the module level — including the items in a dictionary — is actually only calculated once per server process , and then stays in memory for the lifetime of that process .
In the cases we were looking at previously , that was useful behavior , because it provided a way to have something get calculated once and stick around for a long time .
But in a case like this one , it ’s the exact opposite of what ’s wanted ; instead , the latest_link is intended to update on each request , but because it ’s being assigned at the module level that never happens .
The solution for things which need to be calculatd on a per-request basis is to move them into code that ’s executed fresh on each request , like a view .
If you ’re using generic views , you can accomplish this by writing a short wrapper function around the generic view which calculates the extra context , and generally it ’s only one or two lines of code .
As an aside , this also creeps up occasionally in model definitions ; it ’s the difference between this :
pub_date = models .
DateTimeField ( default = datetime .
datetime . now ( ) )
which calls datetime.datetime.now ( ) once , when the module is imported , and this :
pub_date = models .
DateTimeField ( default = datetime .
datetime . now )
which passes the function as the default , ensuring Django will call it each time as needed ( and when we looked at generic model - handling code the other day , we saw how you can test for this in your own code ) .
Use named URL patterns …
I ’ve previously written about why reverse ( ) and permalink ( ) and the { % url %} tag are such handy helpers to have in a Django application ( since they let you design truly decoupled and modular URLs ) , but in order to use them to their utmost you really ought to be using named URL patterns .
These are currently only available in the development version of Django , but they ’re so handy ( and Django ’s trunk is generally so stable ) that they ’re worth upgrading for .
It ’s ever so much simpler to write this :
url ( r'^weblog / $ ' , ' django.views.generic.date_based.archive_index ' , info_dict , name = ' weblog_index ' ) ,
and then be able to drop calls in your templates like
{ % url weblog_index % }
than to have to write out the full name of the view each time ( and , for cases where you have multiple URLs routing to the same view , as when you ’re making heavy use of generic views , this is also the simplest way to avoid the conflicts which would arise from reverse lookups based on view function names ) .
… but make sure your views exist
Using Django ’s reverse - URL lookups , does open up a potential pitfall , however , because Django needs to scan through your root URLConf each time it ’s trying to construct a URL , which means that all of your URL patterns need to point to valid view functions .
If Django is scanning your URLs , looking for the view function named in a call to reverse ( ) or the url tag , and it runs into a pattern which resolves to a non-existent view function , you ’ll end up getting a ViewDoesNotExist exception no matter what ;
Django needs to see what each URL pattern resolves to before it can come up with the correct match for a reverse lookup .
And if you have a typo in your pattern name , or in the name you passed to reverse ( ) or { % url %} , you ’ll similarly get the exception NoReverseMatch ; in order to work , you need to give the URL resolver something that ’s a spot - on match .
Using functions directly in the URLConf
This is a feature that ’s been in Django since shortly after the 0.95 release , and was included in 0.96 : instead of specifying a string which gives the path to your view function , you can import the view and use it directly .
For example :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from django.views.generic import date_based from blog .
models import Entry info_dict = { ' queryset ' : Entry . objects . all ( ) , ' pub_date ' : date_field , } urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , url ( r'^weblog / $ ' , date_based .
archive_index , info_dict , name = ' weblog_index ' ) , )
At first that might not seem very handy ( aside from saving you some typing ) , but it opens up an extremely important use case : since you ’re working directly with the view function , you can decorate it right there in the URLConf .
For example , if you wanted to restrict the weblog in the example above to only logged - in users :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from django.views.generic import date_based from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required from blog .
models import Entry info_dict = { ' queryset ' : Entry . objects . all ( ) , ' pub_date ' : date_field , } urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , url ( r'^weblog / $ ' , login_required ( date_based . archive_index ) , info_dict , name = ' weblog_index ' ) , )
This is extremely powerful , for two reasons :
It lets you decide , on a per- URL basis , whether to decorate a particular view function , which improves the reusability of your views .
It provides an easy way to decorate generic views without having to write a decorated wrapper function around them .
Per-request URL configuration
This is another fairly new feature , though it was in the 0.96 release , and as far as I know it has n’t yet been documented because there are still some issues revolving around reverse URL resolution when you use it , but Django will let you override the ROOT_URLCONF setting on a per-request basis .
This is useful , for example , if you know you ’ll have a lot of different “ sub- sites ” which are n’t different enough to warrant giving each one its own settings and Site object , but which still need somewhat varying URL configurations .
All you have to do is assign a urlconf attribute to the request early on in processing ( basically , in the “ process_request ( ) ” method of a middleware class ) , using the same style as the ROOT_URLCONF setting , and Django will use that in place of the URLConf specified in the settings module .
For example , you might have a middleware like this :
class URLSwitchingMiddleware ( object ) : def process_request ( self , request ) : request .
urlconf = ' myproject.urls . %s ' % request .
META [ ' HTTP_HOST ' ] . replace ( '.' , ' _' )
For a request with a Host header of “ www.example.com”, this would set the root URLConf to myproject.urls.www_example_com
( note the example here replaces dots with underscores , since dots will be interpreted as separators in a Python import path ) .
This is n’t something you ’ll always need to do , and probably not something you ’ll need to do very often , but when you need it it ’s a lifesaver .
Less than a week after the world 's scientists warned there may be just eight years to act on greenhouse gas pollution to avoid the worst of global warming , the aviation industry has announced record increases in the number of flights worldwide .
Booming demand for domestic flights in China has helped nudge the number of global take - offs scheduled for this month to more than 2.5 m for the first time .
A surge in the popularity of low - cost airlines means more than 114,000 more flights are expected than during the same period last year - a 5 % rise .
Announcing the figures for May , Duncan Alexander , managing director of aviation analyst firm OAG , said : " From an industry perspective this healthy growth bodes very well for the future . "
Climate experts and environmental campaigners were less pleased .
Kevin Anderson , a global warming researcher at Manchester University 's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , said the expansion was at odds with efforts to tackle emissions : " While this might be good news for the aviation industry and its shareholders , it 's bad news for the climate and ultimately it 's our children that will pay the price . "
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said on Friday that worldwide greenhouse gas emissions needed to peak by 2015 to keep the expected temperature rise this century to 2C , defined by scientists as dangerous .
Unrestrained growth could see a 6C rise by 2100 .
Although aviation contributes only about 2 % of global emissions , campaigners have highlighted the industry 's environmental impact because it is the fastest - growing source of greenhouse gases , and there is no technological fix .
New official forecasts to be published at an aviation conference in Barcelona next month predict international carbon dioxide pollution from aircraft will reach 1.2bn to 1.4bn tonnes by 2025 , up from 610 m tonnes now .
Aircraft emissions have a greater warming effect because they are released at altitude .
The UK government says this exaggerated impact means that 1 tonne of carbon dioxide released from an aircraft does the same damage as 2.5 tonnes emitted from cars or power stations .
And because most aviation is classed as an international activity , its emissions are rarely included in official figures and they are excluded from the Kyoto protocol , the international treaty to regulate greenhouse gases .
Peter Lockley , of the Aviation Environment Federation campaign group , said : " Even the most optimistic industry estimates have fuel efficiency only increasing by 1 - 2 % each year .
So if the number of flights goes up 5 % a year , it 's not very difficult maths to see their carbon emissions are going to rise , just as the scientists say they need to be reduced . "
OAG's May figures are taken from its Quarterly Airline Traffic Statistics , based on data from 1,000 scheduled airlines .
They show that 2.51 m flights are timetabled worldwide this month , topping the previous high of 2.49 m from August last year .
That represents an additional 113,827 flights compared with May 2006 , or 17.7 m extra seats .
Mr Alexander said : " This is great news from a travellers ' viewpoint , with much more competition and choice . "
The largest year - on - year rise is within China , with nearly 23,000 more domestic flights scheduled this month than in May 2006 , a rise of 18 % .
US domestic flights have risen by some 19,000 , though that represents just a 2 % rise , to 838,000 .
Demand also soared within India , up 10,000 flights , or 25 % , to 43,000 flights .
The figures show that the UK is now the most popular country for international flights , with 121,000 scheduled arrivals and departures this month , up 7 % .
Spain showed the single largest rise , up nearly 10,000 flights , or 16 % .
Overall , the low - cost sector showed a rise of some 70,000 flights , up 22 % year - on - year .
OAG says : " In sheer size , the most noteworthy route showing a year - on - year increase is for flights between western Europe and Africa .
This month , there are over 2,200 more flights scheduled between these two continents , up 13 % , and over 360,000 more seats available . "
Transatlantic routes also showed a significant rise .
The report comes as Mark Ellingham , founder of the Rough Guide series , has called for stringent new taxes on flights to deter travellers and reduce environmental damage .
He wants a £ 100 green tax on all flights to Europe and Africa , and £ 250 on flights to the rest of the world , as well as a moratorium on airport expansion .
He said there was no such thing as an ethical holiday .
" The tobacco industry fouled up the world while denying it as much as possible for as long as they could .
" If the travel industry rosily goes ahead as it is doing , ignoring the effect that carbon emissions from flying are having on climate change , we are putting ourselves in a very similar position to the tobacco industry . "
PRINCETON , NJ -- Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats or independents to rate their mental health as excellent , according to data from the last four November Gallup Health and Healthcare polls .
Fifty - eight percent of Republicans report having excellent mental health , compared to 43 % of independents and 38 % of Democrats .
This relationship between party identification and reports of excellent mental health persists even within categories of income , age , gender , church attendance , and education .
The basic data -- based on an aggregated sample of more than 4,000 interviews conducted since 2004 -- are straightforward .
The differences are quite significant , as can be seen .
While Democrats are slightly less likely to report excellent mental health than are independents , the big distinctions in these data are the differences between Republicans and everyone else .
One could be quick to assume that these differences are based on the underlying demographic and socioeconomic patterns related to party identification in America today .
A recent Gallup report ( see " Strong Relationship Between Income and Mental Health " in Related Items ) reviewed these mental health data more generally , and found that men , those with higher incomes , those with higher education levels , and whites are more likely than others to report excellent mental health .
Some of these patterns describe characteristics of Republicans , of course .
But an analysis of the relationship between party identification and self - reported excellent mental health within various categories of age , gender , church attendance , income , education , and other variables shows that the basic pattern persists regardless of these characteristics .
In other words , party identification appears to have an independent effect on mental health even when each of these is controlled for .
The accompanying graphs display the relationship between party identification and self - reported mental health crossed by categories of a number of relevant variables .
In almost all cases , Republicans are more likely to report excellent mental health across the various categories .
For example , Republicans are significantly more likely to report excellent mental health than are independents or Democrats among those making less than $ 50,000 a year , and among those making at least $ 50,000 a year .
Republicans are also more likely than independents and Democrats to report excellent mental health within all four categories of educational attainment .
Quoth qftblog :
At first , everything goes well .
He ’s impressed by the fact that you do n’t have to constantly compile code to see the effects of your program .
But after using the REPL as a calculator for a few minutes , he decides to check out how you write Hello World .
This is where things start going downhill .
He notices that the chapter on I/O is tucked away in the Advanced section .
When the trees were tall and dwarves roamed about in the forest , I was a wee tot tinkering about with MS - DOS . bat files .
These were the days before there was a dial - up BBS around my area , let alone any dreams of the Internet .
I ’d heard of BASIC , but I did n’t have a compiler ( later I got one ) , so I went the bizantine way of writing dozens of batch files calling each other conditionally using IF ERRORLEVEL .
Evidently , not all was factible to do in that scheme ( it could be argued that a gazillion batch files makes for a Turing - complete system , but what I had was complex enough for an 8 - year - old ) .
Help gradually came in the form of little .EXE files that did things — sorts , file concatenation , some better form of conditionals .
I eventually got someone to pirate me a copy of BASICA .EXE — and then I could program the games I had in my head .
The infatuation must have lasted a few months ; after that , I had exhausted all the little programming ideas a 9 - year - old can have .
But I had concocted a couple of cool little games .
Fast - forward .
It ’s three years ago , and after seriously dicking around with Matlab and getting the computer to do cool stuff like recognize tiny digit bitmaps with a simple backprop net ( that I wrote myself , because I could n’t make sense of the language in the NN module ) or optimizing some routes with GAs , I thought again this programming thing was kind of cool .
So I loaned a copy of the K&R manual on C and went home print “ Oh bitty box ! ” with gcc .
Later that day , I went to ##c at freenode .
net and asked what was only natural to me given my first experiences in trying to get something done with a computer : I wanted to know how to go about reading from stdin , applying a function and writing to stdout .
I was told “ well , there ’s a lot you need to know before doing that ” .
So I dropped C. From my particular point of view , imperative language tutorials are severely flawed because they tuck how to operate the basic Unix form of program interaction in the “ Advanced ” section .
In case you ’re curious , this is Haskell code for processing data from stdin with the_Big_function and writing to stdout :
main = interact the _Big_function
Now all you need to do is , you know , actually build the damn house and choose curtains later .
What my experience with batch files had taught me is that what programming is really all about is transforming pieces of data .
It happens that some of the most visible examples of that are somewhat contrived , as they involve transforming Unix API instructions into bare - metal machine code ( operating systems ) or entire computer - states into next computer - states ( gotos , for - loops , continuations , etc ) .
But in a well - designed language , you should be able to focus on your problem domain , solve it well and fix the curtains later .
That ’s what C programmers need to focus on if they want to learn Haskell : data - driven programming .
Monads will come about at some point like the natural application of data - driven programming they really are .
In the meantime , while you ’re taking breaks from writing the coolest programs employing all the fancy data - structures in the Data . * hierarchy , playing from the REPL and maybe compiling a Unix pipe filter or two with main = interact the_Big_function , you can gradually read the best , if somewhat abstruse - looking in the beginning from all the commutative diagrams , monad tutorial out there .
Keep this in mind : a Haskell program is a list of equations transforming data structures .
The rest will come , and if you ’re smart enough to grok pointers ( what the hell are that ? ) , you will easily grok monads when they come up naturally as a Haskell structure like any other , defined in Haskell itself , no -answers - no - surprises .
Now go and try to have some fun , damnit .

Defense lawyers preparing for the war crimes trial of a 21 - year - old Guantánamo detainee have been ordered by a military judge not to tell their client  or anyone else  the identity of witnesses against him , newly released documents show .
The case of the detainee , Omar Ahmed Khadr , is being closely watched because it may be the first Guantánamo prosecution to go to trial , perhaps as soon as May .
Defense lawyers say military prosecutors have sought similar orders to keep the names of witnesses secret in other military commission cases , which have been a centerpiece of the Bush administration ’s policies for detainees at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
Some legal experts and defense lawyers said the judge ’s order , issued on Oct. 15 without public disclosure , underscored the gap between military commission procedures and traditional American rules that the accused has a right to a public trial and to confront the witnesses against him .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Barack Obama has chipped away at Hillary Clinton 's lead in New Hampshire locking the Democrats in a statistical tie a month before the first presidential primary , according to a CNN / WMUR Poll released Wednesday .
Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama attend a November 15 debate in Las Vegas , Nevada .
Clinton has dropped 5 percentage points since a previous CNN / WMUR survey in November , while Obama has gained 8 percentage points , according to the poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center .
Clinton is now at 31 percent to Obama 's 30 percent .
New Hampshire 's primary is set for January 8 .
Clinton 's 5 - percentage point drop appears to have been largely due to the loss of support among women .
" Clinton 's support among Democratic women in New Hampshire has dropped from 43 percent to 33 percent , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" By contrast , her support among men dropped only 1 point to 27 percent in that same time period . "
Chart : Track support for Clinton and Obama since June »
Clinton is still viewed by Democratic primary voters as having the most experience and the best chance of beating the Republican presidential nominee .
But Obama is seen as more likable , more believable and more likely to unite the country .
Watch how polls could affect Clinton 's campaign »
Among Republicans , the poll reveals that despite Mike Huckabee 's meteoric rise in some Iowa and national surveys , the former Arkansas governor has yet to catch fire in New Hampshire .
Huckabee remains in single digits at 9 percent , up 4 percentage points from November .
But he still trails ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by 23 percentage points .
Romney remains in the lead in New Hampshire with 32 percent , according to the poll , followed by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. John McCain of Arizona who are tied with 19 percent .
Despite Romney 's double - digit edge over his nearest competitors , and the seemingly two - way Democratic battle between Clinton and Obama , Holland said Granite State victories are still up for grabs .
" This race is not over by a long shot , " said Holland .
" Forty - three percent of Democratic primary voters , and a whopping 55 percent of GOP voters , say they are still trying to make up their minds . "
That 's good news for former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards , who trails Democratic front - runners by 14 percentage points , and Giuliani and McCain , who both hope to derail Romney with a win in New Hampshire .
Still , the poll is welcome news for Romney , who has watched his numbers drop in Iowa as Huckabee has moved into first place in recent Hawkeye State polls .
This survey could indicate that for now , Romney has successfully erected a firewall in New Hampshire built largely by early organizing and public support from prominent Republicans in the state , such as Sen. Judd Gregg .
Amid a week of good poll news for Huckabee , this survey will be disappointing as it shows his brand of social conservatism does not appear to be catching on with the traditionally fiscal conservative New Hampshire Republicans .
The Republicans surveyed in this poll ranked Huckabee fourth ( 10 percent ) behind Romney ( 32 percent ) , McCain ( 21 percent ) and Giuliani ( 13 percent ) when asked which of the GOP presidential hopefuls represented their values .
The poll also had bad news for former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson , who garnered a tiny 1 percent among New Hampshire Republicans who responded to the poll .
A Thompson spokesman told CNN on Tuesday that a strategic decision had been made to focus all of the campaign 's attention on Iowa until the January 3 caucuses .
The poll of 354 likely Republican primary voters , and 378 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted from December 6 through December 10 .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points .

小山氏は 「ボットネットはますます『ビジネス』に特化して，仕組みが高度化している」と指摘する。また「昨年秋から，日本語のスパム・メールがボットを使って送信されるケースが増えた」と言う。小山氏にボットネットの現状を聞いた（聞き手は中田
敦＝ITpro）。
小山さんも参加されてい るTelecom - ISAC Japan（国内の通信事業者やISPで構成するセキュリティ組織）は昨年，ハニーポットを使って，ボットネットの仕組みを詳しく調査していました。今も，ボットネットの解析は続けているのですか？
小山覚氏 NTT コミュニケーションズ 企画戦略部門 部門 長
はい。ボットネットに関しては調査を進めるだけでなく，駆除にも取り組んでいます。2006年12月からは総務省と経済産業省の共同プロジェクト「
サイバークリーンセンター 」 のWebサイトを開設し，ボットに感染しているユーザーに対してISP経由で注意を喚起し，「サイバークリーンセンターにボットを駆除できるツールがあるから，適用して下さい」と呼びかけ始めています。
これらの取り組みを進める中で，いくつかのことが分かりました。
私がボットに注目しだしたのは2005年のことですが，当時日本では，ボットという言葉も定着していなくて「ゾンビ」などとも言われていました。その頃のボットの特徴は，高機能なものが多かったことです。ソースコードもアカデミックな感じで，「みんなでボットのソースコードを共有しよう」という機運がありました。いわゆる「ハッカー」が，数千台，数万台のパソコンを遠隔操作するために作ったのが「ボット」だったわけです。
ところが現在は，そうやって編み出された「IRCボット」が，完全にビジネスに悪用されるようになりました。ビジネス化する中で，使われるボットも高機能なものから，単機能なものに変化しつつあります。
最近流行しているボットの場合，パソコンがボットに感染してから，大量のスパム・メールを送信するようになるまで10分しかかかりません。スパム・メール送信業者は，ボットをばらまくクラッカーに対価を払って「スパム送信ツール」を入手し，クラッカーが構築したボットネットを利用して，大量のスパム・メールを送信しています。ボットを使ったスパム送信が，とてもシステマチックに運用されているわけです。スパム送信業者は，クラッカーが提供する「オンデマンド・ボット」を利用して，スパム・メール送信に専念しているのです。
「 日本は大丈夫」は誤 解
2月に米国サンフランシスコで開催された「RSA
Conference 2007 」でも，色んな方が「ボットネットはビジネス目的で運用されている」と指摘していました。またボットを使ったビジネスも，カジノ・サイトなどに対するDDoS（分散サービス妨害）攻撃から，スパム送信に移ったと言われています。
ただ，RSA Conference 2007でも，スパムの送信元としては，米国やフランス，スペイン，ブラジル，ポーランドなどの名前は挙がっていましたが，日本はあまり聞きませんでした。日本人としては，これは喜ばしいことだと思っているのですが…
その認識は甘いですね。
ボットネットに限りませんが，ネットワーク・セキュリティの研究は自然科学みたいなもので，「あなたが観測している世界が，世界の全てですか？」という疑問が付きまといます。
つまり，ボットの観測は「ため池」の観測みたいなものなのです。あなたが観測した「ため池」にフナしかいないからといって，別の「ため池」もそうだとは限らない。別の「ため池」にはメダカがいるかもしれないのです。
ワームのようなマルウエアは，全世界中に感染する傾向があります。それに対してボットは，広域な感染が見られないのが特徴です。ボットの感染傾向は，IPアドレスの範囲にかなり依存しています。
実は，ハニーポットを設置したISPによって，捕獲できるボットの種類にかなり違いが出ています。ボットをばらまこうとする「ボッター」が，特定のIPアドレスの範囲を狙っているということも理由として挙げられますし，ボット自体が感染を他に広げる際に，近接するIPアドレスしか狙っていないという理由も挙げられます。
つまり 「スパム送信元として日本の名前をあまり聞かないから，日本ではボットがあまり広まっていない」と考えるのは誤りなのですね。
「 日本は大丈夫」と思っていると，「 Blaster」ワームの亜種だった「 Nachi」 や「 Welchia」の二の舞になるでしょう。NachiやWelchiaは，米国ではほとんど騒がれませんでしたが，日本に大変な被害をもたらしました。
マイクロソフトは， 「 悪意のあるツールの削除プログラム 」 をMicrosoft UpdateやOSの自動更新機能で配布して，どんなマルウエアが削除されたか，統計を取っています。マイクロソフトの情報に基づいて，ITproも2006年6月に「MSの「ウイルス削除ツール」，今までに駆除したウイルスは1600万件」というニュースを報道しています。サイバークリーンセンターでも，統計を取っていますか？
ユーザーからのフィードバックは頂いています。ただ，システマチックに統計を取るようなことはまだしていません。実は，2007年度の取り組みとして，サイバークリーンセンターで配布するツールに，どのようなマルウエアが何件駆除されたか，ユーザーから送信できるようにする機能を追加しようと検討しています。
サイバークリーンセンターのユーザーからは，どのようなフィードバックがありましたか。
ボットネットに感染していた方は，皆一様に「気づいていなかった」と言われますね。
またボットネットの駆除を始めて，こちらが気づいたこともあります。サイバークリーンセンターでツールをダウンロードしてすぐにパソコンをスキャンした人と，ダウンロードしてしばらく経ってからパソコンをスキャンした人とでは，ボットの駆除率に違いが出ているようなのです。
現在サイバークリーンセンターが配布しているツールは，定義ファイルの内容を1週間に1度更新しています。そのため，定義ファイルの更新から時間が経つと，すぐに駆除率が下がる傾向があるのです。それだけボットが素早く進化しているのだと思います。
定義ファイルの更新頻度が1週間に1回なのはどうしてですか？
色々なバランスがあってのことなのですが，ユーザーに「サイバークリーンセンターでチェックをしておけば，セキュリティは大丈夫」という意識を持ってもらいたくないという理由もあります。

Mayor Wilkins here with another action - packed Goldmine .
When you were younger , you loved those Choose Your Own Adventure books .
Yeah , I know you did .
I did , too .
Anyway , out of all those Choose Your Own Adventure books that were made , you know that some of them just did n't make the final cut .
Forum member Jer decided to dig deep into the collective fetid imaginations of the forum goons this week to find out just what , in their minds , should have made it to the bookshelves .
And from old women flashing people at Mardi Gras to conducting highly famous theoretical experiments , the goons came up with some ... well .
Something .
Enjoy this week 's Comedy Goldmine - " Choose Your Own Adventure " Books That Never Quite Made It !
Newspaper Asks Public to Identify Local Blogger
A Florida newspaper appears to have hit an all - time low in the relationship between bloggers and the media .
The St. Augustine Record is asking the public to help expose the identity of a local blogger who recently started a site critical of county politicians .
This evening , the paper 's home page has a grainy surveillance photo of a man accompanied by this text :
Who is this man ?
Believed to be connected to a politically charged but anonymously - run Web site targeting the character of members of the St. Johns County Commission .
Help us determine his identity .
Start by watching these four movies featuring footage from surveillance cameras .
The Record published video taken inside and outside its offices March 1 that show a man dropping something off at the front desk .
There 's no explanation of what he 's doing , making it look like some kind of threat was delivered , but I found the details on the paper 's message board .
He was at the newspaper buying an ad .
The ad , which the paper ran , criticized County Commissioner Ben Rich for comments he made during a televised meeting :
Unbelievably , Rich went on to say that he was angered by the police officer first responding to the Columbine school tragedy in Colorado .
He actually remarked in the televised meeting that watching the police officer who was outside the school awaiting the SWAT team made him " want to go down there and shoot the cop and go in " .
Mr. Rich , you should resign as an elected official , you do not deserve to serve .
All of us know that in reality Rich is mad because the firefighters union supported candidates in the last election that Mr. Rich did not support .
Rich has been trying to take his revenge against the firefighters publicly for months .
Mr. Rich , we will not allow you to play politics with our local safety any longer .
The blogger 's site , LocalSafety.org , is offline but I fished several pages from Google 's cache .
Allegations made by blogger Lee Padgett , as he 's identified in the site 's whois record and messages on the paper 's message board , are backed up by the Record : Rich really did make the " shoot the cop " remark and disparage firefighters , drawing an angry response .
This week , Rich filed for re-election early , hoping it would cause the site to be judged an excessive campaign contribution by local election officials and shut down .
" I find cowardice in any form repugnant , " [ Rich ] said .
" But in the political arena , where cowardice has become socially acceptable , I find it doubly repugnant . " ... " It 's obvious to me that my political opponents have declared war and are using the unfair advantage of not registering as a political action committee , " Rich said .
" Through the declaration of my candidacy , they 'll no longer be able to operate in the shadows of anonymity .
They will be forced into the open where they 'll have their names and faces known to those they attack . "
I do n't know Padgett , but he has the right to speak his mind on the web without intimidation by politicians and the press , whether or not he 's writing under his real name .
I 've been reading the Record for a decade .
I can't recall a single time where it conducted an effort to catch a rapist , robber or murderer anywhere near the scope of this manhunt for a blogger .
Comments
Hell hath no fury like a local politician being exposed doing something stupid .
I 'm now working on a legal case involving a deeply corrupt local government whose activities were aided and abetted by a local paper .
The paper was so steeped in the local culture of corruption , that they actually felt they were doing a community service in defending the illegal activities .
In fact , at a critical time in my early investigation , the paper felt a need to reveal my own identity ( which I had been trying to keep secret , for safety reasons ) .
Papers like our local Hoboken Reporter , the culprit here , and yoour Record , simply find it easier to ' go along and get along ' than to search out the truth .
Like your paper , ours ( in one of the most notoriously corrupt areas of the country ) has NEVER uncovered a scandal .
Never .
They will report an arrested politician or an investigation , but otherwise , they simply do not wish to ' get involved ' .
Fortunately , local papers have yearly events at which they give each other awards for their fine reporting .
No one has to feel bad , except perhaps the public .
So , I can relate .
I would bet that if a sufficient number of St. Augustine 's citizens called in with false tips , they could torpedo this sleazy effort .
How about a call to arms ?
" I do n't know Padgett , but he has the right to speak his mind on the web without intimidation by politicians and the press , whether or not he 's writing under his real name . "
Of course , if it turns out that the blogger IS actually working for a political opponent ( and is n't merely an honest , concerned , independent citizen ) he 's violating election laws , in a big way , and risking fines and jail time -- and any politician , no matter how unpopular or how poor his judgment , would have a perfect right to expose him .
MYCROFT says " Of course , if it turns out that the blogger IS actually working for a political opponent ( and is n't merely an honest , concerned , independent citizen ) he 's violating election laws , in a big way , and risking fines and jail time -- and any politician , no matter how unpopular or how poor his judgment , would have a perfect right to expose him . "
So what you 're saying is that anyone EXCEPT someone working for a political candidate has the power to tell the TRUTH ?
Remember , his allegations are indeed backed up by the paper and as stand are true , so no matter who he works for he is HONEST and CONCERNED .
And unless he is in this country illegally I 'll assume he is also a citizen .
What happened to the truth shall set you free ?
Why would anyone feel that it is write to ' expose ' someone for telling the truth , no matter WHY they are telling the truth ?
Think about that one .
Why is Mycroft afraid of speech ?
Linked to your story : here maybe it will help get the word out and stop this nonsense ( doubtful )
Good article .
Our local paper , AC-T , is also complicit with the local politicos , and refused to carry stories about state corruption until indictments were handed down .
Calls to the news tip line about the case would result in a dial tone .
" Of course , if it turns out that the blogger IS actually working for a political opponent ( and is n't merely an honest , concerned , independent citizen ) he 's violating election laws , in a big way "
True , which is only to say that election laws violate the 1st amendment , in a big way .
And the media are eager to crush the 1st amendment rights of everyone outside their own ranks , because in the resulting silence they expect to have more influence .
On the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with the accuser having to stand tall in the sunlight as well .
Sniping from the weeds , unless the accuser fears for his life , strikes me as somewhat cowardly .
The traditional media is scared .
With the white cap , looks like it could be Whitey " FBI 10 Most Wanted " Bulger from Boston , except plumper and younger !!!

I hope everyone will visit the discussions on this topic at the Free Speech Forums ( http://tott.myfreeforum.org) where The Record has no influence .
Comments on the newspaper 's own forum like this one :
Originally posted by speak2me :
Wake up people of St. Augustine .
The name Lee Padgett is a ficticious name made up by a representative of the firefighters union .
Force my reply where I post under the nic " Stinky " ;
This is without a doubt the most irrelevant comment in the entire discussion yet it seems to be a few participants ' obsession .
Are firefighters not entitled to protect themselves by calling attention to comments by members of their elected county commission ?
I think so , especially if those comments propose to put their lives and safety at risk .
Arguably , if Mr. Padgett is a member or representative of members of the firefighter 's union , he is very legitimately motivated to do so .
As to his name , it does n't matter whether he calls himself " Lee Padgett " or " John Doe " or " Santa Claus " - he is a citizen repeating the words of an elected official and calling attention to comments made by the chairman of the board that make him look like he belongs in a loony bin .... hum , maybe loonyBEN.com is available ?
And , by the way speak2 me , is " speak2 me " your real name ?
How about stjohnsvoice , or bullgatorlady ?
Are those YOUR real names ?
I know that " Stinky " is n't MY real name but it sure reflects my opinion of The Record this morning and the political cronies that are feeding from the county trough - thanks to their connections to Ben Rich .
They are using their energies on county time , while on the county payroll , at taxpayer 's expense , to advance this ridiculous witch hunt to protect their benefactor .
The Record ran an editorial calling on Rich to resign as Chair of the Commission .
It would n't appear they 're interested in squashing his opponents .
I think they just want to solve the mystery of who the guy is .
Rich is the one trying to limit free speech and he calls himself a libertarian .
Power corrupts as Lord Acton said .
I sent the following email last evening to editor Peter Ellis at the St. Augustine Record 's " tip line " ...
" On behalf of bloggers everywhere : Shame on you !
" Who are you to treat as criminals those who dare to speak out against
their elected leaders ?
" And what exactly do you intend to do with the person behind this
" politically charged but anonymously - run Web site " when you do catch
up with him ?
Have him arrested for crimes against the state ?
Please .
" Consider this :
If your paper were doing its job , perhaps bloggers
would n't have to do it for you . "
I received the following reply from Mr. Ellis this morning :
" This has nothing to do with blogs or bloggers so whoever told you that has led you in the wrong direction . "
Mr. Cadenhead , your thoughts ?
The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of anonymous political speech -
straylight.law.cornell.edu
" Of course , the identity of the source is helpful in evaluating ideas .
But `the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market ' ( Abrams v. United States , [ 250 U.S. 616 , 630 ( 1919 ) ( Holmes , J. , dissenting ) ] ) .
Do n't underestimate the common man .
People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source of an anonymous writing .
They can see it is anonymous .
They know it is anonymous .
They can evaluate its anonymity along with its message , as long as they are permitted , as they must be , to read that message .
And then , once they have done so , it is for them to decide what is `responsible ' , what is valuable , and what is truth . "
New York v. Duryea , 76 Misc. 2d 948 , 966-967 , 351 N. Y. S. 2d 978 , 996 ( 1974
Mr. Cadenhead , your thoughts ?
I do n't understand his comment any more than I understand the paper 's reasoning for trying to hunt the guy down .
You can't get through J school without learning about this country 's rich tradition of anonymous pamphleteering .
The notion that you do n't have the right to speak your mind without completely identifying yourself is bogus .
Many of you are confusing a blogger with a political action committee .
Lee Padgett is a fictitious person ; he does not exist .
The web site under his name was set up by a political action committee .
The goal is to find out what that political action committee is .
I have n't seen any news coverage that provides evidence that the blog was created by a political action committee .
I do n't know what the ad in the Record cost , but the other expenses required to create localsafety .org seem trivial in my opinion -- a couple of hours ' time to set up the software , $ 12 for the domain name and web hosting that 's probably under $ 20 a month .
Since the paper recommended its readers to visit the blogger 's site on March 1 and sold him an ad before that , what changed ?
Politics in the age of blogs is going to be a lot more complex .
Politics rapidly evolves to a winner take all confrontation and as such , as in love , all is fair .
This war is eventually halted , hopefully , by an election and the public decides who to grant power to .
This sounds like an entrenched campaign between a politician and a labor union .
The negotiations they have been involved with have created some real malice and the voters of the local area will now be " gamed " in an effort to win .
It would be nice for the " activist " to come clean ad disclose his connections to the union but it's also understandable that in this environment that act might serve as a political weapon to have him fired .
When the war is being waged truth , fairness and justice are all compromised .
Blogs need to be positioned in the same context as " letters to the editor " .
Signing a letter " an angry citizen " is often acceptable but most papers would insist on the writer declaring himself before publishing an excessively critical missive .
I 'd like to see this blog come out and let the voters follow the events that follow ... closely .
But , it 's very easy for me to put someelse 's career on the line becuase it costs me nothing .
using anonymity in this case just serves to give the opponent leverage to label all the words as politically " out of bounds " ... like a campaign of dirty tricks .
Hopefully , these areas of conflict will be opened , debated and regulated to a reasonable degree to put the potential for gaming at an acceptable level .
I think the politician should request the writer to disclose his identity but understand that legally he has no right to demand it ... writing politically sensitive words in itself is NOT a crime .
Even if a pseudonym is used .
Libel , slander and defamation are all legally defined and potentially applicable in a civil court .
Why is a pac different then a person ?
We can't speak if we do it in groups ?
Is n't the freedom to assemble a constitutional right ?
Maybe the Record 's going for this year 's Eason Jordan Award for Media Access .
I 've had some interesting email correspondence today with Peter Ellis , editor of the Record .
You can find it here :
writingcompany.blogs.com
I 'll update my site as the discussion proceeds .
Are environmental devastators hiding behind supposed Internet anonymity ?
1 . In 2003 , 157 of 159 applications for rezoning were approved by the then - St. Johns County , Florida Commission .
Locals called them a corrupt rubber - stamp for powerful economic interests who are ruining this beautify county with shoddy " developments " without adequate infrastructure , destroying our wildlife , wetlands and way of life .
2 . In 2004 , Ben Rich was elected to County Commission .
Thank God .
A retired federal law enforcement official , he walked the county , heard our concerns and is against corruption and favoritism .
3 . In 2006 , two other populist skeptics were elected .
4. In 2007 , did landraping , clearcutting overdevelopers " use a putative " blog " to attack St. Johns County , Florida Commission Chairman Ben Rich , retaliating for his courageous stands against destruction of our natural beauty and pleasures , our land , air , water ?
5 . Did those who want to destroy the reasons people love to visit and live here with tacky clear - cutting and metastasized " development " trash Ben Rich ?
6 . Thanks to the St. Augustine Record , we may know the answer .
7. I appreciate Mr. Rogers Cadenhead 's concern about personal privacy .
www.cadenhead.org
8 . Ironically , the local government and business carping harpies ( I call them the " anonymice " ) who frequent the St. Augustine Record " Talk of the Town " website have hid behind anonymity for years , making ad hominem attacks on all persons who criticize government officials ( including archaeology issues , St. Augustine 's illegal dumping of the contents of the old city dump into the Old City Reservoir , race discrimination and refusal to fly the Gay Rainbow flags on our Bridge of Lions ( leading to a federal court order that the flags fly June 7 - 13 , 2005 ) .
See , e.g. , www.cleanupcityofstaugustine.blogspot.com
9. ToTTers ' antics are a reflection of a control group that is losing its grip on St. Johns County .
Last year , I was kicked off ToTT for supposedly " outing " ToTTers who already identified themselves .
10 . Some " anonymice " ToTTers attacking my right to engage in First Amendment protected activity were local government officials , businesspeople and their spouses and entourages .
11 . These " anonymice " have chilled free speech here for years on ToTT .
12 . Likewise , the " anonymice " behind the www.localsafety.org have a ( barely ) hidden agenda .
13 .
The public has a right to know .
14 . As Justice Louis Brandeis said , " sunlight is the best disinfectant . "
15 . While the right to anonymous posting on the Internet is protected by the First Amendment against government interference .
16 . No " state action " is involved in the St. Augustine Record 's effort to learn the true identity of the " anonymice " behind the www.localsafety.org website .
17 .
The identity of the " anonymice " behind www.localsafety.org is news .
18 . Kudos to Morris Communications and the St. Augustine Record for exercising their God-given First Amendment right to identify those who contributed to www.localsafety.org.
19 .
Will the malefactors of great wealth who seek to skewer Ben Rich be hoist on their own petard ?
20 .
Will landraping , clearcutting , uglifying foreign investment interests that seek to destroy our county ( and turn it into South Florida ) kindly identify themselves ?
21 . Why must they hide behind " private corporations ? "
22 . Are they ashamed of what they have done to the wetlands , wildlife , land and people of St. Johns County ?
23 .
Do they reckon themselves above the public 's right to know ?
24 .
They have the " right to remain silent , " but we wish they would n't .
25 . By County Commission Chairman Ben Rich announcing his 2008 candidacy earlier this week , the www.localsafety.org crew knew that they would have to disclose their identity as a Political Action Committee ( PAC ) .
26 .
That 's why www.localsafety.org pulled the plug on their " blog " -- they can't stand scrutiny and have contempt for our democracy .
As St. Augustine Record Editor Pete Ellis reportedly wrote another blogger , " There 's a difference between a blogger and a political action committee . "
www.writingcompany.blogs.com
As Pete Ellis wrote above , " Many of you are confusing a blogger with a political action committee .
" Lee Padgett is a fictitious person ; he does not exist .
The web site under his name was set up by a political action committee .
The goal is to find out what that political action committee is . "
I agree .
Taking out a newspaper ad under a false name may also be a breach of contract , depending upon how the Record 's ad rate card and contracts are written .
27 .
So , to solve the kerfuffle , will the www.localsafety.org funders kindly call the St. Augustine Record ( or me ) and identify yourselves ?
28 . Confession is good for the soul -- just as investigative reporting is good for the soul of a democracy .
29 .
Thank you , Pete Ellis and St. Augustine Record for working to disclose the identity of the " frontman " for developers , in order to expose who funded www.localsafety.org, which may involve possible state and federal crimes , including RICO and Hobbs Act .
The wrecking crew of uglifying discredited overdevelopers , manipulators and controllers -- they can run , but they can't hide .
See , e.g. , www.cleanupcityofstaugustine.blogspot.com

I do n't live anythwhere near St. Augustine and I do n't know anything about local politics there .
However , I watched the television footage of the police " response " at Columbine High School .
My reaction to it was pretty much the same as that attributed to Councillor Ben Rich .
If that makes me a loon , then there are lot of loons around .
Do n't see the fuss .
The Blog World was up in arms when corporations masked their blog work and then got " outed " .
Is there a double standard here ?
If a blogger had called this out would the response have been different ?
We are protected if we we give our personal opinion and yet to make a fictitious post seems to beg for the answer to the Why and Who of the story .
Rule of thumb in such affairs : if politicians are involved , they are corrupt .
Does n't always work , just usually .
Eactly .
Were two petty poltroonish clearcutter - coddling St. Johns County politicians involved in setting up the website to trash Ben Rich , working with PR firms and developers ?
Does the public have a right to know ?
Should a newspaper grant secrecy to someone who buys an ad under a false , assumed name ?
Are " anonymice " who support destruction of wetlands , wildlife and scenic beauty privileged characters ?
Is investigative reporting supposed to back off when a malefactor of great wealth uses a blog to spread propaganda ?
What do you reckon ?
With kindest regards ,

No one questions that developers are behind www.localsafety.org
Ed Slavin
www.cleanupcityofstaugustine.blogspot.com
The web site at LocalSafety.org was rudimentary .
I do n't know what the ad in the paper cost , but all other expenses had to be minor .
If this was a calculated PR campaign by some entity , it was n't a very sophisticated one .
Just because it does n't look sophisticated , does n't mean that the developers are n't behind it .
No one ever accused Northeast Florida developers of being suave and sophisticated .
They vote pre-Cambrian and act Neanderthal , electing candidates like ex-Commissioners Marc Jacalone ( defeated by Ben Rich in the 2004 Republican Primary ) and ex-Commissioners Karen Stern and Bruce Maguire ( defeated by Ron Sanchez and Tom Manuel in the 2006 Republican Primary ) .
The closest clear - cutting , wetland - destroying , wildlife - killing overdevelopers have to " sophisticated " is their lawyer , George McClure , who 's very intelligent , but far more oleaginous than sophisticated .
Your typical Northeast Florida developer mouthpiece is more like someone out of a Karl Hiassen or Patricia Behnke novel than someone from a New York PR firm .
Look at the people they hire here locally ( one with a radio show that unsuccessfully touted developer candidates last year ) .
They 're actually about as sharp as a mashed potato sandwich with the crust cut off .
Likewise , Karl Rove 's attacks on the late Texas Governor Ann Richards were n't very " sophisticated " either , but they worked .
In 1994 , Karl Rove allegedly had lugubrious goobers make phone calls in East Texas calling Richards a Lesbian .
PR firms and flaks have been known to use " Astroturf " groups to simulate grassroots citizen concerns .
There are multiple floors of recent college and law school graduates in Washington , D.C. , calling citizens to whip up letters to Senators and Congressmen .
Whether they 're auto dealers or farmers or whatever , they 're coached on what to say .
Does anyone doubt that foreign - funded landrapers are Machiavellian ?
Does anyone doubt that localsafety.org is Astroturf ?
Does anyone question that there 's waste in local law enforcement , starting with multiple non-working helicopters and deputies who get to drive their sheriff 's cars while off - duty ?
Does anyone believe that two fire trucks at an ATM machine at A1A & 312 is a good use of tax dollars ?
Does anyone believe that law enforcement spending should be off - limits to public debate ?
With kindest regards ,

Ed Slavin is right , as usual .
The localsafety.org site is purely an electioneering machination supported by the pro-development community hiding behind the local firefighters .
Only problem is the firefighters seem to have left the fight .
If Lee Padgett is so concerned about his right to free speech , why is he not concerned about his right to vote ?
He 's not registered in St. Johns County and has never voted in any county election .
Supervisor of Elections Penny Halyburton made it very clear when she said that the web site , in its original format , violated political advertisment rules because of its anonymous attacks against one particular candidate .
In addition , the Record only ran that surveillance tape after running an editorial advocating Ben Rich 's resignation and infuriating the community .
My beef with fire engines being away from the fire house on other then emrgency runs is that we as taxpayers and residents of St. Johns county is that someone spent a lot of money to centralize the firehoses for the best coverage of emergencies .
Being away from the engine house ( by 7 miles north , ATM ) could mean the difference between life and death for people in the southern end of A1A .
Plus the extra fuel costs to drive up to Publix for meals .
Funny is as funny does
Nov 8 , 2007 7:00 PM -- the St Augustine Yacht club--
I really was n't paying attention until awaken by a diatribe from the State Committeewoman informing the attendees that she would not take on particular task .
I 'd missed the main message but in part it was about summarizing the information contained in the McCain - Feingold law and how it affected the REC ( Republican Executive Committee ) .
Because of the sideways glances that were going around the room , it was apparent that the harangue was offending .
Although fun to watch , the State Committeewoman was only the preview .
The main show was Chairman Kira .
In a prepared statement the attendees were treated to a heart rending edition of " No Body Likes Me , Every body Hates Me , Think I 'll Eat Some Worms " , Included in the program was an indictment of unnamed persons who attended a football game instead of a belatedly and badly scheduled political event .
The sketch ended with a childlike ultimatum which I call the " if you wo n't play my way I 'll take my ball and go home " threat .
The room was divided .
Those who where afraid that they would have to take the Chairman 's job , ( made visible by fawning and accolades in an attempt to get the Kira resignation retracted ) and persons with a genuine attachment to the personality of Kira forming one faction .
The other formed by those who recognized the power play and did n't like it .
It seemed to this observer that there is a lot of room for improvement in the Republican Executive Committee in St Johns Co. Kira seems to want a top down structure with a " party headquarters " .
His detractors say there 's no money or man power to staff it and it will end up being a " private office " for Kira .
Kira says it should be in the population center and already has a place picked out near SR210 .
All and all it's a big deal to Kira and he will resign if he does n't get it .
I'm a registered Republican Party voter and I say " let him go " .

Mr. Cadenhead :
I have posted a link to this article on the local discussion forum at - http://plazabum.com
My comments are simply to warn voters about the type of people that were behind this assault on my identity .
Thank you .
Assault on his identity ?
What is that supposed to mean ?
Like the " anonymice " who formerly abused dissenters on the now - defunct St. Augustine Record website , Talk of the Town , he expects to trash good people and be undetected and unquestioned about it .
Sounds like the KKK with hoods and robes to me .
I would not think that LocalSafety.org or it 's content would even qualify as a blog .
Simply not newsworthy or blog worthy .
I am surprised it was given a second thought .
- OT
Can the com .
that is accused of taking a bribe get a fair trial in st johns co .
This is not a free speech issue .
Lee Padgett ( he created the fake name ) is hooked up some how with the Firefighters Union .
He is also from the plazabum.com site .
This plazabum.com site is a bunch of terrorists .
I have no respect for people that post only to destroy others lives while wanting no accountability .
They are a Political Action Committee that uses the site to sway public opinion .
They create hate using deception .
The plazabum.com is a site that needs to be held accountable
PlazaBum is a message board for locals to discuss issues involving the community .
The suggestions that it 's either a PAC or a " bunch of terrorists " are the funniest thing I 've read in a while .
This weblog is a message board too .
Are you a terrorist for expressing your opinion here without using your name to be accountable ?
1. " Funniest thing " you 've " read in a while ? "
2 . That suggests that you 're laughing at Plazabum 's victims , instead of decrying Plazabum 's negative effect on our community .
3 . Any potential tourist or investor reading Plazabum would get the false impression St. Augustine is one big 'ole homeless camp , and that anyone who ever criticizes dysfunctional , corrupt local governments is crazy .
Plazabummers perform the same terrorizing functions that the KKK performed in St. Augustine in 1964 .
The " terrorist " analogy is spot on when you consider how they state their intent to drive people out of town and ruin their livelihoods .
4 . You seem to put more credence in Plazabum bigots than their victims .
Why ?
5 . Are you personally acquainted with any of the Plazabummers , or just reflexively defending their First Amendment rights in the abstract ?
I consider myself a First Amendment absolutist , but I do n't defend Plazabummers ' abusiveness , hatred , invective and inventions .
6. Plazabum is a discredited forum for right - wing Republican City of St. Augustine , St. Johns County and other government officials and for unenlightened local businessmen .
Call them " the anonymice . "
7 , Some of the Plazabummers have time on their hands .
Others are backshooting cowards in the spirit of Senator Bilbo -- uninformed bigots who chauvinistically defend St. Augustine City Manager WILLIAM B. HARRISS and all his works and pomps .
8. Cui bono ?
( Who benefits ? )
9 . Notice how whenever our City of St. Augustine is caught committing environmental racism and illegal dumping , anonyous Plazabummers are full of disinformation , defending the indefensible , making threats of bodily harm and blacklisting .
10 .
Who among us can defend putting 40,000 cubic yards of solid waste in the Old City Reservoir ( resulting in fines and a consent order ) ?
Plazabummers have regularly sewn hatred against me for reporting the City .
11 , Who among us can defend five years of a leaking sieve of a " pipe " putting treated freshwater sewage effluent in our freshwater marsh ( resulting in fines and a consent order ) ?
12 . What else do the Plazabum posts involve ?
Bigoted , obscene , sexist , racist , homophobic , unscholarly libelous , slanderous , anti-reform and anti-progressive postings , full of ad hominems , non sequiturs and vile , vicious personal attacks .
13 . Plazabum is not part of the " reality - based community . "
14 . Who founded Plazabum ?
15 . Plazabum was founded by a right - wing fringe group that includes Republican apparatchik MICHAEL GOLD , the former campaign manager for SHERIFF DAVID SHOAR .
16 . Why was Plazabum founded ?
17 .
For the express purpose of driving ho9meless people out of St. Augustine , later adding other hateful agendas .
See MICHAEL GOLD 's December 23 , 2006 St. Augustine Record column , announcing the creation of Plazabum , referring to homeless people in hateful pejoratives .
18 . Plazabummers are uncouth , unkind and a disgrace to our city .
19 .
Calling the delusional Plazabummers " terrorists " is damning with faint praise .
20 . Plazabummers act like anti-literate energumen -- the KKK on steroids , hiding behind anonymity the way KKK hid behind hoods and robes .
21 , Apparently , these are some of the very same people who harassed artists and entertainers on St. George Street and published 32 pages of anti-Gay hatred on the St. Augustine Record " Talk of the Town " website in connection with the Rainbow Flags on the Bridge of Lions ) .
After I questioned their bigotry in 2006 , three ( 3 ) of the 32 pages were deleted , apparently by City and County employees who wrongfully sought to influence our City of St. Augustine , hiding behind anonymity .
This TOTT - induced orgy of bigotry resulted in a First Amendment violation by the City of St. Augustine on May 23 , 2006 .
This vote forced our St. Augustine Pride Committee to go to Federal Court to vindicate the First Amendment rightsw our City of St. Augustine violated .
United States District Judge Henry Lee Adams , Jr. ruled that the City of St. Augustine violated the First Amendment ( once again ) , ordering Rainbow Flags to fly on our historic Bridge of Lions June 8 - 13 , 2005 .
I agree with Jacksonville Business Journal reporter Mary Moewe , who eloquently said on WJCT 's " Jacksonville Week in Review " that the Rainbow flags were beautiful .
The soreheads on TOTT and Plazabum hate First Amendment protected activity when it is by anyone progressive who stands up for their rights .
Their hiding behind the First Amendment is , at best facetious when you read their violent threats and expressed desire to run people out of town ( as they did here in 1964 ) .
22 . What 's really sad is that some City officials pretend like Plazabum ( and TOTT ) are vox populi , rather than vox rex ( playing Cato the Censor or Charlie McCarthy to controversial City Manager - for - Life WILLIAM B. HARRISS ' Edgar Bergen ) .
23 . So , my dear misunderstood Plazabummers , is n't it long past time they " come out " and identfy yourselves ?
What are the Plazaummers ashamed of ?
The fact they 're writing this rancid , racist , sexist , misogynist , homophobic , libellous , slanderous , stuff from government computers while working people pay their fat salaries ?
24 .
My religious tradition teaches forgiveness , even of the intentional tortfeasors on Plazabum .
Confession is good for the soul .
So , anonymous Plazabummers ( other than the ones we 've already identified on www.cleanupcityofstaugustine.blogspot.com): who are you and what qualifies you to sit in judgment of people who care deeokt about our community and want to see it improved ?
25 . Does being a City or County employee ( or no - bid contractor or no-account relative ) carry any responsibility ?
Or do y'all suppose that makes you Republican lords of all you survey ?
Does being WILLIAM B. HARRISS ( or his heyboys or their family members ) mean never having to say you 're sorry ?
Speak !
Oops .
It was May 23 , 2005 that the City of St. Augustine violated the First Amendment .
Two weeks later , on June 7 , 2005 the Federal Court issued a TRO , ordering the Rainbow Flags to fly on our historic Bridge of Lions , commemorating GLBT history in St. Augustine .
As reporter Mary Moewe said on WJCT , it was indeed a beautiful sight .
Too bad the tawdry ToTTers could only emit pages of anti-Gay hatred ( then and now under Plazabum ) , as " Lee Padgett " did against me recently on Plazabum .
I wear their scorn as a badge of honor .
" We shall overcome " ( as we sang at St. Paul 's A.M.E. Church on January 10 , 2008 , after cross-examining City and State officials and exposing their environmental racism and their illegal plans to bring contaminated solid waste back to the historic African - American community of Lincolnville .
The First Amendment , in its majesty , protects their right to be wrong .
Just do n't mistake fascists for freedom fighters or uncivil government civil rights violators as innocent civilians -- they 're more like jihaadist " enemy combatants " in a war against " liberty and justice for all . "
When people care deeply about their community and try to make it better , Plazabummers mock and trivialize their concerns and make harassing comments about them .
Plazabum is dominated by hierarchical , authoritarian bullies and unconscionable energumen .
Plazabum apparently includes managers and minions of the City of St. Augustine , St. Augustine Police , St. Johns County and other governments .
Their terroristic threatening actions may violate federal criminal laws .
See 18 U.S.C. 241 , 243 , 1505,1512 & 1513 ( civil rights violations and obstruction of justice ) , as they expressly vow to retaliate against persons engaged in First Amendment protected activity in reporting environmental wrongdoing and illegal campaign contributions to federal and state authorities .
The whole world is watching , thanks to the Internet on which these rude rubes post their puerile pubescent posturings -- call them " nattering nabobs of negativism , " if you will ( with appreciation to Wm. Safire and Spiro T. Agnew ) .
Are you personally acquainted with any of the Plazabummers , or just reflexively defending their First Amendment rights in the abstract ?
I 'm a person who reads PlazaBum once in a while and the publisher of the Drudge Retort , a site where thousands of people share their opinions on politics .
So I 'm familiar with the dynamic of message boards .
I do n't know if any of the accusations you 're making about PlazaBum are factual , but I think they 're best addressed by either posting messages there ( if they allow it ) or starting your own online community .
The intarweb 's a big place .
If PlazaBum was bad for St. Augustine , as you claim , a better community ought to find an audience .
Mr. Cadenhead
I would be happy to show you the printed material from plazabum.com that supports what is written below .
( 12 . )
This is not a free speech issue it is a cleverly crafted political movement .
They are terrorists by action not only on the message boards but by the follow up on threats in our community .
12 . What else do the Plazabum posts involve ?
Bigoted , obscene , sexist , racist , homophobic , unscholarly libelous , slanderous , anti-reform and anti-progressive postings , full of ad hominems , non sequiturs and vile , vicious personal attacks .
Ellis was correct .
Your " interest " in free - speech did n't include the effort by leftists to use their official governmental positions to " investigate " Joe ( The Plumber ) .
Or , did I miss that article where you decry the effort by your ilk to stiffle the free - speech of an individual , and punish him for doing so ?
You 're the ' journalistic ' equivalent of the one - track - ACLU ; defending the livelyhood of ' Psychics ' , while they ignore the tyranny of the left in using government to destroy individual 's freedom of speech ...
" You all " wo n't be satisfied until there is only one party rule in America , right ?
You 're always correct , politically , right ?
Thank you , Mr. Cadenhead , for Workbench and for graciously admitting you have n't read Plazabum yet .
I 've been reading and posting occasionally on " Workbench " for two about years .
I get the impression that you 're a good person , and that you ( like me ) are a First Amendment absolutist .
Even Justices William O. Douglas and Hugo Black would be troubled by government officials starting an anonymous website for the purpose of harassing the homeless and hounding dissenters .
Plazabummers are government officials and their entourages ( like MICHAEL GOLD ) --
Plazabum is vox rex , not vox populi .
When you read Plazabum 's nasty drivel with an open mind , I reckon you might agree with me that there 's probably no First Amendment protection for government officials ( and their entourages ) abusing the Internet for the purpose of inciting violence , committing obstruction of justice and committing libel , slander , defamation and blacklisting .
Ask yourself when you read their hysterical , lying , obscenities -- so obsequeiously trying vainly to defend our City 's environmental racism and environmental crimes -- " Cui bono ? "
The white - hot , irascible anger that Plazabum and Talk of the Town ( ToTT ) directed against my reporting environmental crimes and defending the First Amendment rights of GLBT people ( the Rainbow flags on our Bridge of Lions ) are consistent with PR wieners defending the indefensible .
City Commissioners have used ToTT and Plazabum NICs .
( NANCY SIKES - KLINE was BULLG8R LADY on ToTT ) .
Their posts were used to create the false impression that " the people " were opposed to the Rainbow Flags on the Bridge of Lions , directly leading to the City 's May 23 , 2005 First Amendment violation ( and June 7 , 2005 Temporary Restraining Order by U.S. District Judge Henry Lee Adams , Jr. , finding the City had violated the First Amendment .
ToTT and Plazabum are First Amendment violators and vilifiers -- read the " anonymice " mockery every time someone speaks out for the rights of others -- obscene , derisive and wrong .
THe fact that Plazabummers are illiterate , impudent , illogical KKK and John Birch Society wannabees makes it all the more unreasonable for anyone to think Plazabum is a community forum .
It 's run by MICHAEL GOLD , CHARLES NUSBAUM , and other cronies of City Manager WILLIAM B. HARRISS and Sheriff DAVID SHOAR , whom HARRISS helped raise a quarter of a million dollars to run for St. Johns County Sheriff in 2004 .
Check out the photos of the Plazabummers and their pal , City Manager WILLIAM B. HARRISS , on www.cleanupcityofstaugustine.blogspot.com
As to your suggestion about posting on Plazabum , I do n't and I wo n't .
I would n't attend a KKK or John Birch Society meeting either .
Let the Plazabum Philistines bay at the moon ( often quoting from www.cleanupcityofstaugustine.blogspot.com, unable to rebut it ) .
I wear their scorn as a badge of honor .
What do they have to offer our community ( other than sniper attacks and jejune , juvenile mockery of persons they never met , including me ( whose own First Amendment struggles on behalf of Tennessee and USDOL environmental , nuclear , federal and trucking whistleblowers they mock ) .
Anyone who'd try to defend the illegal dumping of 40,000 cubic yards of solid waste in the Old City Reservoir and propose moving it back to Lincolnville is beneath contempt .
Anyone who'd try to defend the illegal dumping of sewage effluent in our saltwater marsh while our City Manager kept the public in the dark for some five years is an accompice to environmental crimes and obstruction of justice ( threatening me for making protected reports to the authorities ) .
Anyone who keeps environmental pollution secret is an environmental criminal , like the Union Carbide and Atomic Energy Commission officials who dumped 4.2 million pounds of mercury into Oak Ridge creeks and groundwater and workers ' lungs and brains .
Plazabum 's energies are hatefully focused on hating me , blaring bigotry and defending WILLIAM B. HARRISS ( and the corrupt St. Johns County Republican political machine ) .
It is , at best , facetious to call Plazabum a community forum .
Plazabum is a noisome nuisance , resembling KKK or John Birch Society publications .
What do you reckon ?
Thanks for listening and Happy Thanksgiving to you and Mary .
Cheers ,

What do you reckon ? "
I 'reckon ' that you must be a Democrat / liberal / leftist - otherwise Anon would be calling you " Weeping Adelbert " !
No one denies the resemblance between PB and KKK and JBS .
Who among us can say that the PB crew are not fascists , with MICHAEL GOLD signalling his ideology in his hateful December 23 , 2006 St. Augustine Record column .
Read it .
PB is no community forum .
It 's an online hate site gathering of paranoids and local government officials , not necessarily in that order .
They 're wrong on race , wrong on pollution and a bunch of barnacles on the underbelly of the ship of life .
Now there 's another racist , sexist , misogynist , homophobic , anti-Gay fascistic local hate site , www.disgracefulpeople.com
The successors to KKK and the John Birch Society are at Plazabum.com and disgracefulpeople.com and they are controlled by ( among others ) one MICHAEL GOLD , the bundler , bagman and former campaign manager for Sheriff DAVID SHOAR .
ANONYMOUS DISSENT IS PROTECTED SPEECH , BUT ....
The US First Amendment makes it very clear that anonymous criticism and civil dissent is a privileged ( protected ) form of free speech .
Notwithstanding , it is not absolute ; if an anonymous author publishes statements of fact that are deceptive by error ( without malice ) or maliciously deceptive , the veil of anonymity can be pierced and rightly so .
For what it is worth , the team i work with have a demonstrated track record of positively identifying anonymous blog and forum posters of malicious internet libel .
However , we are not interested in cases unless the client can reasonably demonstrate that the postings are malicious and untrue .
The suggestion of cart blanche and absolute protection of all anonymous speech under the guise of " net neutrality " , justified , malicious or otherwise is absurd .
It is reasonably presumed that proponents of such notions have never experienced the financial and emotional debilitation of these vicious assaults .
The recent advent of anonymous online character defamation mediums compound the victims ' carnage exponentially due to the enduring nature of the postings , instant availability through search engines , and the viral republication thereof .
Notwithstanding the cowardly minority above , given the compelling First Amendment interest at stake when an anonymous blogger 's anonymity is threatened by a subpoena , the Constitution demands a stringent standard .
Advocates suggest that a minimum the determination whether the court will permit discovery of confidential identifying information from a third - party is comprised of the following elements :
(1) The plaintiff must first establish a significant likelihood of success on the merits of her defamation claim ;
(2) The plaintiff must establish that a balance of hardships tips in the plaintiff 's favor ; and
(3) The plaintiff must establish that the subpoena is the least intrusive alternative available .
These factors , while mindful of the right to recover for legitimate defamation claims , ensure that a plaintiff will not be able to compel an ISP to disclose confidential identifying information when disclosure is neither necessary nor fair to a defendant who has not committed anonymous online defamation of character .
In the abstract , the situation is more like the " free speech " exercised in a theatre , and with the owner potentially more damaged by shouts of " fire , " than would any individual under " attack . "
Having said that , attacks on " free speech " conducted by " theatres " on the internet against an individual or other " theatre , " might qualify in the realm of libel .
Of course , political individuals ( those in office , seeking office , or part of the governmental organization ) are " free " targets for any sort of political speech .
However , " public " personalities are certainly not any such " free " target (s ) for political attacks ...
Although there is quite a bit of leeway , stretch , in what constitutes libel in relation to public personalities , such attacks must still be proven to be factual by the defendant - not the plaintiff .
The referenced website conflates that reality with their pre-conditions to the plaintiff 's ability to proceed - that the plaintiff must show the facts ; not as the courts demands of the defendant .
It " means " the same thing in that always convoluted " reality " of the legal practice ...
Since the internet is a public forum , " anonymity " is an illusion in almost every sense .
It is best to be libeled for yourself , rather than some illusion of being an unknown commentator , and one that can be " seen " in every way except visually ; an then that is n't even assured with the neo - big - brother outfit in - charge .
Indeed , they 're already set - up with Limbaugh in their " political " sites ...
Next , they 'll demand that Limbaugh be " water - boarded " for the public safety of Democrat socialism , and anyone who dares repeat his evil " free speech " in the public " theatre . "
Goosestepping is already apparent on the leftish sites .
Waterboarding LIMBAUGH ?
Good one !
Since LIMBAUGH says waterboarding is n't torture , does he want to make it a sacrament ?
Listening to LIMBAUGH is a synecdoche for torture .
I fell in love with St. Augustine years ago and now that I have witnessed the absolute bigotry and seen all the disgusting , racist , redneck pigs that exist here , I have made it a point to never move back .
The PB morons need to take a good look in the mirror .
Nothing attractive or intelligent about a hateful person with no other agenda than to destroy others lives and lie .
I pray these people are all outed and face the extreme humiliation of being revealed as the horrible , racist , sexist , and all around anti-human people they are !
Wait for it St. Augustine - it will be fun to watch the " high and mighty " fall !!

My first encounter with a blogger was a miserable experience .
He reported stuff on his blog about The Record that was wrong and then urged bloggers across the country to write me to complain .
Many of them did , even though most of them had never heard of the St. Augustine Record .
Thirty - seven years as a " journalist " and you never encountered a blogger until March 8 , 2007 ?
Rogers Cadenhead , an author and web publisher wrote :
I do n't know Padgett , but he has the right to speak his mind on the web without intimidation by politicians and the press , whether or not he 's writing under his real name .
I 've been reading the Record for a decade .
I can't recall a single time where it conducted an effort to catch a rapist , robber or murderer anywhere near the scope of this manhunt for a blogger .
So if Cadenhead was wrong when he wrote ...
Allegations made by blogger Lee Padgett , as he 's identified in the site 's whois record and messages on the paper 's message board , are backed up by the Record : Rich really did make the " shoot the cop " remark and disparage firefighters , drawing an angry response .
This week , Rich filed for re-election early , hoping it would cause the site to be judged an excessive campaign contribution by local election officials and shut down .
Was The Record wrong when they sold the $ 1,700 ad ?
Peter Ellis wrote :
That left a bad taste in my mouth about bloggers .
Since then , I 've read quite a few blogs and , with some delightful exceptions , most are awful .
Would your advertisers think Cadenhead " awful " -- if you could get people to respond to their Record ads the way that Cadenhead got bloggers across the country to respond to his blog ?
Peter Ellis wrote :
So I enter the world of blogging gently , knowing that many who have gone before me have failed .
Do n't try to blame your failures on other people .
Your lack of experience with current technology is your own fault .
You had a choice - you made a poor one .
Peter Ellis wrote :
What I will talk about is journalism at The Record .
I hope you 'll join me in the conversation .
You should have completed that statement by saying " I hope you 'll join me in the conversation so long as you 're willing to subject yourself to a Gestapo - like manhunt if you speak your mind . "

Are they also preparing to file bankruptcy ?
Thank you .

Mob takes over Digg – Riot ensues !
Chaos , that ’s the only word that can describe what ’s going on over at Digg right now .
Apparently , someone put up a story that contained the HD - DVD AACS Processing Key and not only was the story deleted , but the user was banned .
This has caused the biggest uproar that I ’ve ever seen on a site such as Digg .
It seems that many users are digging anything that contains the magic number in it , and burying everything else that comes along .
This way every story for pages and pages contains the hack .
The big thing to note is that it ’s not a riot about the hack , it ’s a riot about censorship .
The site was built on the idea that the users picked the stories , and as long as there ’s no foul play to hit the front page , they ’re left alone .
But when Digg decides to start censoring what stories it will allow , then they are destroying everything that they stand for .
I ’m sure that many users out there are wondering just how far the censoring will go .
Could we see the beginning of a Digg that hand - picks the front page stories , taking away the power from the users entirely ?
I certainly hope not .
My question is whether or not Digg will recover from this .
I can guarantee that they have lost a large number of users over this incident .
It is possible that this was caused by one guy who thought he was doing his job , but even if that is the case , I ’m not sure that a personal apology from Kevin Rose himself will ever make Digg the same again .
Update : Users have confirmed that they are unable to submit new stories to Digg .
They appear to go through saying the usual “ Success !
Your story has been submitted . ”
However , the stories do n’t show up .
This does n’t look good .
Second update : Other users are confirming that they can in fact submit stories .
Could this just be a sign of the almighty Digg crumbling ?
Toyota 's announced today they 've one - upped Chevy 's little Sequel with their own FCHV ( Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicle ) .
If you remember , the Chevy Sequel took a 300 - mile one - way drive across the state of New York to become the first fuel cell vehicle to go more than 300 miles in one fill - up .
Toyota 's FCHV team decided they could beat that and they have — the team just finished a 348 - mile one - way drive from from Osaka to Tokyo on a single fill - up of hydrogen .
The road test — part of ToMoCo 's FCHV public - road test program — started in central Osaka City and finished up at the Mega Web auto - themed amusement park in Tokyo's waterfront area , covering approximately 348 miles .
But not only was the fuel cell hybrid minivan - UV able to make it the full distance , it was even able to do it with the air conditioner on — the entire way .
Beat that — umm — every vehicle on the market .
Full press release after the jump .
TOYOTA FCHV Makes Osaka - Tokyo Trip Without Refueling — Initial Hydrogen Fill - up Enough for 560 - kilometer Journey — Tokyo — TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION ( TMC ) announced that an improved version of its TOYOTA FCHV fuel cell hybrid vehicle successfully completed a long - distance road test today by traveling from Osaka to Tokyo on a single fueling of hydrogen .
Today 's road test — part of the TOYOTA FCHV 's public - road test program — started in front of the Osaka Prefectural Government Office in central Osaka City and , via the Meishin Expressway , Tomei Expressway and Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway , concluded at the Mega Web automobile - themed amusement facility in Tokyo's waterfront area , covering approximately 560 kilometers .
The entire trip was completed with the air conditioner on and with no need to stop for refueling .
The TOYOTA FCHV used in the trip is 25 % more fuel efficient than earlier versions , due to improvements in the TMC - developed , high - performance Toyota FC Stack fuel cell and to improvements in the control system for managing fuel cell output and battery charging / discharging .
It also features TMC - developed 70 M pa high - pressure hydrogen tanks capable of storing approximately twice the amount of hydrogen as the TOYOTA FCHV 's previous 35 M pa high - pressure hydrogen tanks .
These improvements make it possible to achieve a single - fueling cruising distance of approximately 750 km ( in the 10 - 15 Japanese test cycle , as calculated by TMC ) .
In addition to issues related to cost and hydrogen storage methods , as well as other technical matters , the supply infrastructure and other issues of broad societal importance also need to be considered .
TMC is actively working toward making fuel cell vehicles widespread by cooperating with the Japanese government , energy companies and other concerned entities .
Against this backdrop , TMC is making steady progress in research and development related to , among others , cruising distance , low - temperature starts , durability and reduced costs .

A person can be guilty of deceit when he lies to a machine rather than a human , a judge has ruled .
Renault sued over abuse of a discount scheme and won the deception - by - computer argument .
But its case was thrown out because it profited from the abuse .
A company called Fleetpro Technical Services ran an affinity scheme with Renault UK , which entitled members of the British Airline Pilots Association ( BALPA ) and their immediate families to discounts on new Renault cars .
Fleetpro took orders that were then entered into Renault 's computer system .
Renault S A , the French parent company , then built each car to order .
The deception
Over a 10 month period , Fleetpro placed 217 vehicles through the scheme .
But only three of these orders came from eligible members of the scheme .
The other 214 vehicles were bought at a discount to which the buyer should not have been entitled .
It transpired that the sole director and employee of Fleetpro , Russell Thoms , had been running a website that passed on the discounts to other internet brokers who resold the cars to members of the public .
Renault sued Fleetpro and Thoms , citing losses of almost £ 700,000 .
The evidence showed that when Thoms took orders via his site , he sent them by email to a Renault fleet sales executive citing the code BALPA or the number 46172 , thereby representing that the order was destined for a qualifying customer .
The executive printed the emails and his assistant entered them into the computer system of Renault UK .
That action ordered the car from Renault UK 's parent company in France and recorded the order as a beneficiary of the discount scheme .
According to the judgment , the assistant 's was " the last human brain in contact with the claim that a particular order fell within the terms of the discount scheme " .
A fraudulent misrepresentation can be made to a machine
" The point of principle which thus arises is whether it is possible in law to find a person liable in deceit if the fraudulent misrepresentation alleged was made not to a human being , but to a machine , " wrote judge Richard Seymour QC .
" I see no objection in principle to holding that a fraudulent misrepresentation can be made to a machine acting on behalf of the claimant , rather than to an individual , if the machine is set up to process certain information in a particular way in which it would not process information about the material transaction if the correct information were given , " he continued .
" For the purposes of the present action , as it seems to me , a misrepresentation was made to the Importer [ Renault UK ] when the Importer ’s computer was told that it should process a particular transaction as one to which the discounts for which the [ pilots ' affinity scheme ] provided applied , when that was not in fact correct .

Sharon Stone caused an uproar when she left her adopted son Roan sleeping in
her car while she dined late with a mystery man at exclusive London restaurant
The Ivy on June 19 .
The 47 - year - old Hollywood actress left her four - year - old in the care of her
chauffeur , but the sweltering 33 degrees Celsius heat and constant camera
flashes raised even the surrounding paparazzi ’s concerns for the sleeping
child , reports Britain ’s Daily Mail newspaper .
And her careless actions are particularly outrageous as Stone is preparing
for a legal wrangle with former husband Phil Bronstein for custody of Roan .
One photographer says , “ I was stunned when I saw she had left her son
sleeping in the car .
Why on earth would she do that when she has a house a couple of miles away .
“ It was a hot night and he could have been traumatized by the camera flashes
going off . ”
