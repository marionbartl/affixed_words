WHEN Tom Glavine , a star pitcher for the New York Mets , earned his milestone 300th victory on a hot and humid night last month , he had a secret weapon .
It was not illegal .
It was so safe a baby could use it .
In fact , many babies do .
Between innings , Mr. Glavine sipped Pedialyte , a liquid sold alongside diapers in drugstores that is meant to quickly rehydrate toddlers experiencing diarrhea .
The neon - tinted fluid that comes in grape and other child - friendly flavors contains electrolytes such as sodium , potassium and glucose , which happen to be the basic ingredients in most sports drinks .
Without an iota of marketing effort from Abbott Laboratories , the maker of Pedialyte , the over - the - counter remedy with a teddy bear on its label has developed a small and devoted following among professional and amateur athletes , a trend that long - distance runners seem to have started sometime in the 1980s .
Athletes are always looking for an edge , even the macho ones who would rather be seen off the field with a Cadillac Escalade than with a teddy bear .
But despite that cuddly label , Pedialyte continues to pop up in locker rooms .
Remember this video and story I helped break called " The Trophy video , " which was posted back in '05 ?
Paul Bremer and the US Gov't have created a juggernaut of --- civilian -- mercenary squads with ties to the Christian Right .
( Blackwater was founded by an extreme right - wing fundamentalist Christian mega - millionaire ex - Navy Seal named Erik Prince )
Remind you of any other groups in Iraq ?

A “ trophy ” video appearing to show security guards in Baghdad randomly shooting Iraqi civilians has sparked two investigations after it was posted on the Internet , the Sunday Telegraph can reveal .
The video , which first appeared on a website that has been linked unofficially to Aegis Defence Services , contained four separate clips , in which security guards open fire with automatic rifles at civilian cars .
All of the shooting incidents apparently took place on “ route Irish ” , a road that links the airport to Baghdad
Here 's another sordid story I broke called : Another Civilian Contractor was under investigation for Homicide in ‘ 04 .
Read the pdf here ...
And if you do n't think the lawlessness these contractor 's have been granted are unknown to the Iraqi people , guess again .
Paul Bremer is responsible for many of the problems in Iraq after Bush gave him the power to run things there and Order 17 stands out today after the Iraqis gave the boot to Blackwater today .
Washington Post :
The Bush administration has decided to take the unusual step of bestowing on its own troops and personnel immunity from prosecution by Iraqi courts for killing Iraqis or destroying local property after the occupation ends and political power is transferred to an interim Iraqi government , U.S. officials said .
Men and women may continue to argue about who are the best drivers , but one area where there is a clear gulf between them is the type of bumps and crashes they have in their cars .
Online car insurance specialist elephant .co.uk studied data from 270,000 claims and found that men are 42 % more likely than women to be involved in a head - on collision and 36 % more likely to hit a pedestrian on a pavement while women are 55 % more likely than men to have an accident in a car park and 47 % more likely to have an accident at traffic lights .
elephant .co.uk wanted to see if there was a difference between how men and women crash .
It soon became clear that there was ; women tend to be in more accidents at slower speeds , where cars are close together , while men have more high - speed accidents where it is easy to lose control .
That s because generally men drive faster and more aggressively than women !
Other differences when it comes to claims were that women are 78 % more likely to lose their keys , 23 % more likely to have something stolen from their car but men are 52 % more likely to suffer flood damage and 42 % more likely to have their car stolen .
Flood damage ?
Yes apparently men are more likely to drive into water thinking theyll come sailing out the other side than women !
Deo Gracias !

When someone asks you what you do for a living , how do you respond ?
I ’m not asking for your job title .
I ’m asking how do you act when you tell someone your job title ?
Do you respond with eagerness and pride , or with reluctance and shame ?
The way you act in response to this common inquiry makes it easy to tell if your career is right for you .
I recently remembered a bit of advice I received from someone years ago , during one of my routine stops as a computer professional .
My boss , intent on making friends with his new neighbor , sent me to this gentleman ’s house to resolve a personal computer problem .
Though do n’t remember his name or what I did for him , I vividly remember how I left this man ’s home that day having learned an important life lesson .
I say this because during my visit , we talked about my life .
After exhausting the subjects of school , work , and religion , he asked me if I had a girlfriend .
Apparently I shot him a huge smile before saying “ Yes . ”
The next thing he said was unforgettable : “ I think you must be in love , ’ cause that ’s the first time you smiled since you walked through my door . ”
It ’s true .
My girlfriend made me so happy that even the slightest thought about her caused me to start grinning uncontrollably .
I was clearly in love with her .
Why is this relevant ?
Because my job never made me smile .
I was in that line of work for the wrong reasons and it was n’t until recently that I understood the significance of what he told me : I was n’t in love with my job .
It was a job I was working so I ’d have something impressive to say when someone asked me what I did for a living .
It was a job I was working to make my parents proud .
It was a job I was working to pay the bills .
That was over three years ago .
Since then , I ’ve left the computer industry to pursue my dream career as a writer .
Though there are times when it ’s hard to tell if my new career is “ right ” for me , there are other times when the answer is crystal clear :
A few minutes into my trim at the local barber shop , the barber asked “ So what do you do for a living ? ”
Consequently , the most overwhelming deja vu of my life came over me as I began to grin uncontrollably .
“ I ’m a writer , ” I explained through my expression .
“ Oh really ?
Do you like it ? ”
With an abundance of certainty , I said — “ I love it . ”
And at that moment , I understood my career is right for me because I am in love with my career .
Should n’t everyone be ?

Antiabortion activists in several states are promoting constitutional amendments that would define life as beginning at conception , which could effectively outlaw all abortions and some birth control methods .
The campaigns to grant “ personhood ” to fertilized eggs , giving them the same legal protections as human beings , come as the nation in January marks the 35th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion .
During those three decades , abortion foes have succeeded in imposing a variety of restrictions , such as waiting periods and parental notification for minors .
But there are still about 1.3 million abortions a year in the U.S .
FOR THE RECORD :
Antiabortion movement :
An article in Friday ’s Section A on proposed ballot initiatives to give legal rights to fertilized eggs incorrectly stated that the contraceptive sponge prevents fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus .
The sponge prevents spermatozoa from fertilizing an egg and would not be at risk of being banned should the initiatives become law . —
Some activists say they are fed up with incremental steps -- and are not interested in waiting years , or possibly decades , for a more conservative court to revisit Roe .
Instead , they are out to change the legal status of embryos in hopes of forcing the Supreme Court to ban abortion .
“ The concept that we ’re going to elect judges who will change everything has failed , ” said Brian Rohrbough , a former president of Colorado Right to Life .
“ The logical thing is to start with personhood .
. . .
It ’s the only legitimate tactic that does not involve a compromise . ”
Ever since abortion was legalized , antiabortion groups have pushed for a federal Human Life Amendment that would define life as beginning at conception .
One of the reasons the court gave for legalizing the procedure is that the fetus is not legally a person .
Abortion opponents think that by granting human status to embryos they will destroy the legal foundation of the right to abortion .
Every year since the decision , members of Congress have introduced a bill to do that , but they never got anywhere .
Now a grass - roots movement is underway at the state level to undermine Roe vs. Wade .
The Colorado Supreme Court last week cleared the way for advocates to begin collecting signatures to place a personhood amendment on the state ’s 2008 ballot .
Activists in Michigan , Mississippi and Montana are gearing up to gather signatures as well .
In January , the Georgia General Assembly will consider placing a constitutional amendment on its 2008 ballot .
The initiatives face several stiff challenges .
For the most part , the campaigns are run by local activists , with little support or funding from big national antiabortion groups .
Similar efforts have failed in the past : Proponents in Michigan could not collect enough signatures to put a personhood measure on the ballot in 2006 .
The Georgia proposal stalled in the Legislature this year .
Any amendments that make it to the ballot will be voted on by a public that has expressed consistent support for allowing at least some abortions , especially during the first trimester , which is when 90 % of U.S. abortions occur .
In South Dakota , a deeply conservative state , voters last year resoundingly rejected a ballot measure that would have outlawed virtually all abortions .
Even if the amendments pass , it could take years of legal challenges before they reach the Supreme Court .
Still , national abortion - rights groups consider the current wave of amendment campaigns a legitimate threat .
They worry that the language of the initiatives might mislead voters .
In Colorado , for instance , voters will be asked whether the constitution should “ include any human being from the moment of fertilization as ‘ person ’ . . . in those provisions of the Colorado Constitution relating to inalienable rights , equality of justice , and due process of law . ”
The amendment is being promoted by a group called Colorado for Equal Rights .
“ This type of language may be scarier than an outright ban , ” said Belinda Bulger , deputy legal director for NARAL Pro-Choice America .
“ First , because it can be hard for people to understand what it ’s doing , and second , because it would be far further reaching . ”
Abortion - rights advocates tried to block the Colorado ballot initiative by claiming the language would confuse voters , but the state Supreme Court ruled 7 - 0 that the initiative was acceptable as written .
The measure ’s proponents must collect 76,000 signatures in the next six months to qualify for the general election ballot .
If successful -- and upheld by the courts -- the amendments could outlaw certain forms of birth control that prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus , such as the birth control pill or contraceptive sponge .
They also could ban or restrict common fertility treatments , such as in vitro , in which multiple eggs are fertilized , but only some are introduced into the mother ’s womb .
Amendment supporters freely admit that giving a fertilized egg the legal status of a human being would affect a wide range of medical decisions .
That ’s precisely the point , they say : “ We ’re trying to establish some bioethical standards to move us into the 21st century , ” said Dan Becker , president of Georgia Right to Life .
Starting in the late 1980s , 10 states amended their constitutions to provide general protections for unborn life .
The U.S. Supreme Court , however , implied in one case that the amendments did not trump its core holding that women have a legal right to end pregnancies .
Even though the current court is the most conservative in decades , it has not reversed Roe .
That ’s one reason several prominent abortion opponents are skeptical of the new round of proposed amendments .
“ Most legal scholars would doubt they have any chance to overturn Roe v. Wade , ” said Clarke Forsythe , president of Americans United for Life .
But smaller , grass - roots group have read legal analyses that lead them to believe the amendments could end abortion , said Cal Zastrow , head of Michigan Citizens for Life , who consults with amendment supporters nationwide .
He said 12 states tried to pass versions of the amendment during the 2006 - 07 legislative session .
None were successful .
“ In every election cycle there are more and more people attempting something , ” he said .
“ It ’s really growing . ”
Antiabortion activists hold out the most hope in Georgia , where the amendment has the backing of some legislative leaders .
They ’re also optimistic in Colorado , where the campaign to collect signatures kicked off last week with a rally headlined by Alan Keyes , a Republican presidential candidate .
“ It ’s not just Bible - thumping kooks or some Roman Catholic nuns ” supporting the measure , Zastrow said .
“ There are a lot of moms and pops that are pro-life who are going to say , ‘ Why have n’t we done something in our state ? ’ ”
Kristi Burton , a spokeswoman for the group promoting Colorado ’s initiative , said the organization hoped to mobilize voters through church networks .
The strategy worked last year in Colorado for a ballot measure banning same - sex marriage .
In promoting the personhood amendment , Burton said her group would aim to present a positive , affirming message : “ We ’re not banning abortion .
We ’re defining life . ”
Her opponents are also honing their sound bites for a future campaign :
“ What is the potential impact on our court system of every fertilized egg having access to Colorado ’s court ? ” asked Toni Panetta , deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado .
Colorado is difficult territory for abortion foes .
In 1967 it became the first state to legalize abortion in certain cases , permitting the procedure in cases of rape , incest or for the health of the mother .
“ Colorado opened this evil door , ” Rohrbough said , “ and there are many in Colorado who would like to close it . ”
To Rohrbough , the initiative has additional import .
A lifelong opponent of abortion , he took up the cause publicly after his son , Daniel , was killed in the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado .
“ The environment that happened at Columbine was created by a culture of death , ” he said .
Proponents of the initiatives say their campaign has a political value as well .
Becker , the Georgia Right to Life president , said it could energize dispirited conservatives during the 2008 presidential election .
“ It ’ll draw a lot of conservatives to the polls , ” he said , “ in an otherwise lackluster presidential year . ”

A company called Premier International Associates has filed suit against a slew of tech companies over infringement on two of the company 's patents .
Microsoft , Verizon , AT&T , Sprint , Dell , Lenovo , Toshiba , Viacom , Real , Napster , Samsung , LG , Motorola , Nokia , and Sandisk are named in one of the two suits filed this week , while Hewlett - Packard , Acer , Gateway , and Yahoo are named in another .
All of the above companies are accused of violating Premier 's patents for an electronic " List building system " — the older of which was applied for in 1997 and issued in 2001 .
The patents describe what essentially comes down to a playlist .
" A plurality of works can be collected together in a list for purposes of establishing a play or a presentation sequence .
The list can be visually displayed and edited , " reads the " 725 " patent .
Both of them describe ways to graphically display an arrangement of songs from CDs or any manner of media that can then be played back sequentially or out - of - order .
Premier 's complaints , seen by Ars Technica , accuse all 19 companies of producing some product that infringes on the playlist patents — usually music stores , music - playing software , or music - playing devices .
The lawsuits make a bit of a stretch in the cases of Dell , Lenovo , Toshiba , HP , Acer , and Gateway — the companies are accused of making computers that are capable of running Windows XP or Windows Vista , which then are capable of running Microsoft 's Windows Media Player , which Premier says infringes on its patents .
But Premier , what about the manufacturing plants that assemble the machines that are capable of running Windows that can run WMP that infringes on the patents ?
Predictably , Premier appears to have no tangible company history other than patent infringement lawsuits and does not produce any sort of product that competes with any of the companies listed .
The company also sued Apple in 2005 over the same two patents , which Premier says have been incorporated into Apple 's implementation of iTunes and the iPod .
Incidentally , Premier filed a motion for dismissal in its case against Apple today , saying that all issues have been resolved and that " the matter has settled in its entirety and all necessary costs and expenses have been paid . "
In both of this week 's cases , Premier has asked for permanent injunctions against the companies to stop them from continuing to infringe on the patents , attorney fees , damages , and trial by jury .
If the reasoning behind the Supreme Court 's ruling on a similar patent infringement suit is applied to these cases , however , Premier wo n't find itself very lucky in having all ( or any ) of its demands met .
On the other hand , if the companies cave and settle out of court , like Apple apparently has , then maybe Premier will ultimately get the moolah it wants anyway .

When Dr Brady Barr decided to dress up as a crocodile , the disguise needed to be good .
Otherwise he was in grave danger of being eaten by the real thing .
The zoologist adopted his bizarre outfit in the hope of getting closer to a colony of Nile crocodiles , which can grow up to 20ft .
His disguise was a prosthetic head attached to the front of a protective metal cage covered with canvas and a generous plastering of hippo dung to mask his human scent .
It was 13ft long - average Nile size .
The head was made of glass fibre , while the frame of the body was aluminium covered with a sheet of Kevlar body armour .
Thus protected , he crawled on his hands and knees up to the fearsome reptiles , close enough to touch them .
The most dramatic moment in a documentary film about Dr Barr comes when he is approaching the largest croc on the riverbank - and mistakenly makes a sudden movement .
It suddenly turns to face him head - to - head .
Dr Barr whispers into his microphone : " Oh , the big one is moving towards me .
He has his eye on me .
I 'm really nervous .
I 've got to back off ! "
But just as he is about to retreat , another moves up behind him .
A sweating Dr Barr whispers to the camera crew : " Now I 'm stuck between two giant crocs .
How close is the one behind me ? "
Back comes the answer : " Next to your right leg . "
" So it 's unsafe for me to get up and move , right ? "
" I would say so ! "
Dr Barr , 44 , claims to be unique in having studied all 23 species of crocodilian - crocodiles , alligators and caymans - in the wild .
For his latest quest , he travelled to Tanzania , where Nile crocodiles lurk in riverbank mud holes during the dry season and crowd on top of each other in burrows .
When a hippo and her calf sniffed inquisitively at him , no doubt attracted by his coating of dung , he stayed as calm as possible .
" That could have been a very dangerous situation , " said Texas - born Dr Barr .
" And that was before I 'd even seen a croc . "
Ultimately he managed to infiltrate the crocodiles ' lair and attach to their tails small hi-tech ' data loggers ' which monitor their activity and give scientists biological information such as the temperatures in their dens .
At least one - third of all crocodile species are endangered , and his extraordinary activities have the aim of bringing worldwide attention to their plight .
" Crawling up to the crocs was n't easy , " he added .
" Worse was scrambling inside their lair .
" Any time you do that , you are asking for trouble .
I am worried that I am getting too old and slow .
I 'm starting to understand that I can't take as many chances as I have in the past . "
• Barr 's documentary launches National Geographic Channel 's new series , Dangerous Encounters , next Monday at 9 pm .
I previously discussed high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates , and mentioned that the detailed mechanism is still controversial .
However , what is widely agreed is that , as originally proposed by P.W. Anderson , a good model for these materials is the Hubbard Model ( see this paper by Anderson for an entertaining and readable argument in favor of this point ) .
And even if one does n’t agree with that statement , the Hubbard Model is of enormous intrinsic interest , as perhaps the simplest model of interacting electrons on a lattice .
Despite its simplicity , physicists have not been able to solve for the behavior of the two or three - dimensional Hubbard model in the “ thermodynamic limit ” ( for lattices with a very large number of sites and electrons ) .
Coming up with a reliable approach to solving the Hubbard model has become a kind of holy grail of condensed matter theory .
Note that this is very different from the situation for the classical ferromagnetic Ising model , for which Onsager solved the two - dimensional version exactly in 1944 but where we do not have an exact solution in three dimensions .
For the three - dimensional Ising model , we may not have an exact solution , but we understand extremely well the qualitative behavior , and can compute quantitative results to practically arbitrary accuracy .
For the Hubbard model , we do not even have know what the qualitative behavior is for two or three dimensional lattices .
I will first describe the model in words , and then show you how to solve for the quantum statistical mechanics of the simplest non-trivial version of the model : the Hubbard model on a lattice with just two sites .
I strongly believe that whenever you want to learn about a new algorithm or theory , you should start by solving , and understanding in detail , the smallest non-trivial version that you can construct .
The Hubbard Model Described With Words
The Hubbard model consists of a lattice of “ sites , ” plus a set of electrons that hop around from site to neighboring site in the lattice .
Each electron has a spin that can point up or down .
A site can accommodate zero , one , or two electrons , but if two electrons are on the same site , they must have opposite spin ( because electrons are fermions , and obey the Pauli exclusion principle ) .
A configuration with two electrons of opposite spin on the same site has an increased energy , because electrons repel each other electrically .
That energy cost is denoted U .
An electron can hop from one site to a neighboring site ; when it does so , its spin does n’t change .
The “ amplitude ” ( in quantum mechanics , you square amplitudes to get probabilities ) for hopping is denoted -t .
It is sometimes useful to add two other refinements to the model .
First we can add a magnetic field h .
If h is positive , it will favor ( i.e. , reduce the energy of ) configurations that have more electrons with spin up .
Second , we can add a chemical potential μ .
If μ is positive , it will increase the energy of configurations that have more electrons .
Quantum Statistical Mechanics
To solve for the statistical mechanics of an ordinary classical system , one weights every possible configuration of the system by a probability given by Boltzmann ’s law :
P[ configuration ] = exp (- E[ configuration ] /T ) / Z ,
where T is the temperature and Z is just a normalization constant ( called the “ partition function . ” )
In quantum statistical mechanics , one does exactly the same thing , except that one needs to solve for all the stationary solutions of the Schroedinger equation , including the energies of those states , and then weight those stationary states using Boltzmann ’s law .
Solving the Two - Site Hubbard Model
I will now show you how to solve for the quantum statistical mechanics of the simplest non-trivial Hubbard model , one with two connected sites .
By the way , the quantum mechanics of the two - site Hubbard model is useful for understanding the binding of molecules like H 2 ( take a look at Feynman ’s Lectures on Physics , vol. III , chapter 10 ) .
There are 16 possible configurations of electrons on two sites : one with no electrons , four with one electron ( an up or down electron on each of the two sites ) , six with two electrons ( one with two up electrons on different sites , one with two down electrons , and four with an up electron and a down electron ) , four with three electrons , and one with four electrons .
Because the electrons are conserved in number and cannot change their spin when they hop , these configurations split up into different unconnected groups , which we can solve separately .
The configuration with no electrons is not connected to any other configuration , and has an energy of zero .
The two configurations with an up electron are connected to each other , as are the two configurations with a single down electron .
Let ’s solve the stationary Schroedinger equation for the single up electron case .
We ’ll write the wave - function in the form |ψ > = a |↑ , o > + b |o , ↑> , where a and b are complex numbers that satisfy the normalization condition that the sum of their squares equals one , and |↑ , o > is the configuration with the up electron on the first site with the second site open , while |o , ↑ > is the other configuration with the up electron on the second site .
In general , the stationary Schroedinger Equation is H|ψ > = E|ψ > , where H is the Hamiltonian , and E is the energy .
In our case , H is just a two - by - two matrix , and we need to solve the eigenvalue equation
which has solutions of
with E=-t , and
with E=t .
Here we already see the characteristic feature of quantum mechanics in the delocalized solutions .
The spin is not definitely at one site or another , it is instead delocalized between them .
There is a symmetric state with an energy of –t and an anti-symmetric state with energy t.
If the system is in either one of these states , you will find that it is at one particular site with probability 1/2 .
Now lets move on to the slightly more complicated computation for the configurations with two electrons .
If they are both pointing up or both pointing down , there is nothing to do : we just have one configuration where they are on different sites with energy 0 .
However , there are four configurations with one up spin and one down spin , and these configurations are connected to each other , so let ’s write the wave - function as
where I hope by now the notation is self - explanatory .
Solving the Schroedinger equation for the configurations with one up and one down electron amounts to solving the eigenvalue equation
.
I wo n’t work through the details of solving this equation in general ; it ’s simply a matter of straightforward mathematics to find the four solutions and their energies .
I will just make one observation , which is that the lowest energy state with one up and one down electron has a lower energy than the states obtained with two electrons of the same spin .
Physically , this occurs because the electrons now have the ability to hop back and forth .
This effect causes an anti-ferromagnetic tendency ( spins on neighboring sites tend to want to point in opposite directions ) .
So one thing that is agreed upon generally by theorists is that the Hubbard model with one electron per site should be an anti-ferromagnet at low enough temperatures .
The states obtained from configurations with three electrons are easy to work out ; they have energies of U -t or U+t , and the state with four electrons has an energy of 2U .
Again , the overall statistical mechanical behavior is obtained by weighting these states with the appropriate Boltzmann factor .
So there are two sources of randomness ; the quantum randomness and then the statistical mechanical randomness layered on top of that .
One important technical point : if you want to work at a particular density of electrons , you need to adjust the chemical potential appropriately .
Hopefully , I have given enough details so that you can at least understand how to set up the computations for the Hubbard Model for a larger lattice .
Of course , if one tries to solve the problem as we did here for larger lattices , one quickly runs into enormous computational problems .
There will be a number of connected configurations which grows exponentially with the number of sites , so that one will need to diagonalize an exponentially large matrix .
Ouch .
So one needs more sophisticated methods .
I ’ll talk about some ideas that I and others have tried in the future .
If you ’re impatient , you can look at the following two papers now ( or look at the references in Anderson ’s paper already mentioned above ) :
Thermodyamics of the Infinite - U Hubbard Model
Onsager Reaction Terms for Quantum Many - Body Systems : Application to Antiferromagnetic and Superconducting Order in the Hubbard Model
Anonymity and the Tor Network
As the name implies , Alcoholics Anonymous meetings are anonymous .
You do n’t have to sign anything , show ID or even reveal your real name .
But the meetings are not private .
Anyone is free to attend .
And anyone is free to recognize you : by your face , by your voice , by the stories you tell .
Anonymity is not the same as privacy .
That ’s obvious and uninteresting , but many of us seem to forget it when we ’re on a computer .
We think “ it ’s secure , ” and forget that secure can mean many different things .
Tor is a free tool that allows people to use the internet anonymously .
Basically , by joining
Tor you join a network of computers around the world that pass internet traffic randomly amongst each other before sending it out to wherever it is going .
Imagine a tight huddle of people passing letters around .
Once in a while a letter leaves the huddle , sent off to some destination .
If you ca n’t see what ’s going on inside the huddle , you ca n’t tell who sent what letter based on watching letters leave the huddle .
I ’ve left out a lot of details , but that ’s basically how Tor works .
It ’s called “ onion routing , ” and it was first developed at the Naval Research Laboratory .
The communications between
Tor nodes are encrypted in a layered protocol — hence the onion analogy — but the traffic that leaves the Tor network is in the clear .
It has to be .
If you want your Tor traffic to be private , you need to encrypt it .
If you want it to be authenticated , you need to sign it as well .
The Tor website even says :
Yes , the guy running the exit node can read the bytes that come in and out there .
Tor anonymizes the origin of your traffic , and it makes sure to encrypt everything inside the Tor network , but it does not magically encrypt all traffic throughout the internet .
Tor anonymizes , nothing more .
Dan Egerstad is a Swedish security researcher ; he ran five Tor nodes .
Last month , he posted a list of 100 e-mail credentials — server IP addresses , e-mail accounts and the corresponding passwords — for
embassies and government ministries around the globe , all obtained by sniffing exit traffic for usernames and passwords of e-mail servers .
The list contains mostly third - world embassies : Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , India , Iran , Mongolia — but there ’s a Japanese embassy on the list , as well as the UK Visa Application Center in Nepal , the Russian Embassy in Sweden , the Office of the Dalai Lama and several Hong Kong Human Rights Groups .
And this is just the tip of the iceberg ; Egerstad sniffed more than 1,000 corporate accounts this way , too .
Scary stuff , indeed .
Presumably , most of these organizations are using Tor to hide their network traffic from their host countries ’ spies .
But because anyone can join the Tor network , Tor users necessarily pass their traffic to organizations they might not trust : various intelligence agencies , hacker groups , criminal organizations and so on .
It ’s simply inconceivable that Egerstad is the first person to do this sort of eavesdropping ; Len Sassaman published a paper on this attack earlier this year .
The price you pay for anonymity is exposing your traffic to shady people .
We do n’t really know whether the Tor users were the accounts ’ legitimate owners , or if they were hackers who had broken into the accounts by other means and were now using Tor to avoid being caught .
But certainly most of these users did n’t realize that anonymity does n’t mean privacy .
The fact that most of the accounts listed by Egerstad were from small nations is no surprise ; that ’s where you ’d expect weaker security practices .
True anonymity is hard .
Just as you could be recognized at an AA meeting , you can be recognized on the internet as well .
There ’s a lot of research on breaking anonymity in general — and Tor specifically — but sometimes it does n’t even take much .
Last year , AOL made 20,000 anonymous search queries public as a research tool .
It was n’t very hard to identify people from the data .
A research project called Dark Web , funded by the National Science Foundation , even tried to identify anonymous writers by their style :
One of the tools developed by Dark Web is a technique called Writeprint , which automatically extracts thousands of multilingual , structural , and semantic features to determine who is creating “ anonymous ” content online .
Writeprint can look at a posting on an online bulletin board , for example , and compare it with writings found elsewhere on the Internet .
By analyzing these certain features , it can determine with more than 95 percent accuracy if the author has produced other content in the past .
And if your name or other identifying information is in just one of those writings , you can be identified .
Like all security tools ,
Tor is used by both good guys and bad guys .
And perversely , the very fact that something is on the Tor network means that someone — for some reason — wants to hide the fact he ’s doing it .
As long as Tor is a magnet for “ interesting ” traffic , Tor will also be a magnet for those who want to eavesdrop on that traffic — especially because more than 90 percent of Tor users do n’t encrypt .

Last week , in an interview with the Albuquerque Tribune , purged U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said , “ I think all roads lead to Rove .
I think that ’s why the president is circling some pretty major wagons around him to keep him from testifying under oath , which subjects him to criminal prosecution . ”
Iglesias appears to be onto something .
Nearly half the U.S. attorneys slated for removal by the administration last year were targets of Republican complaints that they were lax on voter fraud , including efforts by presidential adviser Karl Rove to encourage more prosecutions of election - law violations , according to new documents and interviews .
Of the 12 U.S. attorneys known to have been dismissed or considered for removal last year , five were identified by Rove or other administration officials as working in districts that were trouble spots for voter fraud — Kansas City , Mo. ; Milwaukee ; New Mexico ; Nevada ; and Washington state .
Four of the five prosecutors in those districts were dismissed .
It has been clear for months that the administration ’s eagerness to launch voter - fraud prosecutions played a role in some of the firings , but recent testimony , documents and interviews show the issue was more central than previously known .
The new details include the names of additional prosecutors who were targeted and other districts that were of concern , as well as previously unknown information about the White House ’s role .
Much of this probably seems like old news — we ’ve known for a while that prosecutors who neglected to file trumped up “ voter fraud ” cases got fired — but this WaPo story a ) adds Nevada ’s Daniel Bogden to the mix ; and b ) connects the move to Karl Rove in a new way .
Dan Froomkin explained the big picture very well .
This morning I talked about where the journey to debt elimination started , and how we came to the biggest turning point – budgeting .
This evening I ’ll explore how our adoption of a more consciously frugal lifestyle * before * our economic downturn occurred has helped put us in a position to deal with it without worrying about how our bills will get paid or our basic necessities met .
And also where we want to go from here and what we ’re doing to get there .
And it all hinges on not just living within our means , but knowing exactly what our means are .
Part of what was keeping us from making the most of our money before I started the blog was our spending changing based on how we felt about our situation at any given time .
When things felt tight , we scrimped and spent as little as possible .
But when things felt okay , we ’d loosen up a bit and go out to dinner or buy things we ’d been waiting to buy until “ things got better ” .
We never bounced any checks or overspent our money , but we also did n’t really save any of it either .
When I started this blog I also started working on a budget .
The start was easy .
I listed all our recurring monthly bills and I listed our income .
I was surprised to see how much theoretically was left over after our bills were paid .
And then when I started adding in miscellaneous expenses , groceries , annual expenses , gasoline …
I was surprised to see how * little * was left over .
Since we wanted as much as possible dedicated to debt reduction every month , we eliminated anything we thought we could .
Our budget has , for example :
$ 0 for eating out
$ 0 for entertainment
$ 35 / month for miscellaneous expenses
$ 10 / month for clothing ( generally from yard sales or thrift stores for the kids , who grow continually )
We make all our meals at home ( and my spouse brings lunch to work every day ) and we do things largely for free for entertainment .
We can theoretically take money from the miscellaneous budget for those expenses but it seems other things usually come up for that .
It seems extreme to some , and a bit spartan , and it is in some ways , but we ’re okay with it .
We did take advantage of a vacation opportunity that ultimately paid us , where we did get to eat out a bit and do some fun not - so - free activities .
We switched our cell phones to prepaid plans which we spend less than $ 10 / month each for ( the most inexpensive I could find after a lot of price comparison ) .
We did think about getting rid of the cell phones altogether , but my spouse needs one for work to be able to reach him 24/7 and I travel with my two small children and do n’t want to be stranded on a roadside with them .
But all in all , our lifestyle became much more consciously frugal than it was before budgeting , and left us living about 10 % or more below our means every month ( which has been funneled directly into debt reduction after establishing a $ 1000 emergency fund ) .
The other big change we made was not treating “ found ” or “ extra ” money as “ spendable ” .
I do surveys online to make some extra money , and every penny of that goes to debt reduction ( I used to treat myself to small things with it ) .
I also have some ads on the blog , and that goes to debt reduction as well .
If I am given a cash gift , it goes to debt reduction .
At the end of the month , every penny that we did n’t spend in our budget that is not being carried over for irregular expenses ( like car maintenance ) is paid to debt .
In about 4 months we ’ve eliminated over $ 4000 to the principal of our debt , about half that to the credit card debt .
That may not seem like a lot to some , but in our world ( we ’re in the 15 % tax bracket if that gives you an idea of our income ) it is a lot .
We have a little over $ 4000 in credit card debt left , and we hope to eliminate it before August of 2008 .
Do we save every single penny we possibly could ?
No , of course not .
We have cable TV .
Which , at the moment , is free ( my spouse is required to have cable internet to have access to his work whenever he is needed , he is a computer programmer , and we have a package deal right now that makes the cable TV free until April of next year ) .
When it is n’t free any longer , we ’ll have to reassess that .
We spend more than we could on groceries .
I shop at discount stores like Aldi and buy generic whenever appropriate , but there are a few indulgences like the weekly frozen pizza and the aforementioned diet dew for my spouse at work .
And a semi - weekly batch of cupcakes or muffins for my 3 year old son to help bake .
Sometimes with sprinkles .
What ’s changed though in a very positive direction is we ’re aware of exactly how much money comes in , and how much goes out , and what we do with that .
Budgeting really does work .
And budgeting is what has shown us that even without my irregular income , we will be able to pay all our bills .
When the company I contracted for ceased operations without warning at the end of October , we immediately looked at our budget and figured out exactly how much of that money had been going towards our bills and basic necessities .
And the bulk of it had been going towards debt reduction .
Somewhere between $ 100 - $ 200 a month from July - September had been going towards our budgeted items .
Since my son was switched from his mainstream preschool ( which was a $ 75 / month year round budget item ) to an early childhood special education preschool ( free thanks to the wonders of public education ) in October , that gave us a little more room in our budget as well .
We changed my spouse ’s tax withholding to largely cover the gap , and the blog income for the time being will not exclusively go to debt reduction , and that will cover the gap until I find a new source of income .
Yes , I would love to still have that income and dedicate the bulk of it to debt reduction .
But knowing we have an emergency fund and that we do have what we need to pay our bills is a good feeling , and one I would n’t have had before we started budgeting .
I am actively looking for ways to increase my income , and feel confident that by January I will have succeeded in replacing the income I have lost .
Having the breathing room to be able to set January as a goal and not “ yesterday ” is also thanks to the wonders of budgeting .
So I share all this not to pat myself or my family on the back , for there are lots more little things we could possibly be doing .
I share it to show that it can be done – living below your means is possible , and being prepared for a setback is also possible .
Sometimes it is hard , and sometimes it seems sort of easy .
But it is our adoption of a more consciously frugal lifestyle in the first place that has allowed us to feel like we will get through this setback with our lives largely intact .
Thanks for being a part of our journey and traveling it with us .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve cut the target on a key short - term interest rate by half of a percentage point Tuesday to 4.75 % in a bold acknowledgement that the central bank is concerned the mortgage meltdown plaguing Wall Street and Main Street could hurt the economy .
The Fed also indicated that more rate cuts could be on the way , news that investors cheered .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 200 points immediately following the news of the Fed 's half - point rate cut and wound up finishing the day with a more than 335 point gain .

Stocks surged following the announcement , with the Dow finishing the day up more than 330 points , or 2.5 percent .
The Nasdaq shot up 2.7 percent while the S&P 500 closed nearly 3 percent higher .
Bonds fell , sending the yield on the benchmark 10 - year U.S. Treasury up to 4.5 percent .
( Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions . )
" This took some investors by surprise .
It 's like the Christmas present you really wanted but were n't really expecting , " said Gary Webb , chief executive officer of Webb Financial Group , a Bloomington , Minn . - based independent investment advisory firm with about $ 120 million in assets under management .
The cut to the federal funds rate , the first since June 2003 , was widely anticipated by investors and followed a surprise cut to the Fed 's discount rate on Aug. 17 .
The only question was whether the Fed would lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points or 50 basis points .
( There are 100 basis points in a full percentage point . )
On Tuesday , the Fed also cut its discount rate by another half of a point to 5.25 percent .
The central bank said that the vote to lower both rates was unanimous .
Some investors had thought that Fed chair Ben Bernanke would take a more cautious approach and not cut rates by such a large margin , because a half - point cut could signal the Fed was acting out of desperation to save the economy .
But Alan Skrainka , chief market strategist with Edward Jones in St. Louis , disagreed with that interpretation .
He said Wall Street was cheering the rate cut because it proves the Fed is willing to take any moves necessary to ensure the economy is not derailed by problems in the subprime mortgage market , loans made to consumers with less - than - perfect credit .
" We 're having champagne and cookies , " Skrainka said .
" This is not a magical elixir that solves our subprime problems overnight , but it is a big step in the right direction to keep the economy growing .
The Fed is sending a strong message that it wo n't get behind the curve , " he added .
The federal funds rate , an overnight lending rate that banks charge each other , is important since it influences the amount of interest consumers must pay for various types of debt , such as credit cards , home equity lines of credit and auto loans .
The rate cut should help some beleaguered home borrowers who are set to see monthly payments on adjustable rate mortgages rise later this year .
In its statement , the Fed said that " the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally " and that the rate cut " is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time . "
Chris Probyn , chief economist with State Street Global Advisors in Boston , said that with oil prices rising , consumer confidence sinking and the job market starting to show signs of weakness , the Fed made the right move to reassure investors .
" It was virtually a no - brainer to cut rates .
Why risk destabilizing already fragile markets ?
This was an entirely appropriate response , " Probyn said .
Webb of Webb Financial added that Tuesday 's decision to cut the discount rate , which is what banks pay to borrow directly from the Federal Reserve , for the second time in a month is a sign that the Fed needed to do more to stimulate lending activity by nervous banks .
" The main reason the Fed had to cut both rates was the mortgage situation .
That 's going to keep getting worse but this should lessen the blow and make the market recover sooner , " Webb said .
" It will make cash more available for consumers and banks , good or bad .
People that need money will go out and get it . "
And Probyn said the Fed , if anything , should have cut the discount rate even further so that it would be in line with the federal funds rate .
Although investors applauded the rate cut , another market expert cautioned that this does not mean an end to the credit crunch .
" People should not assume that the economy 's problems are over .
That would be a mistake .
They are significant and they are widespread , " said Larry Smith , chief investment officer with Third Wave Global Investors , a Greenwich , Conn . - based investment advisor with about $ 400 million in assets .
" Today 's action , while important , does not put to rest the fears that emanate from the credit concerns . "
But Smith said the rate cut was a " bold step " and that he expected the Fed to cut interest rates at least one more time , probably by just a quarter of a percentage point though , before the end of the year .
The Fed 's next monetary policy decision is scheduled to take place at the end of a two - day meeting on Oct. 31 and its last meeting of the year is set for Dec. 11 .
Another market watcher agreed that the Fed has room to cut rates further and dismissed concerns that more rate cuts would create another easy - money environment of the type that got borrowers and banks in trouble in the first place .
" Rates are nowhere near the 1 percent historic lows they were at in 2003 and 2004 , " said Robbert Van Batenburg , head of research with Louis Capital Markets , a broker dealer based in New York .
" The Fed has the luxury of leaving the window open for more rate cuts . "
To that end , according to federal funds futures on the Chicago Board of Trade , investors are now pricing in a 100 percent chance that the Fed will cut rates at least one more time before year 's end .
And Skrainka of Edward Jones said he expects the Fed to cut rates several more times during the next few months .
" This is the beginning of an easing cycle .
This is not one - and - done move by the Fed , " he said .
But one economist said it is not guaranteed that the Fed will cut rates again in October .
Tom Higgins , chief economist with Payden & Rygel , an institutional investment firm based in Los Angeles with more than $ 50 billion in assets under management , said he thinks the Fed is trying to " snap the market out of its funk " with a big rate cut now so it wo n't have to cut rates any further .
With that in mind , Higgins thinks the Fed might hold pat in October .
But ultimately , Higgins said the Fed will have no choice but to cut rates again later this year .
Today 's reduction , he said , will not be enough to get the economy quickly back on track since rate cuts typically take several months to have a broad impact .
" I think the Fed is hoping it wo n't have to cut rates more but I doubt it will be successful .
The economic data is likely to come in on the softer side over the next few months and they will have to move again , " Higgins said .
A new report suggests that Apple and Tesco , not P2P file sharers , should take the most blame for the woes of the British music industry .
The report , prepared privately by consultants Capgemini for the Value Recognition Strategy working group , set out to examine the " value gap " , the amount sound recordings revenue has fallen in the UK since 2004 .
The report remains confidential , but details are starting to emerge .
The consultants suggest that " format changes " and price pressure from discounted CDs on sale in supermarkets , are most to blame for this " value gap " .
However , the report gives lie [ not " life " , as a typo suggested - ed. ] to the idea that P2P file sharing stimulates demand for sales , or is even a neutral factor .
This idea has given comfort to the powerful anti-copyright lobby , backed by internet users who want digital music for free - and find endless justifications to avoid paying for it .
Capgemini calculates that of £ 480 m lost to the industry since 2004 , £ 368 m was the result of format changes : principally the unbundling of the CD into an " a la carte " selection of digital songs .
Of the remainder , 18 per cent was lost to piracy .
And that suggests that simply going after illegal downloaders wo n't save the British music business .
The Value Recognition Strategy working group was created last summer - largely at the impetus of the indie labels and collection societies , but backed by all sectors of the industry - to examine alternative revenue opportunities for digital music .
The growth of MP3 has seen large hardware manufacturers such as Apple and media companies such as News Corp 's MySpace prosper from music , but returning little or nothing to composers , songwriters , and sound recordings owners .
It 's what economist Will Page , of the MCPS - PRS Alliance , calls a " broken supply chain " .
Revenues from telecoms companies and service providers dwarf the revenues from the beleaguered music business .
The conclusion that unbundling is the chief factor is richly ironic .
When Apple launched the ( then ) iTunes Music Store in 2003 , it did so with the backing of all four major labels .
The labels had failed to see digital music as an opportunity , and launched only small scale and piecemeal commercial offerings .
At iTunes , consumers chose one or two songs from a performer 's repetoire for 99 cents a song , rather than pay $ 9.99 for the CD .
However , if Steve Jobs had n't unbundled the CD , then someone else would have done it anyway , Jim Griffin pointed out ( here ) three years ago .
" One disconnect the iTunes model has with reality is that what works for IP is a bundled price , and what does n't work is granularity , historically .
Do you think Edgar Allan Poe could have made money if he sold The Raven separately from 30 other poems ? " he asked .
The trick for the music business is to find a " bundle " that consumers are happy with - and that 's not an easy task .
Bittorrent P2P trades of Radiohead 's
In Rainbows are now far outstripping legitimate downloads - even when the legitimate version is free , DRM unencumbered , and the legal downloader need only provide a fake email address .
However , unbundling works both ways .
Paying $ 9.99 for an album for which you only want a couple of tracks is rotten value .
But so is paying $ 0.99 20 times for the contents of a greatest hits album .
And a flat rate , all - you - can eat bundle is the best value of all . ®

On The Fiftieth Anniversary Of On the Road
by Karen Moller
( Swans - October 8 , 2007 ) In 1959 Kerouac seemed to me to be some kind of God , a sort of prophet sent to liberate us from the conformist middle - class lives we were being programmed to live .
He recast the myth of the American West for me , a restless , idealistic art student from rural Canada .
Instead of , Go West , young man -- freedom is waiting for you , the myth became , Go East , young woman , and forge a new identity .
In my third year of art school I often spent my Saturday afternoons browsing the local bookstores .
Curiosity made me pick up Kerouac 's
On the Road , the book that sent me on my travels .
Today I 'd probably dismiss Kerouac 's heroes as macho guys treating women badly but at the time I did n't notice it , and somehow it did n't matter , probably because there were no female heroes anyway .
As I raced through the first few pages I began to tremble with exhilaration .
Here was a voice I wanted to hear as he asked the same questions I was asking .
Why go for mediocrity , life measured out in sensible portions ?
Why accept sameness and routine when new encounters and novel adventures are out there , just waiting to be sampled ?
No sooner had I discovered that book than I saw my friend Suzan with a copy of On the Road in her handbag .
" Gosh , " I said , " Kerouac 's raw , exciting prose really gets to me .
He fills my head with yearnings to be off , to be doing , to be living out loud . "
" Yeah , Sal and Dean are real cowboys , well , rebels , " she said .
" I 'd like to be like them , defying my parents , the world , whatever , living life at dizzying speeds . "
" Imagine ! " I said .
" Just a couple of troublesome free - spirited guys zigzagged their way across America in an old jalopy , hating mediocrity and reinventing every single moment .
Suzan and I sat in our favorite coffee shop that day envying those guys .
She quoted several passages and then said , " I 'd just love to be doing what I want , like those guys .
You know , answering to no one .
Being a guy , that 's real freedom .
And so it went till one spring day , as we sat in the same coffee shop , it just seemed natural and right when I asked , " Why ca n't we be guys ? "
" Yeah , " she said .
" Let 's hitchhike to San Francisco . "
Once the idea was voiced , there was no stopping us .
The next morning we hit the road in an adventure that we felt belonged only to us .
In true Kerouac spirit , we should have driven those one thousand five hundred miles in an old jalopy , but neither of us had a car or knew how to drive .
Hitchhiking might sound romantic to the young , but the problems started as soon as Suzan and I were dropped off at the nearest US border , two hundred miles south of Calgary .
How were we going to get across ?
Suzan twisted her long blond hair nervously around her fingers .
" Hey , you know , it 's a criminal offense to take someone under twenty - one across the border without a passport , " she said as we stood in the street , thinking things over .
" Maybe they might put us in prison too , " she added .
I shrugged , worried that she was going to quit on me and go back .
I suggested we take a bus across .
Like so many schemes hatched out of desperation , it seemed like a good idea ; even Suzan was pleased with it .
We boarded the local bus to the nearest US town , but when the bus got to the border , the plan started to unravel .
At first , I could not figure out why the customs inspector was giving Suzan funny looks , until I took a good look at our fellow passengers in their conventional suits and dresses .
Beatnik clothes would not raise an eyebrow now , but in 1959 , normal was twin sweater sets , longish skirts and bobby socks .
Our black art - school existentialist outfits complete with long straight hair , pale lipstick , and black stockings , made us stand out like space aliens taking a holiday on Planet Earth .
I panicked .
Oh , god !
We are in trouble .
He probably thinks Suzan 's off to Hollywood .
She was too pretty and although blonde , a look - a- like for Juliette Greco , the 1950s famous Saint Germain singer and existentialist .
The inspector was not so interested in me : just a kid , he was probably thinking .
Nevertheless , he kicked us both off the bus in the middle of nowhere , with only a kind of shack offering snacks and coffee .
" So much for your ideas , " Suzan said dismissively .
" Listen , I know the next border crossing .
It 's near my hometown , two hundred miles west . "
She looked very reluctant until I asked , " Where is your Kerouac spirit ? "
No sooner had I spoken than a red station wagon with three unreliable - looking young men in baseball caps pulled over .
" Are you going anywhere near Kamloops ? " I asked hopefully .
" You wanna go there ? " asked the driver , a sweaty , florid - faced kid with some serious acne scars .
" We ain't doing nothin ' .
Get in . "
As soon as we accepted Suzan started complaining and giving them a run-down of our troubles .
" You wanna cross the border ? " the driver asked , giving a wink to the others .
" Me and the guys will run you across the back hills into the States .
C'mon , it 'll be fun . "
I was getting scared .
Suzan was attracting too much attention from the wrong sort of guys .
" Thanks , " I said , " but my Dad 's the chief of police in Kamloops , and if you 'll just drop us there , I 'm sure he 'll take us across . "
I saw them glance at one another and back at Suzan .
For once , she knew enough to keep her mouth shut .
In Kamloops , they dropped us near the police station and we belted down to the Greyhound Bus café .
" Suzan , " I said as I dragged her into the ladies ' toilet and started rummaging through her bag , looking for something that would make her look like the girl next door off to visit her aunt across the border .
" You have got to change your clothes . "
She struggled determinately against my suggestions to change her style , particularly opposed to the idea of removing her black eye - makeup and tying a scarf over her beautiful hair .
Nevertheless , in the end she gave in and we crossed the border with no problem .
I thought that was the end of it but Suzan had bought into her role so wholeheartedly she could n't stop living it .
For an hour I sat in the seat behind her , trying hard not to laugh as she gave the man next to her glimpses of her imaginary , straight - laced aunt .
" Oh , I 've never hitchhiked , " she exclaimed as she leaned into the man 's face -- her special technique , as she called it , to convince someone she was telling the real truth .
" Auntie Pru would n't approve ! "
On the outskirts of Spokane , Washington , we were picked up by two boys driving down to Portland , Oregon , on the Pacific coast .
Not exactly the shortest route but in the general direction that we wanted to go .
In Portland they wanted to take us home to meet their mom , and Suzan , hoping for a free bed for the night , wanted to take them up on it .
" No way ! " I told her emphatically .
The way our luck was going , I suspected we were likely to get more than we had bargained for .
The boys seemed disappointed by my attitude and perhaps to get even dropped us off near the docks , a seedy , rundown section of downtown Portland .
At a hotdog stand where we got something to eat , the vendor directed us to a shabby hotel .
Suzan insisted I cut down on expenses by taking a single room while she climbed the fire escape to wait for the opportunity to creep through the window .
By then it had turned into a cold , damp night and was pretty late .
The intensely bright light of the moon shinning on Suzan , high up on the staircase , gave her the look of a blue angel hovering over the area .
This image apparently did n't detract one wino , who called up from the alley , " Wanna make a quick fiver ? "
We did n't know it then , but we had stumbled into the red light district .
And in the clear light of morning , Skid Row looked even more sinister than it had the night before .
Shabby men lounged on street corners , and broken bottles littered the sidewalk .
At breakfast in a small café , a bearded man sat down next to us and began talking to Suzan about Jesus and the second coming and whether or not she was " prepared . "
To my surprise , Suzan sat there nodding and agreeing with his religious ranting .
I finally realized that she was counting on him to pay for her bacon and eggs .
Separating her from her would - be mentor became quite an ordeal , as he was convinced that she had been converted to his faith and he wanted to take her off to his " church , " whatever that might have been .
Leaving Portland became quite an ordeal till two policemen put us on the highway heading down the coast toward San Francisco .
Distance became illusory as days merged into nights in a sleepless blur since we no longer stopped at hotels but hopped from one car to the next .
A couple of days later the pale light woke me as we rocketed into San Francisco at about six in the morning .
The driver , a young boy about our age , refused to let us off in the run-down area of North Beach because , he insisted , it was full of beatniks and far too dangerous .
Such was the power of a few rebel poets and writers to inspire fear .
The April fog was hanging in ragged streamers above the Bay Area as we dragged ourselves out of the car and walked the final mile to North Beach .
" Hey , we made it , " I said , smiling happily and giving Suzan a nudge .
Suzan , half asleep and looking like a rumpled bag of old clothes , shook herself and looked around slightly dazed as if trying to make out where we were .
I laughed , but glancing down at myself I realized we were both in quite a disheveled state .
The first thing I noticed as we reached North Beach was the way the beatniks were dressed .
The girls either looked like Juliette Greco , or tried to look like her with their long hair , black stockings , and blackened eyes .
In Canada , I had adopted that look too , not in imitation of the beatniks ; I hardly knew what they looked like but in imitation of the arty French look , evocative of Existentialists and life in Sainte Germain des Prés .
The head teacher of my art school , an old fuddy - duddy , had threatened to ban me from the school for looking too consciously rebellious .
Rebellious certainly , but I was pretty sure it was my thick black stockings that he found most unacceptable .
They were , in an old - fashioned way , too provocatively sexy .
The original beatnik look adopted by Kerouac 's generation had begun in the fifties and was personified by the young Marlon Brando as the motorcycle - riding rebel in the film , The Wild One .
Brando wore a tee shirt and jeans , signaling his desire to be affiliated with the working class .
His leather bomber jacket connoted the heroic derring - do of the World War II fighter pilot .
Early beatniks copied him , but by 1959 the look had evolved into something more self - consciously " artistic " with beards and French berets .
To tell the truth , it was not just the look that antagonized people .
It was the idea that a rebel group had the nerve to turn against the American good life .
The San Francisco press and in particular the local Establishment denigrated the movement as a resident phenomenon and treated the beat writers , poets , and artists as purveyors of childish nonsense .
They mocked the bearded , longhaired men and black legged " girls of easy virtue " who hung around Grant Avenue in their dark sunglasses ( a nod to the black jazz musicians ) .
From the moment the Beat movement received its name , it formed a group identity and was unstoppable .
Herb Caen , the writer coined the word " beatnik , " derived from " beatitude " and " beatific , " to describe those bestowing or possessing bliss , rather than the alternative meaning sometimes given to beat -- beaten down by society .
Full of awe and idealism , Suzan and I also felt unstoppable , at least for the time being .
We rented a room in a reasonable hotel in North Beach , the heartland of the beatnik community .
Unfortunately , the owner saw us " hanging around with those good - for - nothing beatniks " and decided we were an undesirable element .
One morning she met us on the landing , frowning as if we had somehow insulted her .
" I run a respectable place here .
I only gave you a room because you came from out of town and did n't look like lesbians , " she growled .
" But I 'm not having people like you in my hotel . "
There was nothing for us to do but shrug , pack up our possessions , and leave .
When we were out of the woman 's earshot Suzan said , " I did n't like that place anyway . "
She paused , puffing under the weight of her bag .
" You know what that woman 's problem is ?
She 's mixed up .
She thinks , like the straight world , that nonconformity is one bundle of intellectuals , painters , dropouts , sex perverts , and dope fiends . "
I nodded .
" Our freedom scares her , " I said .
" Damn it !
Europeans fled to America to be free .
Now we 've got to go to Europe to be free . "
Suzan nodded enthusiastically .
" Right , Europeans have seen it all .
I bet we could dress like we do , hang out in cafés discussing heavy stuff all day over a coffee , and nobody would blink . "
Now the closest Suzan ever came to Europe was watching old French movies , but she was right anyway .
Europeans do tend to accept rebels , loners , and eccentrics as a part of their society .
We plunked our baggage down in the nearest café and ordered coffee .
I thought about some comments my Danish father had made as he sat listening to the news one particular morning when I was fifteen .
He objected strenuously to North American conformity and insisted that at least people who live in small communities could still believe in the ideals that had helped create America .
" We can make it like we want , but city dwellers ... "
He shook his head in dismay .
I had pondered his words for many days before asking him what he meant .
He shook his head again .
" It 's all very complicated , but the folks in the city think that experts know best .
They conform and let other guys tell 'em how to live . "
He sat in his chair , his newspaper on his knees , while I waited for him to continue .
He seemed to hesitate between his desire to return to his paper and the novelty that one of his children was actually listening to him .
Then , deciding my interest was genuine , he went on to explain that during the Depression , the cities suffered the most .
" Unlike us country folk , they starved back then , and now for them work is just a job . "
Only later did I understand he was saying that in the cities , work as man 's self - expression had ceased .
Our problem at hand , though , was much more pragmatic .
Suzan and I had no place to live .
We sat dejectedly in that coffee shop , philosophizing until our problem was solved by an acquaintance , a young journalist that we had met briefly .
He had a room to rent , he said , on the roof of a building high above the North Beach area .
The room , as it turned out , was just big enough to hold a double bed , but the location , perched like a white seagull on the slopes of Telegraph Hill , had spectacular panoramic views .
On one side the city and in the distance , the gray sails of ships were just visible as they made their way across the bay .
The whole building was enveloped not only by the salty smell of the sea but the wildflowers that covered the top of the hill and the sharp tang of sourdough bread that floated up from the bakery below our window .
We were enchanted and managed to ignore the owner 's too - friendly impromptu visits and his constant suggestion that we take our showers in his apartment .
As the days passed , we discovered that the enormous terrace was a perfect place to read and the tiny room more than big enough for the short hours that we slept .
But then , we had little time for sleeping .
We were too busy exploring the beatnik territory and getting to know the inhabitants .
In the percolating underground of the beat community , I recognized my own impatience for talk , for joy , and perhaps enlightenment .
At the same time , in that refuge of misfits and rebels , I was hoping for something more .
To a degree , I found what I was looking for , the sense that I belonged , especially in Lawrence Ferlinghetti's City Lights bookshop , the epicenter of the beatnik underground .
It was a treasure chest of information , new publications , small press releases , as well as announcements of poetry readings and jazz concerts .
I was relatively ignorant intellectually and puzzled my way through the walls devoted to poetry and poets including Ferlinghetti's own book , Pictures of the Gone Wind , a collection of oddly whimsical and surreal poems , similar to poetic telegrams .
Mostly I was grateful to sit among those shelves full of books , in the bright , lively atmosphere , and listen to the intellectual ponderings of those authors and poets who dropped in and who sat around discussing many subjects .
City Lights and its treasures mesmerized me , and so did Lawrence Ferlinghetti .
He was in many ways the éminence grise of the local Beat scene .
Often Ferlinghetti emerges in my dreams and mixes with certain events that are ever changing and , like his stories , rich in detail and full of moments of joy and grief .
He , like Kerouac was a mentor to the young , a point of reference and remains for me where it all began .
Many years later I met Lawrence Ferlinghetti again in the wine hills of Verona .
At the age of 82 , he was still lean and spry .
Even the mass of fine wrinkles that ran over his youthful exterior merely added an extra dimension of beauty to his lively face .
" Ah ! I remember you , " he said with a charming smile .
" Not only in London , but I also remember that 20 - year - old girl hungry for life arriving from the Canadian prairies with little more than a copy of On the Road in her bag . "
He described me perfectly , but I found it hard to believe I stood out from all the other young girls who conceivably hung out in his shop , reading his books , drinking his coffee , and listening to his abundant literary criticism .
Perhaps they had all faded into one , and for the moment , that one was me .
The thought made me happy .
" Well , Karen , we are almost the only beatniks left , " he said shaking his head .
I smiled , doubtful that many beatniks would have included me in that category , especially since I had rejected the unspoken rule that beatnik chicks should be an available , common sexual property .
I hoped Ferlinghetti included me in the Beat Generation in the way Kerouac described Beats as " characters with a special spirituality , who did not gang up , but were solitary Bartlebys staring out the dead windows of our civilization . "
Bartleby , the character in Melville 's short story , was in my opinion an apt symbol of the beatnik refusal to participate in conformist society .
I sensed deeply that spirit of rebellion , the refusal to accept that my life was predetermined , especially predetermined by the fact that I was only a girl .
Now when I reflect on Kerouac 's book I realize it was not just the raw , exciting prose , the hating of mediocrity , the yearnings to be off ; to live life at dizzying speed .
Kerouac did n't give me a doctrine on how to live ; but I got the message that I needed from him and it had saved me from years of wandering in the wilderness .
On the Road flashed a warning sign that all was not right with the world but it also said all is possible .
It was with that spirit and sense of freedom that I took off for San Francisco , the beatnik heartland , just as hundreds of other young people were to do in the years that followed .

A driverless car called Boss has scooped a $ 2 m prize in a Californian race for robotic vehicles .
Boss shared the road with human drivers to simulate traffic
Boss successfully drove around an urban environment , avoiding other cars , and covering 60 miles ( 85 km ) in less than six hours , all without any human control .
The modified Chevrolet Tahoe was one of six cars that crossed the finish line , from a pack of 11 robotic vehicles which set off at dawn .
The others had to pull out after crashes or other problems .
The race was organised by the US military 's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) and is designed to develop unmanned vehicles that could be used in battle situations .
Automotive manufacturers say the technology could eventually lead to self - driving cars .
Boss navigated around a simulated town , created on a disused US Air Force base in Victorville , in the Californian desert .
It had to deal with single and dual carriageway roads , junctions , buildings and car parks .
As well as the 10 other driverless cars , Boss shared the road with more than 30 professional human drivers to simulate busy traffic .
Kill - switch
The robotic vehicle was created by Tartan Racing , a team formed by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and General Motors ( GM ) .
Imagine being able to talk on the phone , eat your breakfast , handle your emails , and leave the driving to the vehicle
Larry Burns
General Motors
" This is a big day for robotics , " said Chris Urmson , the team 's technology leader .
" We had 11 vehicles that were incredibly capable , and the fact that six of them drove the 60 miles is amazing - just a big day . "
Spectators watched from grandstands as the vehicles pulled up at junctions , turned on their indicators , and then pulled away with the steering wheel eerily moving by itself .
Many of them were hoping for some drama , and the rumour on site was the human drivers had been placing bets on who would be hit first .
Each robotic car was followed by a human in a pace car equipped with a kill - switch , designed to stop the robot instantly if it started acting erratically .
Confused truck
Rapid use of the switch avoided any major accidents but there were some minor ones .
TerraMax climbed a curb and hit a building after losing direction
A dumper truck called TerraMax was the largest vehicle in the race .
At 3 m tall , and 2.5 metres wide , the course had to be widened so it would fit .
It drew gasps from the crowd as it pulled into the starting line - up , and bigger gasps a couple of hours later when it became confused as it navigated around the urban environment , and drove into an empty shop .
" It seemed like it was parked , and then all of a sudden it climbed up the curb , and nudged itself into that building , " according to Juan , who stood watching from behind a safety barrier .
" It was n't very fast , but it was definitely hard ! "
Big screens around the site repeated images of two other robot cars colliding , but damage was minor enough for them both to continue .
Laser eyes
Most of the vehicles look like normal road cars but with an array of sensors mounted on the roof , on each corner and embedded in the bumpers .
The robotic vehicles bristle with sensors
One of the key pieces of technology for the winning team was a Lidar - a spinning laser scanner .
" It has 64 individual lasers in it , and it spins about 10 times a second to generate about a million measurements of the world , " explained Chris Urmson .
" That gives us a kind of point cloud which we can use to help understand where features are - cars , walls , the sidewalk and so on . "
The time it takes for the laser to be fired out and bounce back off an object allows a computer to calculate how far the object is .
That information is combined with data from radar sensors for longer - range perception and cameras .
" We have algorithms which process that data and analyse where the fixed objects are , where the moving objects are , and where we are in relation to our maps of the world , " Mr Urmson added .
Eight years ?
The car industry is watching developments closely .
Larry Burns , GM 's vice - president for research and development and strategic planning , said developing cars that drive themselves is a key objective .
" Imagine being able to talk on the phone , eat your breakfast , handle your emails , and leave the driving to the vehicle , " he added .
" That would be pretty phenomenal .
It 's going to a big breakthrough .
It 's technology that 's on the way to ' having cars that do n't crash ' . "
He believes cars with that level of intelligence could be on the road by 2015 .
Published every year based on objective data and dispassionate analysis , The World Energy Outlook ( WEO ) provides critical analysis and insights on trends in energy demand and supply , and what they mean for energy security , environmental protection and economic development .
The first WEO was published in 1977 and it has been an annual publication since 1998 .
The detailed projections are generated by the World Energy Model , a large - scale simulation tool , developed at the IEA over a period of more than 20 years that is designed to replicate how energy markets function .
It covers the whole energy system , allowing for a range of analytical perspectives from global aggregates to elements of detail , such as the prospects for a particular technology or the outlook for end - user prices in a specific country or region .
There is no single story about the future of global energy and no long - term IEA forecast for the energy sector .
The WEO uses a scenario - based approach to highlight the key choices , consequences and contingencies that lie ahead , and to illustrate how the course of the energy system might be affected by changing some of the key variables , chief among them the energy policies adopted by governments around the world .
Continuing to broadcast a clear message of disapproval to the U.S. regarding its foreign policy and commercial interests abroad , Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran on Tuesday to discuss Iran ’s nuclear program and to present a unified front against Washington ’s possible plans vis -à - vis Iran .
AP via Breitbart.com :
Putin ’s visit took place despite warnings of a possible assassination plot and amid hopes that personal diplomacy could help offer a solution to an international standoff on Iran ’s nuclear program .
Putin has warned the U.S. and other nations against trying to coerce Iran into reining in its nuclear program and insists peaceful dialogue is the only way to deal with Tehran ’s defiance of a U.N. Security Council demand that it suspend uranium enrichment .
“ Threatening someone , in this case the Iranian leadership and Iranian people , will lead nowhere , ” Putin said Monday during his trip to Germany .
“ They are not afraid , believe me . ”

Apple Inc. is reducing the price of all songs on its iTunes Store without anti-copying software to 99 cents from $ 1.29 , bringing Apple 's prices on such tracks closer to those offered by Amazon.com Inc. , Wal - Mart Stores Inc. and other rivals in online music .
In an interview , Apple CEO Steve Jobs said music on iTunes Plus – the portion of Apple 's online music store featuring songs without digital rights management , or DRM , anti-copying software – will feature the reduced price later today or tomorrow .

This is a pretty fun idea .
It is a word game in which you try and define words , the more you get right the more free rice is donated to hungry people around the world .
FreeRice has a custom database containing thousands of words at varying degrees of difficulty .
The game automatically adjusts to your level of vocabulary .
It starts by giving you words at different levels of difficulty and then , based on how you do , assigns you an approximate starting level .
You then determine a more exact level for yourself as you play .
When you get a word wrong , you go to an easier level .
When you get three words in a row right , you go to a harder level .
They claim that this one - to - three ratio is best for keeping you at the â€œouter fringeâ€ of your vocabulary , where learning can take place .
There are 50 levels in all , but the site claims it is rare for people to get above level 48 .
The rice is paid for by the advertisers you see at the bottom of the screen while you play , and the rice is distributed by the United Nations .
I am fascinated by the ability of games to make positive change in the world .
I think that deep down we all want to play games , it is something built into us .
I am glad that people are starting to tap into the full potential of play to do good things .
After more than five years of increasingly intense warfare , the conflict in Afghanistan reached a grim milestone in the first half of this year : U.S. troops and their NATO allies killed more civilians than insurgents did , according to several independent tallies .
The upsurge in deaths at the hands of Western forces has been driven by Taliban tactics as well as by actions of the American military and its allies .
But the growing toll is causing widespread disillusionment among the Afghan people , eroding support for the government of President Hamid Karzai and exacerbating political rifts among NATO allies about the nature and goals of the mission in Afghanistan .
More than 500 Afghan civilians have been reported killed this year , and the rate has dramatically increased in the last month .
Advertisement
In some instances , it was difficult to determine whether the dead were combatants or noncombatants .
But in many other cases , there was no doubt that the person killed was a bystander to war .
Still , Western military leaders argue that any comparison of casualties caused by Western forces and by the Taliban is fundamentally unfair because there is a clear moral distinction to be made between accidental deaths resulting from combat operations and deliberate killings of innocents by militants .
“ No [ Western ] soldier ever wakes up in the morning with the intention of harming any Afghan citizen , ” said Maj .
John Thomas , a spokesman for the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force .
“ If that does inadvertently happen , it is deeply , deeply regretted . ”
Moreover , alliance officials say Taliban fighters are ultimately to blame for many of the fatalities attributed to coalition military operations because the insurgents deliberately place civilians in harm ’s way , using them as human shields and employing other brutal tactics .
Advertisement
Human rights groups acknowledge that there are mitigating circumstances .
But to the families of victims such as Azizullah the salt merchant , such distinctions are lost in a wave of grief and indignation .
At dawn on June 16 , Azizullah went to prayers with his older brother , Mohammed Reza .
It was the last time Reza saw his younger brother alive .
At midmorning , Reza received a call on his cellphone from Afghan police saying Azizullah had been wounded , then another saying that he had died , shot by North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops as he sipped a cool drink a few steps from his storefront in a rundown district of Kabul .
“ Why ?
Why ? ” Reza asked .
“ They are supposed to protect us , not kill us . ”

In a communal society such as Afghanistan , “ no death is isolated , ” said Hekmat Karzai , who runs a security think tank in Kabul and is a cousin of the president .
“ When one person dies , it affects a whole village or clan or tribe .
Ultimately , it affects everyone , and there ’s no escaping that . ”
By late June , the United Nations mission in Afghanistan , working with local rights groups , had counted 314 civilian deaths at the hands of Western - led forces and 279 people killed by the Taliban and other militants .
But that figure did not include at least 45 civilian deaths reported by local officials last weekend in Helmand province ’s Gereshk district .
Separate counts by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and the Associated Press differed slightly , but also indicated that more civilians were killed by Western troops than by militants during the first half of 2007 .
On June 23 , in response to the deaths of more than 100 noncombatants in a single week that were blamed on Western artillery or airstrikes in southern Afghanistan , President Karzai unleashed an angry call for caution by U.S. and NATO forces .
Advertisement
“ Afghan life is not cheap , and it should not be treated as such , ” the Afghan president told reporters in Kabul .
Aides said Karzai believed that his language , the sharpest to date on the subject , was the only way to get the attention of Western policymakers after repeated appeals had gone unanswered .
Neither NATO nor U.S. forces keep a tally of civilian deaths , but Thomas said the military did not dispute the figures cited by Karzai .
All sides , however , acknowledge that counting casualties is an inexact science .
Because Taliban fighters do not wear military uniforms , they can be as difficult to identify in death as in life .
Much of the fighting takes place in remote , rugged areas that are difficult for independent investigators to reach .
Advertisement
NATO and U.S. military officials say that when in doubt , human rights groups sometimes count ambiguous cases among the civilian dead , a contention sharply disputed by the investigators .
“ There is always a margin of error , but no one is interested in inflating these figures , ” said Anja de Beer , the director of the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief , a consortium of humanitarian groups that also tallies civilian deaths .
“ We do not rely only on what people say immediately after a battle .
Our investigators follow up afterward , talk to village elders , to families , and look at fresh graves , ” De Beer said .
“ When there is any question of identity , we take that into account . ”
Often , civilians are killed in the aftermath of an attack by insurgents .
Azizullah was shot and killed by troops responding to a car bomb that went off about half a mile away .
Advertisement
The NATO - led force said at the time that initial indications were that a soldier ’s weapon had accidentally discharged .
Two weeks later , a spokesman said there had been no further findings .
Azizullah ’s family , an extended clan of 25 living in a mud- brick compound on the outskirts of the capital , veered between mourning and fury .
“ Who will bring my son back to me ? ” asked his weeping , white - turbaned father , Mohammed Zia .
“ No one , no one .
Not even God . ”
The family was particularly angered by the fact that the shooting took place more than an hour after the explosion and that there was no report of hostile fire directed at troops .
Advertisement
“ We thought the foreign troops , the Americans , would bring peace to this country , ” said the father .
“ Now they have killed my son , and I do not want to see their faces ever again . ”
Political analysts say that despite the increase in civilian deaths , most Afghans still support the presence of international troops .
“ It ’s an obvious truth that the Western forces bring security that we need , ” said Said Najib Mahmood , a political science professor at Kabul University .
“ But they are killing a lot of people , and because of that there is a loss of trust and confidence in the government . ”
Many analysts say the nature of combat tactics employed by both sides makes it very difficult for the military to avoid inflicting civilian casualties , a fact that the Taliban movement exploits to the maximum .

When allied forces come under fire from a walled compound of the kind that dots every Afghan village , the likeliest response is an airstrike -- a strategy that exposes Western troops to less danger than moving in on foot .
Sometimes , even hours of painstaking surveillance fail to turn up signs of noncombatants in the line of fire .
“ Often we will refrain from making a strike because we suspect there might be civilians present , ” said Thomas .
“ But sometimes we ’re wrong . ”
If so , the consequences can be devastating .
Advertisement
“ We see whole families killed together in their home -- mothers , babies , everyone , ” said Abdul Matim , a parliament member from Helmand province , who has personally investigated many of the civilian deaths in his home district .
“ It ’s a terrible sight . ”
Another common insurgent tactic is suicide car bombings aimed at military convoys .
In response , jittery troops sometimes fire on civilians who are merely driving erratically or who accidentally come between military vehicles .
Often there are more such shootings when a contingent of troops has recently arrived in Afghanistan .
“ It takes time to figure out that not everyone in a turban is a suicide bomber , ” said Karzai , the analyst , who directs the independent Center for Conflict and Peace Studies in Kabul .
After a suicide bombing last week on the outskirts of Kabul that targeted a U.S. military convoy and killed two Western security officers , Afghan police anxiously waved journalists away .
Advertisement
“ Do n’t go close , ” they warned .
“ The Americans might shoot you . ”
Criticism over civilian casualties frustrates NATO and U.S. officials , who say atrocities by the Taliban expose civilians to far greater dangers .
In one widely cited recent case , insurgents allegedly tried to trick a 6 - year - old boy into blowing himself up at an Afghan police checkpoint , fitting him with a suicide vest they told him would eject flowers at the push of a button .
Police managed to free the child .
At the same time , Western officials acknowledge that whatever the provocation , they must adhere to international norms of combat .
Advertisement
“ We are rightly held to a higher standard of behavior , ” said Nicholas Lunt , the chief NATO civilian spokesman in Afghanistan .
At the compound of Azizullah ’s family , his four children , all younger than 5 , tussled together on the floor and gazed with bright curiosity at visitors .
Their uncle Mohammed Reza explained that they were too young to comprehend that their father was dead .
“ I asked them where they think he is , and they say they do n’t know , ” he said .
“ They do n’t understand yet that he is never coming back . ”

Proposed FISA update would not give telecom companies legal protection Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 9 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This House introduces delayed proposal to amend foreign spying law House Democrats have refused to submit to Bush administration requests to save telecommunications companies that assisted in a warrantless wiretapping scheme from lawsuits or prosecution , and they want to require judicial approval for future efforts to spy on Americans .
The latest demands were aired Tuesday in a proposed update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , although it remains to be seen whether House leaders -- and their counterparts in the Senate -- will be able to stand firm in sticking to their demands .
 Earlier this year , President Bush signed a short - term surveillance law that exposed innocent Americans  phone calls and emails to warrantless intrusion , " House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said in a statement announcing the Democrats ' proposal .
" This bill shows that it is possible to protect civil liberties and fight terrorism at the same time . 
The proposed House bill offers some concession to the administration , and it includes fixes in surveillance that Democrats and Republicans agreed were needed , such as a clarification that no warrant is required to spy on strictly foreign - to - foreign phone calls and e-mails .
Under the new law , the Attorney General or Director of National Intelligence would be authorized to receive blanket warrants to eavesdrop on several foreign intelligence targets who could call into the United States , but the bill would restore FISA court reviews of targeting procedures and steps taken to " minimize " Americans ' exposure to surveillance .
If an American is to become the " target " of surveillance , intelligence agencies would be required to seek an individualized warrant from the FISA court .
The American Civil Liberties Union said that concession would allow " blanket warrants " to authorize the National Security Agency and other US intelligence services to gather information on untold numbers of Americans who may not be suspected of doing anything wrong .
" The program can collect any communication as long as one leg of it is overseas , " the ACLU said in a critique of the new proposal .
" If Americans  communications are swept up by this new , general program warrant , there is no requirement that a court actually review whether those communications are seized in compliance with the Fourth Amendment . "
A Democratic summary of the new bill says Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell did not object to judicial oversight of targeting and minimization procedures .
A DNI spokeswoman told RAW STORY that McConnell would not comment on pending legislation .
When he testified before Congress last month , McConnell laid out three primary requests for the FISA update .
His foreign - to - foreign clarification and basket warrant provisions were included , but Democrats did not bow to his requests that telecommunications be let off the hook for assisting in the warrantless wiretapping program since 2001 .
McConnell told congressional committees that basket warrants were needed because intelligence analysts can't know in advance whether a foreign target would be calling someone in the US .
The ACLU was largely positive about bill , but it was dire in its warnings about the basket warrants ' potential to violate Americans civil rights .
" There has not been a surveillance program since FISA was created that allows massive , untargeted collection of communications that will knowingly pick up US communications on US soil without any suspicion of wrongdoing , " the group said .
" This creates novel and fundamental Fourth Amendment problems that Congress should seek to avoid instead of sanctioning .
Going back to the court may be inconvenient , but doing so is just a matter or resources and protecting our Fourth Amendment rights is worth the cost . "
Since passing what many saw as a hastily crafted temporary FISA revision just before recessing in August , Democrats in the House vowed to assuage critics who saw that bill , the Protect America Act , as not doing enough to protect Americans ' privacy rights .
The House Intelligence and Judiciary committees on Tuesday released a summary of their latest effort to amend FISA , which would require repair shortcomings in intelligence - gathering efforts while ensuring that intelligence agencies do not target Americans without first getting individualized warrants .
The proposal is known as the Responsible Surveillance That is Overseen , Reviewed and Effective ( Restore ) Act , and it is timed to expire Dec. 31 , 2009 , when Congress also would revisit the Patriot Act .
Before the announcement Tuesday , the New York Times published a bleak assessment of the chances for success of a bill like the one Democrats have proposed .
Although the act would include several provisions requested last week by progressive lawmakers , it does not include must - have items demanded by President Bush , such as telecom immunity , and Democrats are unlikely to be able to corral enough votes to override a presidential veto .
Civil liberties and privacy - rights activists have been lobbying intensely for Democrats to stand firm against immunity for telephone and Internet providers who are alleged to have granted National Security Agency spies access to domestic communications switches , and they appear to have scored a small victory with Tuesday 's announcement .
House leaders were expected to announce their proposal last week but held off after the House Progressive Caucus released its list of needed reforms in a FISA update , such as a sunset provision and refusal to grant immunity to telecom companies , which were included Tuesday .
The Protect America
Act expires in February , and Democrats are facing pressure from the White House to pass a permanent measure soon .
Congress is expected to send its FISA revision to the president before the end of the year .
#
The House Intelligence and Judiciary committees released the following summary of their proposal : RESTORE Act of 2007 ( Responsible Surveillance That is Overseen , Reviewed and Effective ) Bill Summary Security and Liberty :
The bill provides the Intelligence Community with effective tools to conduct surveillance of foreign targets outside the United States but restores Constitutional checks and balances that were not contained in the Protect America Act ( PAA -- the Administrations FISA bill . )
The RESTORE ACT : Clarifies that No Court Warrant is Required to Intercept Communications of Non-United States Persons When Both Ends of the Communications are Outside the United States .
Requires an Individualized Court Warrant from the FISA Court When Targeting Persons in the United States .
( Same as current law . )
Creates a Program of Court Authorized Targeting of Non-U.S. Persons Outside the United States .
Grants the Attorney General ( AG ) and the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) authority to apply to the FISA Court for an order to conduct surveillance of foreign targets , or groups of targets , for up to one year  but RESTORES the following checks and balances that were absent under the PAA : a. Court Review of Targeting Procedures .
The FISA Court must review targeting procedures to ensure that they are reasonably designed to target only people outside the United States .
In emergencies , the FISA Court review may take place after the surveillance has begun  for up to 45 days .
DNI McConnell told Congress in September that he did not oppose FISA Court review of these targeting procedures .
b. Court Review of Minimization Procedures .
The FISA Court must review minimization procedures .
DNI McConnell told Congress in September that he did not oppose FISA Court review of these minimization procedures .
c. Court Review of Guidelines to ensure that , when the government seeks to conduct electronic surveillance of a person in the United States , the government obtains a traditional individualized warrant from the FISA Court .
Clarifies Ambiguous Language on Warrantless Domestic Searches .
The bill clarifies and eliminates ambiguous language in the PAA that appeared to authorize warrantless searches inside the United States , including physical searches of American homes , offices , computers , and medical records .
In a letter to Congress in September , Administration officials indicated that they did not intend their legislation to authorize such warrantless domestic searches and expressed a willingness to consider alternative language .
A RESTORE ACT Authorization May Not Be Used to Target Any Known U.S. Person .
If the government learns that the target of surveillance is a U.S. person ( say , an American traveling abroad ) , it can not use this new authority .
Assistant Attorney General Ken Wainstein acknowledged to Congress in September that the PAA could be used by the Administration to target Americans abroad without a warrant , even U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Limits Authority to Terrorism , Espionage , Sabotage , and Threats to National Security .
The Administrations bill allowed for surveillance for all foreign intelligence , including a broad category of information related to foreign affairs .
This bill allows the Intelligence Community to deal with the threats facing the United States from terrorism , espionage , sabotage , clandestine intelligence activities , and to collect information related to the national defense or security of the U.S. , without authorizing the collection on the broad category of  foreign affairs .
Requires Quarterly Audits and Reports .
Requires quarterly audits by the Justice Department Inspector General ( DOJ IG ) on communications collected under this authority and the number of U.S. persons identified in intelligence reports disseminated pursuant to this collection .
These audits would be provided to the FISA Court and to Congress ( Intelligence and Judiciary Committees . )
The Administrations bill contained very limited reporting to Congress .
During testimony , DNI McConnell said he did not oppose an Inspector General audit of the program to determine the scope of American communications swept up by this authority .
Requires an Audit of the Presidents Surveillance Program and Other Warrantless Surveillance Programs .
This audit mandates a report and documents related to these programs be provided to Congress in unclassified form with a classified annex .
Requires Record - keeping of the Use of United States Persons Information .
Mandates that the Executive Branch record every instance in which the identity of a United States person whose communication was acquired by the Intelligence Community is disseminated to an element or person within the Executive Branch and that it submit an annual report to Congress on the dissemination .
Adds Resources for FISA .
Adds funding for personnel and technology resources at DOJ and NSA to speed the FISA process and to ensure that audits can be conducted expeditiously .
Reiterates the Exclusivity of FISA .
Includes House - passed bipartisan Schiff - Flake language stating that FISA is the exclusive means to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans for the purpose of foreign intelligence collection .
No Retroactive Immunity .
The bill is silent on retroactive immunity because the Administration has refused to provide Congress with documents on the specifics of the Presidents warrantless surveillance program .
However , the bill does provide prospective immunity for those complying with court orders issued pursuant to this authority .
Establishes En Banc Review .
Allows the FISA Court to sit en banc .
The FISA Court requested this , and the Administration does not oppose it .
Provides Sunset , Transition Procedures and Report on PAA .
Sunsets this new authority on December 31 , 2009 , when certain PATRIOT Act provisions sunset .
However , the legislation will allow for a transition from the existing warrants to the new ones to ensure that the Intelligence Community does not go dark on any surveillance .
The Administration will be required to submit a report on U.S. - person information collected and disseminated under the PAA authorities .
To recall memories , your brain travels back in time via the ultimate Google search , according to a new study in which scientists found they can monitor the activity and actually predict what you 'll think of next .
The work bolsters the validity of a longstanding hypothesis that the human brain takes itself back to the state it was in when a memory was first formed .
The psychologist Endel Tulving dubbed this process " mental time travel . "
How it works
Researchers analyzed brain scans of people as the test subjects watched pictures on a computer screen .
The images were divided into three categories : celebrities like Jack Nicholson and Halle Berry , places like the Taj Mahal and the Grand Canyon , and everyday objects like tweezers and a pocket mirror .
To make sure the subjects were paying attention , they were asked a question about each image as it came up , like whether they liked a certain celebrity , how much they wanted to visit a certain place or how often they used a certain object .
Later , without any images and while their brains were still being scanned , the subjects were asked to recall as many of the images as they could .
The researchers found that the patterns of brain activity associated with each picture " reinstated " themselves seconds before the people could verbally recall the memories .
On average , the time between beginning brain activity associated with the memory and the subjects verbally stating the memory was about 5.4 seconds .
" When you have an experience , that experience is represented as a pattern of cortical activity , " explained Sean Polyn , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and leader of the study .
" The memory system , which we think lives in the hippocampus , forms a sort of summary representation of everything that 's going on in your cortex . "
Googling your brain
The process can be compared to the way web crawlers work to browse and catalogue web pages on the Internet .
Web crawlers are automated programs that create copies of all visited pages .
Search engines like Google then tag and index the pages .
In the same way , as we 're trying to remember something , our brains dredge up the memory by first recalling a piece of it , scientists say .
When trying to remember a face you saw recently , for example , you might first think broadly about faces and then narrow your search from there , enlisting new details as you go , Polyn explained .
It 's like adding more and more specific keywords to a Google search , until finally you find what you want .
Scientists call this process " contextual reinstatement . "
" The memories that came up would be hits and the ones that most match your queries would be the ones that came up first , " Polyn told LiveScience .
Reading your mind
The researchers were even able to do a little mind - reading by watching the search in progress .
By comparing the brain scans of the subjects while they tried to remember the images they 'd seen with those collected when they first viewed the images , the researchers were able to correctly conclude whether the people were going to remember a celebrity , place or object .
" We can see some evidence of what category the subject is trying to recall before they even say anything , so we think we 're visualizing the search process itself , " Polyn said .
A similar mind - reading effort was announced earlier this year , when researchers found they could predict where a patient would move his hand based on brain activity the instant prior .
Scientists think that contextual reinstatement is unique to memories that involve personal experiences , so - called " episodic " memories , but that similar processes might be at work in other forms of memory .
The study was detailed in the Dec. 23 issue of the journal Science .
Files , whose contents are stored directly ( without the filename or other metadata ) .
Trees , which represent directory structures .
Imagine a text file that contains a sequence of lines " < path/ for/ file > < file SHA1 > " .
Commits , which represent history .
Imagine a text file that contains a commit message followed by the SHA - 1s of a tree and one or more parent commits .
This is a braindump about git .
I do n't describe commands , like how to add and remove files , because they provide tutorials as well as translation guides for users of other tools .
Instead , I 'm trying to describe what distinguishes git from other VCSes in the same space ( sort of a hobby of mine , see more posts ) and what makes it interesting .
This is the sort of thing I wish I could 've read when I first started looking into this .
The place to start is at the philosophy , because that makes a lot of other decisions more clear .
Imagine you 're Linus .
You 're managing a huge code base with many contributors , but you do n't really care much about version control as it currently exists -- you 've been content in the past managing the whole thing by just patches and email .
What do you need to get more work done with less pain ?
With that in mind , git to me feels much more like a " content tracker " ( their term ) than a " version control system " .
It starts with a content - addressable file system as its primitive and then adds the minimal layer of glue on top of it to support some work flow , but above all the focus is speed and simplicity .
For example , " git clone " is a shell script that calls curl and rsync , among others .
For another example , git more or less does n't handle renames in any sort of principled way , nor do they care much about merge algorithms -- I recall reading some thread where Linus argued that it 's better to conflict than do something fancy because you want a human to look over it anyway in cases where the merge starts getting fancy .
The whole thing still feels super weird to me because the similarity to monotone is obvious but the end result is really different .
Let 's start with the repository representation .
( You can skip this section if you get monotone or mercurial , because as I understand it this is the bit of monotone that everyone borrowed . )
Through underlying representations you do n't need to care much about , imagine you can store and retrieve blobs of bytes keyed by their SHA - 1 .
You can build pointers between blobs by storing collections of SHA - 1s , which themselves get new SHA - 1s representing the collection .
Suppose you 've stored two blobs with SHA - 1s A and B ; you can then store a blob whose contents is literally just the string " A
B " and hash that , getting SHA - 1 C .
When you pull C out again , its content is then just the pointers you need to the original two blobs via their SHA - 1 .
The important property of SHA - 1s is that they are ( hopefully ) unforgeable , which means that the SHA - 1 C is all you need to uniquely identify the original blobs .
Git stores four sorts of blobs .
The important ones are ( glossing over some details here ) :
The important thing to note is that a single SHA - 1 of a commit , because of the chained SHA - 1 pointers , uniquely identifies not only the entire state of a tree of files , but also all previous states of the tree .
One SHA - 1 can identify an entire history .
( But also note there 's no provisions for tracking renames ; they actually try to identify renames by looking for similar file content across different versions ( ! ) . )
Git 's underlying store of these objects has some nice properties , like how files are only added and never modified .
( This means it can make hardlinks between copies of local repositories without needing to implement copy on write . )
Here 's where git starts to diverge from monotone .
You have this pool of files and SHA - 1s , and you need to know which SHA - 1 to start at to do a checkout .
Git uses text files , stored outside of the SHA - 1 database in . git/refs / , that each contain an initial commit SHA - 1 .
A new tree has one file : heads / master , aka the " master " branch .
If you create a branch , all that does is make a new refs file .
Commits " on " a branch add all the objects described in the previous section and then change the branch ref to point at the new commit , leaving the master ref alone .
If you 've cloned from another source , its head is also represented with a branch at remotes / origin / master .
This allows you to pull upstream ( with " git fetch " ) and look at it before you attempt a merge .
Git is the first DVCS I 've seen that has a good story for looking at a remote person 's work .
You can pull their tree into your repository as a branch alongside your other branches , and can use the normal git tools for diffing and merging between branches .
If you do n't like their code , you can throw away the branch without leaving any effect on your code .
Tags are , to quote Linus , " 100 % the same thing " as branches : files that contain the SHA - 1 of a particular commit .
In practice they 're handled differently by the git tools , like how " git branch " only displays branches and not tags , andthat commit update branch pointers but not tags , but the underlying representation and effects are identical .
( There 's a separate " tag object " concept used for GPG - signing golden releases , but I wo n't get into that . )
You can even create your own tag - like files under the refs directory and git will pick them up and use them like tags .
All of these structures involve forward pointers : branches point at commits point at trees point at files .
When you delete a branch ( suppose you decide to stop tracking some upstream source ) , how do you tell whether the data it pointed at is still useful ?
Git 's solution is just to require a separate occasional garbage collection step that I imagine does the natural mark and sweep .
When I first learned of this it seemed a bit ridiculous , but on further reflection it 's actually sorta sensible ; there are other useful processes ( such as " repacking " , which restructures the database to make it more space - efficient as well as sync - efficient ) that also take enoughtime to run that you would n't want to do them " online " ( in response to a user action ) .
As I think Graydon observed , it 's hard to beat git 's sync speed when its " clone " operation literally involves shoveling compressed bytes directly off of disk over the socket .
Contrast thiswith , for example , SVN's FSFS backend , which writes each commit as deltas into separate files and makes checkout of even just the most recent version of a single file involve ferreting around in multiple files .
The other weird aspect of git that makes me think " content tracker " and not " version control " is that they 're surprisingly cavalier about rewriting history .
For example , consider the " git rebase " command .
As I understand it , this command rolls your branch back to the point where it diverged , jumps forward to the head , then reapplies your branch 's changes .
( If that 's not clear , there 's a nice ASCII art diagram in the man page . )
Instead of having history represent the flow of development ( where there 's a fork and then the forks meet again ) , it re-linearizes two branches into a serial path .
This makes your history " cleaner " -- after all , if the rebase worked without problems , the changes were independent anyway -- but took me a while to grok because it seemed so strange to want to do this .
( For example , it 's not safe to do on any sort of shared repository . )
But again , consider the " Linus 's global army " basis of the system : when you 're sending code upstream , it 's your responsibility to provide a patch series that is as clean as possible .
The rebase man page linked to above also discusses how to take an existing series of commits and re-construct them in a new branch , to allow you to clean up each commit and remove unuseful experiments , so that the new branch can be what you submit .
( Personal aside : it does n't seem that important to me to linearize history ; in a sufficiently churning project you 're going to have a branchy history and what you really need are tools to make that clearer .
I always think of this picture from monotone - viz , showing a complicated project .
On the other hand , this sort of behavior has prompted interesting - looking experiments , and in my mind that 's always a good thing -- who knows what they 'll discover . )
Git sorta gets a free pass in the n+1 space because it came with its killer app : Linux .
Because of Linux , there is a surprising quantity of software built around git , such as repository browsers , GUIs , and importers from other systems .
It also seems plausible to me ( though I have n't thought it through ) that because of its simplistic design it 's easier to write an importer for git ( or maybe it 's just because there are more people contributing code ) but the svn bridge for git is the best I 've yet seen , supporting tracking an upstream svn repository and pushing commits out .
Git pretty much requires cygwin ; the tools are written in a mixture of C , shell , and even Perl .
There is a mingw port ( which does n't quite work for me , though I think my computer may be broken ) as well as efforts to make a more " native " port , by rewriting the scripts in C -- even the MinGW port installer includes stuff like bash .
Git , being written by Linus , is likely biased in its performance characteristics towards Linux .
It 's noticeably slower on Windows , but mostly because it 's so fast on Linux .
The main thing people rave about with git is its speed , and I can see why .
At work we deal with a few agonizingly slow version control systems and it has all the sorts of negative effects you 'd expect : people adjust their workflow to avoid touching the VCS , which harms productivity as well as the processes we have for maintaining code quality ; people do n't test all changes against clean checkouts because they take too long .
The difference between five seconds of latency and instantaneous can change your workflow entirely .
Particularly git 's branching is so lightweight it 's painless to create and switch between branches and the normal workflow of doing anything is to start by creating a branch .
If someone interrupts you with a quick fix , you can instantly flip your checkout to the state before the branch , apply the fix , and even rebase your branch on top of the fix so it 's as if you inserted the fix into your history graph .
Their command " revert " actually creates an undo patch .
The " revert " command seen in every other system is called " reset " .
( darcs still wins the prize for most gratuitously renamed commands . )
Git adds a middle layer between your code and committing it called " the index " or " staging area " .
I imagine this makes some aspect of the system easier , but can make status messages confusing .
If you look at the " reset " docs you 'll be confronted with this .
Git is low - level and tends to get pretty ugly when things go wrong .
People are improving this rapidly , though ( I guess 1.5 changed a bunch of the commands around ) so I have hope this will change .
The important things for me to realize about git were that ( 1 ) it'll never go away completely unless someone makes something significantly better for Linus , which is especially unlikely because git was made by him specifically for his workflow ; ( 2 ) it 's been adopted by other big projects like x.org and wine ; and ( 3 ) there are a lot of people hacking in its space -- it moves quickly .
Even if something like mercurial is " better " it 's not significantly ¹ so .
To me it makes git sort of inevitable as the system of choice , despite its flaws and ugly corners .

The Giuliani-Romney clash has been shaping up along familiar battle lines .
Giuliani , the consensus front - runner with broad name recognition and support of the party establishment , is waging a national campaign designed to culminate in a sweep of the 22 " Super Tuesday " contests on February 5th .
Mitt Romney , on the other hand , is traveling the route of the insurgent , the dark horse .
Through the mobilization of grassroots organizations and an influsion of cash , Romney hopes a surprisingly strong win in Iowa on January 3 will catapult him to victory five days later in his home base in New Hampshire .
As I wrote in May , Romney is counting on the " Iowa Effect " to overturn the conventional wisdom about the inevitability of Giuliani and transform the race :
In a nutshell , the Iowa Effect is the complete upending of the predicted presidential primary landscape by a candidate 's unexpected performance in the nation 's first caucus .
Riding a wave of adoring press coverage by a media eager to hype the tale of the underdog , the perceived winner in Iowa sweeps through New Hampshire and subsequent primary states to take ( or at least seriously challenge for ) the party 's nomination .
The Iowa Effect is all about psychology , expectations and , more than anything else , momentum .
In 2004 , John Kerry 's surprising win in Iowa produced a slingshot effect that took him through New Hampshire and succeeding primaries , while front - runner Howard Dean imploded within days .
In 1984 , Gary Hart 's shocking second place finish in Iowa ( he trailed Walter Mondale by 51 % - 16 % ) produced a 30 point swing and victory in New Hampshire in the span of just 8 days .
In 2008 , Mitt Romney is hoping to follow in their footsteps .
At it appeared to be working for Romney , that is , until last week .
Governor Huckabee surged into a virtual dead heat with the former Massachusetts Governor .
An ABC poll released last week showed Huckabee trailing Romney just 28 % to 24 % , while a new Strategic Vision survey put the deficit at only two points .
( A Rasmussen poll completed yesterday actually shows Huckabee ahead 28 % to 25 % . )
Mike Huckabee 's surprisingly strong performance reflects his own budding grassroots momentum .
A charismatic campaigner , Huckabee is leveraging his second place showing at the Iowa straw poll in August .
He also benefited from the departure of Sam Brownback , whose stillborn campaign was a competitor for conservative Christian votes .
Perhaps more than any other factor , Huckabee , a former minister , is successfully mobilizing the evangelicals of Iowa , a group that constitutes a third of caucus - goers .
( As the New York Times reports today , Romney 's Mormon faith now appears to be hurting him among religious right voters in the Hawkeye state . )
However , while Mike Huckabee may deny Romney the benefit of the Iowa Effect , he may not reap the rewards , either .
In New Hampshire , not a target rich environment for evangelical voters , Huckabee is trailing badly .
With only 5 % in a recent CNN / WMUR / UNH poll , he is running a distant fifth behind Romney ( 33 % ) , John McCain ( 18 % ) , Rudy Giuliani ( 16 % ) and even Ron Paul ( 8 % ) .
Fairing somewhat better in Michigan ( January 15 ) and South Carolina ( January 29 ) , Huckabee has a lot of ground to make up in Florida , New York , California and other Super Tuesday states .
Right now , those states belong to Rudy Giuliani .
Mike Huckabee 's faith - based campaign may do nothing more than knock Team Romney off the rails .
And that makes Mike Huckabee Rudy Giuliani 's best friend .

First Lt. Ehren Watada , the first commissioned officer to refuse deployment to Iraq , won what his backers are calling a " huge victory " in court Thursday .
US District Court Judge Benjamin
Settle ruled the military cannot put Watada on trial a second time unless it can prove such a trial would not violate the US Constitution ’s prohibition against " double jeopardy . "
In February , Lt. Watada ’s first court martial ended in a mistrial just before he was to take the stand in his own defense .
Many observers believe the judge , Lt. Col.
John Head , ordered a mistrial in that case because he was worried that Lt. Watada ’s testimony would lead to him being found not guilty of " missing [ troops ] movement " and " conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman . "
Immediately before a mistrial was declared , Watada had said : " Your Honor , I have always believed that I have a legal and moral defense .
I realize that the government can make arguments and you can make rulings contrary to that , but that does not negate my belief that I have a defense . "
" To me , " Watada told the court , leading soldiers into battle in Iraq " means to participate in a war that I believe to be illegal . "
Watada had hoped to make that argument under the so - called Nuremberg Principals which arose from trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II .
The fourth of the Nuremberg Principles says that superior orders are not a defense to the commission of an illegal act , meaning soldiers who commit a war crime because they were " just following orders " are just as culpable as their superiors .
Over the last nine months , Watada has continued in his daily duties at Fort Lewis , Washington while his lawyers and lawyers for the Army have been in and out of federal court .
The Army has been trying to launch a second prosecution , with Watada ’s attorneys arguing such a trial would violate the 5th Amendment to the US Constitution , which prohibits citizens from being tried twice for the same crime .
In his ruling Thursday , Judge Settle found the Army judge " likely abused his discretion " in the first court - martial .
" The same Fifth Amendment protections are in place for military service members as are afforded to civilians , " he wrote .
" To hold otherwise would ignore the many sacrifices that American soldiers have made throughout history to protect those sacred rights . "
Judge Settle ’s ruling does not provide a complete victory for Watada , however .
The injunction only temporarily blocks Army prosecutors from proceeding .
In a statement released Thursday , the Army Office of the Staff Judge Advocate indicated it was not giving up and said the military plans to file additional briefs on the double jeopardy issues .
" We look forward to the opportunity to further explain to the District Court judge the full extent of the protections and safeguards that are afforded to a military accused , " the statement said .
" We believe that this additional information will be helpful as the judge prepares to issues his final ruling in the case . "
Watada ’s supporters expressed surprise that the military continues its legal crusade .
David Mitchell , a lawyer who served time in prison for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War , noted that Lt. Watada has already completed his term of service in the military and could now simply be discharged .
" The longer the military continues this trial , the more publicity Lt. Watada gets , " Mitchell told IPS , " [ and ] the more information is out there for the public that there are people in the military who challenge the legality and morality of the war . "
Yet despite Watada ’s apparent victory , Mitchell is disappointed that other officers have not followed in the lieutenant ’s footsteps .
Nearly two years after he publicly refused his deployment , Lt. Watada remains the only commissioned officer to refuse to serve .
" The war is incredibly unpopular , " Mitchell said , " but people are frustrated because they do n’t think they can do anything about it .
You see it in the fact that we do n’t really have large demonstrations and you see it in the fact that the amount of military resistance is a lot lower than it was during the Vietnam War . "
Nonetheless , antiwar sentiment in the ranks is making an impact .
In February 2006 , pollster John Zogby conducted a survey of US soldiers stationed in Iraq .
Seventy - two percent said that US troops should be pulled out within one year .
Of those , 29 percent said they should withdraw " immediately . "
More than 10,000 soldiers have deserted since the Iraq war began four years ago .
According to the Army , the number of deserters has increased every year of the war ; 3,196 active - duty soldiers deserted the Army last year , compared to 2,543 the year before .

THE ISSUES
STORY BY MIKE ZIGLER , PHOTOS BY CODY BOOR O n a 106 - degree May afternoon in 2003 , government agents raided several establishments belonging to Southern Nevada businessman Robert � Bobby � Kahre .
With guns drawn , officials held more than 20 handcuffed workers in the sun without water as agents collected records and other materials .
Kahre hadn�t committed a crime .
He had upset the Internal Revenue Service by paying his workers based on the face value of gold and silver coins , versus the market value in the Federal Reserve system ( the value of the coins in U.S. paper dollars ) .
Even though the coins were in circulation , displayed a face value , and were regulated by Congress , the IRS�s confusing and endless tax code did not determine how to handle these gold and silver coins if used for payroll .
The tax code only references dollars .
It does not distinguish between coined money and paper money .
Kahre didn�t opt for the precious metal bullion system without first doing his homework .
He consulted monetary experts , engaged in extensive research , and even met with congressmen .
Kahre�s conclusion was simple :
While the currency in the precious - metal system was greater in value than the currency in the other system , as money and a medium of exchange , the law knows no difference between the face value of both currencies .
The IRS expected Kahre to report his workers � earnings based on the coins� market value in the Federal Reserve system .
Instead , he didn�t report or pay anything at all because the face value of the coins fell below the reporting threshold .
The IRS alleged that Kahre and the other defendants paid at least $ 114 million ( based on the Federal Reserve system ) to workers .
The use of these coins in trade is a direct challenge to the fiat money system now in place .
� Bobby Kahre is the only person in the world I know of with the courage to do that , � said Joel Hansen , a Las Vegas attorney who represented one of the nine defendants in the case .
While the purpose of the case was to identify the intent of the defendants , the trial that followed tested America�s dual monetary system and further validated that the U.S. greenback is quickly becoming more and more a worthless piece of paper .
I n 1985 , Ron Paul and other congressmen challenged our country�s currency system , which was monopolized by Federal Reserve Notes ( FRNs ) � the familiar greenbacks in American wallets .
The congressmen successfully pursued the Gold Bullion Coin Act , which required the U.S. government to mint and place gold coins in denominations of $ 50 , $ 25 , $ 10 and $ 5 into circulation based on demand .
The coins are made of 91.67 percent pure gold .
The ultimate purpose of the act was to allow Americans to invest in gold .
However , it also brought sanity back to this country�s monetary system by establishing a dual system .
Instead of the Federal Reserve solely providing the money supply by endlessly printing FRNs , the U.S. government now minted and circulated precious metal coins .
In the mid-�90s , Kahre began exercising this alternate system .
He compensated workers for their labor in the form of these gold and silver coins versus FRNs .
The workers calculated their income and tax liability based on the face value of the coins .
One gold coin with a face value of $ 50 currently equals $ 806 in FRNs .
If a worker earns a $ 50 gold coin each week , that person takes home an annual income of $ 2,600 based on the precious metal system , which is below the income - tax reporting threshold for an employee .
However , the value of the coins in FRNs � $ 41,912 � is not .
That �s the basic idea .
The IRS did not fancy Kahre�s gold - and - silver payroll system , and after seven years of operating his family businesses in this fashion , he and eight others found themselves as defendants in a Las Vegas federal courtroom .
Kahre was charged with 109 counts of tax - related crimes , varying from tax evasion to willful failure to file and conspiracy to evade taxes .
Fifty - two other counts were divided among the other defendants .
While the case was about the intent of the defendants , it raised several issues .
There was the issue of whether or not Kahre�s workers were considered independent contractors , who are responsible for paying their own taxes , or employees , who have their taxes withheld by their employer each pay period .
Then there�s the issue of America�s dual monetary system .
If there are two monetary systems , and the value of one system�s currency is greater than the other beyond its face value , what is the standard for determining the value of taxable income ?
No Federal Court of Appeals has ever ruled that the gold coins in question must be reported to the IRS based on FRN market value .
� The defense showed that the defendants believed in good faith that a Federal Reserve Note is not the standard because Congress created the dual monetary system , � Hansen said .
� The defendants believed that gold and silver coins are just as legitimate and legal as our other tender , the FRN . �
K ahre certainly caught the attention of the IRS .
In addition to operating his businesses via the gold - and - silver payroll system , according to testimony at the trial , he helped 35 other contracting companies do the same .
But even though Kahre and his colleagues followed the dual monetary system mandated by Congress , the IRS didn�t care .
To America�s most feared agency , the bottom line was Kahre�s workers weren�t taxed enough for their labor .
Based partially on cases that pre-dated the 1985 Gold Bullion Coin Act , the judge in the case did not allow defense attorneys to argue that Kahre was justified to pay workers based on the face value of the coins .
Based on case law , the court concluded that income had to be calculated based on the FRN fair market value , rather than upon the face value .
A flaw with some of those cases was that each referred to double - eagle gold coins , which Franklin D. Roosevelt outlawed in 1934 .
Those coins are no longer in circulation like the coins minted by the U.S. government following the 1985 Act .
The double - eagle coins were deemed to be property for tax purposes in those old cases .
Of course , the judge�s rule was binding upon the parties and was followed by the defense attorneys at the trial .
Hansen , under the good faith belief defense , was able to present evidence that his specific client , Alex Loglia , who performed research work for Kahre , did not have intent to commit tax crimes .
This interesting twist allowed jurors to still hear the argument that Kahre was justified to pay workers based on the face value of the coins .
The U.S. Supreme Court had long before ruled , in the Cheek case , that a good defense in a tax - evasion case is a person had good faith in not following certain tax laws .
� The Supreme Court said , if they don�t have criminal intent , then they are not guilty of tax evasion , � Hansen explained .
� That doesn�t mean you don�t have to pay the tax , but it means you didn�t commit a crime and won�t go to jail for a felony . �
In 2005 , Loglia penned a paper that earned him an � A� from his law school professor Jay Bybee ( who just happens to also be a 9th Circuit judge ) on the gold - coin issue and the separation of powers .
His paper took the position that , under Article 1 , Section 8 , Clause 5 of the Constitution , Congress alone had the power to coin money and set its value .
Loglia�s position was that the judicial branch does not have this power .
� The judge applied those old court cases , but we were still able to make the argument that Alex was not criminally liable because he believed in good faith in the use of the face value of the gold and silver coins for tax purposes , � Hansen said .
� Loglia�s 100 - page legal paper was great evidence for the jury of his good faith belief . �
B eyond the courtroom , there is another significant issue with the Kahre case � it gives attention to the ever - decreasing value of the Federal Reserve Note .
One Euro is now worth $ 1.45 in FRNs .
A Chinese Yuan buys the same as $ 1.34 in FRNs .
Even the Canadian dollar is now more valuable than our paper currency .
Compared to the American buck , it�ll buy seven cents more in goods and services .
� Because of how much stronger the Euro is compared to an American FRN , the Federal Reserve just pumped up to $ 50 billion of FRNs into Federal Reserve banks to prop up the banks , � Hansen said .
� But when they do that , every dollar that you have in your pocket is now worth less . �
However , America�s other monetary system � gold and silver coins � does not decrease in value .
It becomes more valuable in terms of FRNs .
Americans , though , rely on the FRN , and its rapid decline will sooner than later decimate the middle class , Hansen said .
Take socialist Karl Marx�s theory , for example .
He believed the most effective way to obliterate the middle class involved a system of progressive taxation coupled with inflation .
In the Federal Reserve�s case , if the bank continues to inflate the currency so that everybody moves into higher and higher tax brackets , eventually everybody will pay 30 to 40 percent of their income to taxes in Federal Reserve Notes , all while the FRN decreases in value due to inflation .
� By using the gold coins , Kahre was beating Karl Marx , the socialists and the liberals who want people to pay more and more so they can have bigger and bigger government , � Hansen said .
� Kahre challenged the whole system and that�s why the IRS came down so hard on him and his associates .
� The IRS doesn�t want this going on ; they want you to use their fiat money and be forced into higher tax brackets through progressive taxation coupled with inflation .
That way there�s no limit on the money they can issue and inflate . �
O n Sept. 17 , after four months of trial and days of deliberation , the Las Vegas federal jury returned with its verdicts .
The courtroom was crowded as the IRS and Department of Justice filled the entire area on their side of the chambers with its officials .
Hansen was uncertain of what to expect .
He just hoped that the jurors listened closely to the evidence presented .
� I could tell in the closing arguments , as I was watching the jury , that they were sympathetic to what I was saying .
But what they were going to do , I did not know , � he recalled .
� I think the government , because it had packed the courtroom , was confident they were going to get numerous guilty verdicts . �
Rather , jurors delivered zero guilty verdicts .
Three defendants , all workers , were acquitted as well as Kahre�s mother , who worked as a runner for her son�s businesses .
Two other defendants were partly acquitted � the jury hung on one count each .
The jury also hung on all counts faced by Kahre , Loglia and Kahre�s sister , resulting in mistrials .
� I�m telling you that I have never seen such a dejected group of people leave a courtroom in my life , � Hansen said of DOJ and IRS officials .
� They were shocked .
Of course , we were pleased .
� The thing is , they had 161 counts and they did not get a guilty verdict on a single one .
They got a big goose egg .
We didn�t get not - guilty verdicts for everyone , but the government didn�t get anything . �
The IRS was supposed to notify the judge in late October if the agency intended to retry the five defendants on the charges that resulted in a hung jury .
The government waffled , indicating they would pursue another grand jury and issue superceding indictments .
More information will be known by mid-November .
Looking back , Hansen recalls what may have been a key turning point in the trial .
The government called three accountants to testify .
The defense asked each one , � What is the proper way to calculate income for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code if you are paid in a gold coin that has a $ 50 face value on it ? �
All three of them responded , � I do not know ; I�ll have to research that . �
� One of them had a masters degree in taxation ! �
Hansen observed , saying their answers made it difficult to prove the defendants willfully committed tax crimes .
� If accountants and masters of taxation don�t know the answer to this question , how in the world can they expect anything different from an ordinary person who is confronted with a dual monetary system created by Congress ? �
Hansen believes it was uncalled for to prosecute Kahre and the other eight defendants criminally .
The case revolved around a complicating and confusing legal issue .
It should have been handled civilly , Hansen said , but the IRS wanted to make an example of these defendants because the federal government simply doesn�t want anyone paying a lower tax than what the feds determine should be paid .

UPDATE - 11/2/2007
In recent sessions , Mukasey has avoided answering both broad questions concerning the use of torture as well as particular ones as to whether specific practices , like waterboarding ( simulated drowning ) and electric shocks , constitute torture .
Mukasey has also avoided straight answers on electronic eavesdropping .
He has indicated that he believes the president has power to engage in domestic wiretapping without a warrant and outside the law , regardless of restrictions that Congress may pass .
In the ACLU 's view , it is impossible for senators to fully perform their constitutional duty to " advise and consent " on the Mukasey nomination until he gives real answers .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : 202-675-2312 , media@dcaclu.org
Washington , DC – The American Civil Liberties Union calls on the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider the confirmation process of former U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mukasey for Attorney General as an opportunity to address the longstanding and unresolved issues surrounding the Department of Justice .
This is also the time for the committee to thoroughly examine Judge Mukasey ’s record from his time on the bench .
The ACLU is specifically looking for the Senate to get a four - part commitment from Judge Mukasey pertaining to the current problems of the Justice Department before allowing his nomination to move forward :
Turn over to the Judiciary Committee all documents in DOJ ’s possession on the authorization for wiretapping of any phone call in the United States without a warrant .
Disavow the legality of any interrogation tactic not authorized by the Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogations , and commit to providing key documents supporting an illegal interrogation program .
Appoint an outside special counsel for the investigation and , if appropriate , prosecution of any person who violated federal laws against torture and abuse , or who violated federal laws against wiretapping within the United States .
Create a blue - ribbon committee of civil rights advisors to focus on restoring the Civil Rights Division to its historic role as the nation ’s premier and nonpartisan civil rights enforcement agency .
The Senate Judiciary Committee needs to also probe Judge Mukasey ’s views on the indefinite detention of Americans and on the detention of material witnesses .
The ACLU is concerned about Judge Mukasey ’s past ruling in Padilla v. Bush , where only " some evidence " was needed to detain an American citizen without charge .
" Now that the Gonzales Department of Justice era has finally ended , the Senate can use this confirmation process to begin to repair the damage to our nation ’s largest law enforcement agency , " said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" The ACLU fully expects this repair to begin before the Senate Judiciary Committee moves forward in the confirmation process of Judge Mukasey .
The next attorney general must live up to the requirements of the position – ‘ to pursue justice on behalf of Lady Justice , ’ not on behalf of President Bush at the expense of the American citizens . "
Am I the only guy in this country who 's fed up with what 's happening ?
Where the hell is our outrage ?
We should be screaming bloody murder .
We 've got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff , we 've got corporate gangsters stealing us blind , and we can't even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car .
But instead of getting mad , everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say , " Stay the course . "
Stay the course ?
You 've got to be kidding .
This is America , not the damned Titanic .
I 'll give you a sound bite :
Throw the bums out !
You might think I 'm getting senile , that I 've gone off my rocker , and maybe I have .
But someone has to speak up .
I hardly recognize this country anymore .
The President of the United States is given a free pass to ignore the Constitution , tap our phones , and lead us to war on a pack of lies .
Congress responds to record deficits by passing a huge tax cut for the wealthy ( thanks , but I do n't need it ) .
The most famous business leaders are not the innovators but the guys in handcuffs .
While we 're fiddling in Iraq , the Middle East is burning and nobody seems to know what to do .
And the press is waving pom-poms instead of asking hard questions .
That 's not the promise of America my parents and yours traveled across the ocean for .
I 've had enough .
How about you ?
I 'll go a step further .
You can't call yourself a patriot if you 're not outraged .
This is a fight I 'm ready and willing to have .
My friends tell me to calm down .
They say , " Lee , you 're eighty - two years old .
Leave the rage to the young people . "
I 'd love to — as soon as I can pry them away from their iPods for five seconds and get them to pay attention .
I 'm going to speak up because it 's my patriotic duty .
I think people will listen to me .
They say I have a reputation as a straight shooter .
So I 'll tell you how I see it , and it's not pretty , but at least it 's real .
I 'm hoping to strike a nerve in those young folks who say they do n't vote because they do n't trust politicians to represent their interests .
Hey , America , wake up .
These guys work for us .
Who Are These Guys , Anyway ?
Why are we in this mess ?
How did we end up with this crowd in Washington ?
Well , we voted for them — or at least some of us did .
But I 'll tell you what we did n't do .
We did n't agree to suspend the Constitution .
We did n't agree to stop asking questions or demanding answers .
Some of us are sick and tired of people who call free speech treason .
Where I come from that 's a dictatorship , not a democracy .
And do n't tell me it's all the fault of right - wing Republicans or liberal Democrats .
That 's an intellectually lazy argument , and it's part of the reason we 're in this stew .
We 're not just a nation of factions .
We 're a people .
We share common principles and ideals .
And we rise and fall together .
Where are the voices of leaders who can inspire us to action and make us stand taller ?
What happened to the strong and resolute party of Lincoln ?
What happened to the courageous , populist party of FDR and Truman ?
There was a time in this country when the voices of great leaders lifted us up and made us want to do better .
Where have all the leaders gone ?
The Test of a Leader I 've never been Commander in Chief , but I 've been a CEO .
I understand a few things about leadership at the top .
I 've figured out nine points — not ten ( I do n't want people accusing me of thinking I'm Moses ) .
I call them the " Nine Cs of Leadership . "
They 're not fancy or complicated .
Just clear , obvious qualities that every true leader should have .
We should look at how the current administration stacks up .
Like it or not , this crew is going to be around until January 2009 .
Maybe we can learn something before we go to the polls in 2008 .
Then let 's be sure we use the leadership test to screen the candidates who say they want to run the country .
It 's up to us to choose wisely .
So , here 's my C list : A leader has to show CURIOSITY .
He has to listen to people outside of the " Yes , sir " crowd in his inner circle .
He has to read voraciously , because the world is a big , complicated place .
George W. Bush brags about never reading a newspaper .
" I just scan the headlines , " he says .
Am I hearing this right ?
He 's the President of the United States and he never reads a newspaper ?
Thomas Jefferson once said , " Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter . "
Bush disagrees .
As long as he gets his daily hour in the gym , with Fox News piped through the sound system , he 's ready to go .
If a leader never steps outside his comfort zone to hear different ideas , he grows stale .
If he does n't put his beliefs to the test , how does he know he 's right ?
The inability to listen is a form of arrogance .
It means either you think you already know it all , or you just do n't care .
Before the 2006 election , George Bush made a big point of saying he did n't listen to the polls .
Yeah , that 's what they all say when the polls stink .
But maybe he should have listened , because 70 percent of the people were saying he was on the wrong track .
It took a " thumping " on election day to wake him up , but even then you got the feeling he was n't listening so much as he was calculating how to do a better job of convincing everyone he was right .
A leader has to be CREATIVE , go out on a limb , be willing to try something different .
You know , think outside the box .
George Bush prides himself on never changing , even as the world around him is spinning out of control .
God forbid someone should accuse him of flip - flopping .
There 's a disturbingly messianic fervor to his certainty .
Senator Joe Biden recalled a conversation he had with Bush a few months after our troops marched into Baghdad .
Joe was in the Oval Office outlining his concerns to the President — the explosive mix of Shiite and Sunni , the disbanded Iraqi army , the problems securing the oil fields .
" The President was serene , " Joe recalled .
" He told me he was sure that we were on the right course and that all would be well .
' Mr. President , ' I finally said , ' how can you be so sure when you do n't yet know all the facts ? ' "
Bush then reached over and put a steadying hand on Joe 's shoulder .
" My instincts , " he said .
" My instincts . "
Joe was flabbergasted .
He told Bush , " Mr. President , your instincts are n't good enough . "
Joe Biden sure did n't think the matter was settled .
And , as we all know now , it was n't .
Leadership is all about managing change — whether you 're leading a company or leading a country .
Things change , and you get creative .
You adapt .
Maybe Bush was absent the day they covered that at Harvard Business School .
A leader has to COMMUNICATE .
I 'm not talking about running off at the mouth or spouting sound bites .
I 'm talking about facing reality and telling the truth .
Nobody in the current administration seems to know how to talk straight anymore .
Instead , they spend most of their time trying to convince us that things are not really as bad as they seem .
I do n't know if it 's denial or dishonesty , but it can start to drive you crazy after a while .
Communication has to start with telling the truth , even when it 's painful .
The war in Iraq has been , among other things , a grand failure of communication .
Bush is like the boy who did n't cry wolf when the wolf was at the door .
After years of being told that all is well , even as the casualties and chaos mount , we 've stopped listening to him .
A leader has to be a person of CHARACTER .
That means knowing the difference between right and wrong and having the guts to do the right thing .
Abraham Lincoln once said , " If you want to test a man 's character , give him power . "
George Bush has a lot of power .
What does it say about his character ?
Bush has shown a willingness to take bold action on the world stage because he has the power , but he shows little regard for the grievous consequences .
He has sent our troops ( not to mention hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens ) to their deaths — for what ?
To build our oil reserves ?
To avenge his daddy because Saddam Hussein once tried to have him killed ?
To show his daddy he 's tougher ?
The motivations behind the war in Iraq are questionable , and the execution of the war has been a disaster .
A man of character does not ask a single soldier to die for a failed policy .
A leader must have COURAGE .
I 'm talking about balls .
( That even goes for female leaders . )
Swagger is n't courage .
Tough talk is n't courage .
George Bush comes from a blue - blooded Connecticut family , but he likes to talk like a cowboy .
You know , My gun is bigger than your gun .
Courage in the twenty - first century does n't mean posturing and bravado .
Courage is a commitment to sit down at the negotiating table and talk .
If you 're a politician , courage means taking a position even when you know it will cost you votes .
Bush can't even make a public appearance unless the audience has been handpicked and sanitized .
He did a series of so - called town hall meetings last year , in auditoriums packed with his most devoted fans .
The questions were all softballs .
To be a leader you 've got to have CONVICTION — a fire in your belly .
You 've got to have passion .
You 've got to really want to get something done .
How do you measure fire in the belly ?
Bush has set the all - time record for number of vacation days taken by a U.S. President — four hundred and counting .
He 'd rather clear brush on his ranch than immerse himself in the business of governing .
He even told an interviewer that the high point of his presidency so far was catching a seven - and - a - half - pound perch in his hand - stocked lake .
It 's no better on Capitol Hill .
Congress was in session only ninety - seven days in 2006 .
That 's eleven days less than the record set in 1948 , when President Harry Truman coined the term do - nothing Congress .
Most people would expect to be fired if they worked so little and had nothing to show for it .
But Congress managed to find the time to vote itself a raise .
Now , that 's not leadership .
A leader should have CHARISMA .
I 'm not talking about being flashy .
Charisma is the quality that makes people want to follow you .
It 's the ability to inspire .
People follow a leader because they trust him .
That 's my definition of charisma .
Maybe George Bush is a great guy to hang out with at a barbecue or a ball game .
But put him at a global summit where the future of our planet is at stake , and he does n't look very presidential .
Those frat - boy pranks and the kidding around he enjoys so much do n't go over that well with world leaders .
Just ask German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who received an unwelcome shoulder massage from our President at a G - 8 Summit .
When he came up behind her and started squeezing , I thought she was going to go right through the roof .
A leader has to be COMPETENT .
That seems obvious , does n't it ?
You 've got to know what you 're doing .
More important than that , you 've got to surround yourself with people who know what they 're doing .
Bush brags about being our first MBA President .
Does that make him competent ?
Well , let 's see .
Thanks to our first MBA President , we 've got the largest deficit in history , Social Security is on life support , and we 've run up a half - a- trillion - dollar price tag ( so far ) in Iraq .
And that 's just for starters .
A leader has to be a problem solver , and the biggest problems we face as a nation seem to be on the back burner .
You can't be a leader if you do n't have COMMON SENSE .
I call this Charlie Beacham 's rule .
When I was a young guy just starting out in the car business , one of my first jobs was as Ford 's zone manager in Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania .
My boss was a guy named Charlie Beacham , who was the East Coast regional manager .
Charlie was a big Southerner , with a warm drawl , a huge smile , and a core of steel .
Charlie used to tell me , " Remember , Lee , the only thing you 've got going for you as a human being is your ability to reason and your common sense .
If you do n't know a dip of horseshit from a dip of vanilla ice cream , you 'll never make it . "
George Bush does n't have common sense .
He just has a lot of sound bites .
You know — Mr. they 'll welcome us as liberators no child left behind heck of a job Brownie mission accomplished Bush .
Former President Bill Clinton once said , " I grew up in an alcoholic home .
I spent half my childhood trying to get into the reality - based world — and I like it here . "
I think our current President should visit the real world once in a while .
The Biggest C is Crisis Leaders are made , not born .
Leadership is forged in times of crisis .
It 's easy to sit there with your feet up on the desk and talk theory .
Or send someone else 's kids off to war when you 've never seen a battlefield yourself .
It 's another thing to lead when your world comes tumbling down .
On September 11 , 2001 , we needed a strong leader more than any other time in our history .
We needed a steady hand to guide us out of the ashes .
Where was George Bush ?
He was reading a story about a pet goat to kids in Florida when he heard about the attacks .
He kept sitting there for twenty minutes with a baffled look on his face .
It 's all on tape .
You can see it for yourself .
Then , instead of taking the quickest route back to Washington and immediately going on the air to reassure the panicked people of this country , he decided it was n't safe to return to the White House .
He basically went into hiding for the day — and he told Vice President Dick Cheney to stay put in his bunker .
We were all frozen in front of our TVs , scared out of our wits , waiting for our leaders to tell us that we were going to be okay , and there was nobody home .
It took Bush a couple of days to get his bearings and devise the right photo op at Ground Zero .
That was George Bush 's moment of truth , and he was paralyzed .
And what did he do when he'd regained his composure ?
He led us down the road to Iraq — a road his own father had considered disastrous when he was President .
But Bush did n't listen to Daddy .
He listened to a higher father .
He prides himself on being faith based , not reality based .
If that does n't scare the crap out of you , I do n't know what will .
A Hell of a Mess
So here 's where we stand .
We 're immersed in a bloody war with no plan for winning and no plan for leaving .
We 're running the biggest deficit in the history of the country .
We 're losing the manufacturing edge to Asia , while our once - great companies are getting slaughtered by health care costs .
Gas prices are skyrocketing , and nobody in power has a coherent energy policy .
Our schools are in trouble .
Our borders are like sieves .
The middle class is being squeezed every which way .
These are times that cry out for leadership .
But when you look around , you 've got to ask : " Where have all the leaders gone ? "
Where are the curious , creative communicators ?
Where are the people of character , courage , conviction , competence , and common sense ?
I may be a sucker for alliteration , but I think you get the point .
Name me a leader who has a better idea for homeland security than making us take off our shoes in airports and throw away our shampoo ?
We 've spent billions of dollars building a huge new bureaucracy , and all we know how to do is react to things that have already happened .
Name me one leader who emerged from the crisis of Hurricane Katrina .
Congress has yet to spend a single day evaluating the response to the hurricane , or demanding accountability for the decisions that were made in the crucial hours after the storm .
Everyone 's hunkering down , fingers crossed , hoping it does n't happen again .
Now , that 's just crazy .
Storms happen .
Deal with it .
Make a plan .
Figure out what you 're going to do the next time .
Name me an industry leader who is thinking creatively about how we can restore our competitive edge in manufacturing .
Who would have believed that there could ever be a time when " the Big Three " referred to Japanese car companies ?
How did this happen — and more important , what are we going to do about it ?
Name me a government leader who can articulate a plan for paying down the debt , or solving the energy crisis , or managing the health care problem .
The silence is deafening .
But these are the crises that are eating away at our country and milking the middle class dry .
I have news for the gang in Congress .
We did n't elect you to sit on your asses and do nothing and remain silent while our democracy is being hijacked and our greatness is being replaced with mediocrity .
What is everybody so afraid of ?
That some bobblehead on Fox News will call them a name ?
Give me a break .
Why do n't you guys show some spine for a change ?
Had Enough ?
Hey , I 'm not trying to be the voice of gloom and doom here .
I 'm trying to light a fire .
I 'm speaking out because I have hope .
I believe in America .
In my lifetime I 've had the privilege of living through some of America 's greatest moments .
I 've also experienced some of our worst crises — the Great Depression , World War II , the Korean War , the Kennedy assassination , the Vietnam War , the 1970s oil crisis , and the struggles of recent years culminating with 9/11 .
If I 've learned one thing , it 's this :
You do n't get anywhere by standing on the sidelines waiting for somebody else to take action .
Whether it 's building a better car or building a better future for our children , we all have a role to play .
That 's the challenge I 'm raising in this book .
It 's a call to action for people who , like me , believe in America .
It 's not too late , but it 's getting pretty close .
So let 's shake off the horseshit and go to work .
Let 's tell 'em all we 've had enough .

Nextbio is a new search engine for the biotech - health industry , something you could have seen coming a mile away .
The nation ’s multi-trillion dollar healthcare industry is the equal sister to the information technology sector .
In IT , you have plenty of niche search engines , such as Koders and Google Code Search .
On the healthcare side , you ’ve got a bunch of search engines focused on consumers , but few serious sites oriented to the biotech business - research community .
There ’s the Canadian site , Lifesciencesworld.com , and German site , Bionity , but Nextbio appears to be going a level deeper , focusing first on gathering all freely available biological research on the Web , and organizing it so you can search for experiments or studies related to specific genes , proteins , or diseases .
It then plans to move into chemical search , and then clinical search .

Under a 1998 law known as the Vacancies Reform Act , acting government officials can remain in their posts for 210 days with the full legal authority they would otherwise have with Senate confirmation , with the calendar reset to 210 days once a nominee ’s name has been forwarded to the Senate .
As of Monday , there are 462 days left in Mr. Bush ’s term .
The president also has authority under the Constitution to make so - called recess appointments to senior jobs when the Senate is out of session — authority that President Bush has invoked far more often than his immediate predecessor , Bill Clinton .
But recess appointments often subject the White House to criticism that it is trying to circumvent the Senate confirmation process .
And because there is relatively little time left in the Bush administration , there may be less pressure , or need , to consider them .
The indefinite appointment of acting officials might have the same effect of circumventing Congressional oversight of nominations for what remains of the Bush presidency .
While exact comparisons are difficult to come by , researchers say that the vacancy rate for senior jobs in the executive branch is far higher at the end of the Bush administration than it was at the same point in the terms of Mr. Bush ’s recent predecessors in the White House .
“ You ’ve got more vacancies now than a hotel in hurricane season , ” said Paul C. Light , a professor of public service at New York University and one of the nation ’s best - known specialists on the federal bureaucracy .
“ In my 25 years of studying these issues , I ’ve never seen a vacancy rate like this . ”
Michael J. Gerhardt , a law professor at the University of North Carolina who studies the federal appointment process , said that he believed the large number of vacancies reflected a widespread fear by Republicans that the next president , whoever it is , will be a Democrat , and that there is no job security at the top ranks of the executive branch .
“ Republicans do n’t have as much incentive to give up lucrative jobs in the private sector right now , ” Mr. Gerhardt said .
This type of acne is characterised by white heads and small cysts
A study of 1,000 women found over 40 % those who smoked had non-inflammatory acne , characterised by blocked pores , large white heads and small cysts .
This compared with 10 % of non-smokers , the study published in the British Journal of Dermatology found .
However , the link between smoking and spots is controversial , and the authors admit other factors may play a role .
Nevertheless , the team from the San Gallicano Dermatological Institute in Rome said they felt their findings could lead to non-inflammatory acne ( NIA ) being seen as " a new entity among smoking - related cutaneous diseases " .
They dubbed it " smokers ' acne face " .
Teenage spots
The study was carried out on women because the condition appears to affect more women than men .
All of these findings will hopefully provide people with an extra incentive to quit
Colin Holden
British Association of Dermatologists
Of the 1,000 subjects , just under 30 % were smokers .
Of these 42.2 % developed acne , predominantly the non-inflammatory form rather than the one featuring red and swollen spots .
The researchers said the smokers in the group had half the levels of skin secretions of vitamin E compared with non-smokers , as well as other variations in skin make - up .
Those who had experienced acne in their teens were found to be four times more likely to suffer acne than non-smokers who had also suffered teenage spots .
Other factors have however already been identified in the development of NIA , including hormonal alterations , stress , occupational and environmental factors .
Environmental factors were found in half of the 10 % of non-smokers with the condition .
Such factors included the skin being exposed for instance to intense smoke or steam , usually in a place of work such as a kitchen .
It is unclear the extent to which these factors may also have influenced the development of NIA in non-smokers .
Nonetheless , the study fitted into a trend of linking smoking with acne , said the president of the British Association of Dermatologists , Colin Holden .
" All of these findings will hopefully provide people with an extra incentive to quit . "
This article describes a new efficient implementation of the Cooley - Tukey fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) algorithm using C++ template metaprogramming .
Thank to the recursive nature of the FFT , the source code is more readable and faster than the classical implementation .
The efficiency is proved by performance benchmarks on different platforms .
Introduction
Fast Fourier Transformation ( FFT ) is not only a fast method to compute digital Fourier transformation ( DFT ) — having a complexity O( Nlog ( N ) ) ( where N must be power of 2 , N=2P ) , it is a way to linearize many kinds of real mathematical problems of nonlinear complexity using the idiom " divide and conquer . "
The discrete Fourier transform f n of the N points signal x n is defined as a sum :
where i is the complex unity .
Put simply , the formula says that an algorithm for the computing of the transform will require O ( N2 ) operations .
But the Danielson - Lanczos Lemma ( 1942 ) , using properties of the complex roots of unity g , gave a wonderful idea to construct the Fourier transform recursively ( Example 1 ) .
where f k e denotes the k - th component of the Fourier transform of length N/ 2 formed from the even components of the original x j , while f k o is the corresponding transform formed from the odd components .
Although k in the last line of Example 2 varies from 0 to N - 1 , the transforms f k e and f k o are periodic in k with length N/2 .
The same formula applied to the transforms f k e and f k e reduces the problem to the transforms of length N/4 and so on .
It means , if N is a power of 2 , the transform will be computed with a linear complexity O ( Nlog ( N ) ) .
More information on the mathematical background of the FFT and advanced algorithms , which are not limited to N=2P , can be found in many books , e.g . [ 3,4 ] .
I would like to start with the simplest recursive form of the algorithm , that follows directly from the relation in Example 2 :
FFT( x ) { n=length( x ) ; if ( n==1 ) return x ; m = n/2 ; X = ( x_{2j} ) _{j=0}^{m -1} ; Y = ( x_{2j+1} ) _{j=0}^{m -1} ; X = FFT ( X ) ; Y = FFT (Y ) ; U = ( X_{k mod m} ) _{k=0}^{n - 1} ; V = ( g^{ - k} Y_{k mod m} ) _{k=0} ^{n - 1} ; return U+V ; }
This algorithm should give only a first impression of the FFT construction .
The FFT( x ) function is called twice recursively on the even and odd elements of the source data .
After that some transformation on the data is performed .
The recursion ends if the data length becomes 1 .
This recursion form is instructive , but the overwhelming majority of FFT implementations use a loop structure first achieved by Cooley and Tukey [ 2 ] in 1965 .
The Cooley - Tukey algorithm uses the fact that if the elements of the original length N signal x are given a certain " bit- scrambling " permutation , then the FFT can be carried out with convenient nested loops .
The scrambling intended is reverse - binary reindexing , meaning that x j gets replaced by x k , where k is the reverse - binary representation of j .
For example , for data length N =25 , the element x 5 must be exchanged with x { 20} , because the binary reversal of 5=00101 2 is 10100 2 =20 .
The implementation of this data permutation will be considered later , since it has been a minor part of the whole FFT .
A most important observation is that the Cooley - Tukey scheme actually allows the FFT to be performed in place , that is , the original data x is replaced , element by element , with the FFT values .
This is an extremely memory - efficient way to proceed with large data .
Listing
One shows the classical implementation of the Cooley - Tukey algorithm from Numerical Recipes in C++ [ 5 ] , p.513 .

This week 's horrifying events at Virginia Tech have sparked a predictable debate , with gun opponents claiming that incidents such as this occur because of the wide availability of firearms -- meaning that there should be more restrictions on these weapons -- while gun rights proponents point out that a student or faculty member with a concealed carry permit might have prevented a good deal of yesterday 's carnage .
As with most political debates , virtually everybody goes in already knowing the answer .
The events fit neatly into place to justify long - held positions .
The positions boil down to :
Guns are the problem .
If we want to prevent tragedies such as this , there need to be fewer guns and fewer people carrying guns .
Restrictions on guns are the solution Guns are the solution .
If we want to prevent tragedies such as this , there need to be more guns and more people carrying guns .
Restrictions on guns enable these kinds of tragedies .
People arrive at both of these positions through a combination of logic and emotional predisposition .
The first position draws on the fact that guns kill people * .
So if you have fewer guns , they reason , fewer people will be killed .
The second position relies on the proposition that self - defense is crucial to protecting not only one 's safety and property , but ultimately one 's freedom .
So if you have a responsible armed populace , they reason , you have a safer populace .
I do n't want to discuss the merits of either of these arguments .
There are plenty of blogs that provide an opportunity to do so .
Believing , as I do , that the solutions to many problems lie in developing technologies , I 'm more interested in exploring whether technology has n't provided a third option in the form of non-lethal ( or more properly , less - lethal ) weapons .
Consider this :
The new Advanced Taser M - 18 series has almost 100 % effectiveness rating .
It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro - Muscular Disruption ( EMD ) technology .
In police studies , the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9 mm hand gun .
The Advanced Taser over - rides the central nervous system , providing more reliable takedown power .
The advanced TASER has 15 foot range .
Granted , that 's marketing copy .
I 'm sure there are significant drawbacks to using a Taser versus using a conventional firearm .
But there could also be tremendous advantages in arguing for greater availability and use of such weapons among the general populace .
Namely , these weapons are not designed to kill people .
So let 's go back to the firearm advocates ' assessment of yesterday 's tragedy .
If there were students or faculty members at various points around campus carrying legal , concealed firearms , might there not have been an opportunity to stop this monster before he killed 32 people ?
Seems to me there might have been .
But if you had an equal ( or greater ) number of people armed with Tasers , would n't they have had a similar chance of taking the shooter down ?
Opponents of the concealed carry argument argue that students and faculty members would be shooting each other , or that cops would accidentally target an armed good guy rather than the shooter .
But that equation changes somewhat if the good guys ( including the cops ) are all carrying less - lethal weapons .
Dr. Helen quotes Jeff Cooper on the psychology of self - defense :
I forget when I first dreamed up the color code , but it was a long time ago .
I have been teaching it and preaching it , practically forever , but I never seem to have got it across !
The color code is not a means of assessing danger or formulating a tactical solution .
It is rather a psychological means of overcoming your innate reluctance to shoot a man down .
Normal people have a natural and healthy mental block against delivering the irrevocable blow .
This is good , but in a gunfight it may well get you killed .
If the blow is likely not to be irrevocable , is there a chance that a Taser - armed populace might even be more proactive and able to defend itself than one armed with conventional firearms ?
The downside , of course , is that people might be more likely to Taser others in non-life - threatening situations .
Individuals with a concealed carry permit for a less - lethal weapon would have to be highly trained , just as I assume are those who carry permits for conventional firearms .
And there would need to be severe penalties for frivolous or irresponsible uses of such weapons .
I 'm not saying that it would be politically easy to implement a scheme whereby people could legally conceal Tasers or similar weapons .
Gun opponents probably would n't be wild on the idea -- seeing as they are n't big on the arguments in favor of self - defense -- and gun proponents would probably look askance on any such proposal as the start of some kind of slippery slope .
But both camps would get a large share of what they want out of such a compromise .
Gun proponents would see more people armed and defending themselves ; opponents would not see an increase in the incidence or likelihood of people being killed by firearms .
( In fact , those numbers might go down . )
Plus , it 's a measure that need not be tied -- in fact , in order to work , it absolutely must not be tied -- to efforts either to restrict or allow greater access to conventional firearms .
Perhaps it could be a point of truce between the two camps .
As less - lethal weapon technology continues to develop , I think this third option will bear greater exploring .
UPDATE : Instalanche !
Thanks ,
Glenn .
* Yeah , I know .
Guns do n't kill people ; people kill people .
Well , let 's just say that people with guns do it more efficiently than , say , people with Hula Hoops .
Can we agree on that ?

COS design is tuned to provide efficient portable implementation of these concepts , specially dynamic message dispatch ( x1.7 - x2.3 slower than an indirect function call and about x1.2 - x1.5 faster than Objective - C ) as well as generic message forwarding ( as fast as message dispatch and about x40 - x80 faster than Objective - C ) .
On top of these concepts , it is easy to implement high order messages , class - predicate dispatch , multiple inheritance , dynamic inheritance , dynamic classes , adaptive object model , reflection and advanced memory management .
It also simplifies the programming of multi-agent systems , distributed systems or adaptive systems .
COS seems to achieve the principles 1 - 2 - 3 as well as existing mainstream scripting languages ( e.g. PHP , Python , Ruby , SmallTalk ) while keeping principles 4 - 5 in the range of C. Nevertheless , COS is compliant with POSIX threads and requires a ( moderately compliant ) C99 compiler .

From Black Agenda Report
" If this were a dictatorship , it'd be a heck of a lot easier , just so long as I 'm the dictator . "
- George W. Bush
According to an old saying , many a truth is often said in jest .
Not enough people took notice on December 18 , 2000 when George W. Bush said those awful words .
On that date the president - elect went to Capital Hill for a get acquainted session with Congressional leaders .
He emerged from that meeting with his well known smirk , and gave Congress and the American people the finger .
No one should be shocked when a man who tells jokes about dictatorship turns into a dictator .
Without fanfare , or announcement of any kind , the president recently signed a directive which states that in case of a " catastrophic emergency " the " President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government . "
What is a catastrophic emergency ?
Well , it is anything that Bush says it is .
The document , National Continuity Policy , was signed by the president on May 9 , 2007 and unceremoniously posted on the White House website .
It defines catastrophic emergency as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government function . "
That language describes hurricanes , earthquakes , black outs , flu epidemics , terror attacks , or mass demonstrations .
If location does n't matter , the president can usurp the constitutionally guaranteed powers of Congress and the judiciary because of an attack on Iran or a surge of casualties in Iraq .
L'etat c'est Bush .
The president announced that he is crowning himself king and thereby making his sick wishes come true .
What should be a headline in every major newspaper in the nation has been covered only by the Boston Globe .
None of the television networks have said a word nor has a peep been heard from Congress .
This announcement is consistent with other Bush administration actions .
In 2006 the federal government awarded a contract to KBR , a subsidiary of Cheney 's Halliburton , to build " detention centers " in case of a national immigration emergency .
Homeland Security has already established an immigrant detention facility in Texas , the T. Don Hutto center , that has incarcerated entire families , including children .
When U.N. human rights investigator Jorge Bustamante showed up for a pre-arranged visit he was refused entry and turned away .
Congress has also been silent about this blatant power grab and usurpation of its authority .
The National Emergencies
Act gives Congress the right to prevent open ended declarations of states of emergency , but that act 's existence is not very comforting .
If Congress wo n't even speak up about the National Continuity Policy , why would they speak up if Bush declared an emergency and told them to go to hell ?
Congressional Democratic leaders Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi would once again go along to get along as the Bushites began a reign of terror against democracy .
Reid and Pelosi have their own little reign of terror in Washington .
They have cracked the whip and told progressives to shut up and toe the party line .
John Conyers is one of their victims .
He has been in Congress longer than all but a few of his colleagues and has been called the conscience of the Congressional Black Caucus .
He now serves as Chairman of the House Judiciary committee .
Ever since the Republican victory in 1994 , progressives have hoped for a return to Democratic control and with it the return of stalwarts like John Conyers to committee chairmanships .
While Democrats were in the wilderness , Conyers spoke often about impeachment and unequivocally stated that he intended to hold hearings as soon as he had the opportunity .
In 2005 Judiciary Committee staff issued a report recommending that Congress establish a select committee to investigate whether or not the President Bush and Vice President Cheney had committed impeachable offenses .
Once Conyers had that power , he refused to use it .
He was forced into silence by Pelosi , who said that impeachment is " off the table . "
Conyers had a strange defense .
He called himself a liar :
" In this campaign , there was an orchestrated right - wing effort to distort my position on impeachment .
The incoming speaker has said that impeachment is off the table .
I am in total agreement with her on this issue : Impeachment is off the table . "
Just to make certain he was n't misunderstood , Conyers added , " Impeachment would not be good for the American people .
The country does not want or need any more paralyzed partisan government . "
It is time to stop letting Conyers and the rest of his colleagues off the hook .
They too are complicit in the ever increasing erosion of our civil rights and civil liberties .
A coordinated impeachment effort might slow down or even stop the Bush coronation .
The long years of waiting for Conyers , a committed progressive for decades , to chair the House Judiciary Committee were wasted .
His most recent statement is not much better than his self - repudiation after the November 2006 election .
He now claims to have " been supportive of that movement ( for impeachment ) .
I encourage that nationwide . "
Well , that is awfully big of him .
The next round of demonstrations in Washington should be directed at the Democrats , including members of the Congressional Black Caucus .
Democratic timidity only encourages the Republicans .
When a hurricane , terror plot or bird flu pandemic begins , we may as well pack our bags and join immigrants at the Hutto detention center .
Immigrants were just used for practice .
Bush is preparing for the real thing and there is n't anyone in a position to stop him who is willing to do it .

U.S. Congressman John Olver ( D - MA ) said recently that heAs Ralph Nader describes it , Olver and the rest of Congress are afraid that -- if Bush or Cheney are impeached -- they might declare martial law and suspend the 2008 elections :
How is Congress failing to remove Bush and Cheney from office based upon such fears any different from Neville Chamberlain trying to appease Hitler so Hitler would not attack ?
Appeasing bullies only encourages them to becomeaggressive .
Appeasing criminals only guarantees that they will strike again and commitcrimes .
Do n't Americans remember that the only thing that works is standing up to the schoolyard bully ?

Anand regained the title after nearly seven years
Anand , who won four games and drew the rest to stay undefeated in the competition , regained the $ 390,000 title after nearly seven years .
Indian PM Manmohan Singh has congratulated Anand for his feat .
The 38 - year - old chess player , will keep his world number one ranking , according to reports .
Anand became the world champion on Saturday after drawing his 14th and final round game against Leko in Mexico City .
" This time , it 's somewhat special because the field was very strong .
It feels nice to come through without a defeat in 14 rounds , " Anand was quoted as saying by The Hindu newspaper .
Indian newspapers hailed Anand 's victory on their front pages .
" Given that chess is officially played in 161 countries , he is our only global icon , " said the Hindustan Times newspaper .
Anand , who was born in the southern Indian city of Madras ( Chennai ) , divides his time between India and Spain .
His achievements have triggered off huge interest in the game in India with chess clubs mushrooming in many parts of the country .

There is no doubt about it , Ron Paul can win .
His opponents have a good excuse to challenge this claim , as they correctly reason that the only thing that can stop the Ron Paul Freedom Train is if fence sitters and likely supporters dismiss Ron Paul ’s campaign as a long shot and thus decide not to get involved .
Although this view gives his opponents a strategic advantage , it is n’t really justified .
Those who dismiss
Paul ’s chances are saying that a candidate who had the third most cash on hand after the last quarter , who raised over 4 million in a single day and whose following surpasses over fifteen folded the following of all other Republican candidates , simply does n’t stand a chance in the primaries .
Ron Paul ’s supporters have been accused for the past six months of spamming online and text messaging polls up to the point where the polls themselves have become meaningless .
During the last months they ’ve been also accused of spamming straw polls , campaign funding , GOP debates , online gambling , TV shows , Intrade markets , Democratic debates , traditional yard advertising and the campaign events of other GOP candidates .
So , if the Paul supporters really have the power and ability to spam practically everything there is to spam , what stops them from spamming ( and thus winning ) the general elections ?
Oh , I know , it ’s the pesky opinion polls is n’t it ?
As I have written earlier extensively on the methodological and general problems of these so called scientific polls , I will only highlight their most significant flaw : bad representation .
In general there are only two ways to do opinion polls .
Either you select a group of people who voted in the previous GOP primary or you select all Republicans and Republican leaning who say that they will vote in the GOP primaries .
Both give a bad and biased sample .
If you select all those who voted in the last GOP primaries , you will get a sample consisting of hardcore neocons only .
No wonder you get no support for Ron Paul in these polls .
Luckily , opinion polls are almost never conducted in this way .
Instead the pollsters use republicans and republican leaning who self select themselves by stating that they will “ most likely vote in the GOP primary ” .
Now , let ’s take a closer look at this self selected group .
In the last GOP primaries only 6.6 % of the Republicans voted .
The number for the 2008 primaries will most likely be seemingly under 15 % but above the previous record low 6.6 % .
In order to obtain a result consistent with reality , this would mean that out of all Republicans and Republican leaning interviewed , around 90 % would reply , in theory , “ would n’t vote ” to the pollster .
In practice the polls show that less than 5 % claim that they wo n’t vote .
This means that if 95 % of Republicans and Republican leaning would vote , the outcome of the election would be roughly as these polls predict .
But as only approx .
10 % vote in the GOP primaries it means that there are just 15 % valid picks in the polls ( those who really vote and the 5 % that say they do n’t ) and an amazing 85 % random meaningless candidate picks .
Compare this to a question “ which computer company would you support ” and say that 40 % would reply Dell , 30 % HP and 20 % Mac .
This does n’t automatically translate into Dell having a 40 % market share the next year if only 10 % of the interviewed persons would be buying a computer and there would be simply no way to tell which ones of those “ yes ” - answerers would represent the purchasers .
An interesting question is why so many people answer “ yes , I will vote ” to the pollsters when most of them clearly wo n’t ?
Partially this is a psychological phenomenon .
Individuals reply yes to the question since they reason that a virtuous citizen does vote and they see themselves as good people ( which they undoubtedly are ) .
An even larger reason is that pollsters try to force answers from the individuals .
Pollsters have to do this for two reasons : 1 ) a large amount of non-responses disqualifies most statistical tests and thus a large amount of non-responses would also disqualify the survey and 2 ) pollsters simply can’t afford to do a survey where enough people are interviewed if 90 % of the replies would be “ would n’t vote ” .
In order to get a statistically accurate result from 300 million Americans a pollster needs to interview at least 400 individuals ( 2,500 is recommended ) .
If 90 % of the replies would refuse , the pollster would have to conduct anywhere from 4,000 to 25,000 interviews .
The largest poll this year has interviewed roughly 1,500 potential voters and in around half of all the polls , the number of interviews has been less than 400 individuals and thus those polls can be disqualified as being too inaccurate .
If this is n’t enough proof , I can still point to the polls themselves .
I remember seeing one poll few months back where about 70 % of the GOP voters did n’t have an opinion about Ron Paul .
As readers know , that ’s not simply possible .
Even the old media frequently defines Ron Paul as “ the most loved and the most hated GOP candidate ” .
This is fairly true .
Neocons and pro-warians hate him .
Liberty lovers and anti-war activists adore him .
When 70 % of the GOP voters do n’t have an opinion about Paul it simply means that they do n’t know who Paul is .
Mike Huckabee got roughly the same treatment , even if he is clearly among the nicest GOP candidates and definitely someone to prefer over the greatly faulty four horsemen of apocalypse .
Some polls also suggest that 23 % have never heard of Romney and 23 % have never heard of Fred Thompson .
Furthermore 6 % did n’t know who Giuliani was .
On top off it all , between 10 and 20 % of likely voters do n’t have an opinion about the four so called GOP frontrunners .
Of course , in some cases , these figures include Democratic voters too , but it still does n’t change the fact that if you ca n’t name the frontrunners of the Other Party you probably are n’t a very likely primary voter .
In my previous article I stated that Ron Paul can win the New Hampshire primary with just 15,000 votes and that Paul can in fact succeed because so many past Democrats like Carter and Clinton have won the Presidency with extremely low polling numbers ( I ’ll return to Carter and Clinton in a bit ) .
I do admit that the NH example was a bit off due to the fact that the number of people participating in the GOP New Hampshire primaries where almost 30 % last presidential election .
Still , my previous analogy holds for almost all the other states .
Ron Paul can win the GOP nomination with less than 5 million votes jointly , simply because the primaries are n’t very voter attractive .
The last presidential election 62 % of the Republicans where pleased with their field , currently only half of them are .
Remember that the primary season is in mid winter .
In most of the US this means temperatures below 40 F or in some cases below 0 F .
Snow , rain and cold winds are frequent .
How many neocons would bother to leave their comfortable homes in order to cast a vote when their major alternatives are a drag queen , a Mormon , two grumpy old men and a pastor - comedian who they identify as a non -shot ?
Most will pass this one and those who wo n’t , ca n’t be unified beneath one banner .
The neocon vote is shattered .
Ron Paul ’s campaign is a very special one and it keeps surprising even me .
You ought to look at the opinion poll results in this light .
Back in 1975 Carter was polling 1 % and he became the next president .
In 1991 Clinton was polling only 2 % and he also won the presidency .
John McCain polled only 3 % in 1999 and he still won the New Hampshire primary .
Even if Carter and Clinton belong to the Democratic Party the comparison is still relevant .
Yes , the Democratic Party selects its delegates with a proportional system instead of the majority system the Republicans use , but Carter and Clinton did n’t win the nomination because of an even second place race , they won because they won most Democratic primaries .
This is a comparison between apples and pears not a comparison between apples and oranges .
It ’s true that the Democratic Party has witnessed more dark horses winning in the past , but this is merely a statistical accident and by now means does it imply that a dark horse could n’t win the Republican nomination next year .
While my professional opinion is that Ron Paul has a good shot at the presidency this does n’t mean that his campaign would n’t have hurdles to overcome .
If Ron Paul does n’t win the GOP nomination he has no chance of winning the presidency as a third party candidate ( he is n’t even planning on running as one ) .
Then there ’s a Clinton - Richardson or a Clinton - Obama hurdle to overcome .
However , the largest problem for a Ron Paul presidency is n’t the excellence of other contenders but the poor media treatment he receives and the total unpredictability of his own campaign ( the later is also among his greatest assets ) .
Anyone who has ever run a business or raised any funds knows how hard planning ahead is if your figures look like this : $ 30,000 on 11/03 ; $ 4.3 million on 11/05 ; $ 80,000 on 11/08 and roughly $ 1 million on 11/11 .
Another disheartening bit of information for the Paul campaign has been that many of his natural allies such as European libertarians , Cato libertarians and Randians have refused to endorse his candidacy .
One of my favourite libertarian authors Johan Norberg from Sweden ( who wrote In Defence of Global Capitalism ) is endorsing John McCain ; Reason seems to endorse Giuliani and the Cato Institute is cheering for the “ anybody but Paul ” - alternative .
Partly this has to do with Ron Paul ’s view on immigration but the major reason for the libertarian divide is the war .
In my view ( if a libertarian even could somehow justifiable be pro-war ) a libertarian should foremost be a libertarian and not a pro-warian and thus naturally he should also endorse Paul ’s candidacy .
While the Paul campaign suffers from these minor setbacks his campaign is not a replay of Dean 2004 .
That title belongs to Obama 2008 .
Both Dean 2004 and Obama 2008 started out as online candidates but they were picked up by the old media and henceforth driven by the old media .
Without this attention both campaigns would have quickly fallen flat .
These campaigns where picked up because the candidates were seen as acceptable and they had enough of support on old media standards .
Furthermore Obama is greatly benefiting from the fact that he is a celebrity and a minority representative – both qualities the media loves to dance around .
Ron Paul ’s candidacy is a stark contrast to Obama’s .
Paul is the real internet celebrity ( e.g. outperforming Obama 20 to 1 in Meetup groups ) .
But Paul is also a candidate the media naturally hates .
The media lives on political debates , controversies and conflicts and a president Paul would bring an end to many of them .
If Paul is defeated it means that the era of the old media endures – for now .
If Paul wins – after all this ignoring , ridiculing and fighting – it means that the old mass media is powerless .
It is dead .
It has ceased to be , kicked the bucket , hopped the twig and bit the dust .
If Paul wins the old media can henceforth be ignored and forgotten as it .
Matters .
Not .
Remember to tell your family and friends , especially the elderly as they are the ones who most frequently vote in the primaries and who ( according to some polls ) support Paul the least .
When they hear about Paul they will most likely love him and his message .
The chances are that you will find many Old Right supporters who are furious over what the three decades of a Bust - Clinton dynasty has done to the United States and they are eager to get their country back .

The Best of Lasse Pitkaniemi
We frequently hear that drunk drivers “ cause 50 % of all highway fatalities . ”
This falls into the category of “ tell a big enough lie long enough and loud enough and people will believe it . ”
The truth is closer to 10 % of all highway fatalities are caused by drunk drivers .
This certainly is n’t good , but let ’s at least put the issue in perspective .
Our government and certain self serving “ non-profit ” organizations have exaggerated this problem beyond any sense of reality to promote an agenda that eliminates basic individual rights , undermines our system of due process and heaps onerous penalties on people who have not injured anyone and may not have met any reasonable standard of “ impairment . ”
So where do the numbers that we hear being repeated time after time come from ?
The “ government speak ” term is “ alcohol - related . ”
This term was created to deliberately mislead and confuse the general public about the magnitude of the drunk - driving problem .
When you hear some “ expert ” state that 40 or 50 percent of all fatal accidents are “ alcohol - related , ” the intention is to make you believe that drunk drivers are responsible for causing all these fatalities .
This is pure propaganda .
The federal government defines an alcohol - related fatal traffic accident as an accident where someone died and a person involved in the accident had some measurable amount of alcohol in his or her system .
For example :
A sober driver hits a pedestrian who has been drinking , even modestly .
That ’s considered an alcohol - related accident .
A sober driver rear - ends a driver that has had something to drink .
That ’s considered an alcohol - related accident .
A driver has a single drink and is involved in a fatal accident that he did not cause .
That ’s considered an alcohol - related accident .
Do these sound like “ drunk - driver - caused ” accidents to you ?
That ’s what the government and the anti-drinking organizations would like you to believe .
Unfortunately , the media often parrots back the “ alcohol - related ” statistics to the general public which inevitably prompts people to push for more and more draconian penalties .
The common response when this misinformation is pointed out is for people to say , “ Well , just do n’t drink and drive and you wo n’t have to worry about it . ”
This is disingenuous at best .
The truth is that these laws will certainly affect many drivers who never even had a sip of alcohol .
The constant stream of misinformation over the years has created a hysteria about drunk driving .
This hysteria has made normally rational people line up to give away their constitutional rights .
The sad thing is that these rights are being given up for nothing .
They ’re being given up for the illusion of safety .
It ’s worth noting that the NMA does not support drunk driving .
No rational organization does .

Teenage brown belt Rebecca Kelly saved the day when her parents were attacked by a Taser - wielding junkie as they picked her up from a karate lesson .
The pretty 13 - year - old put her martial arts skills to the test after a drug- crazed yob lunged at her mother , Diane , 53 , with the weapon , which temporarily paralyses people with a huge electric shock , as she waited in the car for her daughter .
The karate kid , who was still wearing her white suit , jumped onto James Cordingley , 29 , as he was trying to drag her mum from their silver Vauxhall
Astra .
Scroll down for more ...
Prosecuting , Richard Hebbert , told Leeds Crown Court : " Rebecca pulled the suspect away and shouted ' What do you think you are doing ? ' "
She jumped onto his back , but in the scuffle he turned round and zapped her with the gun .
Speaking after the case , she said : " Not for a moment did I think of what danger I put myself in .
I just saw red and just knew I had to save my mum .
" Using the skills I had learnt through my karate lessons I ran and jumped onto the man 's back to pull him off my mum .
" I was really scared but in my head I was working out all the moves I could do to protect us . "
Violent drug abuser Cordingley , who had been using drugs for 13 years , was jailed last month for seven years after he pleaded guilty to attempted robbery , possession of a prohibited weapon and assault occasioning actual bodily harm .

On Tuesday September 18 this year he was desperate for money after his dealer threatened him over a £ 60 drug debt .
He had drank eight cans of strong lager and taken drugs , heroin and crack cocaine during the day .
He crossed paths with housewife Diane , who had just arrived at Kirian Karate School , in Horsforth , West Yorks . , after picking up her husband , Keith , 54 , from a friend 's wake in the local pub in Pudsey , Leeds .
Cab driver Keith was asleep in the passenger seat when Cordingley targeted them .
Diane now laughs at how Keith managed to sleep throughout most of the ordeal , although she was terrified at the time .
She said : " Cordingley seemed to come out of nowhere and opened the car door .
" He began hitting me in the arm and chest with something , screaming at me to get out of the car .
" I did n't know what he was hitting me with , but sparks were flying everywhere and he virtually dragged me out of the car . "
Luckily Diane was unhurt by the Taser as she was wearing a thick winter coat .
After Rebecca 's heroics the teenager ran inside to recruit three black belts .
In the meantime Cordingley had managed to get into the driver 's seat and was trying to start the car .
Diane said : " I was shouting and shouting at Keith to wake up .
I could n't believe this was happening , when my husband had been at a wake and had been
drinking .
" I was petrified he was going to drive away with my husband .
Keith looked really alarmed when he woke up .
I think it took him a while to register what was going on . "
Between them the pair were able to drag him out of the car , while Rebecca 's instructors managed to hold him down until police arrived .
Praising her daughter 's courage , Diane said : " She 'll never know how proud we are of her .
He 's a 29 year - old tall bloke and she 's only a 13 - year old girl .
" We did n't know it was a Taser gun he had , at the time .
It could have been a knife or worse , but she still defended us - she is so brave .
" We bought her some new trainers to show her our gratitude for saving the day .
" She loves her karate and I 'm so glad I offered her the chance to take it up all those years ago .
" I only introduced her to the sport to help her get fit and build her confidence - I never realised she 'd end up using her skills to save our lives and our car . "
Jailing Cordingley , recorder Jonathan Gibson told him : " Possesion of this kind of weapon is in itself a very serious offence , but it was also used in an attempted robbery and to cause someone injury . "
How to Describe Performance Comparision
I ’m writing today about a pet peeve of mine : amateur benchmarking that reports its results badly .
Let ’s say I ’m running benchmarks to compare three of my favorite programming languages : Unlambda , Whitespace , and Plankalkül .
So I run some benchmarks , and come up with this table of results .
Benchmark Unlambda Whitespace Plankalkül Church Numeral Factorial 342 days 167 days 350 days Tetration 270 days 410 days 450 days Busy Beaver 1,344 days 996 days 700 days Iterated Ackermann 20 days 43 days 50 days
Based on this information , I shall now make three arguments :
This data proves that Unlambda is way faster than Whitespace .
Whitespace takes 0.49 , 1.52 , 0.74 , and 2.15 times as long , respectively , for these problems .
So on average , whitespace takes 1.22 times as long ( 22 % longer ) to run programs that Unlambda .
This data proves that Whitespace is way faster than Unlambda .
Unlambda takes 2.05 , 0.66 , 1.35 , and 0.47 times as long , respectively , for these problems .
So on average , unlambda takes 1.13 times as long ( 13 % longer ) to run programs than Whitespace .
This data proves that Plankalkül is faster than either one !
In total , running all these programs took 1,976 days in Unlambda , 1,616 days in Whitespace , and 1,550 days in Plankalkül .
So which argument is correct ?
None of them , of course .
The last argument , regarding Plankalkül , is pretty obviously wrong .
Had I chosen different sizes for the problem sets , I could have made any of these results change by any constant factor … and in doing so , I could make any one of these languages perform best ( by increasing the problem set of the problem it wins at ) .
So clearly , I need to compare ratios of time , not totals .
The first two do n’t fare much better , though .
The problem here is that taking a ratio is an inherently biased operation .
I pick one result to serve as the base , and the other to scale according to that base .
If I then take an arithmetic mean ( what most people mean by “ average ” ) the answer can depend on which benchmark was chosen as the base !
There are two ways to fix this .
First , I can take a geometric mean .
In other words , multiply all the numbers together , and then take the nth root of the result .
This is good enough to make the results come out fairly .
Unfortunately , the raw ratios are still misleading to human readers who are n’t paying really close attention .
A language taking 10 times as long seems like a big deal !
But a language taking 0.1 times as long does n’t catch most people ’s eyes as much .
Or you might see it the other way around .
In any case , there ’s clearly an asymmetry there that is likely to give readers false ideas about the data .
The other method , which I prefer , is to take the log of the ratios .
You can then take the ordinary arithmetic mean ( mathematically , the arithmetic mean of logs is equal to the log of the geometric mean ) , and there is n’t any kind of asymmetry between results in each direction .
Positive numbers mean one language did better , and negative numbers the other ; and the magnitude fairly represents by how much .
You ’re better off either way than by reporting in ways ( like the original three ) that are just plain wrong .
We spend far more , but our health care is falling behind / Australia , Canada , Germany , New Zealand , U.K. spend less and do better job , studies say
Filmmaker Michael Moore might be onto something in his new documentary , " Sicko . "
These days , fewer Americans are buying the claim that the United States has the best medical system in the world .
With polls showing that health care is Americans ' top domestic concern , politicians are scrambling to propose reforms .
Consumers are buying lower - cost online drugs from foreign sources , and some even become " medical tourists " to obtain affordable treatment in other countries .
Studies show Americans are n't healthier , nor are they living longer than people in industrialized nations that spend half per capita of what we do on care .
For example , a 2007 Commonwealth Fund study that compared the United States with five other nations -- Australia , Canada , Germany , New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- ranked the U.S. health system last .
The study looked at access to health care , efficiency , equity and healthy living , among other measures .
And a 2000 report by the World Health Organization , the most recent available from the U.N. organization , put the United States 37th out of 190 nations in health care services -- between Costa Rica and Slovenia .
France was rated No. 1 , the United Kingdom in the 18th spot , Canada at No. 30 and Cuba a couple of notches behind the United States in the 39th spot .
In a New York Times / CBS poll conducted in March , health care ranked as the top domestic concern .
And in " Sicko , " Moore highlights Americans ' disillusionment with their health care system , comparing it to systems in other countries , including France , Canada , Britain and Cuba .
Many health experts say Moore might be glorifying other systems -- particularly the once in France .
Still , they accept his argument that other nations are doing a better job than the United States in providing coverage for all residents and making sure people have access to primary care and preventive services .
The United States has a private system for all but the poor and elderly .
The countries lauded in " Sicko " have national systems funded primarily through the government .
" We , unlike any other country , have 46 million people who are uninsured , and that raises a whole host of health and financial issues , " said Ken Thorpe , professor of health policy at Emory University .
Those issues are undermining the health of Americans , several studies have shown .
While the United States may have cutting - edge medical technologies , many people lack access to such advanced care , limiting any positive health impact .
" Ours is really is a sick - care system .
We have tremendous technical capabilities to deal with people with serious illness , " Thorpe said .
He argues , though , that it is far more cost - effective to prevent people from getting sick or at least catch illnesses early through better monitoring .
Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , a nonprofit foundation that supports health care research , said many of the problems associated with poor primary care can be traced to the fragmented structure of our health care system .
U.S. patients often have trouble seeing the same doctor on short notice , see multiple doctors who sometimes fail to communicate with one another and forgo care because they do n't want to spend the money .
" We tend to have more medical errors than other countries , in part because of this highly specialized , fragmented system , " she said .
" More things can go wrong and do go wrong . "
Moore 's film has been criticized for showing the positive side of health systems in other countries while glossing over negative aspects .
" There 's almost only positive attributes about the British , the French and Cuban system .
Invariably , no system is perfect .
I think this sort of detracts from his credibility on these comparisons , " said Stephen Zuckerman , health economist with the Urban Institute in Washington , D.C .
Moore ignores the fact that private coverage still exists in most countries with nationalized health care .
And he avoids showing solutions other than adoption of a government - funded system , often known as single - payer .
" He 's trying to be entertaining .
But if the objective here is to kick off a serious study about the British and Cuba as an alternative to the U.S. system , you need a lot more than what was presented in ' Sicko , ' " Zuckerman said .
In " Sicko , " Moore addresses one of the biggest criticisms of the Canadian system -- long wait times for care -- by asking patients in an Ontario emergency room how long they had to wait .
All respond that they got treated quickly .
But the Commonwealth Fund report found that both U.S. and Canadian patients were more likely to wait six days or more for an appointment .
Waiting times for specialists or elective surgery were shortest in the United States and Germany .
U.S. patients were less likely than Canadians to have to wait more than four hours in an emergency room , the report found .
Moore also implies that care in Canada , Britain and France is virtually free .
He dismisses claims that the French are overtaxed by showing the comfortable life of a French couple who even have money left over to travel .
But la vie francaise is n't entirely en rose .
The country has a high unemployment rate of 9 percent along with high taxes .
In France , taxes amount to more than 44 percent of gross domestic product , compared with 26 percent in the United States , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Still , the United States spends a higher percentage of its gross domestic product on health than any other country -- more than 16 percent compared to France 's 10.7 percent .
The United States spends $ 6,102 per person in public and private funds compared with $ 3,159 per capita spending in France .
Americans living in France generally praise the French system .
Roderick Beck , a former New Yorker who moved to Paris this spring , said the profit motive that drives insurance companies as well as physicians is the central problem with the U.S. health system .
" What are those insurance companies doing at the most fundamental level ?
Collecting cash and paying out benefits , " said Beck , 45 , who works for a telecommunications firm .
" Governments using taxation and a simple health care card do that more efficiently than an insurance based system . "
Bruce Gain , 41 , a U.S. journalist living in France since 2003 , said the French system is better because the government strictly controls prices and the number of doctors per capita is much higher than the United States .
" As far as access to medial technology goes , there are more doctors here to offer the latest treatments and drugs at affordable costs , " Gain said .
Davis , of the Commonwealth Fund , said the United States does not need to adopt nationalized health care to improve efficiency .
For example , she said , the Netherlands has a well - developed system for after - hours primary care that would reduce emergency room visits .
" There 's a lot we can learn from other countries , " she said .
Unhealthy comparisons
The World Health Organization in 2000 ranked the United States 37th out of 191 countries in health care services .
U.S. life expectancy is nearly three years shorter on average than Canadians ' and about two years less than that of the French .
The United States spent more than $ 6,000 per person on health care in 2004 , about double what France , Germany and Canada spent per capita .

No Joke : Colbert 's Campaign May Run Afoul of Law Doritos sponsors show but cannot support candidate under campaign law .
Oct. 24 , 2007  --
With its snack - food sponsorship , Democratic and Republican affiliations , and Sen. Larry Craig as a possible running mate , Stephen Colbert 's run for the presidency is hardly serious business .
But the joke could be on Colbert if federal election officials decide his candidacy is for real .
If his campaign plays out the way he 's indicated that it will , Comedy Central and Colbert 's sponsor , Doritos , could be violating federal laws that bar corporations from backing political campaigns , election law experts say .
" How serious can you get about running as a joke ? " said Massie Ritsch , communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics , a non-partisan group that tracks campaign finances .
" The Federal Election Commission does n't have a great sense of humor . "
Feds May Take Colbert Seriously
Federal law bars corporations from contributing to candidates , either through donations or in - kind contributions such as free use of goods or services .
Media organizations are permitted to feature presidential candidates in covering campaigns .
But no precedent exists for a television network promoting and fostering a candidacy of one of its own talk - show hosts , said Lawrence M. Noble , a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission .
And comedian Pat Paulsen 's 1968 candidacy predated current campaign finance regulations .
" The real problem comes in the fact that he actually has his own show , talking about his campaign , paid for by a network , " Noble said .
" These are the kind of things on slow days you 'd debate until the late afternoon at the FEC , but there are serious questions that come up .
In theory , he could end up having some campaign finance problems . "
While he has talked about his candidacy publicly only in character -- as the combative faux - talk - show host who favors " truthiness " on " The Colbert Report " -- Colbert is taking formal steps that are consistent with an actual presidential candidacy .
He has begun collecting signatures to get himself placed on both the Democratic and Republican presidential primary ballots in South Carolina .
And while he has said he's in the race to run , not to win , he has talked about trying to win delegates to the Democratic National Convention .
" I think a lot of people are asking whether -- they say , ' Is this , is this real , ' you know ? "
Colbert said Sunday on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
" And to which I would say to everybody , this is not a dream , OK ?
You 're not going to wake up from this , OK ?
I 'm far realer than Sam Brownback , let me put it that way . "
2008 Brought to You By ...
After being alerted to a possible election law violation , he and the network dropped plans to post signature forms on Comedy Central 's Web site , and instead created a bare - bones Web site for official campaign activity , www.colbert08.org.
On Thursday 's program , he held up what he said was a letter from a Washington election lawyer , and made the legal framework part of his schtick .
" In accepting corporate money , I promise to respect federal election laws the same way I respect the must - shower - before - swimming law at the Y , " Colbert said .
" As a candidate , I am under no obligation to promote the zesty , robust taste of Doritos brand tortilla chips , regardless of how great a snack they may be for lunchtime , munch time , anytime . "
He also said that , because of election laws , Doritos would technically be sponsoring not his candidacy but his program 's coverage of his candidacy .
" It 's illegal for my crunch money here to pay for the campaign , but it is legal for it to pay for my show , and the show can report on my campaign , " he said .
" Host : ' Eat them . '
Candidate : ' I just happen to like 'em . ' "
But even if Doritos has found a way around the ban on corporate donations , that does n't address the issue of Comedy Central 's promotion of a candidacy .
Noble said it would pretty clearly violate the law for the owner of a cable station to decide to give a talk show -- or otherwise hand over editorial control of a program -- to a favored candidate .
Comedy Central representatives did not immediately return calls seeking comment
Colbert 's Cash Flow
Noble said that one key threshold for the FEC to consider will be whether he's an actual candidate for federal office .
By one definition , a candidate is anyone who has raised or spent at least $ 5,000 to pursue office , Noble said .
No danger there yet for Colbert .
As he put it Thursday , he has raised " zero - point - no - million dollars " for his campaign .
" As a practical matter , I 'd think the FEC is going to stay out of it unless he starts soliciting a lot of money , " Noble said .
" If he was to start soliciting contributions , it could be a lot more serious . "
The FEC could consider Colbert 's entire campaign satire , which may allow corporate backing under the exemption that allows media organizations to report and comment on candidates as they choose .
But Colbert 's continued candidacy makes it more likely that he 'll actually have an impact on the election -- which makes him difficult to ignore , Noble said .
" Everybody is very cautious , not wanting to take this too seriously , or to say that campaign finance laws are going to stop satire , or what is clearly a joke , " he said .
" But he 's trying to get on the ballot , and he could in fact affect the election . "
If you read the various indie gaming blogs , I ’m sure you ’ve heard the news already : “ Within a Deep Forest ” creator Nifflas has finally released his long awaited atmosphere - em - up Knytt Stories .
The poor game ’s had to endure a hell of a lot of hype – in part , just from being the sequel to the excellent Knytt – but mostly from all the interviews , the previews , the hundreds of people who seem to have got their hands on the pre-release version – all of which seem to have come back ecstatic about new game .
It would n’t be easy for any game to live up to all that .
And yet , it does .
Knytt Stories is fantastic .
First of all , Knytt Stories is not just a game .
It is nine games – and no doubt in a few weeks , it ’ll be dozens more .
Rather than just make a straight sequel , Nifflas has instead opted to make an engine , a good level editor , and a couple of small and very distinct mini-levels .
The release pack contains one level , and there are eight more on his site ( which includes four “ third party ” levels ) .
All the levels are good , but my favourite has to be “ An underwater adventure ” , which returns to the last level from “ Within a deep forest ” and is the most game like of the lot .
Wanna see it in action ?
Tim ’s put up a video of the “ Strange Dream ” level on youtube :
This is NotKnytt .
It ’s way better .
In fact , it ’s so good , I ’m giving it a place on that all exclusive list 🙂
CAST your eye around Europe , and you find a funk about foreigners .
Denmark 's voters have given the anti-immigration Danish People 's Party its fourth successive rise in voting share .
The Swiss gave 29 % of their votes to the xenophobic Swiss People 's Party .
An anti-foreigner party is the second - biggest in Norway .
A fifth of Flemish voters in Belgium back the far - right Vlaams Belang .
In France , Nicolas Sarkozy won the presidency in May after aping the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the National Front 's Jean - Marie Le Pen .
He now talks of inculcating French values .
Next year , when France has the European Union presidency , he will promote a similar idea at EU level .
His new ministry of national identity and immigration has proposed quotas on immigrants from some regions that may be a ploy to keep out the dark - skinned .
He has passed a law to limit immigration for family unification , which allows DNA testing to prove genetic ties .
French policy is measured by comparison with recent actions in Italy .
After a Romanian migrant killed an Italian woman in Rome , Romano Prodi 's government approved a decree to make it easier to expel EU citizens who are deemed a threat to public security .
This pandered to the popular prejudice that Italy 's half a million Romanian immigrants , often Roma ( gypsies ) , are more criminal than other new arrivals .
But it achieved little .
Vigilantes attacked Romanians ; police destroyed Roma camps .
But as of mid-November , only 117 people had been served with expulsion orders ; far fewer had actually gone .
Why are Europe 's voters and politicians so stirred up ?
The short answer is that rates of immigration , from inside and outside the EU , are high , and have been rising for years .
A report by Goldman Sachs , an investment bank , suggests that since 2001 migration has added 0.5 % a year to Europe 's workforce .
It concludes that immigration in Europe has outstripped even inflows to America .
In many European countries the stock of the foreign - born population has never been higher .
As much as 24 % of the Swiss population was born elsewhere , as was 12 % of Belgium's .
The numbers alone do not explain why some countries are anxious and others less so .
France and Denmark have foreign - born shares of the population of only 8 % and 6.5 % respectively .
Some countries that are relatively more relaxed about immigration have much bigger shares : Sweden has 12 % and Ireland 11 % , for example .
One explanation is that an inrush of immigrants may not provoke a backlash so long as the economy is strong .
Worries about immigration from poor countries have been around for years .
The fresh element in many west European countries is a concern about immigration from new EU members in eastern Europe .
Since the accession of eight countries from the region in 2004 , followed by Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007 , large numbers of migrant workers have moved ( often legally and temporarily ) from east to west .
Britain , Sweden and Ireland opened up fully to workers from the east in May 2004 and have taken in many highly educated migrants , helping to sustain their long economic upswings .
Countries that have seen housing booms have imported hundreds of thousands of lower - skilled workers , often from the east .
Spain alone is thought by the European Commission to be home to some 547,000 adults of working age from Romania and Bulgaria .
Yet Spaniards , according to a poll this month for France 24 , a television station , appear untroubled .
They have the sunniest attitudes of all Europeans towards migration , with 43 % of respondents saying that immigrants are a boon to Europe and 55 % believing that they are good for the economy .
The same poll suggested that 42 % of Britons think immigrants are good for the economy , although fewer believe they benefit the country overall .
Yet even in Britain there is creeping anxiety about high immigration from within the EU .
This is partly to do with foreign nationals ( all those skilled Poles in London ) who now take roughly half of all the new jobs being created in Britain .
Other gripes are that schools , hospitals and roads are getting overcrowded .
After its experience since 2004 , Britain decided last January to keep its doors shut to migrant workers from Romania and Bulgaria .
Gordon Brown , the prime minister , aware of Mr Sarkozy 's electoral success , even talked at the Labour Party conference of “ British jobs for British workers ” .
He has pledged to restrict immigrants from any countries that join the EU in future .
Such talk may please voters , but the ebb and flow of EU migrants seems likely to be driven more by economics than by politicians .
In the short run the rate of migration within the EU is likely to slow .
Demand for foreign labour in western Europe may drop as housing markets slow and construction falls off .
Years of strong growth in the east , combined with a steady outflow of workers , have led to serious labour shortages that are driving up wages .
That reduces the incentive to leave , and increases the incentive to return .
In truth the bad demographic outlook of much of western and eastern Europe will make the continent increasingly reliant on foreign labour .
And one irony is that , for all the current fretting about too many foreigners , a chronic shortage of suitable workers may be felt most acutely in the countries that seem most hostile to outsiders .
Germany has kept its labour markets closed to new EU members until 2011 , but it now admits to a skills shortage .
This month it eased the restrictions on migrant workers in the mechanical and electrical - engineering industries .
Immigration already accounts for most of the limited population growth in Europe .
Ageing populations , combined with the natives ' lack of ability , or inclination , to do many jobs , mean that more foreign workers are likely to be needed .
By one estimate Europe 's native - born workforce will shrink by 44 m by the middle of the century .
Skilled workers will be in especially short supply .
Those calling most fiercely for foreigners to go home may come to regret what they wished for .

Nearly 17 years after troops returned from the first Gulf War suffering from mysterious symptoms the UK government is set to officially recognize Gulf War Syndrome .
The Manchester Evening News reported at the weekend that the Ministry of Defence will finally recognize the existence of Gulf War Syndrome after sustained pressure from veterans and their families , as well as many in the political and scientific arenas .
It seems Defence Minister Lord Drayson admitted the change of position to Manchester peer Lord Morris , who has been an outspoken critic of the way veterans have been treated .
Lord Morris has consistently sought to bring the problems faced by veterans to the attention of those in power .
The MEN quotes Lord Drayson as saying : " The issue of Gulf War Syndrome will be fully recognised by the Ministry of Defence and I accept on behalf of the MoD that this issue has not been handled well from the beginning .
" The department was slow to recognise the emerging ill - health issues and to put measures in place to address them .
We have apologised for this and I repeat that apology today . "
The MoD has reportedly written to veterans to tell them they can use the term Gulf War Syndrome to describe their illness .
They also said they are collaborating with doctors and other experts to develop a suitable rehabilitation program for those affected .
There is however no sign of an official announcement informing the public that Gulf War Syndrome is now officially recognised as an illness caused by service in the first Gulf War and no national media sources seem to be carrying the story .
If this does turn out to be an official recognition of Gulf War Syndrome it should make it much easier for thousands of veterans to secure pensions based on their ill - health .
The situation was previously improved for veterans following a landmark tribunal appeal in October 2005 , in which a sick veteran was awarded a military pension due to his illness .
At that time the MoD said it accepted Gulf War Syndrome as a " useful umbrella term " .
The allies have all been slow to officially recognize the syndrome but the UK has been one of the slowest .
Towards the end of 2004 the US government performed a u-turn and conceded , after years of denials , that Gulf War Syndrome does exist as a distinct disease .
The American 's official acceptance came after an official report from the US Department of Veterans Affairs  Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans  Illnesses .
The report concluded that , a substantial proportion of Gulf war veterans are ill with multisystem conditions not explained by wartime stress or psychiatric illness .
The report suggested illness had resulted from damage primarily caused by nerve gas and its antidotes , and organophosphate insecticides ( OPs ) .
All of these substances block an enzyme called cholinesterase which normally breaks down acetylcholine , an important neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction and important brain functions such as memory .

Hi all ,
Well , I ’m taking the plunge into hosting my own installation of WordPress .
None of this “ one - click ” stuff for me .
No sir .
I wget ’ed a tarball to my web host , config ’d it to talk to my MySQL database ( um … did that … once or twice ) , and now there ’s an almost - exact replica of this blog at http://www.protocolostomy.com
This post , of course , is not replicated 🙂
Also , the theme I use here is not replicated , because I can’t find the darn thing !!
S’ok , though .
I ’m having fun browsing through all of the themes out there for WordPress .
Why am I doing this ?
Well , in short , WordPress.com is unable to let me ( or anyone else ) have per-post widgets ( to my knowledge – if this is n’t true please enlighten me ! ) .
For example , I ’ve been wanting to use the AddThis button , or something like it , for a long time .
The button makes it a lot cleaner for me to add social bookmarking links to each post ( you can see the button on the new blog ) – this is much cleaner than adding 50 href tags to my post manually every time I post ( yes , that ’s how WordPress.com users are getting around this limitation – by hand ) .
In addition , I registered for an addthis.com account , so I can log in and see not only what articles eyeballs are landing on , but which ones they ’re actually finding interesting enough to bookmark .
DISCLAIMER : I recently took a job with AddThis .
However , it ’s still true that I was looking for something like this long before I knew what AddThis was .
Also , my working there does n’t really buy me much .
I ’m using the same WordPress plugin as anyone else who hosts their own WordPress installation .
I get the same stats and stuff … unless I find another interesting database query that ’ll give me more , in which case it ’ll be rolled into the product and made available , so I ’ll * still * be running the same code as everyone else 😉
Pros : Apple ’s first iPod - branded device with a widescreen display , wireless Wi-Fi antenna , and icon-based touchscreen interface , offered at a lower price than the company ’s same - capacity iPhone .
Includes iPhone - style music , video , photo , and web browsing features , plus updated versions of several classic iPod applications , plus wireless access to the iTunes Store for audio downloads .
Offers longer audio and video run times than last year ’s models , in a surprisingly thin package .
Cons : Feels less like a flagship iPod than an intentionally stripped down iPhone , with diminished cosmetics , interface and features .
Noticeably downgraded screen exhibits problems such as inverted blacks and dead pixels , which detract from video viewing experience , while shorter battery life , lower storage capacity , longer transfer times , and less impressive audio quality make it a surprisingly so - so alternative to the less expensive iPod classic .
Neither Apple ’s best portable video or audio device ; also lacks games .
Continues iPhone ’s overly expensive battery replacement program , despite using less powerful battery .
[ Editor ’s Notes : On January 29 , 2008 , we added a new section to the last page of this review , detailing Apple ’s release of a $ 20 software upgrade for the iPod touch , containing five applications ( Mail , Maps , Stocks , Weather and Notes ) previously reserved only for iPhone users .
On February 5 , 2008 , Apple released a 32GB version of the iPod touch at a $ 499 price point , without changing the device ’s other features or dimensions .
Due in part to screen quality concerns that were raised in our original review , found in multiple early units we ’ve tested , and never fully addressed by Apple , our rating of the iPod touch has remained unchanged since it was originally issued in September , 2007 . ]
If you thought you knew what Apple was planning for its first widescreen video iPod , you were sort of right , sort of wrong .
Surprising the millions of people who expected the company to add a hard disk and remove the cell phone from its iPhone design , the new iPod touch does remove the cell phone , but continues to use flash memory — now 8 GB ( $ 299 ) or 16GB ( $ 399 ) of it .
The good news is that both versions sport an 8 mm thick enclosure that ’s even thinner than the iPhone , and continue to include the Wi -Fi ( 802.11b / g ) functionality found in the iPhone , enabling you to — for the first time ever — browse the Internet from an iPod , as well as access Wi-Fi hotspots to download music directly to the iPod from the new iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store .
In essence , iPod touch is a stripped - down iPhone that shares many of the same applications but adds only two major new features to the formula : video output to a TV , and the option of extra storage capacity .
One color is available — black — and the headphone port has interestingly been moved to the device ’s bottom .
We ’ll be updating this piece with additional details and photos shortly .
New !
Watch our video of the iPod touch interface here !
Apple has proved capable of near - miraculous things .
The original iPod changed the world ’s perception of digital music by demonstrating the value of a cutting - edge 1.8 ” hard drive and a simple , intuitive user interface .
iPod minis became must - haves thanks to even smaller drives , colored enclosures , and lower prices .
Then , iPod nanos went “ impossibly thin ” by discarding hard drives altogether , eventually becoming the ideal “ take it everywhere ” iPod .
Every sequel was a smarter evolution of what came before , at roughly the same or lower prices .
i Pod touch ( $ 299/8GB , $ 399/16 GB ) departs from that path .
Rather than growing in performance from the company ’s previously - released fifth - generation iPod or more recent iPod classic , the iPod touch is actually a devolution of Apple ’s much - discussed iPhone , which showed how an iPod might look with a 3.5 ” widescreen video display , multi- touch - sensitive interface , and numerous wireless communication features .
To create iPod touch , Apple reused many of iPhone ’s components — the reason touch is the first product with an iPod name to have a bigger footprint than the 2001 original — but trimmed out enough to differentiate the devices and leave the iPod version noticeably thinner .
It also omits iPhone ’s most onerous limitation : iPod touch requires no lengthy cell phone contract , and is thereby intended to appeal to users in countries where iPhones are n’t officially available .
Unfortunately , by the past standards of a company that has proudly released products disruptive enough to threaten cannibalization or premature discontinuation of their recent predecessors , the iPod touch is not a truly great new device .
In fact , iPod touch feels as if it was designed quite specifically not to threaten Apple ’s recent cell phone initiative , putting the future of the 110 - million - selling iPod family at the mercy of the 1 - million - selling iPhone .
Given that it exists first and foremost to serve as a better - than - iPod classic widescreen video player , it ’s surprising that it steps backwards from iPhone in all regards : there ’s no other way to explain Apple ’s decision to combine a large video screen with a small battery , limited storage capacity , and an interface that looks and feels so stripped - down by comparison .
Despite its positive traits — particularly a wireless antenna that has the potential to transform the iPod media experience as people know it — we can’t help but feel considerably less enthusiastic about the iPod touch than we would ever have expected .
Though some users will be thrilled to have the ability to play with iPhone - like media and web features at a lower - than - iPhone cost , a less impressive screen and cheaper - feeling design touches render iPod touch less the rightful heir to the full - sized iPod ’s storied legacy than a quick fix for those who ca n’t wait for Apple to release something better — the first iPod in six years that has rated below our general recommendation .
Our comprehensive review , complete with numerous photographs , test results , and videos , continues below .
Because of the length of each section , we have included new Executive Summaries to help you skip quickly through the pages if you do n’t care to read all the details .
i Pod touch Unboxed : The Hardware and its Pack - Ins
Executive Summary : Like other iPods , iPod touch is sold with minimal pack - ins , which are interesting only because of a new , simple clear plastic video stand , and Apple ’s omission of the dock and wall charger included with iPhone .
Certain industrial design decisions seem to intentionally render iPod touch less impressive than the iPhone , particularly on its back ;
Apple compensates for this , and its larger - than - any - past - iPod footprint , with surprising thinness , but reverts to an easily scratchable mirrored back casing .
You can see a video showing off both devices here .
As noted in our review of the iPod classic , Apple ’s iPod boxes now come in two flavors : clear plastic for the least expensive models , and thick black cardboard for the more expensive ones .
iPod touch , like the iPod classic and iPhone before it , arrives in a cardboard container , this time with the image of an musician named Corinne Bailey Rae on the front ; one side of the box shows the iPod touch ’s slim profile , while the flip side has the product ’s name in silver foil , and the top and bottom both use silver foil to show its storage capacities .
The back contains text , UPC , Apple Part and serial numbers .
Apart from the iPod touch itself , which sits in a black plastic tray inside the box , wrapped in two sheets of protective film , most of the box contents are the same as the iPod classic ’s or iPhone ’s .
In addition to two Apple stickers , a Quick Start guide , and a booklet full of warnings , there ’s a pair of 2006 - vintage microphone - less iPod Earphones , a new iPhone - style USB cable , a black screen cleaning cloth like the iPhone ’s , this time stamped “ iPod , ” and a Universal Dock Adapter for use with Universal Dock accessories .
The adapter is numbered 14 , for those keeping count .
There ’s also an odd little piece of clear plastic that is n’t described on the box or the included Quick Start guide .
Once you strip off all the protective film that covers it , you ’ll discover that you can use it as a horizontal viewing stand for the iPod touch while it ’s playing back videos .
It provides fine support for the reclining device when placed underneath , rather than on the touch ’s side , where it is unstable .
Cosmetically , the iPod touch is a mixed bag , though its face is attractive enough that you might ignore the junk in its trunk .
Viewed from the front , it can most easily be described as an iPhone without the chrome front bezel , replaced here by matte charcoal black aluminum similar to the front of the latest iPod nano .
Apple ’s removal of the chrome unquestionably makes iPod touch ’s face less scratchable , but it will be a matter of personal preference as to whether you prefer the newer , darker look , or the more luxurious accenting of the iPhone .
We think Apple got it right the first time , and knew as much : iPod touch was designed to look less expensive , and succeeds .
Like the new iPod nano , the matte metal continues past iPod touch ’s face to its bottom , where it surrounds a centrally - located Dock Connector and a right - mounted headphone port ; thankfully , it ’s not recessed like the iPhone ’s , and works with any earphones you might have .
Unlike the nano , there ’s no Hold switch on the bottom ; instead , iPod touch has a black Sleep / Wake button on its top left side , similar to the one on the top right side of the iPhone , which also serves as a power on button .
Finally , iPod touch and iPhone share the same jet black frame for their glass - covered 3.5 ” widescreen displays and plastic - coated Home buttons ; touch ’s
Home button is a little smaller than iPhone ’s , but equally usable .
As was the case with the iPhone , iPod touch has a footprint that ’s not precisely the same as past full - sized iPods , but the shape ’s pretty familiar .
Though the 2.4 ” width stays the same as all hard disk - based iPods since the 2001 first - generation model , iPod touch grows 0.2 inches taller than all of these models , for a 4.3 ” height .
That ’s 0.2 inches shorter than the 4.5 ” tall iPhone , but still not short enough to fit properly in certain closed dock iPod accessories such as Altec Lansing ’s inMotion iM7 .
Putting temporarily aside our feelings about its wisdom , iPod touch ’s single most impressive design feature is its thinness .
Regardless of whether you like anything else about the device ’s cosmetics , the fact that it ’s only 0.31 inches thick — 8 millimeters — is an immediate attention - grabber .
Sure , the iPod nano is thinner at only 6.5 millimeters , but iPod touch feels very close ; slimmer than the 10.5 millimeter 80 GB iPod classic and the 11.6 millimeter iPhone .
Similarly , its 4.2 - ounce weight is under both the 4.8 - ounce iPhone and 4.9 - ounce 80 GB iPod classic .
Its least impressive feature is its back shell .
Apple ’s iPhone casing design very deftly managed to fit multiple wireless antennas and a camera within an enclosure that looked great , and thanks to an unpolished , resilient finish , did n’t unduly attract scratches .
Lacking iPhone ’s camera , cell phone antenna , and apparently the Bluetooth antenna as well , iPod touch ’s back casing had less to manage , and yet is n’t as impressively designed .
It has one odd black plastic upper corner for the Wi-Fi antenna — better than a stub , but not as clean as the iPhone ’s bottom panel — and a highly scratch - attractive mirrored finish .
If the facial proportions of the new iPod nano suggested that Apple was willing to compromise beauty for functionality , iPod touch ’s back proves that point , and then some .
A Few Notes on New Technologies Inside , and Absent
Executive Summary : iPod touch is a stripped - down iPhone , with a similar ( but not identical ) display and icon- heavy touchscreen interface , one wireless antenna , and some of iPhone ’s applications .
The iPod functionality is preserved and modestly enhanced with video - out functionality .
In addition to the previously mentioned missing pack - ins , you also lose iPhone ’s camera , phone functionality , built - in speakers , built - in microphone , side volume controls , superior screen , superior battery , larger suite of applications , and Bluetooth wireless feature .
You can see a video showing off both devices ’ applications here .
If you ’ve been following the hundreds of iPhone details that occupied months of attention earlier this year , nothing inside the iPod touch will surprise you : it ’s the same device , minus features .
But it ’s worth reiterating some of the novelties iPhone introduced that managed to survive the slenderizing process , and pointing out the important ones that did n’t .
Most notably , iPod touch still contains a 3.5 ” , 480×320 - pixel widescreen display with a multi - touch - sensitive covering .
Unlike any prior iPod , this display lets you access music , videos , photos , and programs using a main menu with touch - sensitive icons rather than just lines of text ; you use your fingers to touch the icons rather than scrolling through menus with a Click Wheel .
Each icon represents a separate feature or “ application ” on the iPod touch , which other than being less numerous and slightly less fully - equipped than the ones on iPhone , are basically identical .
i Pod touch has only two physical buttons .
One is the aforementioned Wake / Sleep button on top , which turns on and off the screen , and doubles as a power on / off switch .
The other is the Home button on its face , which serves to bring you back to the main menu from wherever else you might be in iPod touch ’s interface .
Since Apple has removed the volume buttons from iPod touch that were found on iPhone ’s left side , double - tapping the Home button brings up those controls , plus track and play / pause buttons , on any one of iPod touch ’s screens .
Holding
Home down for several seconds forces the currently viewed application to quit , and holding both Home and Wake / Sleep forces the iPod touch to reset .
i Pod touch includes two types of sensors that have never been in an iPod before : an accelerometer , which enables the device to detect when it ’s been rotated from an upright position into a widescreen one , and a brightness sensor , while allows the screen to brighten and dim automatically based on ambient light conditions .
Both sensors work just as they ’re supposed to , so you do n’t have to fidget with the screen to make it look right ; however , you can turn off the automatic brightness adjustment if you prefer and make manual adjustments .
The iPhone introduced three great audio - specific features that had never been included in an iPod : an integrated speaker that could play music or other audio when headphones were n’t attached , a built - in microphone , and side - mounted volume controls you could access without having to activate the screen or step through menus .
None of these features have survived to iPod touch , most regrettably the speaker , which made it possible to quickly enjoy music or videos without earphones .
Nor has iPhone ’s rear - mounted camera , which takes surprisingly great pictures , or its packed - in dock or wall charger .
You ’ll need to add pictures and , other than the included USB cable , provide standalone charging and docking solutions on your own .
i Pod touch still contains the iPhone ’s 802.11b/g - compatible Wi-Fi functionality , which when coupled with Apple ’s built - in Safari browser enables you to connect to web sites , YouTube , and now a wireless version of the iTunes Store without using your computer — assuming you have access to a home or office wireless network , or another wireless hotspot .
Apple has preserved and enhanced iPhone ’s on - screen keyboard so that you can enter web addresses and search terms for YouTube and the iTunes Store , as well as contact information , now even with characters from non-English languages .
However , Apple has either removed or completely disabled Bluetooth in the iPod touch , a feature which — like the iPhone ’s Wi - Fi — is hugely underutilized in the earlier device .
Other companies have used Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to stream audio and video content directly to or from a portable device and a computer , another portable device , or a dedicated listening accessory , but Apple has offered no such functionality with iPhone , and shows no signs of doing so with iPod touch .
More obviously , iPod touch also entirely loses the iPhone ’s much better than expected GSM / EDGE cell phone features , as well as a number of applications and features which at least sometimes relied upon them .
You can synchronize and edit contacts , but not send or receive e-mail to them , or create editable notes ; you can view YouTube , but not send your favorite clips to friends ; and you can browse the web , but not get one - touch access to stocks , weather , Google maps , or text messaging .
i Pod touch only gains one thing that ’s currently absent from iPhone : video out .
Consequently , you ’ll be able to dock iPod touch in certain Apple - authorized video docks and watch its video content on a connected TV .
For both physical and electronic reasons , you cannot use iPod touch with most of the portable video displays and docks previously released .
There have been numerous clues that iPhone possesses the same hardware video - out capability , but Apple has disabled it ; it remains to be seen whether this will change in the future .
From a software standpoint , Apple ’s approach to preserving and omitting iPhone features is only partially understandable , and seems to have been decided in a rush , with certain features unexpectedly cut from the iPhone ’s software even after iPod touch ’s manual was written .
You can tell how hastily iPod touch ’s feature set was developed from some of its on - screen displays , which still say “ iPhone ” rather than “ iPod touch ; ” like the manuals , we ’d expect that Apple will clean up these references at some future date .
We ’ll have to stay tuned to see how the device evolves — or does n’t — in the future .
Comparative Battery , Capacity , and Transfer Rate Details
Executive Summary : Despite the fact that iPod touch is Apple ’s most expensive iPod , it offers less battery life than the $ 149 iPod nano , and far less than Apple ’s latest hard disk - based iPods .
Apple ’s post - warranty battery replacement plan for iPod touch is unusually expensive by iPod standards , as well .
Between its low storage capacities and its slow transfer speeds , iPod touch takes a longer time than any other iPod to reload with music and movies , and more frequently requires such reloading if you hope to make best use of its video screen .
i Pod touch ’s most distinctive characteristic — its thinness — is also the one that makes us the most concerned about Apple ’s future plans for the family .
From generation to generation , past iPods have started thick and gotten thinner .
If that ’s going to happen with future editions of the iPod touch , we ’ll be the first to ask Apple to reverse course : the most expensive iPod video player needs the battery power and storage capacity to make the most of its screen , and in both regards , it ’s obvious that iPod touch has been starved to the bone .
The best way we can explain iPod touch ’s battery performance is to note that it ’s outperformed on both video and audio run time by every screened iPod currently on the market , including the iPod nano , as well as the iPhone .
During our first test of its battery , the iPod touch played back test iTunes Store videos for a meager 4 hours and 30 minutes , falling more than an hour short of the iPod nano , two hours short of the 80 GB iPod classic , three hours short of the iPhone , and five hours short of the 160 GB iPod classic .
This was with both the iPod touch ’s and the iPhone ’s wireless features turned entirely off ; leaving them on will only reduce those times further .
We were so surprised by this result that we repeated the test two more times with the same content on two different iPod touch units , and the results were different .
These times , video played for between 4 hours and 10 minutes or 4 hours and 30 minutes before playback stopped abruptly ; iPod touch was stopping playback when the battery was running low .
Eventually , both units went on to play video for 5 hours and 30 or 40 minutes .
Our table ’s 5:05 * number is an average of our best and worst testing results ; it remains to be seen whether updated firmware will enhance the continuous runtime .
With a Wi -Fi - disabled audio run time of 28 hours and 30 minutes , iPod touch ’s music run time was much better than its video performance — and solid enough that no one will complain .
Assuming you keep its Wi -Fi antenna disabled , it ’s surely better on pure run time than the best of last year ’s discontinued iPods , which played for 24 hours before expiring .
But it ’s still not up to the levels of this year ’s less expensive iPods , or the iPhone .
It runs for almost 2 hours less than the new iPod nano , nearly 8 hours less than the 80 GB iPod classic , and nearly 30 hours less than the 160 GB iPod classic .
Used purely as a music player , the iPhone blew right past its run time , too , with over 10 hours of extra run time .
Of course , both the iPod touch and iPhone are meant to be used with their wireless features turned on , and their screens enjoyed rather than turned down , so these numbers are on the high side : expect real - world performance to be lower .
Adding further salt to this wound is Apple ’s Out - of - Warranty Battery Replacement Program for the iPod touch , which — unlike the merely upsetting $ 66 charge for other iPods — requires you to pay Apple the same staggering $ 88 you ’d pay to replace the iPhone ’s battery .
As with the iPhone , Apple has n’t brought this price increase to the attention of iPod customers , who will no doubt be shocked when their batteries need replacement .
Hopefully by then there will be more reasonably priced third - party solutions .
If iPod touch lags a step behind Apple ’s full - sized iPods in battery life , it ’s far further behind even last year ’s models in capacity .
Bear in mind that Apple has n’t offered a 20 GB iPod since 2005 — prior to the release of the first video - ready iPod , which shipped with 30 GB at the prior model ’s $ 299 price .
By contrast , the $ 299 version of iPod touch ships with a stated 8 GB capacity — the same as the $ 199 iPod nano — and actually gives you only 7.08 GB of usable storage space , versus 7.24 GB on an 8 GB iPhone , and 7.41 GB on an 8 GB nano .
For $ 399 , you get a stated 16GB capacity , only 14.8 GB of which is usable — under one - tenth the space of the $ 349 160 GB iPod classic .
Part of each device ’s missing Gigabyte or so is due to formatting ; the other part is due to Apple ’s OS X operating system , which eats up a chunk of the space you ’d otherwise use for media storage .
Though some people may disagree on this point — particularly those who have grown accustomed to shoehorning small pieces of their larger iTunes Libraries into prior low - capacity iPods — we very strongly agree with the majority of our readers that the iPod touch ’s current storage capacities are simply inadequate , and a major strike against the device ’s recommendability .
Like the iPhone , the iPod touch will require any virtually any user with a video library to strategize what really does and does n’t need to be carried around at all times — an approach that ’s contrary to the “ your library in your pocket ” approach pioneered by the iPod family .
With two - hour movies consuming nearly 1.5GB of storage space , it goes without saying that the standard iPod touch will hold only two films and a 1,000 - song library , running out of space for other types of content .
You ’ll have to decide whether this type of experience is worth the price of admission , but in our view , it ’s not :
Apple clearly should have used a hard drive with more capacity for the dollar , and a better battery , and charged commensurately .
There ’s another issue with touch ’s flash storage ; it takes a comparatively long time to fill and re-fill .
It took 17 minutes and 15 seconds to transfer our standard 5 GB test playlist to the iPod touch in our first test — so long that we ran it again , and saw the time drop only by one minute .
This same test took under 6 minutes on the 80 GB iPod classic , under 8 minutes on the 160 GB iPod classic , and 8 and a half minutes on the iPod nano .
iPod touch took about twice as long to transfer the same files as the nano ; it was roughly as slow as the iPhone .
Since you can expect to be re-loading videos on to it with some frequency , be aware that you ca n’t just sync and run — the process will require you to sit for a while .
Overall , the iPod touch is n’t too impressive when it comes to battery performance , storage capacity , or transfer times .
In our view , there ’s something very wrong when an $ 199 iPod nano runs longer , has more usable storage capacity , and transfers files faster than a $ 299 widescreen iPod .
It ’s not that the iPod nano ’s an overachiever — it ’s just that iPod touch is too thin and too slow for its own good .
Mostly an iPod : iTunes Synchronization & Accessory Compatibility
Executive Summary : Unlike iPhone , iTunes treats iPod touch almost entirely like a standard iPod : you can still manually manage audio and video content , synchronizing photos , contact information , and calendars through separate tabs .
However , iPod touch is the first iPod to lack “ Disk Mode , ” so you cannot easily store files on it like a disk drive , and its iPod accessory compatibility is even more spotty than the recently - released iPod classic and iPod nano .
Thankfully , it is more car accessory - compatible than the iPhone , but it lacks support for voice recorders , the iPod Radio Remote , and other previously supported accessories .
It is also a surprising step behind the iPod classic and iPod nano in video - out support , lacking 480 p output capabilities .
Ever since the release of the iPod shuffle in early 2005 , experts and casual iPod users alike have been scratching their heads over a fairly simple question : “ What is an iPod ? ” — or stated differently , “ At what point can Apple take enough away from a device that it stops being an iPod ? ”
Relative to the iPod shuffle , which lost the screen , Click Wheel , and much more from its older brother iPod mini , iPod touch loses comparatively little .
For instance , iTunes synchronization is still classic iPod - style : if you manually manage the iPod touch , you can still drag and drop songs , videos , TV shows , and podcasts directly from the iTunes Library into its storage space , rather than being forced to synchronize playlists full of content or use special tabs , as you are with iPhone and Apple TV .
You can also still play content directly from the iPod touch back through the connected computer ’s screen and speakers , too .
Photos , contacts , and calendars still require synchronization through separate iTunes screens , as they always have .
Access to that content is almost the same on the iPod touch as it is on the iPhone .
As described in the next section , Apple makes all your audio , video , and photo content available in scrollable menus that look much like the ones on last year ’s video iPods and this year ’s iPod classic and nano models .
Just like the iPhone , it then improves upon those menus .
You lose little from past iPods , or the iPhone , with the iPod touch .
One surprise is that , unlike all other iPods released to date , iPod touch ca n’t be used for Disk Mode .
In what we believe to be the start of a trend , Apple does n’t allow the iPod touch to be used as a mass storage device , so the only way it will generally communicate with your PC or Mac is through iTunes .
You ca n’t see it as a disk drive in Windows or the Mac OS Finder , so you ca n’t otherwise drop files onto it , or pull them off .
With such modest storage space , this might appear to make some sense , but even the 512MB iPod shuffle could store files — why not the iPod touch ?
Two small surprises are the loss of Notes and games .
Apple released the original Notes application for black and white iPods , enabling them to display simple text documents , then added hyperlinking , image and sound linking , and eventually video linking as well .
Then for iPhone , it changed Notes , allowing you to create your own short text documents with the on - screen keyboard , and either mail them or store them on the device .
iPod touch does n’t have either version of Notes , which might seem like a small loss given the inclusion of Safari for web browsing , but it does mean that you ca n’t access language translation tools such as those developed by Talking Panda or Wuhan Venus unless you ’re near a Wi -Fi network , which is an unnecessary bummer .
Similarly , though iPod touch can play Safari browser - based games , it does n’t support downloadable titles that can be played away from a wireless network .
Apple could easily add both Notes and games to iPod touch in the future , but has made no commitment to do so .
There ’s one thing that you gain relative to the iPhone , and lose relative to past iPods : video - out .
Like color iPod 4G and 5G models , Apple has enabled the iPod touch to perform video both on its own screen and on a connected video display , though it has — as with the new iPod classic and iPod nano — locked this video output feature so that you ca n’t take advantage of it unless you buy new Apple - authorized video accessories .
Unfortunately , this means that iPod touch wo n’t work in any of the portable video display docks that were previously released under the Made for iPod program , and there ’s another surprise : iPod touch ’s top output capabilities are actually less impressive than both iPod classic ’s and nano’s .
Whereas the cheaper models can display 480p or 576 p signals through a component video cable , iPod touch only displays at 480i or 576i .
This is only an improvement over past iPod models .
Non-video accessories we have tested so far appear to be more compatible with the iPod touch than with the iPhone , but not as compatible as with the iPod classic and nano .
Though there were still some remaining combination car charging and audio kits that were hassled by the iPhone , they now work properly with iPod touch .
Similarly , speaker systems and docks that previously caused the iPhone to bring up a “ turn off the wireless antennas ” nag screen no longer have this message on iPod touch .
They sound better , too , as touch does n’t have a cell phone antenna to generate screeching TDMA signaling noises — one of the reasons the iPhone needs all - new , shielded speakers .
Other accessories are a crap shoot .
FM transmitters and other devices that relied upon on - iPod screen displays for menu interaction generally do not work properly here , as with iPhone , but ones with built - in screens generally do .
Any device that treated an iPod like a mass storage device , such as the iPod Camera Connector , wo n’t work on iPod touch .
That includes voice recorders that work on the fifth - generation iPod and iPod classic , second - and third - generation iPod nanos ; they do not work on iPod touch .
And somewhat inexplicably , the iPod Radio Remote does not work with the iPod touch , either .
It comes up as an unsupported accessory , just as it does with the iPhone .
In sum , the iPod touch may be an “ iPod ” by the general standards of the word , but it only adds further confusion to the iPod accessory pool : there ’s no longer a line above which certain accessories are guaranteed to work or fail , but rather , because of repeated mid-production revisions to products , a huge mess that can only be sorted out by the companies that make the accessories — or better yet , Apple itself .
If you need something that ’s guaranteed to work completely with iPod touch , our advice is to check the manufacturer ’s web site , then follow up your research with their customer service representatives ; if you ca n’t get an accurate or timely answer , look elsewhere .
Performance as an iPod : Music , Video , and Photos
Executive Summary :
As a music , video , and photo device , iPod touch is similar to the iPhone , but not quite as good .
It has a superb interface for playing back and navigating music — the iPod family ’s best ever — but its audio quality is a step behind the less expensive iPod classic’s .
Video playback is almost identical to the iPhone ’s , but hampered noticeably by iPod touch ’s lower - quality screen .
The photo experience is steps above any other iPod , with zooming , rotating , and superior thumbnail browsing , though the iPod 5 G ’s larger suite of transition effects are gone , and on - TV slideshows now require expensive video cables .
You can see a video of both devices ’ music and photo interfaces here .
Back in January , Apple CEO Steve Jobs referred to the iPhone as the company ’s “ best iPod ever , ” and as it turned out , he ’s still right : other than capacity differences and its restricted video - out functionality , there ’s nothing the iPod touch has that iPhone lacks in the iPod department .
Featuring the same audio ( MP3 , AAC , WAV , Audible , Apple Lossless ) and video ( MP4/ H.264 ) format support as iPod classic and nano 3G , iPod touch ’s major step forward over past iPods is the media interface it borrows from iPhone , with the following key features .
The new Now Playing screen : Populated with roughly 320×320 - pixel album art in the center , iPod touch makes the simple act of listening to music more visual than ever .
Track , play / pause , and volume controls appear at the bottom of the screen , with artist , song , and album details in small text above the artwork .
Tapping once brings up a scrubber to change your position in the song , plus shuffle and repeat icons ; tapping twice flips over the album cover to show stars for rating the track , and other song titles from the album that can be selected non-sequentially .
Cover Flow :
In addition to iPod - style scrolling lists of names and titles that can be accessed with flicks or drags of your finger against the screen , turning iPod touch on its side brings up album covers for individual songs that can be scrolled through and selected at will .
This mode , Cover Flow , is a much - improved version of the same - named feature built into iTunes , and works just like the iPhone .
The only conspicuously absent iPod classic / nano feature from iPod touch is , ironically , search : even with the ability to call up an on - screen keyboard in other iPod touch applications , you ca n’t type in letters to find related media content on the device .
Part of this is because touch ’s scrolling audio lists have alphabetical letters on their right sides , enabling you to point to any letter and arrive there instantly , and part of it is likely because the device ’s limited storage capacity — like iPhone — does n’t leave as much room for long lists of music if you ’ve stored videos and photos on board , too .
Still , some people might like a cross-media search feature , particularly one that could save results as bookmarks for later reference .
That brings us to audio quality .
Two and a half years ago , when certain audiophiles were praising the original iPod shuffle as the best - sounding iPod in the family , Apple surprised some users by agreeing : audio quality was , a company representative explained , a “ moving target , ” and with that shuffle as a gold standard , the goal would be to bring other members of the family up to that level .
Since then , a lot has changed : Apple did improve the sound of the subsequently - released fifth - generation iPod and iPod nanos , and it noticeably reduced the overall quality of second - generation iPod shuffles .
Though they did n’t demonstrate that Apple was willing to guarantee superb quality all the way up the line , the changes made sense : pay more , get better sound .
Apple ’s near - simultaneous release of the iPod classic and the iPod touch has changed the equation once again .
The less expensive iPod classic now boasts Apple ’s best - sounding audio : when used with even premium earphones , the classic ’s sound is comparatively cleaner , and has hints of additional bass and treble relative to the iPod touch .
Songs with strong bass growl a little more , and with the right earphones , they also have greater apparent depth , thanks in part to the treble , while a noticeable hiss in the iPod touch ’s signal adds to a sense that the music is a tiny bit flatter in the midrange .
The hiss is only a hair more evident than in the fifth - generation iPod , which appears to have been based on either the same or a very similar audio chip , and otherwise shares iPod touch ’s signature .
The good news in all of this is that average users will almost certainly never notice iPod touch ’s hiss , as it ’s only detectible with good earphones , and touch ’s sound is almost identical to the nearly unobjectionable 5G .
That said , we ’d advise serious listeners to consider iPod classic a smarter choice , not just because of its cleaner sound , but also because it ’s less expensive and offers far more storage capacity to take advantage of good earphones .
There ’s only one difference in the way videos are handled on iPod touch from the way they ’re handled on iPhone : iPod touch has its own Videos icon on its main screen , rather than buried one level below an all - purpose iPod media icon .
Once that icon has been selected , the display is the same , combining movies , TV shows , and other video content into one segregated list with small icons and bare details to help you make your selection .
Battery performance aside , the video playback experience is almost the same on iPod touch as it is on iPhone , which is to say generally better in most regards than on a fifth - generation iPod , iPod classic , or iPod nano .
In addition to packing twice the actual pixel - level detail of all three of those devices , iPod touch ’s screen is an inch wider on the diagonal , and a widescreen rather than a 4:3 TV - style display .
Overlays do n’t crowd the video , as they do on the iPod classic and nano , and you still have the iPhone - inspired ability to instantly toggle between widescreen or cropped full - screen presentation of content .
i Pod touch ’s screen colors ( top ) do n’t look as good as iPhone ’s ( bottom ) when viewed off - angle
All video is watched on iPod touch ’s side , rather than when it ’s standing upright , and pausing , skipping through , or adjusting the volume is as simple as tapping once on the screen to bring up those controls , then again to make them disappear .
Our one and only complaint about this feature , common to the iPhone , is that scrubbing — choosing your place in the video — is unnecessarily difficult thanks to a hair - fine cursor that you ca n’t control with any precision .
A magnifying glass feature , as with text editing , would help this a lot .
Dark colors tend to invert on iPod touch ’s screen ; the video shown in iTunes ( above ) looks very different on touch
Video suffers relative to the iPhone in two ways .
First , their screens are n’t the same , and though iPod touch ’s screen contrast initially seems a bit better , with darker blacks , it turns out that the blacks go negative , creating a shimmering effect in dark spots , especially when they ’re viewed on the wrong angle .
The iPod touch screen ’s optimal viewing angle is fairly shallow , as well , making the screen look washed out when viewed from the side .
These were n’t problems on recent hard disk - based iPods , or on the iPhone , and there still are n’t contrast or color controls to help you correct the deficiencies .
One of our two purchased iPod touch units also had two dead or stuck pixels on its screen , which were noticeable whenever the screen went black .
In this closer crop of the above screen , you can see the shadow of her head on his chest , inverting rather than darkening it
i Pod touch ’s photo functionality is generally a major improvement over all other iPods , but a little short of the iPhone ’s performance .
Once again , you can select from a list of all of the separate albums that iTunes has synchronized from iPhoto , Photoshop Elements , Aperture , or a My Pictures folder , and iPod touch will show you a collection of twenty thumbnails at a time , scrolling smoothly to the next 20 with every finger swipe , and opening a picture into full - screen mode with a tap .
You can zoom in on any picture by putting two fingers on the screen and expanding them , zoom out by pinching two fingers together , and rotate the picture by turning iPod touch on its side .
Flicks left or right scroll through pictures , and a tap on the bottom of the screen will either start a slideshow — complete with one of 5 limited transition effects , like iPhone ’s — or let you choose the current photo as your Home screen ’s background image , scaled and positioned to your liking .
Gone are your abilities to e-mail photos , add them to a .
Mac web photo gallery , or take new photos with a built in camera , as iPod touch once again is n’t designed to serve as a creation or communication device , but rather almost exclusively as a player .
Wi -Fi : Safari , YouTube , and the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store , Nothing More
Executive Summary : Though Apple does n’t currently make the most of the hardware , the addition of a Wi - Fi ( 802.11b / g ) antenna to the iPod will be a potent new weapon in Apple ’s arsenal against competitors .
Between its dead - simple setup , Safari web browser , YouTube video player and wireless access to the iTunes Store , the iPod touch could easily evolve into a powerful bed - or couch - friendly tool for new music discovery and purchasing .
It ’s limited only by the fact that users of the feature are most likely to be accessing it in the same places that they ’re already using wireless computers with less limited features .
You can see a video of the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store here .
From an iPod user ’s perspective , the iPod touch ’s biggest feature gain over prior iPods — apart from the screen and interface — is its new 802.11 b or 802.11g wireless network - compatible Wi-Fi antenna .
Just as with the iPhone , iPod touch ’s Wi-Fi functionality provides access to two types of applications : Apple ’s Safari web browser , and other purpose - specific programs that are whittled down versions of more sophisticated web sites or computer programs .
Turning on Wi-Fi is simple .
In the iPod touch settings menu , you select Wi -Fi , pick your preferred network from a list , and enter the password .
As with iPhone , iPod touch figures out the 802.11 b or g network ’s security protocol and other necessary settings without any work on your part — unless you ’ve set up the network to require an additional level of manual configuration — and within seconds , you ’re ready to start checking out web pages , YouTube content , and the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store .
A three - bar network strength monitor on the top left of the screen lets you know that Wi -Fi is on , and whether you ’re in danger of losing your connection to the network .
As with its music , video , and photo features , iPod touch ’s web - based applications are highly similar to the ones on the iPhone .
Safari provides a browsing experience that , apart from its lack of support for Flash content , is extremely impressive for a portable device .
Pages that have been developed specifically for iPhone and iPod touch Safari are especially easy to use and enjoy , though many — games and mobile productivity applications — are n’t as compelling when you can only access them from the same Wi -Fi network your computer ’s already on .
When browsing sites that have n’t been optimized for the iPhone and iPod touch screen , the same zooming , panning , and screen rotation tools available in the Photo program work to expand and contract full - sized web pages in Safari , and you can have multiple pages open at once , access secure sites , and enter text — URLs , Google / Yahoo searches , or otherwise — through a pop - up on - screen keyboard .
iTunes automatically syncs your browser ’s bookmarks to iPod touch at your request , eliminating your need to use the keyboard for anything but text entry ; taps on links will guide you through the web .
Thanks to its new international settings , iPod touch also eases foreign - language text entry with predictive foreign dictionaries , enabling non-English - speaking users to select words after typing only a couple of letters .
Having used Safari on iPhone , our biggest complaint has been its instability — crashes are unfortunately quite frequent , and it will then need to reload all of the previously opened pages it remembers .
Our testing of the feature on iPod touch suggests that Apple has improved that stability somewhat , and is continuing to work on making pages more stable .
An odd new settings menu option called Developer enables advanced users to trace errors generated when they ’re running their own web pages through iPod touch — not the sort of thing Apple typically exposes to its end users , but interesting nonetheless .
As with iPhone , YouTube allows you to browse an ever - increasing subset of the popular video sharing site ’s content , enabling you to enjoy free videos whenever a wireless network is nearby .
Nothing has changed on iPod touch for YouTube , save for the absence of its “ Share ” feature to e-mail favorite clips to friends , and unfortunately , YouTube is still not making all of its newest clips available to iPod touch and iPhone users .
Apple has even left a “ This video does not currently support iPhone ” message in the YouTube application , which appears when you try to click on incompatible YouTube videos from within Safari .
Our views on the third iPod touch Wi-Fi application , Apple ’s iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store , are generally positive .
As a sole justification for the included Wi -Fi antenna , iTunes would have been weak — “ we ’ve conveniently added a way for you to buy more stuff from us . ”
But in tandem with Safari and YouTube , the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store has the potential to be the third pillar of a powerful music discovery and purchasing service , enabling a user to find popular or unpopular songs , preview them through the Store or YouTube , research the artist or album through Safari , and then make a purchase on the spot .
When you press the iTunes button on the iPod touch ’s main screen , you open a stripped - down version of the music portion of the iTunes Store , complete with a search engine — again using predictive text , here in English , too — to locate artists , albums , and songs you might want to download .
Videos , even music videos , are not searchable or downloadable by the iPod touch .
Assuming that you ’ve set up an iTunes Store account already , iPod touch knows your account and billing information , and sits ready to help you make purchases .
Each purchase requires you to enter your account ’s password , keeping the device from becoming a lucky thief ’s music ATM .
Songs are presented individually with 99 - cent or $ 1.29 buy now buttons , based on your computer - set preference for iTunes or iTunes Plus tracks , and you can click on tracks twice to download them directly from the network to the iPod touch ’s free space .
You ca n’t zoom in on pages , click on an artist ’s name to see her entire catalog , or find related music as easily as on a computer ’s version of iTunes , but there is a way — typically , through Search — to get to any music in the Store that you might want to buy .
Once a track is purchased , you can see its downloading status in a Downloads menu—typically only briefly as Wi-Fi transfers the files rapidly — and then the track ’s sitting in a Purchased playlist on iPod touch .
It ’s playable instantly with album art , as are full albums , though their included digital booklets and videos are for some reason not downloaded alongside them .
Instead , when you return to your computer ’s iTunes , the booklet will download there , and your iPod touch ’s downloaded contents are supposed to be force - synchronized back to your iTunes library .
In our test of the Wi-Fi Music Store with an album by comedian Lisa Lampanelli , which contained 14 tracks and included a video , we had no problem whatsoever downloading all of the tracks to iPod touch , or listening to them immediately .
But when it was time to get the video and transfer the tracks back to our test computer , iTunes failed : the “ Accessing iTunes Store ” message came up , sat around , then brought up an “ network connection ” error message .
The video did n’t arrive , and not only did the songs did n’t transfer back to our machine , but they could n’t even be seen by the computer .
We worked around the problem by turning on automatic synchronization in iTunes , erasing the rest of our content from the iPod touch , and re-syncing the device to get the files to transfer to iTunes .
Then , we forced the video to download through the iTunes “ Your Account ” screen .
Apple will surely fix these sorts of bugs , but they marred what was otherwise a positive purchasing experience .
While we liked the basics of how the Wi-Fi Music Store operates — apart from the lack of video and other content — and we found Safari and YouTube to be nice companions , especially for music research , we ca n’t help but feel that Apple has n’t done the sorts of things with the wireless hardware that people have been asking for .
AirPort Express or Apple TV - like audio and video streaming are nowhere to be found , nor are wireless music sharing or accessories such as headphones .
Similarly , though the prospect of buying iTunes content directly from the iPod is nice , the fact remains that most users ’
Wi - Fi access is at home , or in another place where they have a computer .
Wireless iTunes access is far better suited to video downloads for Apple TV than audio downloads to an iPod or iPhone ; we ’ll see whether Apple rolls that out in the future .
Apple has acknowledged the limited availability of iPod - friendly public Wi-Fi by signing a deal with Starbucks , which conceivably could host paying iPod touch customers right away with its T - Mobile pay - as - you - go Hotspots .
Since few people would ever pay to access such Hotspots with an iPod or iPhone , however , the deal calls for Starbucks to add free iTunes Wi-Fi Store access to its huge fleet of restaurants on a city - by - city basis , a process that will start slowly in late 2007 and continue through 2009 .
This falls into the “ nice announcement , ask us how we like it when we live someplace it ’s available — maybe next year ” category , and really is n’t a substitute for , say , iPod wireless headphones we could actually use right now .
Extras : Calendar , Contacts , Clock , Calculator
Executive Summary : Standalone applications familiar to iPod and iPhone users have returned on iPod touch in their more iPhone - like , evolved forms , albeit with fewer editing features and lower - quality sound effects .
Users will enjoy the ability to edit contacts and re-synchronize them to their computers , but wonder why they cannot do the same with their calendars , an unnecessary and not especially comprehensible Apple product differentiation .
There ’s little to say about the iPod touch ’s helper applications , which are almost identical to the same - named iPhone programs : they ’re nice visual improvements on ones previously available for iPods , but generally missing small things from the iPhone versions .
Calendar synchronizes iCal or Outlook calendar data , presents it in list , week , or month views on the screen , and keeps you informed about major upcoming events with on - date dots .
Unlike the iPhone , you ca n’t edit events on iPod touch — a disabled iPhone feature that made little sense to us , or to our readers — but the feature ’s still better than Calendar on any other iPod model .
Contacts synchronizes Address Book , Microsoft / Outlook , or Yahoo contacts to the iPhone for review .
Surprisingly , you can edit contact data on the iPod touch , including adding photos to your contacts from the collection you have in Photos , but you ca n’t do much with the contacts thereafter , such as actually contacting the people on your list through e-mail or the phone .
You can click on any web URL you ’ve stored for a contact , and if you ’re on Wi-Fi , Safari will go automatically to that web page .
Clock still contains world clocks , alarms , a stopwatch , and a timer .
They all work just like the features of the iPhone , and much the same as on the latest iPod classic and nano models .
The only major difference is that the alarm tones are n’t based on ringtones , and now play through the iPod touch ’s micro clicker speaker rather than through the iPhone ’s nicer actual speaker .
These tones — Checkmate , Jump , Time Passing , Time ’s Up , and Up Down — are all simple beeps , and it would be generous to call them anything but annoying .
Finally , Calculator is just like the one on iPhone — a handy feature when you ’re out and about and just need a quick way to compute tips , your bank deposits , or whatever else you may need .
Oddly , all that ’s different is its main menu icon ; when Calculator is opened , it looks just like the iPhone ’s calculator .
Settings , International Appeal & Keyboards
Executive Summary : With the exception of added iPod silhouette wallpaper and a surprising collection of new international features , iPod touch ’s settings and keyboards are very similar to the iPhone ’s , and therefore generally similar to past and current iPods .
It also preserves the secret iPod Hi-Fi and authenticated Speaker settings found on past iPods .
i Pod touch ’s Settings menus are basically the same as those on iPhone , only fewer in number : the list is now initially comprised of Wi-Fi , Brightness ( for the screen ) , General , Music , Video , Photos , Safari , and Contacts .
There are only a few really interesting points in these menus , as noted below .
Like the iPhone , iPod touch offers you the ability — for the first time on an iPod — to pick your own wallpaper as a start - up and “ Hold ” screen .
Though the feature is limited by iPod touch ’s lack of an integrated camera , you can pick any image from your synchronized photo collection , or certain built - in pictures , moving and scaling it to your liking before setting the final position .
Apple has included nine iPod silhouette images and 19 other photos or pieces of art to choose from .
In addition to the iPhone ’s past settings , Apple has added a new “ International ” menu to the General settings list , allowing you to change iPod touch ’s language and activate a wide variety of foreign language - specific keyboards .
The standard US English keyboard we ’ve previously seen is activated by default , with separate on / off options for UK English , French , German , Japanese , Dutch , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , Danish , Finnish , Norwegian Bokmal , Swedish and Polish .
You can also switch the entire user interface language to these languages , plus Chinese and Korean , resulting in updated text for everything from the main menu icons to other text - only menu options , to the settings themselves .
Finally , iPod touch lets you change the “ region format ” of date , time , and phone data as preferred in various countries around the world .
Settings familiar from past iPods are also included .
Date and time are gimmes , as are the passcode - based screen lock feature , the option to turn clicker sound effects on , off , or only on for the headphone port .
You also still get the iTunes - specific sound check , audiobook speed toggle , a bunch of equalizer presets , and the headphone port - capping volume limit feature .
Under video , you can choose to start playing where you left off , or at the video ’s start , turn on or off closed captioning if it ’s included in a video , and set two TV out switches : widescreen on or off , and signal to the widely - used NTSC or PAL standards .
With the exception of the International options , little has changed from the iPhone ’s on - screen keyboard to iPod touch’s .
As before , iPod touch ’s on - screen keyboard will require around a week of adjustment for those with larger fingers .
In the two and a half months since iPhone ’s release , we have not come to prefer the keyboard to a physical one , and do not consider it nearly equivalent to a Danger Sidekick for text entry .
It is a fine option for what it is , but not as precise as we ’d prefer it to be .
Apple has added only one major feature for US English typists : a keyboard shortcut option that lets two spaces automatically become the characters period and space (. ) for faster typing .
It ’s appreciated , if less necessary here than on the e-mail - ready iPhone .
On iPod touch , the keyboard comes in handy mostly when you want to search YouTube or the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store , and if you dare to try and enter data onto Safari web pages ; because of Safari ’s instability on iPhone , we have n’t used it as much as we ’d hoped for more complex data entry .
The only other Settings menu options iPod touch has are almost secrets : iPod Hi-Fi and Speakers .
Unlike past iPods , which display these options as new main menu choices when iPod Hi-Fi or certain speakers such as Bowers and Wilkins ’ Zeppelin are connected , iPod touch hides them under Settings — a change introduced in iPhone .
Like the equalizer / EQ feature of the iPod , these options enable you to make speaker - specific adjustments to bass or treble levels , and disappear immediately once the speakers have been disconnected .
Conclusions & January 2008 Software Upgrade
In the six - year history of the iPod family — and our publication — we have never before issued a limited recommendation to an iPod .
Even the iPod shuffle , which we viewed as stunningly minimalist and a weak value for the dollar relative to its screened iPod mini , iPod nano , and iPod counterparts , seemed worthwhile from day one because of its small size and low entry price point , and its brothers have generally continued to get better and better over time .
i Pod touch is different .
Demand for a “ video iPod ” started years ago , and the contours of the product consumers wanted was obvious : a big , detailed screen , a hard drive , and a good battery .
Apple ’s initial response , the fifth - generation iPod , was widely viewed as a compromised step down that path , but not the breakthrough people truly wanted ; consequently , demand for a “ true video iPod ” continued to build , and was openly acknowledged by Apple during its January , 2007 announcement of the iPhone .
But rather than using certain of the iPhone ’s components as a starting point for an even better iPod , Apple decided to downgrade them , creating an iPod that now sits in the cell phone industry ’s shadow rather than pointing the way forward , or serving the greater capacity and performance needs of iPod buyers .
And those downgrades are numerous : you do n’t just lose a cell phone by buying iPod touch instead of a comparable - capacity iPhone ; you lose the dock , charger , camera , external speaker , microphone , battery life , screen quality , resilient back casing , Bluetooth , and several applications .
Try to read that list aloud without taking a breath .
You gain only a limited video - out feature , and a few millimeters of thinness , which we ’d gladly have traded for superior performance .
As with every iPod model it has released since 2004 , we have no doubt whatsoever that Apple will sell plenty of iPod touch hardware , and that this model will be of particular interest to users overseas without access to iPhones — hence its newly robust support for foreign languages and keyboards .
Our limited recommendation is largely directed at such people , as well as those in iPhone - supplied countries who simply cannot wait for something better to emerge .
That said , we cannot in good conscience generally recommend the iPod touch to all of our readers .
The essential elements of the “ true video iPod ” we and others have been waiting for are obvious — an iPhone - matching screen with iPod classic - matching capacity and battery life — but between its so - so screen , limited storage and below - nano battery life , iPod touch does n’t equal or surpass the best portable products Apple has released this year .
If you need similar storage space and do n’t need a big video screen , get an iPod nano .
If audio quality and capacity are important to you , buy an iPod classic .
And if you ’re a video fan , consider an iPhone if it ’s available in your country , or save your money .
Wait until Apple ( or someone else ) gets the “ true video iPod ” formula right .
We sincerely hope that it will be sooner rather than later .
Updated January 29 , 2008 : the “ iPod touch January Software Upgrade ”
In late 2007 , Apple announced that it would enable third - party developers to create iPod touch and iPhone applications , presumably to be sold through the iTunes Store , with development to commence in February of 2008 .
Following Apple CEO Steve Jobs ’ January , 2008 keynote speech at Macworld Expo in San Francisco , Apple released two updates to the iPod touch : version 1.1.3 of its Software , enabling the viewing of rented iTunes movies and rearrangement of Home screen icons , as well as a separate application package called the “ iPod touch January Software Upgrade , ” containing the first collection of new programs for the iPod touch .
Unlike past iPod software upgrades , which have been made available to past buyers at no charge , the iPod touch Upgrade sells for $ 20 and includes five applications already available to iPhone users : Mail , Maps , Weather , Stocks , and Notes .
Starting in mid-January , new iPod touch customers received the applications pre-installed on their devices without any need to pay the $ 20 fee .
These five applications are virtually identical to the latest ones found on the iPhone , with small exceptions .
Keyboards in the iPod touch versions by default show international keyboard toggling , unless you go into your International and Keyboard settings , and the Maps application has a substantially diminished Locate Me/location finder feature relative to the iPhone ’s , which uses both cell phone towers and Wi-Fi hotspots to determine your location .
The iPod touch uses only Wi-Fi and frequently cannot automatically determine your location at all .
Otherwise , the applications are the same .
Photos of all five are shown here .
As a postscript to this review , iLounge is currently on its fourth iPod touch unit , having replaced two previous units because of screen problems , and one due to a failed firmware update that rendered the device fully inoperable and incapable of recovery .
None of the units has removed the screen issues we noted in our review , or dramatically improved iPod touch ’s audio or battery performance .
Consequently , though these new applications add additional value for new iPod touch buyers , and might otherwise have merited revision of our rating , we continue to feel that our original rating of the device is merited based on Apple ’s failure to address the continued technical issues the device has experienced .

I was sure we were goin to jail
The Bank of America teller who helped police catch the notorious " Hat Bandit " responsible for 19 area robberies in 10 months was handed $ 10,000 in reward money from law enforcement this afternoon - but said he had to give up his job to collect it .
Steven Gomez , a 21 - year - old junior at Rutgers University , said his employer told him he had to forfeit the job if he took the money publicly .
Gomez said he chose to leave the bank and portrayed his departure as a resignation rather than being fired .
He said his Bank of America bosses were not happy with him because he defied company procedures when he trailed the robber out of the building after the bandit demanded $ 3,000 .
Bank of America spokeswoman Tara Burke said today she could not speak about Gomez personally but all employees are trained in the steps and actions to take in the event of a robbery .
" It is for their protection as well as the protection of the customers , " Burke said .
Gomez , an Elizabeth resident , is a business and finance major who worked 25 hours a week at the bank .
Gomez was instrumental to police in cracking the case of the mystery man who wore hats to his bank heists .
Authorities had no solid leads until July 22 , when James Madison walked into the Union Township bank branch .
Madison demanded $ 3,000 from Gomez .
Gomez turned over the money but decided to trail Madison to the parking lot and spied him leaving in a black 2001 Nissan Altima .
Gomez got the license plate number that led police to Madison , a paroled killer living in Maplewood .
Madison , 50 , has since confessed to 19 robberies in which he netted $ 80,000 .
Madison pleaded guilty in federal court in September and is awaiting sentencing .
Contributing to Gomez ' reward were Union County Crimestoppers ( $ 1,000 ) , Morris County Crimestoppers ( $ 1,000 ) , Essex County Crimestoppers ( $ 1,000 ) , Commerce Bank ( $ 2,000 ) and the FBI ( $ 5,000 ) .

The WaPo noted about a week ago that congressional Republicans are still taking polls seriously , particularly when it comes to Iraq .
When a recent Gallup poll included a hint of good news about Americans ’ attitudes towards Gen.
David Petraeus , “ GOP Senate offices circulated the results . ”
The numbers were skewed , and Republicans were cherry - picking from the data , but the fact that they were even looking to polls in the first place shows that they are interested in public opinion .
And with that in mind , congressional Republicans might want to take a good , long look at the new WaPo / ABC poll .
Most Americans oppose fully funding President Bush ’s $ 190 billion request for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and a sizable majority support an expansion of a children ’s health insurance bill he has promised to veto , putting Bush and many congressional Republicans on the wrong side of public opinion on upcoming foreign and domestic policy battles . [...]
Despite discontent with Congress this year , the public rates congressional Republicans ( 29 percent approve ) lower than congressional Democrats ( 38 percent approve ) .
When the parties are pitted directly against each other , the public broadly favors Democrats on Iraq , health care , the federal budget and the economy .
Only on the issue of terrorism are Republicans at parity with Democrats .
What ’s more , frustration with Congress stems entirely from the public ’s desire to see lawmakers stand up to Bush on Iraq more , not less .
As for Congress ' lack of popularity , by a 2 to 1 margin , those who are frustrated by the lack of progress in Congress this year blame the inaction on Bush and the GOP more than Dems .
Fifty - one percent place primary fault with the president and congressional Republicans , and 25 percent on Democrats .
The next time you hear a conservative crowing that the Democratic Congress receives low marks , keep these numbers in mind .
When the Bush administration holds a meeting this week to formally relaunch the Israeli - Palestinian peace process , one uninvited guest will be looming large over everyone 's shoulder : Iran .
Tuesday 's meeting in Annapolis , Md. , was once envisioned as a three - day conference to kick off the negotiation of final - status issues .
It 's now an incredibly shrinking 24 - hour gathering , but its occurrence at all is in no small measure a result of the rise of Iran and its brand of radical Islam in the Middle East .
Consider how Iran plays into the picture for the following players :
• If President Bush has finally bought into a process he eschewed for seven years , it is not so much because he really believes now is a propitious moment for progress on peace .
Instead , analysts say , Mr. Bush sees the need to contain Iran .
He also sees how bringing Arab moderates to the table with Israel could work toward that goal .
• Saudi Arabia said it would attend a conference only if it addresses the core issues for establishing a Palestinian state .
That wo n't happen , but still Riyadh will attend – in large part because the Saudis see as desirable any action that ties the United States into the region and challenges Iran 's rise .
• And the attendance of Syria – something that both the Bush administration and Israel hoped for – reflects how Damascus is seeking to hedge its bets after having aligned itself increasingly with the regime in Tehran .
For the US , moderate Arab states , Israel , and the Palestinian supporters of Mahmoud Abbas , " finding a way to counter the threat from Tehran … is fueling this peace meeting more than any other factor , " says Martin Indyk , a former US negotiator on the Middle East who is now director of the Brookings Institution 's Saban Center on the Middle East in Washington .
Expectations for the Annapolis meeting , to be held at the US Naval Academy in Maryland 's capital , are " lower than the Dead Sea , " says David Makovsky , director of the project on the Middle East Peace Process at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
Neither Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert nor the Palestinian president , Mr. Abbas , is coming from a position of domestic political strength that would allow for compromise .
The best to be expected from the gathering may be a " road map - plus " formula , Mr. Makovsky says .
Under such a scenario , the parties would formally agree to undertake steps – security measures on the Palestinian side , a settlement freeze and steps easing Palestinian living conditions for the Israelis – while launching final - status negotiations on issues like refugees and Jerusalem .
Still , the meeting will draw participants anxious for anything that might stall Iran 's hegemonic rise in the region , Makovsky says .
The reputation of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has risen in the Palestinian territories and the region as he has advocated violence over accommodation to address the Palestinians ' plight .
He has also skewered moderate Arab leaders for agreeing to work with Israel on peace .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who has focused much of her attention this year on Iran containment , hopes to use the Annapolis meeting to " pull Syria out of Tehran 's orbit , " Makovsky says .
As one Arab diplomat told Makovsky , the real purpose of Annapolis is to " take the Palestinian card out of Ahmadinejad 's hand , " he notes .
But not everyone is so sure the Annapolis meeting will have the desired geopolitical impact , while some even caution that it could end up playing into Tehran 's hands .
" This is rigged for Iran to win , " says David Wurmser , a former Middle East adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney .
The objective of Tehran and in particular Mr. Ahmadinejad is to stoke a " civilizational struggle , " pitting a weak and compliant Islam that is tethered to the West against an aggressive and resurgent Islam , Mr. Wurmser says .
In that context , it actually serves Iran 's purposes if a " humiliated " Arab world joins Israel at the conference table and does n't receive anything concrete in return .
If the Saudis , Egyptians , and Jordanians are seen to " march off to Annapolis to surrender " before the US and Israel , Wurmser says , " that could be a greater gift to the Iranians than anything else Iran could achieve . "
Others are not so categoric , but do see cracks in Secretary Rice 's strategy of containing Iran with a relaunched Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
The idea that a convergence created by a fear of Iran could compel the parties to make unprecedented concessions has " elements of truth , " says Dennis Ross , a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and former peace - process coordinator for the Clinton administration .
But that vision , he says , fails to grasp another reality : that Iran 's rise is seen by many in the region through the " prism " of the Sunni - Shiite divide .
One result of that particular perspective is that Sunni states like Saudi Arabia are still holding out the possibility of producing a bridge between Abbas 's moderate Fatah organization and the radical Hamas , which took control of Gaza after it won elections in January .
Hamas is a Sunni organization but has relied increasingly on support from Shiite Iran as the international community has sought to isolate it .
" The assumption that a common threat would produce a common approach faltered , " Mr. Ross says .
The Annapolis meeting will actually kick off with a dinner at the State Department Monday , when Bush is to hold White House talks with Mr. Olmert and Abbas .
Bush is also scheduled to wrap up the event Wednesday with further talks with the two key leaders .
The impact of Annapolis will really be in what comes after it , experts say .
For clues on that , most will be watching for two things : who actually attends the meeting and what Bush says in the speech he will give in Annapolis on Tuesday .
Rice pressed hard for Saudi Arabia to send its foreign minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal , as a sign of its commitment to the process .
He will attend , though somewhat grudgingly .
Likewise , the administration wanted Syria to send its foreign minister and publicly assured it that the Annapolis microphone would be open to them to put their chief concern with the Israelis – the occupied Golan Heights – on the conference table .
But Syria 's announcement that it will settle for sending its deputy foreign minister , Faysal Mekdad , reflects a hedging of its bets :
While Damascus holds out hope for improved relations with Washington , and wishes to demonstrate some distance from Tehran , experts say , it does not to appear to be playing wholly into the US game plan .
As for Bush 's speech , the key will be if the president sets out any kind of an agenda and timeline for the peace process – and if he outlines any of the tough issues to be addressed with specifics .
Mr. Indyk of the Brookings Institution says he will watch for any mention of the " territorial compensation " the Palestinians can expect in return for the West Bank settlement blocks that Israel will not be asked to hand over to a new Palestine .
And then , what mention does Bush make of a follow - up agenda to Annapolis ?
Many ears will be attuned to any reference to a review conference by which point certain progress would be expected .
Indyk says talk is already circulating of such a conference occurring in Moscow .
Noting that the US and the international community are basically " reinstating a process after seven years of not having a process , " Ross says the crucial question will be : " What is the day - after strategy ? "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices set another record high Tuesday , jumping over $ 2 on fears of dwindling supplies in the United States , projections for strong worldwide demand and a falling U.S. dollar .
A suicide bombing in Afghanistan that killed at least 35 people and a pipeline attack in Yemen also helped push prices higher .
U.S. light crude for December delivery gained $ 2.72 to settle at $ 96.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , surpassing the previous closing high of $ 95.93 set Friday .
Crude hit an intraday high of $ 97.07 , surpassing the previous intraday record of $ 96.05 , also set Friday .
Crude , already up more than $ 2 in morning trade , rose further after the Energy Information Administration issued a report showing worldwide demand unchanged , despite high prices .
EIA said the forecast for oil use growth worldwide in 2008 was unchanged at 1.5 million barrels per day .
This was despite the fact prices have risen 20 percent .
The agency said world oil use would grow by 1.8 million barrels per day in the current quarter , slightly below previous estimates due to a drop in U.S. demand .
The world currently consumes about 85.6 million barrels of oil a day .
Total U.S. petroleum consumption is expected to increase by 0.5 percent in 2007 and 1 percent in 2008 , despite the higher oil and petroleum product prices .
Continued economic growth and forecasted colder average temperatures this winter than last winter could combine to push demand higher .
The rising demand 's impact on prices was noted .
" Tight fundamentals continue to put upward pressure on oil prices , " read the report .
" Global oil markets will likely remain stretched , as world oil demand has continued to grow much faster than oil supply outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries . "
EIA estimates oil prices in the fourth quarter to average $ 87 a barrel .
Crude got a boost earlier in the day on projections of another stockpile draw in the United States .
Analysts expect a 1.6 million barrel drop in domestic crude supplies when the government issues its weekly inventory report Wednesday .
Most of the decline is being blamed on an outage from Pemex , Mexico 's national oil company .
Mexico , after Canada , is the second largest source of imported U.S. oil .
The drop would follow last week 's decline of more than 5 million barrels .
It would also come while refineries are shutting down for planned maintenance - a time that should see rising supplies of oil as refineries turn less of it into gasoline .
Overseas , at least 35 people - including three children and six members of parliament - have been killed in a suicide bombing at a sugar factory in northern Afghanistan , the hospital chief in that province told CNN .
While Afghanistan does n't produce much oil , violence in the Middle East always makes traders nervous .
The fear is the conflict could spread to the broader region , which holds nearly two - thirds of the world 's oil reserves .
An attack on an oil pipeline in Yemen also disrupted the shipment of 155,000 barrels of oil a day , the Associated Press reported .
The continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar , which hit $ 1.4556 against the euro earlier Tuesday , also contributed to climbing oil prices .
One analyst said oil will likely attempt to break $ 100 a barrel but actually doing so might be tough .
" We still feel that prices will ultimately advance to at least $ 98.50 , " Peter Beutel , an oil analyst at Cameron Hanover , wrote in a research note .
" But there will be increasingly heavy long - term profit - taking as prices get closer to the magical three - digit level . "
Crude prices have spiked more than 20 percent in the last three weeks .
The jump is unusual because this time of year is known as a shoulder season - marked by slack demand - between the summer driving and winter heating months .
Crude is now at or near all - time highs , even adjusted for inflation .
The last time oil was this high was the early 1980s , when it rose to $ 93 to $ 101 a barrel , depending on the inflation calculation used and the oil contract cited .
Fighting between Turkey and the Kurds in oil - rich northern Iraq , reports showing demand outpacing supply in the fourth quarter , a falling dollar and lots of speculative investing have all been cited as reasons for the runup .
Crude oil prices have surged nearly five - fold since trading below $ 20 a barrel in 2002 .
Analysts say surging global demand combined with limited new supply is the main underlying factor .
The surge in prices has also attracted lots of speculative investment money , further driving prices higher .
And the tight supply and demand situation magnifies the effect that geopolitical tensions have on prices , as there is less spare supply available globally to cover disruptions from places like Iran , Nigeria or Venezuela .
The falling U.S. dollar has also played a role , as oil worldwide is priced in dollars .
Oil - producing nations have less incentive to ramp up output if the buying power they receive per barrel is declining , and foreign consumers have less incentive to reduce demand if oil is , relatively , getting cheaper for them .

I was reading Code Complete 2 last night and Steve McConnell says that he would n’t hire a programmer who wrote a recursive factorial function .
[ I ’m not sure that would be such a crime in languages like Lua with proper tail recursion , but still .
( I ’m probably wrong , now I ’ve written that !
“ Open mouth , insert foot , echo internationally ” as they used to say on Fidonet :-) ) ]
I thought “ that seems a bit harsh ” , especially since in real life they ’d get one from a library most of the time , anyway .
So , as I have often run out of stack on Ruby , I ’ve tried to rewrite unfold as an iterative function .
It seems to be working .
The script as modified blows up at 5000 on my system with the recursive version , but the iterative version succeeds at 5000 .
Thanks for this blog entry .
There ’s something REALLY nice about this idea , which I ca n’t put my finger on .
Might be something to do with loops terminating when they should , and The Pragmatic Programmers ’ article about “ cook until done ”
http://www.pragprog.com/articles/cook-until-done
Unfold feels like a “ do until finished ” loop .

The Bizarre Breasts Tutorial How to Draw Breasts by L.K. Malnassy L.K. Malnassy is the creator of Sea of Insanity .
This is her first column for Sequential Tart .
Bizarre proportions are nothing new to comics ; be it the desire to cater to the cheesecake crowd or simply the preference of the artist , distorted anatomy has become commonplace .
The fact that " professional " artists may utilize distortions in published works is a bit disappointing , but frankly , if they 've gotten the job the odds are they are n't going to feel the need to change their style .
That 's fine , the world needs laughter .
However , what does bother me is the possibility  hell , the reality  that amateur artists are copying this exaggerated anatomy and making these mistakes their own .
So , in hopes of reaching those for whom this advice may actually have some impact , I have utilized my meager knowledge of anatomy and admittedly unpolished art skills to bring the world a brief tutorial on one of the comic artists ' greatest challenges : the breast .
Full Frontal Stupidity
Does this look familiar ?
If it does , do n't be too surprised 
I 've found renderings similar to this in a number of amateur ( as well as professional ) works .
For reasons I cannot fathom , many artists seem inclined to draw their heroines with breasts that appear to be connected to their bodies by only the most tenuous shred of flesh .
Fear not  if you 've found yourself making this particular mistake , there are ways to correct it .
My pathetic lines aside , this is how the female torso should appear from the front .
Aside from sporting considerably less disturbing proportions , note the distinct lack of cleavage .
Give that gravity tends to pull breasts down and slightly outwards , " natural " cleavage is pretty rare unless the subject is leaning over .
A good way to judge angle is to draw a line down the middle of the figure ; from there , you 'll find that nipples tend to point outwards from the collarbone at about a 45 degree angle .
Also , note the guidelines .
If a woman 's elbows are located about level with the bottom of her ribcage , the lower curve of her breasts will place around 1 / 2 to 1 / 4 of the way above the joint .
In terms of elevation , the nipples , although generally located in the middle of the breast , are not dead - center  remember the aforementioned 45 degree angle rule .
Drawing horizontal lines to act as a guide also helps .
I mean , seriously , if you were trying to fight the forces of evil , would n't you want level nipples ?
A Breast Too Far Side- views , such as the one above , can be just as bad as frontal views when it comes to exaggeration .
Although not usually drawn quite as orb - like as the latter depiction , many profiles share some common problems .
Physics Remember gravity ?
You know , that thing that keeps your feet locked to the earth ?
Well , the breast is not exempt .
If you have what is essentially a pocket of fat protruding from your ribcage , there 's going to be a little in the way of pull .
The exact degree of this varies with the breast , but as a rule the larger the area the greater the degree of gravity exerted .
As such , you cannot depict bare breasts as either a perfect triangle , nor 3 / 4 of a sphere .
Should the woman be wearing a bra the shape of the supported breast is open to debate , but for the sake of completion one should be aware of the physics involved .
Variety Breasts vary with the woman , and I 'm not just talking about size .
To prove this , I cracked open a book of photographs and found the following three examples :
All right , so I did n't include any incredibly buxom or incredibly old subjects in the study , but because most of the mistakes I 've seen occur in artists who concentrate on superhero - type women I figured neither of those types would be of particular interest .
Why ?
Two reasons :
There are very , very few geriatric superheroines , and even fewer who wear spandex .
The more athletic a woman is , the smaller her breasts are .
Now , # 2 is not necessarily a hard and fast rule , because bust - size varies with genetics .
Although fat does tend to collect in the breasts , being active is n't likely to turn a woman into a stick .
However , given the life most super - types lead , they 're likely to be on the smaller side .
Just look at any female athlete .
Also , any woman with a shred of empathy is likely to look at your average superheroine and wince in sympathy , especially if said character is wearing very little in the way of support .
That attractive bouncing that , yes , does occur naturally in the well - endowed , is quite uncomfortable .
( And yes , this is one reason why many of the women I know roll their eyes while watching certain anime titles . )
As an aside , I felt I should stress variety because all too often one will open a comic and see characters whose physiques are virtually identical .
This is not limited to breasts , but for the purpose of this article they are , as usual , the stars of the show .
Anatomy
You should remember that breasts are an extension of the ribcage , not vice - versa .
They are n't beachballs attached to a board .
They are pieces of flesh firmly anchored to an existing skeletal structure .
Before you draw the breasts it is vital that you draw the torso .
Once you do , draw a line down the center of the ribcage from collarbone to navel .
This will help you in determining which way the breasts should be pointing .
In addition to finding the center of the torso , pay attention to its angle .
The collarbone and shoulders are the best means of judging this ; if one shoulder is raised , its corresponding breast will be raised as well .
In Closing Of course , there is no substitute to drawing from life .
Granted this may be a problem for male artists , but there are ways around it .
Find magazines , photographs , or screenshots .
These models will be real ( although possibly not entirely in the case of magazines ) , generally in shape and , almost as important , still .
As many of you have no doubt discovered , it 's a lot easier to draw a motionless target .
Attend life - drawing courses .
I should note that it 's important to be aware that you 're probably not going to be drawing Victoria 's Secret models , as very skinny people are not nearly as interesting as the obese or the elderly , but the experience is important if you want to know how gravity and various angles affect flesh and bone in reality .
Ask your female friends to pose for you .
You might want to be careful how you phrase this request , because it can definitely be taken the wrong way , but if you can't afford life - drawing classes it can be a cheap and easy way to get a firm grasp of anatomy .
So to speak .
Good luck , and if someone asks you why you 're drawing naked women , just give them the excuse all artists must utter at some point in their lives : " It 's okay , Mom , it 's not porn , it 's art . "

NEW YORK –
It takes at least 10 minutes and a large glass of orange juice to wash down all the pills – morphine , methadone , a muscle relaxant , an antidepressant , a stool softener .
Viagra for sexual dysfunction .
Valium for his nerves .
Four hours later , Herbert Reed will swallow another 15 mg of morphine to cut the pain clenching every part of his body .
He will do it twice more before the day is done .
Since he left a bombed - out train depot in Iraq , his gums bleed .
There is more blood in his urine , and still more in his stool .
Bright light hurts his eyes .
A tumor has been removed from his thyroid .
Rashes erupt everywhere , itching so badly they seem to live inside his skin .
Migraines cleave his skull .
His joints ache , grating like door hinges in need of oil .
There is something massively wrong with Herbert Reed , though no one is sure what it is .
He believes he knows the cause , but he cannot convince anyone caring for him that the military 's new favorite weapon has made him terrifyingly sick .
In the sprawling bureaucracy of the Department of Veterans Affairs , he has many caretakers .
An internist , a neurologist , a pain - management specialist , a psychologist , an orthopedic surgeon and a dermatologist .
He cannot function without his stupefying arsenal of medications , but they exact a high price .
" I 'm just a zombie walking around , " he says .
Reed believes depleted uranium has contaminated him and his life .
He now walks point in a vitriolic war over the Pentagon 's arsenal of it – thousands of shells and hundreds of tanks coated with the metal that is radioactive , chemically toxic , and nearly twice as dense as lead .
A shell coated with depleted uranium pierces a tank like a hot knife through butter , exploding on impact into a charring inferno .
As tank armor , it repels artillery assaults .
It also leaves behind a fine radioactive dust with a half - life of 4.5 billion years .
Depleted uranium is the garbage left from producing enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and energy plants .
It is 60 percent as radioactive as natural uranium .
The United States has an estimated 1.5 billion pounds of it , sitting in hazardous waste storage sites across the country .
Meaning it is plentiful and cheap as well as highly effective .
Reed says he unknowingly breathed DU dust while living with his unit in Samawah , Iraq .
He was med -evaced out in July 2003 , nearly unable to walk because of lightning - strike pains from herniated discs in his spine .
Then began a strange series of symptoms he'd never experienced in his previously healthy life .
At Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C , he ran into a buddy from his unit .
And another , and another , and in the tedium of hospital life between doctor visits and the dispensing of meds , they began to talk .
" We all had migraines .
We all felt sick , " Reed says .
" The doctors said , ' It 's all in your head . ' "
Then the medic from their unit showed up .
He too , was suffering .
That made eight sick soldiers from the 442nd Military Police , an Army National Guard unit made up of mostly cops and correctional officers from the New York area .
But the medic knew something the others did n't .
Dutch marines had taken over the abandoned train depot dubbed Camp Smitty , which was surrounded by tank skeletons , unexploded ordnance and shell casings .
They 'd brought radiation - detection devices .
The readings were so hot , the Dutch set up camp in the middle of the desert rather than live in the station ruins .
" We got on the Internet , " Reed said , " and we started researching depleted uranium . "
Then they contacted The New York Daily News , which paid for sophisticated urine tests available only overseas .
Then they hired a lawyer .
Reed , Gerard Matthew , Raymond Ramos , Hector Vega , Augustin Matos , Anthony Yonnone , Jerry Ojeda and Anthony Phillip all have depleted uranium in their urine , according to tests done in December 2003 , while they bounced for months between Walter Reed and New Jersey 's Fort Dix medical center , seeking relief that never came .
The analyses were done in Germany , by a Frankfurt professor who developed a depleted uranium test with Randall Parrish , a professor of isotope geology at the University of Leicester in Britain .
The veterans , using their positive results as evidence , have sued the U.S. Army , claiming officials knew the hazards of depleted uranium , but concealed the risks .
The Department of Defense says depleted uranium is powerful and safe , and not that worrisome .
Four of the highest - registering samples from Frankfurt were sent to the VA .
Those results were negative , Reed said .
" Their test just is n't as sophisticated , " he said .
" And when we first asked to be tested , they told us there was n't one .
They 've lied to us all along . "
The VA 's testing methodology is safe and accurate , the agency says .
More than 2,100 soldiers from the current war have asked to be tested ; only eight had DU in their urine , the VA said .
The term depleted uranium is linguistically radioactive .
Simply uttering the words can prompt a reaction akin to preaching atheism at tent revival .
Heads shake , eyes roll , opinions are yelled from all sides .
" The Department of Defense takes the position that you can eat it for breakfast and it poses no threat at all , " said Steve Robinson of the National Gulf War Resource Center , which helps veterans with various problems , including navigating the labyrinth of VA health care .
" Then you have far - left groups that ... declare it a crime against humanity . "
Several countries use it as weaponry , including Britain , which fired it during the 2003 Iraq invasion .
An estimated 286 tons of DU munitions were fired by the United States in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991 .
An estimated 130 tons were shot toppling Saddam Hussein .
Depleted uranium can enter the human body by inhalation , the most dangerous method ; by ingesting contaminated food or eating with contaminated hands ; by getting dust or debris in an open wound , or by being struck by shrapnel , which often is not removed because doing so would be more dangerous than leaving it .
Inhaled , it can lodge in the lungs .
As with imbedded shrapnel , this is doubly dangerous – not only are the particles themselves physically destructive , they emit radiation .
A moderate voice on the divisive DU spectrum belongs to Dan Fahey , a doctoral student at the University of California at Berkeley , who has studied the issue for years and also served in the Gulf War before leaving the military as a conscientious objector .
" I 've been working on this since ' 93 and I 've just given up hope , " he said .
" I 've spoken to successive federal committees and elected officials ... who then side with the Pentagon .
Nothing changes . "
At the other end are a collection of conspiracy - theorists and internet proselytizers who say using such weapons constitutes genocide .
Two of the most vocal opponents recently suggested that a depleted - uranium missile , not a hijacked jetliner , struck the Pentagon in 2001 .
" The bottom line is it 's more hazardous than the Pentagon admits , " Fahey said , " but it 's not as hazardous as the hard - line activist groups say it is .
And there 's a real dearth of information about how DU affects humans . "
There are several studies on how it affects animals , though their results are not , of course , directly applicable to humans .
Military research on mice shows that depleted uranium can enter the bloodstream and come to rest in bones , the brain , kidneys and lymph nodes .
Other research in rats shows that DU can result in cancerous tumors and genetic mutations , and pass from mother to unborn child , resulting in birth defects .
Iraqi doctors reported significant increases in birth defects and childhood cancers after the 1991 invasion .
Iraqi authorities " found that uranium , which affected the blood cells , had a serious impact on health :
The number of cases of leukemia had increased considerably , as had the incidence of fetal deformities , " the U.N. reported .
Depleted uranium can also contaminate soil and water , and coat buildings with radioactive dust , which can by carried by wind and sandstorms .
In 2005 , the U.N. Environmental Program identified 311 polluted sites in Iraq .
Cleaning them will take at least $ 40 million and several years , the agency said .
Nothing can start until the fighting stops .
Fifteen years after it was first used in battle , there is only one U.S. government study monitoring veterans exposed to depleted uranium .
Number of soldiers in the survey : 32 .
Number of soldiers in both Iraq wars : more than 900,000 .
The study group 's size is controversial – far too small , say experts including Fahey – and so are the findings of the voluntary , Baltimore - based study .
It has found " no clinically significant " health effects from depleted uranium exposure in the study subjects , according to its researchers .
Critics say the VA has downplayed participants ' health problems , including not reporting one soldier who developed cancer , and another who developed a bone tumor .
So for now , depleted uranium falls into the quagmire of Gulf War Syndrome , from which no treatment has emerged despite the government 's spending of at least $ 300 million .
About 30 percent of the 700,000 men and women who served in the first Gulf War still suffer a baffling array of symptoms very similar to those reported by Reed 's unit .
Depleted uranium has long been suspected as a possible contributor to Gulf War Syndrome , and in the mid-90s , veterans helped push the military into tracking soldiers exposed to it .
But for all their efforts , what they got in the end was a questionnaire dispensed to homeward - bound soldiers asking about mental health , nightmares , losing control , exposure to dangerous and radioactive chemicals .
But , the veterans persisted , how would soldiers know they 'd been exposed ?
Radiation is invisible , tasteless , and has no smell .
And what exhausted , homesick , war - addled soldier would check a box that would only send him or her to a military medical center to be poked and prodded and questioned and tested ?
It will take years to determine how depleted uranium affected soldiers from this war .
After Vietnam , veterans , in numbers that grew with the passage of time , complained of joint aches , night sweats , bloody feces , migraine headaches , unexplained rashes and violent behavior ; some developed cancers .
It took more than 25 years for the Pentagon to acknowledge that Agent Orange – a corrosive defoliant used to melt the jungles of Vietnam and flush out the enemy – was linked to those sufferings .
It took 40 years for the military to compensate sick World War II vets exposed to massive blasts of radiation during tests of the atomic bomb .
In 2002 , Congress voted to not let that happen again .
It established the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans ' Illnesses – composed of scientists , physicians and veterans ' advocates .
It reports to the secretary of Veterans Affairs .
Its mandate is to judge all research and all efforts to treat Gulf War Syndrome patients against a single standard :
Have sick soldiers been made better ?
The answer , according to the committee , is no .
" Regrettably , after four years of operation neither the Committee nor ( the ) VA can report progress toward this goal , " stated its December 2005 report .
" Research has not produced effective treatments for these conditions nor shown that existing treatments are significantly effective . "
And so time marches on , as do soldiers going to , and returning from , the deserts of Iraq .
Herbert Reed is an imposing man , broad shouldered and tall .
He strides into the VA Medical Center in the Bronx with the presence of a cop or a soldier .
Since the Vietnam War , he has been both .
His hair is perfect , his shirt spotless , his jeans sharply creased .
But there is something wrong , a niggling imperfection made more noticeable by a bearing so disciplined .
It is a limp – more like a hitch in his get - along .
It is the only sign , albeit a tiny one , that he is extremely sick .
Even sleep offers no release .
He dreams of gunfire and bombs and soldiers who scream for help .
No matter how hard he tries , he never gets there in time .
At 54 , he is a veteran of two wars and a 20 - year veteran of the New York Police Department , where he last served as an assistant warden at the Riker 's Island prison .
He was in perfect health , he says , before being deployed to Iraq .
According to military guidelines , he should have heard the words depleted uranium long before he ended up at Walter Reed .
He should have been trained about its dangers , and how to avoid prolonged exposure to its toxicity and radioactivity .
He says he did n't get anything of the kind .
Neither did other reservists and National Guard soldiers called up for the current war , according to veterans ' groups .
Reed and the seven brothers from his unit hate what has happened to them , and they speak of it at public seminars and in politicians ' offices .
It is something no VA doctor can explain ; something that leaves them feeling like so many spent shell rounds , kicked to the side of battle .
But for every outspoken soldier like them , there are silent veterans like Raphael Naboa , an Army artillery scout who served 11 months in the northern Sunni Triangle , only to come home and fall apart .
Some days he feels fine .
" Some days I ca n't get out of bed , " he said from his home in Colorado .
Now 29 , he 's had growths removed from his brain .
He has suffered a small stroke – one morning he was shaving , having put down the razor to rinse his face .
In that moment , he blacked out and pitched over .
" Just as quickly as I lost consciousness , I regained it , " he said .
" Except I could n't move the right side of my body . "
After about 15 minutes , the paralysis ebbed .
He has mentioned depleted uranium to his VA doctors , who say he suffers from a series of " non-related conditions . "
He knows he was exposed to DU .
" A lot of guys went trophy - hunting , grabbing bayonets , helmets , stuff that was in the vehicles that were destroyed by depleted uranium .
My guys were rooting around in it .
I was trying to get them out of the vehicles . "
No one in the military talked to him about depleted uranium , he said .
His knowledge , like Reed 's , is self - taught from the internet .
Unlike Reed , he has not gone to war over it .
He does n't feel up to the fight .
There is no known cure for what ails him , and so no possible victory in battle .
He 'd really just like to feel normal again .
And he knows of others who feel the same .
" I was an artillery scout , these are folks who are in pretty good shape .
Your Rangers , your Special Forces guys , they 're in as good as shape as a professional athlete .
" Then we come back and we 're all sick . "
They feel like men who once were warriors and now are old before their time , with no hope for relief from a multitude of miseries that has no name .

An American eBayer has auctioned off a week - old pancake for $ 338 , claiming it contains images of Jesus and Mary .
Or maybe Moses and Elijah .
As her mother cooked up a few flapjacks last Monday morning , Dana O'Kane looked down at one of them and saw a pair of " religious figures dressed in the early desert garb that would have been worn at that time in Jerusalem . "
At least , that 's how she explains it on eBay .
Then her mother looked down and agreed with her .
" I saw what looked like , possibly , what people may imagine Jesus would look like , or Moses , " the mum told a TV station in her hometown of Port St. Lucie , Florida .
Jesus and Mary ?
Moses and Elijah ?
Or a pancake ?
O'Kane opts for Jesus : " Being a very spiritual person , which I am , when I saw that , I said , ' Jesus and Mary ! ' "
But her brother is equally sure it 's Moses and Elijah .
Nonetheless , O'Kane 's mother was intent on eating the pancake .
She was just about to sprinkle it with chocolate powder , when O'Kane nabbed it and threw it onto eBay .
Nine days and 43 bids later , it sold for $ 338 .
This ranks somewhere between the Jesus - like garage stain and the divine aubergine . ®

Thanks to reader Rick for the tip .
He has a sharp eye for edible religious artifacts .
It may be the 21st century , but you would n’t know it from stories like this :
Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue stepped up to a podium outside the state Capitol on Tuesday and led a solemn crowd of several hundred people in a prayer for rain on his drought - stricken state .
“ We ’ve come together here simply for one reason and one reason only :
To very reverently and respectfully pray up a storm , ” Perdue said after a choir provided a hymn .
These past few months , the American South has been suffering from its most severe drought in decades .
So far this year , northern Georgia has received half the amount of rain it would usually have gotten by this point .
Lake Lanier , Atlanta ’s main reservoir , may run dry in as little as three months if the rains do n’t come .
Undoubtedly , this is a serious crisis – which makes it all the more ridiculous and embarrassing that the governor of an entire state is engaging in a superstitious magical ritual which he hopes will change the mind of his omniscient , infinitely intelligent god .
The logic behind intercessory prayer makes no sense .
Does Gov. Perdue suppose that Georgians ’ prayers will bring to God ’s attention a need of which he was not previously aware ?
Is God forgetful , so that he needs to be reminded to send rain each year ?
Or did God knowingly cause the drought for reasons of his own – and if so , what arrogance it would be for a Christian to assume that they know better than God what God should do and that they can persuade him to alter his plan !
Worst of all , it seems clear that this event made no effort to be inclusive , but instead employed the full machinery of the state to promote a Protestant Christian belief system in an atmosphere resembling a revival sermon :
A church choir belted out “ What a Mighty God We Serve ” and “ Amazing Grace ” as a keyboardist swayed to the rhythm .
While preachers spoke , worshippers chanted “ amen , ” and some stood with eyes closed and arms outstretched .
… The hourlong event was billed as an interfaith ceremony but only three Protestant ministers joined Perdue , who is a Baptist , and Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle .
Thankfully , this egregious violation of separation of church and state did not go entirely unchallenged .
The Atlanta Freethought Society was in attendance to protest , with some welcome words of reason , and most of the media articles about this event that I ’ve seen at least noted their presence .
Their press release put it best :
This is embarrassingly foolish , a great mistake , a waste of taxpayer money , and unconstitutional on its face .
Defenders of the faith may say that the state is in crisis , human efforts can’t help bring rain , and there ca n’t be any harm in praying , so why not try it ?
But if that were the case – if this truly was a desperate last resort – then we should expect the governor to try everything that might help .
Why not sacrifice some livestock ?
Perform a rain dance ?
Bow towards Mecca ?
It ca n’t hurt , right ?
But Gov. Perdue has n’t tried any of these things .
Doubtless , that ’s because the real purpose of this event is n’t to seriously petition God for rain ; it ’s to put on an ostentatious show of public piety for his constituents .
If it were otherwise , he could simply have encouraged people to pray at home – which would have been bad enough , but less offensive than this farce .
If Lake Lanier runs dry , the consequences would be catastrophic .
On the other hand , if the rain returns in time to avert disaster – which is not unlikely , considering that rain is statistically inevitable given enough time – we can be sure that Gov. Perdue and his religious cronies will claim that their prayers saved the day .
But even in the worst - case scenarios imaginable , it ’s a certainty that no one will call prayer a failure or think to blame God .
In this scenario , as in others , religion has positioned itself in a no-lose situation .
A more rational government , meanwhile , would not waste time imploring the gods for help , and would instead have used the crisis as a springboard for setting up water - conservation measures ( such as reuse of graywater ) , in the hope of averting a similar disaster in the future .
As Mark Twain once said , “ It is better to read the weather forecast before we pray for rain . ”
Many years back an elderly relative of a family friend of mine passed away .
The next day , while I was at the funeral , I had a really strange experience .
I noticed that a man who looked really stricken with grief was continuously staring at me , I vaguely remembered seeing him somewhere too .
A few minutes later , he left the group of people he was with and came and stood next to me .
“ I ‘ve seen you at so and so office , you are the guy who talks Financial Services , am I correct ? ” he whispered .
I nodded , not knowing whether I was expected to carry on a conversation .
And then , having surreptitiously glanced around to make sure no one was listening , he whispered again , “ Is the market going to go up ? ”
“ I do n’t know , ” I said .
It was an honest answer because I never do know what ’s going to happen to the markets ( nor , do I think does anyone else but that ’s not the point ) .
The man looked hurt and angry , perhaps because he felt that I should have done my bit to lighten his sorrow by predicting the future direction of the stock market .
Once he realized that I was too heartless to oblige , he stalked off and kept glaring at me till I left .
Later , I could n’t help thinking about this incident and wonder at the vast range of attention levels that people pay to investing .
I ’m not talking about those who have a legitimate professional connection with the markets like investment managers , family astrologers of stockbrokers and perhaps even editors of mutual fund magazines .
I am talking instead of ordinary people who have a non-financial profession .

I ‘ve observed that there is a long scale along which people can be placed based on their interest in investing .
There are those who never , ever think of savings or investments .
This is n’t particularly bad if all you can afford to save is what gets cut from your salary as compulsory company schemes , although even this category will need to build a little awareness .
Then there are those who think about investments once a year , normally around the time when they wake up to making some tax - savings investments .
At the other extreme are people who obsess with investments all the time without any justification .
This is the category that the person who harassed me at that funeral belonged to .
This category seems tormented by the thought that if only they had some real information about the markets –some secret that others know and are not telling –then they too could earn millions without any effort .
I really like what I do as a profession but I must tell you that while the above incident is the only time I ’ve been harassed by a mourner at a funeral , most people who are in professions similar to mine are frequently waylaid by these obsessive seekers of the markets ’ secrets .
I think there ’s a correct level of interest in investing .
Perhaps this correct level should be calculated by looking at the proportion between your real income and the returns from your investments .
I mean if your main professional income is fifty times the amount of your investments ’ returns then you surely should limit your investment research to perhaps reading this blog for maybe one day in a month .
At the very least , we should all realize that investment returns are not correlated with the amount of time you spend obsessing over them or by the number of people you ask for advice , specially at funerals .
Details emerge in Judge Kent scandal
How far did this federal judge go ?
A judicial council reprimanded U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent for ' inappropriate behavior ' and accused him of misconduct over sexual harassment charges .
But that only begins to tell the story .
U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent is accused of groping a federal court employee .

The federal court employee at the center of a sexual misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent first went to her boss about the judge allegedly touching her inappropriately in 2003 — four years before the March incident that led to his reprimand by the 5th Circuit judicial council .
In mid-2003 , case manager Cathy McBroom told her supervisor that the judge lured her into an office used as an exercise room and groped her , according to interviews with McBroom 's friends , her mother and other sources .
But her female supervisor advised that McBroom could lose her job if she made a formal complaint , and no further action apparently was taken .
The alleged assault in March prompted McBroom to request an immediate transfer and file a judicial misconduct complaint .
It resulted in a rare reprimand of the judge for sexual harassment and " inappropriate behavior " toward other employees .
For the first time , the Houston Chronicle is publishing details about the 2007 incident and other encounters based on interviews with McBroom 's close friends , family and co-workers — all of whom spoke to McBroom in the hours or days after the incident .
McBroom and her attorney , Rusty Hardin , would not comment on specifics .
However , Hardin told the Chronicle he is preparing a criminal complaint for federal officials .
" I believe ( Kent ) committed a felony under state and federal law , and we 're so informing federal authorities . "
Kent is barred from commenting on the investigation or the reprimand .
His attorney refused a request for an interview and referred all questions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit .
This is McBroom 's account of what happened in March as told to friends and her mother in conversation and in written notes :
McBroom was summoned to the judge 's chambers on Friday , March 23 , at about 3 p.m .
Her hands were full of legal papers when the judge — a former high school athlete who is more than 6 inches taller and at least 100 pounds heavier — asked for a hug .
She told him she did n't think that was appropriate , but reluctantly approached .
The judge grabbed Mc - Broom , pulled up her blouse and her bra and put his mouth on her breast .
Then , Kent forced her head down toward his crotch .
As McBroom struggled , Kent kept telling the married mother of three what he wanted to do to her in words too graphic to publish .
The papers fell to the floor .
The pet bulldog Kent kept in his chambers began to bark .
The incident was interrupted by the sound of footsteps from another staff member in the corridor , and the judge loosened his grip .
As she left , the judge said McBroom was a good case manager and then made suggestions about engaging in a sexual act .
McBroom ran out crying .
Reports of the incident
Later that day , McBroom called her childhood friend , Charlene Clark , a San Antonio schoolteacher .
Close as sisters , the two spoke nearly every day .
Clark recently told Mc - Broom 's story to the Chronicle in an exclusive interview corroborated by other sources , including McBroom 's mother , Mary Ann Schopp , and Felicia Williams , a retired court employee who previously worked as the judge 's case manager and is McBroom 's friend .
" It was very physical , " Clark said . "
If he had n't been a judge , she would have gone to the police , and he would have been put in jail . "
McBroom , Williams and at least three other women later gave statements to 5th Circuit investigators regarding Kent 's alleged abuse of employees .
Judge Edith H. Jones , chief judge for the 5th Circuit , has refused comment on the investigation , referring the Chronicle to the reprimand , which includes no specifics .
On the Monday after the March 23 incident , McBroom put all the details of her allegations in a written request for immediate transfer to Houston , where she still works .
In May , she filed a formal complaint against Kent .
McBroom had worked for Kent as his case manager since September 2002 , when he fired his previous case manager , Williams .
Other allegations
Williams , who had worked for Kent from 1993 to 2002 , said her firing came days after she apparently offended the judge with a comment she 'd made about his arriving late for a hearing , though she says she was given no official reason at the time .
Williams told the Chronicle that over the years she frequently had seen Kent appear inebriated at work after long lunches with lawyer friends , was regularly asked for " hugs " and subjected to lewd remarks .
The judge said he could " service me when my husband was being treated for prostate cancer , " Williams said .
" He told me sexual dirty jokes , and ( I ) was expected to listen to his rude comments regarding other people . "
Williams said she never told co-workers or even her husband about most of the comments out of loyalty to the judge — and out of fear that he would retaliate .
" I need to relay how Cathy and I felt threatened due to ( Kent 's ) power and authority and were always concerned about our positions and knew we could be dismissed at a moment 's notice , " Williams said .
" Since ( I ) no longer work for him , I feel more comfortable talking but will always feel the emotional pain . "
Williams later worked at the federal courthouse in Houston until her retirement in 2006 with 33 years of U.S. government service .
McBroom , who replaced Williams , became her friend .
According to women who have spoken to the Chronicle , the first incidents of alleged harassment and unwanted physical contacts with female court employees began about a decade ago .
In fact , when McBroom reported the first incident to her supervisor in 2003 , the supervisor told McBroom that other female employees had problems with the judge making dirty remarks or attempting to touch or kiss them , according to Clark and to McBroom 's mother .
Though McBroom took her orders from the judge as his case manager , she also reported to a supervisor in the Galveston clerk 's office .
The supervisor , who still works for Kent , did not return phone calls or respond to a note left at her home .
' Talked incredibly crudely '
Just a couple of months earlier , in January 2003 , the Southern District of Texas had adopted a policy against sexual harassment .
The policy , which is still in effect , says workplaces should be free of " unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature " when that conduct affects employment or creates an " intimidating , hostile or offensive working environment . "
The same policy promises no " retaliation " against those who complain .
A spokesman for the 5th Circuit , Joseph St. Amant , said he could provide no details about how , or whether , the policy was enforced in McBroom 's case .
Between 2003 and 2007 , McBroom experienced about 15 to 20 other incidents of alleged harassment , five involving improper touching , according to Clark and another source .
" He talked incredibly crudely when he was under the influence , " Clark said .
" He described sex acts . ... "
Typing out her account
Still , the incident in March was unexpected .
For days afterward , McBroom shut down , stayed at her mother 's house , missed her son's birthday party , and tried to decide what to do , Clark and McBroom 's mother both said .
McBroom typed a detailed account of what happened into her mother 's computer but initially decided against going to the police .
" When she gave it to me to read , I was just completely shocked and I could not believe it happened , " Schopp , Mc - Broom 's mother , said .
" It was so traumatic it really has affected her in ways you can't even imagine . "
On May 21 , McBroom filed an internal judicial conduct complaint against Kent .
On Sept. 28 , a formal reprimand was issued .
A month later , on Oct. 25 , Kent was formally reassigned to Houston .
The decision meant that for the first time in decades no federal judge would be assigned full time to Galveston .
Kent remains on a leave of absence but has continued to draw his $ 165,000 annual salary .
If nothing changes , he 'll return to the bench in January .
His current reassignment in Houston requires a 70 - mile roundtrip commute from his home in Santa Fe .
The U.S. attorney , who appears to have jurisdiction over crimes alleged to occur in a federal courthouse , has taken no action .
Several members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee have called for an investigation into whether Kent should be impeached .
Hardin , McBroom 's attorney , said the " 5th Circuit judicial authorities have done all that they believe is appropriate .
Now it 's up to the criminal and congressional officials .
We are going to cooperate fully with both institutions . "

ATLANTA , Feb. 1 — Cities should close schools for up to three months in the event of a severe flu outbreak , ball games and movies should be canceled and working hours staggered so subways and buses are less crowded , the federal government advised today in issuing new pandemic flu guidelines to states and cities .
Health officials acknowledged that such measures would hugely disrupt public life , but they argued that these measure would buy the time needed to produce vaccines and would save lives because flu viruses attack in waves lasting about two months .
“ We have to be prepared for a Category 5 pandemic , ” said Dr. Martin Cetron , director of global migration and quarantine for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , in releasing the guidelines .
“ It ’s not easy .
The only thing that ’s harder is facing the consequences .
That will be intolerable . ”
In an innovation , the new guidelines are modeled on the five levels of hurricanes , but ranked by lethality instead of wind speed .
Category 1 , which assumes 90,000 Americans would die , is equivalent to a bad year for seasonal flu , Glen Nowak , a C.D.C. spokesman , said .
( About 36,000 Americans die of flu in an average year . )
Category 5 , which assumes 1.8 million dead , is the equivalent of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic .
( That flu killed about 2 percent of those infected ; the H5N1 flu now circulating in Asia has killed more than 50 percent but is not easily transmitted . )
Tintin was created by Belgian writer and illustrator Herge
Complaints about Tintin in the Congo have led to Borders and Waterstones moving it to their adult section .
A spokeswoman said the book contained " words of hideous racial prejudice , where the ' savage natives ' look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles " .
Borders said they are committed to let their " customers make the choice " .
' Racist claptrap '
The store 's spokesman added : " Naturally , some of the thousands of books and music selections we carry could be considered controversial or objectionable depending on individual political views , tastes and interests . "
A Waterstones spokesman said : " We have reviewed the title 's situation and are moving it away from the other Tintin titles into the graphic novel section . "
The CRE spokewoman said : " How and why do Borders think that it 's okay to peddle such racist material ? "
" The only place that it might be acceptable for this to be displayed would be in a museum , with a big sign saying ' old - fashioned , racist claptrap . '
" It 's high time that they reconsidered their decision and removed this from their shelves , " she added .
The book 's publishers Egmont said the book comes with a warning that it features " bourgeois , paternalistic stereotypes of the period - an interpretation some readers may find offensive " .
The Tintin adventures were written by Belgian author Herge - real name Georges Prosper Remi - from 1929 until his death in 1983 .
He continued to revise his books after their publication , and admitted embarrassment over some of the views they expressed .
A scene in Tintin in the Congo in which the eponymous hero gave a geography lesson to Africans about Belgium was later changed to a maths class .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Friday vetoed a bill that would have authorized hundreds of water projects across the United States , escalating a battle with congressional Democrats over domestic spending .
President George W. Bush speaks on the " global war on terror " at the Heritage Foundation in Washington , November 1 , 2007 .
Bush on Friday vetoed a popular bill that would have authorized hundreds of water projects across the country , escalating a battle with the Democratic - led Congress over domestic spending .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
Bush had long threatened to veto the $ 23 billion bill , targeted for projects including coastal restoration in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina and improving the Florida Everglades , saying it was too expensive because it had unneeded projects supported by individual lawmakers .
Democrats said they would try to override the president ’s veto as early as next week .
The measure passed both houses of Congress with more than the two thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino called the measure “ fiscally irresponsible ” and said Bush cast the fifth veto of his presidency before leaving for a trip to South Carolina .
The Senate passed the bill , 81 - 12 , in September after the House of Representatives approved it by 381 - 40 a month earlier .
Overall , the $ 23 billion legislation authorizes 900 projects and studies .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer from Maryland said his chamber would hold a vote on Tuesday to attempt to override the president ’s veto .
He noted the legislation won significant bipartisan support when it passed the House and Senate with “ large veto - proof majorities . ”
A spokesman for Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said the Senate could revisit the water bill as early as Wednesday .
Republican and Democratic lawmakers said the veto showed Bush was out of touch with the American people and vowed to move forward with the bill .
“ When we override this irresponsible veto , perhaps the president will finally recognize that Congress is an equal branch of government and reconsider his many other reckless veto threats , ” said Reid .
COST VERSUS NEED
Bush and Democrats , at loggerheads over his Iraq war strategy , have also been sparring over other spending issues , including a proposal by Democrats to expand a popular children ’s health program and a series of annual domestic spending bills supported by Congress that exceed a funding limit Bush has suggested .
Perino said the water projects in the bill fall outside the scope of the Army Corps of Engineers ’ mission and said many of them “ lack any sense of merit . ”
“ It ’s by far the costliest U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authorization ever sent to a president ’s desk , ” she said .
Sen . Russ Feingold , a Wisconsin Democrat , praised the president for vetoing the bill .
This “ is a welcome opportunity for Congress to modify the flawed , bloated bill .
Instead of trying to override the veto , Congress should take this opportunity to fix the bill , ” said Feingold .
The legislation also would include new locks to speed up freight traffic on the Mississippi River .
Farm and business groups have campaigned for years to expand navigational capacity on the upper Mississippi , where many of the locks and dams date from the Depression era .
The Chamber of Commerce warned that without better waterways , communities run a greater risk of flooding and farmers would have a harder time facing foreign competition .
“ We are facing a water infrastructure crisis and our national investment in water resources has not kept pace with our level of economic expansion , ” said Republican Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio .
Auto workers face neocons at the bargaining table
Published Jul 4 , 2007 11:43 PM
What has three heads and drops bombs ?
If you follow news about the auto industry , the three heads would be a dead giveaway .
Cerberus , the three - headed guard dog of Greek mythology , is the name and mascot of the Wall Street hedge fund buying Chrysler .
The more we learn about the firm , however , the more we might conclude that the modern - day Cerberus is not the guardian of hell but its more famous horned denizen .
As is often stated in the media , former U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is the firm ’s chair and former vice president and spelling blunderer Dan Quayle its Global Operations chair .
Yet Quayle did not leave politics ; he is one of the 25 elite signers of the mission statement of the neocon think tank , the Project for the New American Century .
Their document proclaims that : “ We need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future .
...
We need to accept responsibility for America ’s unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security , our prosperity , and our principles . ”
Other signers include Dick Cheney and such now - disgraced figures as I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld .
Rumsfeld is an investor in Cerberus , which is rumored to require a minimum outlay of $ 1 million to join the club .
Cerberus , in turn , is a major contributor to Republican candidates , although it also funds Democrats such as Joe Lieberman .
These contributions do n’t come without strings .
MCI , partially owned by Cerberus , was a subcontractor in an $ 8.8 billion project to build a secure computer network for the Navy and Marines .
When MCI was in danger of being dumped by the Navy , Cerberus held a fundraiser for California Representative Jerry Lewis , who was then chair of the House Appropriations Committee .
One hundred and thirty - three thousand dollars later , MCI was kept on the project .
Among those investigating the scandal was Carol Lam , later fired by Alberto Gonzales .
Cerberus owns Netco , a Navy supplier , and IAP Worldwide Services , a major provider of logistics support to the U.S. Army in Iraq .
IAP had the contract to run the privatized Walter Reed military hospital , whose shoddy care to wounded Iraq veterans has inflamed public outrage .
It was IAP who mismanaged the delivery of desperately needed ice during the Katrina disaster .
Cerberus ’ paid lobbyist , former top Quayle aide Craig Whitney , formed a political action committee , Improve America PAC , almost exclusively with Cerberus funds .
The first lobbyist Cerberus contracted with , Patton Boggs , made available the services of Laurence Harris , a former Federal Communications Commission staffer who would join MCI ’s board of directors ; retired Marine Colonel John Garrett ; and Marcus Dunn , a former aide to two members of the House Armed Services Committee .
Former Utah Republican Senator Jake Garn was paid $ 410,000 in 2003 to lobby for Cerberus .
Cerberus also has ties to Washington ’s closest military ally .
The firm owns Israel ’s second largest bank , Leumi , and collaborated with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in the privatization of Israel ’s state banking system .
It ’s not only Chrysler workers who have this monster to contend with ; Cerberus is now looking at buying Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford .
The firm may also decide not to withdraw from the purchase of Delphi .
Cerberus is buying Tower Automotive and owns other auto parts companies .
Not inclined to be left out , Bush family friend the Carlyle Group has just arranged to buy Allison Transmission from General Motors .
As the military faction of the U.S. ruling class sinks its teeth into the auto industry , it ’s clear the UAW has a quite a formidable foe to negotiate with — but as the Iraqi people have shown , it is a foe that is not unbeatable .
Martha Grevatt has worked at the Chrysler stamping plant in Twinsburg , Ohio , for 20 years and serves on the executive board of her local union .

Gloucestershire police have confirmed that a 26 - year - old Cheltenham man at the centre of an investigation into the website TV - Links was arrested under section 92 of the Trade Mark Act , on suspicion of supplying property with a registered trademark , without permission .
The man was taken into custody on Thursday last week after an investigation by the Federation Against Copyright Theft ( FACT ) and the local trading standards office .
Initial reports from FACT said he had been arrested for " offences relating to the facilitation of copyright infringement on the Internet " .
TV - links , by all accounts , was ( it is no more ) a place where users could post links to content from TV shows , movies and so on , so that other web users could view them .
The site did n't host the material directly , but did , according to reports , embed some video clips .
The man has not been charged with any offence , and has been released pending further investigation .
According to legal experts , the revelation that the 26 year - old was arrested under trademark law adds further uncertainty to an already cutting edge legal situation .
" I 've never heard of using trademarks law for anything like this , " said Struan Robertson , legal eagle at Pinsent Masons , and editor of Out - Law.com .
" There are criminal provisions in the Trade Marks Act , but they are intended to catch the sale of counterfeit goods , not the supply of a service .
I 'd be surprised if the provision of links was found to be a criminal offence under the Trade Marks Act . "
Indeed , section 92 is very clear that :
" A person does not commit an offence under this section unless - ( a ) the goods are goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered , or ( b ) the trade mark has a reputation in the United Kingdom and the use of the sign takes or would take unfair advantage of , or is or would be detrimental to , the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark . "
There has been no suggestion ( so far ) that TV - Links was involved in anything other than providing access , via web links , to copyrighted material .
Robertson speculated that they'd have a better chance of bringing a case for copyright offenses , but even that would be on new legal ground .
" They 'd have to show that he was distributing or communicating copyrighted works .
And that is a legal argument to be had between the prosecution and defence .
It sounds like they are trying to crow - bar activity that looks wrong into laws that are n't really designed to deal with it , " he told us .
We contacted the Federation Against Copyright
Theft , but the organisation offered no further comment on what it describes as an ongoing investigation . ®
Findings in the social psychology literatures on attitudes , social perception , and emotion demonstrate that social information processing involves embodiment , where embodiment refers both to actual bodily states and to simulations of experience in the brain 's modality - specific systems for perception , action , and introspection .
We show that embodiment underlies social information processing when the perceiver interacts with actual social objects ( online cognition ) and when the perceiver represents social objects in their absence ( offline cognition ) .
Although many empirical demonstrations of social embodiment exist , no particularly compelling account of them has been offered .
We propose that theories of embodied cognition , such as the Perceptual Symbol Systems ( PSS ) account ( Barsalou , 1999 ) , explain and integrate these findings , and that they also suggest exciting new directions for research .
We compare the PSS account to a variety of related proposals and show how it addresses criticisms that have previously posed problems for the general embodiment approach .

Once it was simple .
You got married , had kids , worked the land , and stayed married whether you could stand each other or not .
The concept of " a happy marriage " was no more relevant than the idea of " a pretty tractor . "
" That has changed over time as marriage has become more independent , " says Steven Nock , a professor of sociology who studies marriage at the University of Virginia and author of Marriage in Men 's Lives .
" Couples do n't need each other for quite as many things as they once did .
If you 're running a farm with someone , it does n't matter if you 're pissed at her or not .
You need her labor as much as she needs yours .
The couple is more or less equally dependent on each other . "
Chances are , though , if you are reading this , you are not running a farm with your mate .
And if you are , you are probably doing it out of choice , not necessity .
As a recent Washington Post story pointed out , " As marriage with children becomes the exception rather than the norm , social scientists say it is also becoming the self - selected province of the college - educated and the affluent . "
Marriage in America is becoming more like a luxury car ―― in other words a BMW , not a Harvester .
This does n't necessarily mean modern marriages are happy marriages .
According to the latest U.S. Census data , the overall divorce rate has declined as couples get married later in life , often after living together .
But the divorce rate for first marriages is still about 47 % .
Having a happy marriage today means thinking of reasons to be together
" From my perspective , the hardest thing is issues of commitment and trust , " says Nock , who has followed couples over time and conducted interviews with 6,000 married men since 1979 .
What does commitment mean to the modern husband ?
" I 'm going to behave myself because I 'm committed to this relationship , " is how Nock describes it .
Because people have left the farm , and because women have achieved financial parity , married people need new reasons to stay together .
Responding to an outcry that included a passionate Internet campaign and a satiric rap video , city officials yesterday backed off proposed new rules that could have forced tourists taking snapshots in Times Square and filmmakers capturing that only - in - New - York street scene to obtain permits and $ 1 million in liability insurance .
In announcing the move , officials at the Mayor ’s Office of Film , Theater and Broadcasting said they would redraft the rules , intended to apply to commercial film and photography productions , to address complaints that they could be too broadly applied .
They will then release the revised rules for public comment .
“ It appears that the mayor ’s office on film has come to their senses , ” said Eileen Clancy , a member of a group formed to protest the rules .
“ Clearly , they did not anticipate the way in which the rules were likely to affect so many different groups of people . ”
Katherine Oliver , the film office commissioner , said in a statement , “ We appreciate the feedback and collaboration of the production community in the city and look forward to revising our proposal . ”
The proposed rules would have required any group of two or more people using a camera in a public location for more than half an hour , and any group of five or more people using a tripod for more than 10 minutes , to get a permit and insurance .
Press photographers and students would not be affected , officials said .
How to create and apply a patch with Subversion
It ’s been a while since I posted something new on the use of Subversion .
I ’ve been working with the tool a lot , and I ’ve found that patches are a great way to communicate code changes .
For those of you who are still learning , let me first explain what a patch is .
A patch is a text file that contains the alteration that were made to a specific file .
It includes the lines that have been removed and the lines that have been added .
In short , if you have a ruby script and edited it , you could create a patch file , containing the changes you ’ve made .
Why is this useful ?
You could check in your changes to your repository directly .
True , but there are cases that you do n’t have write access to the repository .
For example , if you wanted to contribute code changes to Acts As Exportable , you should create a new ticket and attach a patch file .
I will then review your changes before I apply them to the code and commit them to the repository .
So , how do you go about creating a patch file and how do you later apply it to your source ? ~

Creating a patch file is really easy .
First , check out the most recent version of the code from Subversion using the ‘ checkout ’ command .
Make your changes .
Then , in the root the project run the following command .
It will store the patch file in your home directory .
Make sure to give it meaningful filename .
svn diff >
~/fix_ugly_bug.diff
The file has the .diff extention , which stands for differences .
This extension is recognized by many text editors and enables ‘ syntax highlighting ’ automatically .
( Give it a try with TextMate and you ’ll know what I mean . )
You can send the diff - file to the author of the project by email , or you can create a ticket in Trac and add it as an attachment .
The author will review the changes you made and possibly apply them to the source .
Applying a patch
You should never apply patches from any person other than your development team without first reading through the changes , apply them locally and test your application and then commit them .
Patches can not only include bug fixes , but also alterations to create back doors or add other exploits to your code .
Always read through a patch before applying it !
When you are sure the patch will bring no harm to you , your application or your customers , go ahead an apply it to your working copy .
Here , I assume that you downloaded the patch file we previously generated , and placed it in your home directory .
In the root of your application now run :
patch - p0 -i ~/fix_ugly_bug.diff
This will apply all the changes in the patch to your source .
The - p0 option makes sure that all files can be found correctly ( this has to do with something called ‘ zero directories ’ , I wo n’t get into that right now ) .
The - i option tells ‘ patch ’ what to use as input , in this case the ‘ fix_ugly_bug.diff ’ file in your home directory .
With the code changes in place , run your tests and make sure everything works as expected .
If it does , commit your changes and celebrate with a cup of coffee .
WHEN Hurricane Frances ripped through Gainesville , Fla. , in 2004 , Christopher Swinney , an anesthesiologist , was without electricity for a week .
A few weeks ago , Dr. Swinney lost power again , but this time he was ready .
He plugged his Toyota Prius into the backup uninterruptible power supply unit in his house and soon the refrigerator was humming and the lights were back on .
“ It was running everything in the house except the central air - conditioning , ” Dr. Swinney said .
Without the Prius , the batteries in the U.P.S. unit would have run out of power in about an hour .
The battery pack in the car kept the U.P.S. online and was itself recharged by the gasoline engine , which cycled on and off as needed .
The U.P.S. has an inverter , which converts the direct current electricity from the batteries to household alternating current and regulates the voltage .
As long as it has fuel , the Prius can produce at least three kilowatts of continuous power , which is adequate to maintain a home ’s basic functions .
This form of vehicle - to - grid technology , often called V2G , has attracted hobbyists , university researchers and companies like Pacific Gas & Electric and Google .
Although there is some skepticism among experts about the feasibility of V2G , the big players see a future in which fleets of hybrid cars , recharged at night when demand is lower , can relieve the grid and help avert serious blackouts .
The origin of life is one of the great unsolved problems of science .
Nobody knows how , where or when life originated .
About all that is known for certain is that microbial life had established itself on Earth by about three and a half billion years ago .
In the absence of hard evidence of what came before , there is plenty of scope for disagreement .
When Sam Bowne visited the DEFCON hacking conference in 2006 , he saw a lot of people having fun with a really interesting topic : computer security .
As a professor of computer science at the City College of San Francisco , Bowne wanted to find a way to make computer security accessible to the average student .
So , following his trip to DEFCON last year , he talked with the administrators at CCSF and got permission to start up a class with a hacking lab .
The first course - called " Ethical Hacking and Network Defense " - was a total success , he told attendees at the DEFCON on Friday .
" This is a good thing , because the students love it , " Bowne said .
" They learn the material and have fun at the same time . "
In the past , some security firms and universities have worried that teaching computer - science students how to hack could lure them to the Dark Side of security - especially if the courses went beyond computer intrusion and into cybercrime .
The University of Calgary came under fire when it introduced classes that would task students with creating computer viruses and spam networks .
However , ethical hacking courses have become more mature and more accepted .
Teaching hacking started as an effort by serious hobbyist groups , such as the L0pht and GhettoHackers , then became the purview of bleeding - edge companies founded by hackers , and finally started making its way into schools - mainly community colleges .
During a question - and - answer session following his presentation , Bowne and other educators criticized universities that take a hard stance against the teaching of hacking as narrow thinking .
" Colleges are not about sealing up information and hiding it away , " Bowne said .
Others educators agreed .
One attendee who identified himself as a professor at Emporia State University in Kansas said that many universities are starting to evaluate courses .
Emporia State fully supported teaching ethical hacking , he said , offering a course titled " Computer Attack Essentials " that teaches " the techniques and tools to detect and evaluate ... vulnerable points of known exploits in network and operating systems , " according to the course description ( PDF ) .
Other attendees supported the idea of teaching hacking as a way to understand the risks to corporate networks and personal computers .
Security firm Immunity teaches courses to managers and executives so they can make better decisions regarding their companies ' defenses , said founder and principal researcher David Aitel .
" First of all , it 's fun , so it really does engage them in the technology , " he said .
" It also makes them better at their jobs .
When vendors pitch them on their products , they know enough to gauge what the sales people are saying . "
When Bowne started his course at the City College of San Francisco , 80 students had signed up .
When it ended , only 40 had passed .
Such a success rate is typical for community colleges , he said .
" Students are not working toward degrees , but are looking for job experience , " Bowne said .
Bowne only worried about one student , but not for being unethical .
The student acted with a typical hacker mentality , not following the course material and getting only what he wanted out of the course , Bowne said .
He had a failing grade and did not take the tests , but he maintained all the computers in the lab and the teacher found him indispensable .
The rest of the class went off without a hitch .
" At city college , I had no real problems , " Bowne said .
" But the students were 30 and 40 year - olds with kids .
They did n't want to be hackers .
They just wanted to get better at their jobs . "
To do that , teaching attacker 's techniques is as valuable as teaching how to defend against the attacks , said Leon Johnson , a security analyst with the University of Texas at San Antonio and a member of the Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security , which runs the school 's annual cyberdefense competition .
" It is not so much that you are teaching hacking , but comprehensive security , " he said .
" If you teach only defensive security , that is not enough .
You also have to teach offensive security . "
However , Johnson did acknowledge that teaching ethical hacking is more of a challenge at the university level because some students may be more likely to satisfy their curiosity than worry about breaking laws .
" It 's a youthful thing , " he said .
" When you are young and you are learning to drive , you are more likely to drive fast . "

Calling the RIAA 's case unjustified " as a reasonable exploration of the boundaries of copyright law , " a federal magistrate judge late last week awarded former RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen attorneys ' fees for her nearly two - and - a - half - year fight against a copyright infringement lawsuit .
Andersen is a disabled single mother living in Oregon with her now 10 - year - old daughter .
In February 2005 , she was sued by the record labels , which accused her of using KaZaA to distribute gangster rap under the handle " gotenkito . "
From the outset , she denied all wrongdoing , and in October of that year , filed a countersuit against the record industry , accusing it of racketeering , fraud , and deceptive business practices .
The RIAA continued to press its legal claims against Andersen , despite any evidence other than an IP address tying her to the alleged infringement .
Andersen even provided the name , address , and phone number of the person she believed was responsible for the " gotenkito " account .
Inexplicably , the RIAA chose not to contact him for over two years , then chose to take his denial at face value , choosing instead to continue prosecuting the case against Andersen .
Throughout its prosecution of the case , Andersen accused the RIAA of underhanded investigative tactics .
These included what Andersen describes as inappropriate attempts to contact her daughter .
In one instance , the RIAA 's investigators allegedly contacted her elementary school , posing as a relative in an attempt to speak with then - eight - year - old Kylee Andersen about the alleged infringement .
Even the RIAA 's own forensic investigator reported that he could not find " any evidence whatsoever " that Andersen had used KaZaA .
In June of this year , the RIAA finally came to the conclusion that it had an unwinnable case and decided to drop the case prior to its going to trial .
The parties stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice — unusual for the RIAA , since it made Andersen the prevailing party and eligible for attorneys ' fees .
Andersen dismissed her counterclaims without prejudice ( meaning she can refile them ) after she filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit against the RIAA .
In his order awarding Andersen attorneys ' fees , US Magistrate Judge Donald C. Ashmanskas noted that he had to make a decision on this case " without ever addressing the merits of the claims or the counterclaims . "
Despite that , Judge Ashmanskas noted that there had been a " material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties , " and that with the sole exception of attorneys ' fees , Andersen had gotten " all the relief available to a defendant of a claim for copyright infringement . "
Judge Ashmanskas also cited the RIAA 's admission that the " evidence uncovered during discovery proved inconsistent and inconclusive , " a fact for which the labels could provide no explanation .
He concludes that the RIAA lacked the prima facie evidence to support the claims of infringement .
" Whatever plaintiffs ' reasons for the manner in which they have prosecuted this case , it does not appear to be justified as a reasonable exploration of the boundaries of copyright law , " wrote the judge .
" Copyright holders generally , and these plaintiffs specifically , should be deterred from prosecuting infringement claims as plaintiffs did in this case . "
While Andersen 's attorney adds up the bills , Andersen is seeking class - action status for her malicious prosecution lawsuit .
Saying that the RIAA " has engaged in a coordinated enterprise to pursue a scheme of threatening and intimidating litigation in an attempt to maintain its music distribution monopoly , " Andersen wants to make a class from those who have been wrongfully sued by the RIAA ; if successful , the RIAA could find itself locked in a long and costly legal battle .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German court has awarded 3,000 euros ( $ 4,100 ) in damages to a man who had to have the top of his skull replaced with plastic because of a faulty hospital fridge .
Doctors removed the top of the man ’s head and put it in cold storage while they operated on his brain , the court in the western city of Koblenz said Tuesday .
Because the refrigerator was defective , the section of skull was not kept cool enough and could not be reattached .
Doctors replaced the bone with a plastic prosthesis .
The man sought compensation of at least 20,000 euros on the grounds that the prosthesis caused him headaches , affected his balance and made him unduly sensitivity to the weather .
Following consultations with experts , the court found that the operation had caused the man ’s discomfort , not the loss of the top of his skull .
Compensation of 3,000 euros was “ appropriate and sufficient , ” it said .
“ The experts consulted by the court concluded the new skull roof was better than the original , ” a court spokesman said .

In the age of the mp3 , label musicians and the labels themselves are fighting for survival .
As the cost of music is driven down to near zero , they ’re doing everything they can to reverse that trend — and yet , the trend continues .
I ’ve been thinking about music costing effectively nothing and the future of the business and my musician friends for the past few weeks , and some half - assed ideas popped into my head .
Classical Music .
Classical music is our future so take some time to consider it .
1. People rarely spend money on classical music itself .
I bought a Bach or Mozart CD once when I was 19 when I needed background sound while studying .
For the last few years , whenever I want to hear some classical , I just put on the one radio station that plays it or I pick any random classical listing in iTunes ’ streaming music area and let it play .
It ’s basically free and plentiful .
2 . Old classical music has no copyright , anyone can cover anything by Beethoven and not owe anyone a cut .
You can remix sheetmusic from the 1700s all you want and call it your own .
If you ’ve got access to an orchestra and a recording device you can go nuts making music and never need a lawyer for any of it .
Everything before 1923 is in the public domain : it ’s like a Creative Commons wet dream .
3. Classical music fans are tech savvy and embrace the internet .
The majority of them rip music , and a sizable chunk own iPods and pay for downloads .
Despite these doomsday notions , classical music remains an industry and there are tens of thousands of professional classical musicians worldwide that make a living from it .
It ’s not all glitz and glamor , but there are classical music labels that are doing alright and plenty of live events generate a decent amount of revenue even in modest - sized cities .
There may not be crazy millionaire Kanye West platinum sellers ( aside from maybe Yo Yo Ma ? ) in the classical set , but they ’re not all starving artists .
The popular music industry of the future is n’t going to be anything like it is today , but if you ’re an indie rocker in 2007 worried about what the future might bring , do n’t listen to what the labels are saying , think more about the 2nd chair clarinet in the Berlin orchestra .
update : Andy was kind enough to send more evidence along : NYTimes , NPR , and The New Yorker all on how despite being plentiful and free like I mentioned , classical was the fastest growing segment of music sales last year , thanks in part to the tech savvy listeners paying for downloaded music .
I agree with BTD .
Dodd has perhaps the most clearly defined rationale for running for president of any of the candidates -- he 's running to restore our tattered Constitution .
And what better way to underscore that rationale than by single - handedly killing the Senate Democrats ' capitulation on FISA ?
Dodd :
While the President may think that it 's right to offer immunity to those who break the law and violate the right to privacy of thousands of law - abiding Americans , I want to assure him it is not a value we have in common and I hope the same can be said of my fellow Democrats in the Senate .
" For too long we have failed to respect the rule of law and failed to protect our fundamental civil liberties .
I will do what I can to see to it that no telecommunications giant that was complicit in this Administration 's assault on the Constitution is given a get - out - of - jail - free card . "
The rest of the Senate Democrats :
Senate Democrats and Republicans reached agreement with the Bush administration yesterday on the terms of new legislation to control the federal government 's domestic surveillance program , which includes a highly controversial grant of legal immunity to telecommunications companies that have assisted the program , according to congressional sources .
. . .
It was a victory for President Bush , whose aides lobbied heavily against the Democrats ' [ House ] bill , and an embarrassment for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , who had pushed for the measure 's passage .
The draft Senate bill has the support of the intelligence committee 's chairman , John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , and Bush 's director of national intelligence , Mike McConnell .
It will include full immunity for those companies that can demonstrate to a court that they acted pursuant to a legal directive in helping the government with surveillance in the United States .
Dodd needs to put a hold on this bill and make life miserable for anyone trying to move it forward .
Meanwhile , House Democrats should continue to refuse to provide immunity to lawbreaking companies for actions they refuse to even disclose .
Three telecommunications companies have declined to tell Congress whether they gave U.S. intelligence agencies access to Americans ' phone and computer records without court orders , citing White House objections and national security .
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell " formally invoked the state secrets privilege to prevent AT&T from either confirming or denying " any details about intelligence programs , AT&T general counsel Wayne Watts wrote in a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Qwest and Verizon also declined to answer , saying the federal government has prohibited them from providing information , discussing or referring to any classified intelligence activities .
" Our company essentially finds itself caught in the middle of an oversight dispute between the Congress and the executive relating to government surveillance activities , " Watts wrote .
As Kagro wrote in response :
Did you catch that ?
Three telecommunications companies have declined to tell Congress .
Citing White House objections .
First , the White House says it can use executive privilege to prevent former employees from testifying before Congress .
( And Congress does nothing . )
Now , the White House says it can use the state secrets privilege ( normally something invoked in the courts , not in Congress ) to prevent corporations from testifying before Congress .
Any guesses on what Congress will do with this one ?
" Capitulate " was the right answer .
Note , too , that the companies say " the federal government " has prohibited them from providing this information .
Has Congress removed itself from " the federal government " since we last checked ?
Congress now demands the right to inform itself about the subject matter on which it legislates , and the executive branch says no -- and not only no , but that any bill not containing the provisions it demands but will not permit the Congress to inform itself on will be vetoed .
Unacceptable .
Dodd can give himself a nice boost by doing everything possible to put a wrench into this disastrous capitulation .
So can the other Democratic candidates in the Senate , but I 've lost any hope in seeing real leadership from them on such key issues .
And no , I 'm not talking about a " carefully worded press release " .
I 'm talking real leadership .
Martin Luther King had a dream that some day his children would " live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character . "
He wanted his children to become strong , beautiful people .
But what we see today in poor African American neighborhoods is a nightmare .
We know there are forces that make the ability to escape poverty seem bleak : overburdened single - parent homes , a high dropout rate , joblessness , gangs , drugs , crime , incarceration , deaths at an early age from guns fired by angry black men .
We know that systemic racism and governmental neglect still exist .
Yet we in the black community must look at ourselves and understand our own responsibility .
We sometimes inflict ourselves with a victim mentality , feel hopeless , and do self - destructive things that make our lives even worse .
Many people who are trying to make it find themselves struggling against fellow African Americans so lost in self - destructive behaviors that they bring down other people as well as themselves .
These forces are decimating our communities .
And they are not what Reverend King and other leaders took those whuppings for .
This is not the future for which our ancestors escaped slavery or resisted it .
None of our forebears sacrificed their lives so that their children 's children could call each other " nigger . "
Time to overcome
We cannot accept this current state of affairs .
We must realize – and believe – that , for all the external hassles we face , we are not helpless .
We can overcome the odds and succeed in spite of the obstacles .
And we must try .
Despite the fact that racial discrimination has not been eliminated , black strength lies in the resolve to keep on keeping on , never quit , never give up , never yield to the role of cooperative victim .
Since the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision to end school segregation , black people have achieved extraordinary accomplishments on all fronts that seemed unthinkable 50 years ago .
As black people face the future , we must remember our successes in American society .
One way slaves survived brutal conditions was to turn the Christianity they had learned into a liberation theology .
The stories of the Hebrew slaves became their own .
Even as slave owners used the Bible to justify slavery , black people used the Bible as God intended – to give people hope for a time when there would be true justice .
For black people to hold their heads high even today means getting rid of internal feelings of inferiority .
A history of obstacles
This can be difficult given that white supremacists had real clout in this nation for nearly 250 years .
Take , for example , the very definition of a " black " person in America .
Historically , a person with any known black ancestry was defined as black , making African ancestry a taint on white purity .
The way race is defined in the United States makes no biological or genetic sense .
It 's been used primarily as a tool for political and psychological oppression – providing economic gain for many white people .
The Emancipation Proclamation , written in 1863 during the Civil War , finally freed slaves in the South from bondage .
After slavery , there was a short - lived period of " Reconstruction " in the South when black people started businesses , bought property , voted , and even served in Congress .
But old habits die hard , especially racist ones .
When Northerners wearied of Reconstruction , the old South reared its head and imposed " Jim Crow " segregation .
Buying into victimhood
Although few acknowledge it , the doctrine of white supremacy has sunk deeply into the minds of too many Americans , black people included .
It has slithered its way into the psyches of poor black youth with low self - esteem , who equate academic success with " acting white . "
If success is " white , " then are they saying that to " act black " is to fail ?
We wonder how these embedded stereotypes affect black people today .
Are we too dependent ?
Do we rely too much on white people or " the system " to rescue us ?
Do we lack faith in our own ability to run things ?
Has the legacy of slavery affected even our current mental state ?
Too many people , including some black people , believe many poor black youth – particularly males – cannot be educated .
This position harkens back to the notion of poor genes determining poor performance rather than poor environment , poor schools , or a music scene that imparts destructive , degrading values .
The good must be separated from the bad while treating black people with respect and not demeaning an entire culture .
Victors through community , family
When restaurants , laundries , hotels , theaters , groceries , and clothing stores were legally segregated , black people opened and ran their own .
Such successes provided jobs and strength to black economic well - being .
They also gave black people that gratifying sense of an interdependent community with people working to help each other .
During legal segregation , white racists destroyed some of these economically independent communities .
To their credit , our ancestors did not accept victimhood .
They fought back as individuals and as a people .
Most refused to become passive victims of the system .
Black neighborhoods today must adopt that same can - do attitude and take action .
They must be enterprising and work hard to improve their own economic situation – and by so doing , help improve the community .
This tenacious drive to be victorious is a quality that will help us meet the current challenges in our neighborhoods .
We can pass this sense of strength on to our children by strengthening black families , whatever their structure , and nurturing our youth with love and guidance .
We must put children first and sharpen our parenting skills in both single - parent and two - parent homes .
Fathers must play a bigger role .
They can not be absent .
Children do better when fathers are actively involved in their lives .
With the help of supportive social policies , we can shoulder the remaining challenges and overcome the barriers to black success .
The driving force for change has been the activism of African Americans and others who take up our cause .
The key word is activism , yesterday , today , and tomorrow .
We must be actively involved in empowering our schools and participating in the political process by exercising our right to vote .
Being passive takes us nowhere .
Activism is what gets us where we want to go .
It is time to think positively and act positively .
A people armed with the will to want to get better , armed with the will to win , and armed with knowledge of the past and present , can move forward and take action , succeed , and reclaim their dignity .

Another noted that Iraqis were better off before the invasion , while a third jokingly asked the Digital Outreach Team for a green card .
Mr. Jawad ’s responses tend toward the earnest : “ We do not deny that the situation in Iraq is difficult , but we are achieving success in decreasing the level of violence there with the contribution of the Iraqis who care about their nation and who reject the terrorists and killers who target their victims based on sect , ” he wrote at one point .
He directed the green card writer to the Web sites describing how to apply .

Mr. Sufi also said he was in his 30s .
The team said certain topics repeated regularly , including arguments over the accusations that American soldiers tortured Iraqis at Abu Ghraib and President Bush ’s comment that the fight against terrorism is a “ crusade . ”
Much time is also spent trying to douse the Internet brush fires that erupt whenever prominent Americans from talk - show hosts to politicians make anti-Muslim remarks of the “ bomb Mecca ” variety .

Honor does .

Re “ Senators Clash With Nominee Over Torture and Limits of Law ” ( front page , Oct. 19 ) :
Michael B. Mukasey , the nominee for attorney general , acknowledges that torture is illegal under national and international law .
He will not say , however , what is or is not torture .
This allows him to preserve the right to sanction torture by defining it as not torture .
But like pornography , torture does n’t require a definition .
The Mukasey nomination should be voted down .
There must be one moral person in this country who qualifies for attorney general , and the Senate should hold out until this person is located and nominated by President Bush .
As an American citizen , I am tired of being disgusted with my government .

How can the United States hope to regain its position as a respected world leader on the great issues of human rights if its chief law enforcement officer cannot even bring himself to acknowledge the undeniable verity that waterboarding constitutes torture , applying any conceivable definition of that term ?

Extremist Islamic groups have come to value the internet so much for its ability to spread their message that some have said the keyboard is as important as a Kalashnikov rifle , a report for the US Congress says .
The report , to be presented to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday , says terrorists have increased their use of the internet to make their activities faster , cheaper and more secure .
Use of the internet for communications , propaganda and research has grown to include recruitment and training , says the report prepared by a panel of experts brought together by George Washington University 's Homeland Security Policy Institute and the University of Virginia 's Critical Incident Analysis Group .
From Bagels to Coal Fires : An Unorthodox Economist Keeps Pushing for Change
You may remember Paul Feldman as the Bagel Man we wrote about in Freakonomics .
You may also remember that he was an economist before he got into bagels , with an interest in agricultural , medical , and military issues .
He recently wrote to us about an environmental issue he ’s been looking into : the abundance of underground coal fires in abandoned mines and other places that not only waste coal but contribute mightily to worldwide carbon dioxide emissions .
According to Paul ’s research — take a look at Web sites like this one , this one , and this one — underground fires in China alone contribute as much CO2 to the atmosphere each year as all the cars and light trucks in the U.S.
( We touched on the issue of coal mining fatalities in the U.S. and China in a recent column about nuclear energy , but did n’t include this other important byproduct of widespread coal use . )
We asked Paul to write up a guest blog on the subject , which you ’ll find below .
Once you ’ve read it , you ’ll probably understand a bit better why this was the guy who could figure out how to make a handsome living by selling bagels on an honor system .
It is a call to arms that understands the political and economic realities of the climate change debate .
Here ’s hoping that someone answers Paul ’s call .
GUEST BLOG : COAL FIRES
By Paul Feldman
There is growing acceptance that the earth ’s climate is changing , and that action is needed to control the production of greenhouse gases .
There is no consensus , however , on what should be done .
Some proposals focus on using carbon taxes or carbon cap - and - trade arrangements to regulate industrial emitters .
Other proposals are directed at re-designing individual emitters such as cars and trucks .
Such proposals are not likely to be accepted unless they are adopted worldwide .
No nation wants to pay for emissions reductions while others continue to increase their emissions .
Gaining international acceptance of broad policy actions , however , is a time - consuming and contentious process .
For example , the Law of the Sea Treaty that is now being considered by the Bush Administration has been in the works since 1982 , and it still fails to satisfy many parties to the negotiations .
And the international treaty on climate change produced by the United Nations in 1992 and followed by the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 still lacks worldwide acceptance , because it excludes several of the most important emitters of greenhouse gases .
But while a worldwide policy to limit greenhouse gases will be difficult to achieve , not all interim steps to reduce emissions have to be contentious .
One example concerns an issue that has escaped front - page attention : extinguishing underground coal fires that have been burning freely and putting massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the air for decades .
Underground coal fires in China alone produce as much carbon dioxide annually as all the cars and light trucks in the United States .
Fires in other countries , including the United States , are smaller but still add significantly to the total burden .
Although extinguishing these fires would be costly , it would reduce carbon emissions without the major disruptions to individual national economies mentioned above .
And it would further benefit nations by eliminating the loss of their coal fields .
As such , it might be possible to work out some international cost - sharing arrangement to attack those fires now , without waiting for all nations to agree on a wide - ranging treaty to limit carbon dioxide emissions .
Choho Zukeran was a schoolboy , mobilised to dig beachfront trenches , when US soldiers landed on his native Okinawa , sparking one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war .
Over the next few weeks , some 200,000 Japanese and Americans would die , including more than a quarter of Okinawa 's civilian population .
Most died in the invasion , others killed themselves - on the orders of the army that was supposed to be protecting them .
" The army had given us two grenades each .
They told us to hurl the first one at the enemy and to use the second one to kill ourselves , " Mr Zukeran told the Guardian from his home in Okinawa , a subtropical island 1,000 miles south - west of Tokyo .
Whole families and communities committed suicide together .
Yet if the government in Tokyo gets its way , Japanese children may never learn how hundreds of Okinawa residents , under direct or indirect pressure from the military , took their own lives .
This year the education ministry ordered publishers of seven high - school textbooks to be introduced next April to remove references to the forced suicides .
The ministry said " it was not clear there were military orders [ to commit suicide ] " and that " recent studies suggest there were no such orders " .
The demand is part of a growing movement to sanitise - or simply ignore - the darkest episodes in modern Japanese history , which have gathered pace under one of the most conservative governments of recent decades , led by the hawkish prime minister , Shinzo Abe .
A long simmering row over the 1937 massacre of tens of thousands of Chinese civilians in Nanking by Japanese forces has been reignited by renewed efforts to play down the carnage .
Last month about 130 Japanese MPs denounced the massacre as a Chinese fabrication and claimed the death toll was nearer 20,000 .
Several films marking the 70th anniversary are due for release this year , including one by the rightwing director Satoru Mizushima which describes the episode as a myth .
Other attempts by the Japanese right to rectify Japan's " masochistic " view of its own history have set it on a diplomatic collision course with its closest ally , the United States .
Last month a congressional committee passed a resolution calling on Japan to acknowledge and apologise for forcing an estimated 200,000 mainly Chinese and Korean women to work in frontline brothels - the so - called " comfort women " .
Mr
Abe caused uproar when he denied the women had been coerced , and was forced to reiterate his support for an informal 1993 apology issued by the then parliament speaker .
Hiromichi Moteki , secretary - general of the rightwing Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact , denies Japan 's current obsession with reinterpreting the past is politically motivated .
" We are now able to look again at our history now that the facts have come to light , " he said .
" We have been listening to the left 's fabrications for years , but now we have the truth in front of us . "
The drive extends to the rehabilitation of wartime politicians closely associated with militarism .
Yuko
Tojo , whose grandfather , Hideki , was prime minister during the war and was hanged as a war criminal in 1948 , says clearing her grandfather 's name is part of a mission to restore " pride and confidence " .
" There is no need to apologise to anyone - our ancestors are not guilty of the crimes of which they have been accused , " said Ms Tojo , 68 , who is running as an independent in elections .
" If my grandfather is to be blamed for anything , it is not that he started the war but that we lost it . "
Japan 's defeat probably saved Mr Zukeran 's life .
After a week in a beach cave in June 1945 , hunger triumphed over fear and his family surrendered .
" We soon realised we had been lied to .
The Americans were not going to kill us .
" Lots of my school friends were told to commit suicide by Japanese soldiers .
At school we had been brainwashed ... [ that ] to surrender to [ US troops ] would be to disgrace the emperor , " said the 75 - year - old retired teacher and local councillor .
The attempt to airbrush the suicides caused outrage in Okinawa and prompted half its towns and villages to demand the references stay .
" It is an undeniable fact that mass suicides could not have occurred without the involvement of the Japanese army , " the Okinawa city assembly said .
More than six decades on , Mr Zukeran is appalled at what Japan 's modern - day leaders are trying to do .
" Many of my friends died because they were told to .
The army never once tried to protect us .
They told people to die and stole food intended for women and children .
That is how war robs people of their humanity . "
In the weeks after the invasion , Mr Zukeran 's family walked from village to village to escape the Americans who , they had been told , would rape and kill them amid a " typhoon of steel " .
Eyewitnesses claim entire families committed suicide together on the orders of fanatical Japanese soldiers rather than allow them to surrender and betray sensitive information about troop movements .
Some 700 committed mass suicide in the Kerama islets off Okinawa .
· This article was amended on Friday July 6 2007 .
When we said in the first paragraph that " some died in the invasion " , we should have said " most " .
In the third paragraph we said , " Yet if the government in Tokyo gets its way , Japanese children may never learn how thousands of Okinawa residents ... took their own lives . "
This should have read " hundreds " not " thousands " .
The article has been corrected .

Researchers have learned that rats overwhelmingly prefer water sweetened with saccharin to cocaine , a finding that demonstrates the addictive potential of sweets .
Offering larger doses of cocaine did not alter the rats ’ preference for saccharin , according to the report .
Scientists said the study , presented this week in San Diego at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience , might help explain the rise in human obesity , which has been driven in part by an overconsumption of sugary foods .
In the experiment , 43 rats were placed in cages with two levers , one of which delivered an intravenous dose of cocaine and the other a sip of highly sweetened water .
At the end of the 15 - day trial , 40 of the rats consistently chose saccharin instead of cocaine .

When sugar water was substituted for the saccharin solution , the results were the same , researchers said .
Further testing the rat sweet tooth , scientists subjected 24 cocaine - addicted rats to a similar trial .
At the end of 10 days , the majority of them preferred saccharin .
“ Intense sweetness is more rewarding to the rats than cocaine , ” said coauthor Magalie Lenoir of the University of Bordeaux in France .
Lenoir said mammalian taste receptors evolved in an environment that lacked sugar and so were not adapted to the high concentrations of sweets found in the modern diet .
Excess sugar could increase levels of the brain chemical dopamine , she said , leading to a craving for sweets .

Cocaine also increases dopamine , she said , but through a different brain mechanism .

Last week we launched the Creative Commons annual fall fundraising campaign .
Goal : US $ 500,000 .
We also launched a redesigned creativecommons.org site ( more on that below ) and now have matching campaign buttons :
Get one for your site or blog !
As you might guess from the buttons above , a map theme runs throughout the campaign , including on the super cool campaign t- shirts ( there ’s only one way to get one … ) , see right .
This includes the most immediately noticeable addition to the CC homepage : a dynamic donor map , showing where in the world contributions to the fall campaign are coming from ( no personal information is exposed ) .
One cool thing about the donor map is that it ’s built with OpenLayers , a completely free software dynamic mapping library .
While maps make great eye candy , the most significant changes to the CC site fall into two categories : international exposure and information architecture .
We ’re now aggregating CC jurisdiction project blogs on the CC homepage .
Aggregated feeds will be available soon , and announced here .
We ’ll be doing a lot more in the coming months to shine a light on vital jurisdiction project activities .
Information architecture - wise we ’ve made a bunch of small changes to make the CC site ( actually sites ) easier to navigate and use , with more coming .
Three of note :
This now omnipresent set of navigation tabs is self - explanatory and points to the other two changes .
First , a completely revamped projects page .
If you want a very concise guide to current and ongoing projects of CC ( the organization ) , with pretty icons , go there .
Of course most of the projects represent iceberg tips , both within the organization and beyond .
Second , the participate tab points to our wiki , now restyled to match the rest of the site .
One of the cooler things we ’re doing with the wiki is adding Semantic MediaWiki annotations .
The short explanation is that this allows us to use information in the wiki as if it were in a database , without creating a custom database application .
See a very early and trivial application of this on our content directories page .
A number of CC staff are directly responsible for the rollout of campaign and site refresh features , including Asheesh Laroia ( OpenLayers integration ) , Jon Phillips ( information architecture ) , Nathan Kinkade ( sysadmin ) , summer intern Thierry Kennes ( Semantic MediaWiki integration and Wiki theme work ) , Cameron Parkins , Rebecca Rojer , and Tim Vollmer ( asset creation and wikifarming ) .
Melissa Reeder , Eric Steuer , and Nathan Yergler provided fundraising , editorial , and technology oversight respectively .
Alex Roberts imagined all of the visual concepts , made everything pretty , and wrote lots of the code .
The best ways to congratulate Alex & co. are to provide support for their continued work and spread the word .
Thank you !
Nov. 5 , 2007 -- Vermont has moved into the No. 1 position as the nation 's healthiest state , according to an annual 50 - state survey released Monday .
Vermont eclipsed Minnesota in 2007 as the nation 's overall healthiest state .
But the nation 's overall health picture got slightly worse from last year to this year .
" We are displeased and unhappy to have to report that this year the health of the nation is less good than it was last year .
In fact , the health of the nation has slipped by about three tenths of a percent , " says Reed Tuckson , MD , senior vice president of the United Health Foundation , which has issued the survey for the last 18 years .
The study 's overall national scores have stagnated or declined since 2000 .
Authors attribute the drop to rising obesity , now affecting more than 25 % of the population .
The survey uses a combined score of health indicators and policy questions to rank all 50 states .
Obesity rates , tobacco and alcohol use , and high school graduation rates are accounted for , as are state laws and regulations promoting better health .
The survey measures access to health services and also environmental issues like pollution , infectious disease rates , and crime .
I 'm Flattered , Wikipedia But Seriously , I Don't Know What I'm Talking About
Kris Chau
The other day , I was trying to find stuff about the ortolan , a finger - sized bird eaten with cruel ceremony by ancient Romans and modern French .
I 'd written about it before , but it 's stuck in my head .
I wanted to check up on the little bird .
The " gastronomy " section of the Wikipedia entry included a description of eating one .
Awesome , I thought .
I wonder what it 's like to eat one of those .
The description began : " You catch the ortolan with a net spread up in the forest canopy .
Take it alive .
Take it home .
Poke out its eyes and put it in a small cage . "
This sounds familiar .
Have I read this before ?
" Force - feed it oats and millet and figs until it has swollen to four times its normal size .
Drown it in brandy .
Roast it whole , in an oven at high heat , for six to eight minutes . "
Oh my God , I wrote this !
" Bring it to the table .
Place a cloth — a napkin will do — over your head to hide your cruelty from the sight of God . "
What am I doing in an online encyclopedia ?
I 'm not an authority !
" Put the whole bird into your mouth , with only the beak protruding from your lips .
Bite .
Put the beak on your plate and begin chewing , gently .
You will taste three things :
First , the sweetness of the flesh and fat .
This is God .
Then , the bitterness of the guts will begin to overwhelm you .
This is the suffering of Jesus .
Finally , as your teeth break the small , delicate bones and they begin to lacerate your gums ... "
" Lacerate " ?
That 's a little much .
Simpler word — " cut " — would 've done .
" ... you will taste the salt of your own blood , mingling with the richness of the fat and the bitterness of the organs .
This is the Holy Spirit , the mystery of the Trinity — three united as one .
It is cruel .
And beautiful .
According to Claude Souvenir , chewing the ortolan takes approximately 15 minutes . "
Let me back up .
Nine years ago , I was in Paris with my then - girlfriend in a restaurant called Jose's .
Jose owned the place , waited tables , and was blind .
There was no menu and , between courses , Jose told jokes and stories in French that we could n't understand .
For dessert , Jose told us customers to pull our tables together and eat our gâteau ( or whatever it was , I can't remember ) as newfound friends .
He told another joke we could n't understand and the man next to us , a Belgian named Claude Souvenir , translated .
When the meal was over , Souvenir invited my girlfriend and me for a nightcap at a sidewalk cafe on the Champs - Élysées .
He seemed suspiciously generic : his middle - tall , middle - weight , middle - aged body ; his fake - sounding name ; his vagueness about his work .
We thought he was a spy .
He bought us a round of beer and talked about Tintin comics ( they 're Belgian ) and the ortolan .
He began , as I remember it : " You catch the ortolan with a net spread up in the forest canopy ... "
He was good company , but we never saw each other again .
His description of the ortolan stayed with me , and last year , when I needed it for a story I was writing for this newspaper , about killing and eating animals , I used it [ " The Urban Hunt , " Sept 28 , 2006 ] .
I was n't sure I 'd remembered his description correctly and did a little research , some of it on Wikipedia .
( I 'd hate to be wrong . )
Nothing was as detailed as Claude 's description , but everything checked out .
After the story was published , I did n't think much about the ortolan until the other day when I looked on Wikipedia and started reading my own words .
For the record : I am in no way an expert on the ortolan .
That description does not belong in an encyclopedia .
It 's my paraphrase of a monologue delivered by a weird guy on a tipsy night a decade ago — many details of which ( our dessert , for example ) I do n't remember .
I just Googled " ortolan " and " Wikipedia " and found a blog where somebody quoted my paragraph under the header " WTF ? "
Commentors freaked out : " Horrible ! " " Tasteless ! "
The stinging one : " There is no way that this can be real . "
Shit , shit , shit .
I 'm wrong .
Two comments later , someone named MadFox rushed to my rescue : " I saw Jeremy Clarkson eat one of these on his Meet the Neighbours programme a few years ago , it seemed to be pretty much exactly as described including cloth on head eating .
Pretty disgusting if you ask me . "
Thanks , MadFox !
I may be disgusting , but at least I 'm right — some stranger on the internet says so .

Local Turkeys take to cities , towns
A wild turkey strolled along a sidewalk on Beacon Street in Brookline .
The birds can grow to weigh roughly 20 pounds and stand 4 feet tall .
( Globe Staff Photo / Mark Wilson ) BROOKLINE -
On a recent afternoon , Kettly Jean - Felix parked her car on Beacon Street in Brookline , fed the parking meter , wheeled around to go to the optician and came face to face with a wild turkey .
The turkey eyed Jean - Felix .
Jean - Felix eyed the turkey .
It gobbled .
She gasped .
Then the turkey proceeded to follow the Dorchester woman over the Green Line train tracks , across the street , through traffic , and all the way down the block , pecking at her backside as she went .
" This is so scary , " Jean - Felix said , finally taking refuge inside Cambridge Eye Doctors in Brookline 's bustling Washington Square .
" I can not explain it . "
Notify the neighbors :
The turkeys are spreading through suburbia .
Wild turkeys , once eliminated in Massachusetts , are flourishing from Plymouth to Concord and - to the surprise of some wildlife officials - making forays into densely populated suburban and urban areas , including parts of Boston , Cambridge and , most recently , Brookline .
Some Brookline residents have welcomed the birds , happy to see wildlife strolling amid the nannies with $ 300 strollers and Trader Joe 's shoppers .
But many others worry what the keen - eyed , sometimes ornery birds might do , prompting as many as a dozen calls to the police department every day .
" Some people are getting very upset , " said Brookline police animal control officer Pierre Verrier .
" One of the biggest things is , they 're afraid .
They do n't want the turkeys to get hurt .
And the other thing is , they 're afraid of the turkeys around their children .
They do n't know what they 'll do . "
As such , Brookline police issued a statement last month , telling residents what they should - or should not - do if they meet a wild turkey in town .
The basic advice : stay away from the turkeys .
But still , people keep calling police headquarters to report the strangest sight : Turkeys in downtown Brookline .
* * * July 20 , 9:31 a.m. , Rawson Road : Caller reports 18 turkeys in her backyard .
" Something must be done , " caller says .
" It 's just not right . "
Requests animal control officer .
* * * Wild turkeys - the official game bird of Massachusetts - are impressive animals that can grow to be roughly 20 pounds and 4 feet tall .
By 1851 , they had been eliminated from Massachusetts , a victim of hunting .
" We were turkey - less for many years , " said Wayne Petersen , director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society 's Important Birds Area Program .
" And then we decided it would be quite nice to get them back on the landscape . "
Efforts to revitalize the state 's turkey population between 1911 and 1967 failed .
Then , in 1972 and 1973 , the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife released 37 turkeys in the Berkshires .
These turkeys survived and bred .
And between 1979 and 1996 , wildlife officials trapped more than 500 turkeys in the Berkshires and released them elsewhere in the state .
Biologists were pleased ; today 's turkey population in Massachusetts lingers around 20,000 .
But Marion Larson , an information and education biologist at MassWildlife , said officials had not counted on the turkey 's appetite for suburban - and even urban - living .
" That was something that surprised us , " Larson said .
" Who knew ?
The last time there were turkeys in Massachusetts there were n't a whole heck of a lot of suburbs . "
This time around , of course , that is not the case , and turkeys have proven especially adaptable to residential living .
By his last count , Verrier said , there are at least two dozen wild turkeys living in Brookline , feeding off everything from bird seed to gutter trash and , sometimes , scaring the wits out of the townspeople .
* * * September 4 , 11:01 a.m. , Chatham Circle and Chatham Street : Caller - who had gone under some beech trees to take a picture of turkeys - reports four turkeys chasing him .
Requests animal control officer .
* * *
The problem , according to some Brookline residents , is that the turkeys can be aggressive at times .
Dr. Ruth Smith , an internist from New York City , was staying with a cousin in Brookline a couple of weeks ago when she was stalked by what she describes as a 3 - foot - tall turkey .
" He came at me and , at first , I tried to shoo him away , " Smith recalled .
" I figured I 'd just go ' Shoo ! ' and he'd go .
But he was very aggressive . "
Smith said she escaped by ducking into the Dunkin ' Donuts on Beacon Street .
But some of the hounded do not have the luxury of going inside .
Brookline postal carrier Rosanne Lane said she has skipped houses on her mail route because turkeys dissuaded her from approaching .
" They make a lot of noise and I just take off , " said Lane .
Under state law , an animal control officer can kill a turkey if it creates a public safety threat .
In 2005 , for example , Canton police killed three .
But for now in Brookline , it has not come to that , said Verrier .
When dispatched to the scene of a turkey , Verrier offers advice instead .
He tells people not to feed them , not to be intimidated by them , and to keep their distance .
Still , some people cannot help themselves .
They need to be near the turkeys .
* * * September 7 , 7:39 a.m. , Druce Street :
Two packs of turkeys ( 15 ) in the road . . .
Two not getting along .
* * * Over an eight - hour stretch last week in Brookline , a lone turkey walked Beacon Street , strutting at times , preening at others , and napping every now and again in the landscaping near the sidewalk .
Most people did not even notice .
And those who did simply edged a few feet away from him and kept right on walking .
But as afternoon turned to dusk - and the turkey , a male , moved down Beacon Street into the heart of Washington Square - a crowd began to gather .
Some , like Jessica Dolber , snapped pictures .
Others , like Kelly Stearn , called police .
But not Kettly Jean - Felix , the woman who had been followed by the turkey earlier that afternoon .
When she finally left the optician 's office on the corner just an hour after being stalked by the turkey , she headed straight for her car .
And this time the bird did not notice Jean - Felix .
He was too busy eating peanut shells in front of the 7 - Eleven and gobbling to the delight of the crowd .

On Dec. 10 , 1968 , a uniformed man pulled over a bank car in Tokyo .
He explained that police had received a warning that dynamite had been planted in the vehicle , which was transporting bonuses for local Toshiba employees .
The four passengers got out and watched as the officer crawled underneath .
After a moment he rolled out , shouting that the car was about to explode .
When the passengers ran , he got in and drove off .
Thus one man stole 294,307,500 yen in broad daylight , working alone and without harming anyone .
It remains the largest single heist in Japanese history .
The thief was never caught .
A good friend in the lawsuit business alerted us the other day to an important , recent decision of the Oregon Supreme Court that could reach down into the pockets of anyone in the state who has ever used Craigslist or a garage sale to unload used goods -- or anyone who 's ever sold their home , for that matter .
The case is Bailey v. Lewis Farm , Inc. , and the full text of the court 's opinion is here .
The facts of the case are pretty simple .
May Trucking had a Paccar tractor - trailer that it drove about 500,000 miles over six years .
Then it sold it to another party , who in turn sold it to Lewis Farms .
About a year after May had gotten rid of the truck , the wheels came off on the highway due to an axle failure .
They hit a car , which then crashed and burned , and the car 's owner , Jerome Bailey , was badly hurt .
Bailey sued Paccar , Lewis , and May .
His allegations against May were that it had negligently failed to maintain the axle , and that that failure is what caused the awful accident .
May said it could n't possible be liable to Bailey , because it sold the truck a year before the axle failure .
Lewis was responsible for the safety of the vehicle it was operating , said May , and so May should be off the hook to Bailey .
May moved to dismiss the case , arguing that even if it were negligent , it had no duty to Bailey , and that the harm Bailey suffered was n't reasonably foreseeable when May owned the tractor - trailer .
No way , said the court .
Just because Lewis had a duty to Bailey does n't mean that May was relieved of its obligation to act reasonably in maintaining the truck .
And of course the harm could be reasonably foreseeable -- if you let your truck run down without proper maintenance , it 's no surprise if somebody gets hurt in an accident as a result .
And so back the case goes to Multnomah County Circuit Court , where May may very well have to pay up whatever damages Paccar and Lewis are n't covering -- at least if it 's proven that May was negligent , and that its negligence caused the axle to fail .
( Evidence on those points has n't been presented yet . )
How far does the rule of this case go ?
Would it cover tools that you unloaded at a garage sale last year ?
How about the house you sold last year , or five years ago ?
Surely , it would cover that used car you got rid of , although the court hinted that maybe you'd be off the hook if the dangerous condition was obvious when you sold it , or if you traded the car in at a dealership .
What can you do to protect yourself ?
I doubt that your insurance covers it -- at least auto policies end when the vehicle is sold , and I 'd be surprised if a standard homeowners policy would n't work the same way .
There 's no way to get a release in advance from everyone who might be hurt by breakdowns of your former stuff while it's in the hands of future owners whom you do n't even know .
I suppose you could try to make the person who buys your junk sign a contract that says from here on out , they 'll pay for any harm that 's caused by problems with the stuff , even if it 's due to crummy maintenance by you .
Those ought to be some interesting negotiations .
Particularly at the garage sale .
And that contract 's only as good as the future credit of the person you 're dealing with .
Heck , in a lot of cases you probably would n't even take their check .
A University of South Florida neuroscientist reports that the cutting - edge research study of human stem cells in primates with Parkinson ’s disease is compelling on several fronts – particularly how the transplanted cells did their job of easing disease symptoms .
Paul R. Sanberg , DSc , PhD , Distinguished Professor of Neurosurgery and Director of the Center for Aging and Brain Repair at USF Health , wrote the commentary “ Neural Stem Cells for Parkinson ’s Disease : To Protect and Repair ” published July 9 in the “ Early Edition ” online version of journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America .
The expert commentary is a companion piece to the study conducted by Gene Redmond and colleagues at Yale and Harvard Universities and the Burnham Institute .
That NIH - funded study showed that only a small number of stem cells turned into dopamine - producing cells – not enough to improve the primates ’ function by replacing missing neurons .
Instead , some stem cells turned into astrocytes , a supportive brain cell that produces neuron - nourishing chemicals .
The researchers also identified in the brains of the primate recipients a significant amount of dopamine - producing neurons that were not derived from stem cells .
The results suggest that stem cells may actually trigger the brain ’s own self - repair mechanisms by pumping out molecules that boost nerve survival and blood vessel development and decrease neural degeneration .
“ We at the Center for Aging and Brain Repair at USF Health have been arguing , for some time now , that stem cells are important for brain repair because they provide growth factors and because they send signals to the brain to help it repair itself , ” Dr. Sanberg said .
“ This study in primates showed the same effects -- that the stem cells are there to act as facilators of repair versus the original hypothesis that stem cells are transplanted to merely replace an injured cell . ”
Dr. Sanberg said the study has relevance to all audiences .
“ This was one of the first studies to look at stem cells in primates with Parkinson ’s disease .
It ’s the first step in translating that research , ” he said .
“ We hear about new sources of stem cells monthly , but how we take those cells and treat disease is going to be a significant amount of translational work .
This is one of the first studies that starts that process - looking at primates before going into people with Parkinson ’s disease . ”
While the transplanted cells appeared not to form tumors following transplant , Dr. Sanberg said the translational research in primates raises questions that need to be addressed before moving to human trials , including determining the most effective cell dosing and brain sites to target .
“ Pending further preclinical studies , ” he concludes in the commentary , “ the results so far from the current study are supportive for developing a safe and effective stem cell treatment for Parkinson ’s disease . ”
Dr. Sanberg ’s commentary and the study it highlights will also be published in the magazine edition of PNAS .
The global journal has been a resource for multidisciplinary research since 1914 .
Its online edition , where Dr. Sanberg ’s commentary appears this week , receives nearly 6 million e-visitor “ hits ” per month .
Content includes research reports , commentaries , reviews , perspectives , colloquium papers , and actions of the Academy .
Coverage in PNAS spans the biological , physical , and social sciences .

Even though Singapore Airlines has equipped its new A380 jets with private double bed suites , company officials are saying you 'd better not do the bouncy bouncy in there or you 'll meet with their stern disapproval .
What are they going to do ?
Throw you off the plane ?
The first couple to book one of the double suites was n't too impressed with the airline 's prudish demeanor .
" So they 'll sell you a double bed , and give you privacy and endless champagne — and then say you can't do what comes naturally ? " asked Tony Elwood , a 76 - year - old passenger who booked the suite with his wife , Julie .

Let 's not forget that Singapore Airlines is based in a country which still deems it okay to smack people with a rattan cane for even the slightest transgression , so you 'd better keep that johnson in your pants , big boy .
" There are things that are acceptable on an aircraft and things that are n't , and the rules for behaviour in our double beds are the same ones that apply throughout the aircraft , " proclaims Stephen Forshaw , a Singapore Airlines official .
He warns , " If couples used our double beds to engage in inappropriate activity , we would politely ask them to desist . "
Since the doors close on the suites , how on earth are Singapore Airlines flight attendants going to know who is engaging in the old in / out and who is n't ?
It 's always so noisy in aircraft anyway , you could be screaming to high heaven and no one would ever know .

We 're thinking one of the most difficult temptations to resist aboard a Singapore Airlines double - bed flight is avoiding asking one of those gorgeous flight attendants , known as " the Singapore Girls , " to join us inside the comfy suite .
But then , for the $ 14,320 price for two tickets in one of the suites , we'd hope a good swift caning would be included in the ticket price .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The Iraqi government wants U.S. security firm Blackwater to pay $ 8 million in compensation to each of the families of 17 people killed in a shooting last month , a senior government source said on Tuesday .
The source said the figure was roughly in line with compensation paid by the Libyan government to the families of the 270 people killed in the 1988 Lockerbie airline bombing over Scotland .
“ We want them to pay $ 8 million for each family , ” the source told Reuters .
“ The same level as the compensation for the Lockerbie victims . ”
Blackwater , which has a U.S. State Department contract to protect its diplomats in Baghdad , has been told of the demand , the source said .
It was unclear what Blackwater ’s response was and the North Carolina - based firm did not immediately respond to e-mailed questions from Reuters .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack declined comment on how much compensation its contractor had been asked to pay for the September 16 shootings .
“ Obviously , the issue of what some refer to as bereavement payments -- or a number of different names for them -- is an issue of some sensitivity that we are taking a look at , ” McCormack told reporters .

“ It is an issue that commonly turns up when you have security incidents in which there is a loss of life .
As with other previous incidents throughout Iraq , civilian or military , we are taking a look at the issue . ”
There are four separate investigations into Blackwater ’s actions in Iraq and McCormack cautioned people about “ jumping to conclusions ” on the private security contractor ’s conduct .
Far more often , he said there was a loss of innocent life from the actions of al Qaeda and other extremist groups in Iraq than security contractors working for the U.S. government .
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said on Sunday the investigation set up by Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki had found Blackwater “ deliberately killed ” the 17 people in the September 16 shooting in western Baghdad .
Blackwater has said its guards responded lawfully to a hostile threat against a U.S. State Department convoy it was guarding but Dabbagh said the investigation also had found there was no evidence they had come under fire .
The incident caused outraged among Iraqis who see security contractors like Blackwater as private armies that act with impunity .
Blackwater employs about 1,000 people in Iraq .
Its founder , former U.S. Navy SEAL Erik Prince , told a congressional hearing last week his men had come under small - arms fire and “ returned fire at threatening targets . ”
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice last Friday ordered tighter controls on Blackwater , including putting cameras on the company ’s vehicles and ensuring diplomatic security agents accompany and monitor each convoy .
A Libyan intelligence agent was found guilty in 2001 of the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , which killed 270 people including 189 Americans .
In March 2003 , Libya reached a political settlement with the United States and Britain to accept civil responsibility for the bombing , with Libya agreeing to pay about $ 2.7 billion in total compensation .
Is this guy a pothead or did he just try it once ?
Your employer may wonder .
A quick urine test will not offer them an answer .
If someone wants to know if you have used drugs recently , they can buy a kit with plastic urine cups and strips that change color like a home pregnancy test .
This simple analysis can reveal which drugs someone has used – but not the amount .
Pushing the limits of analytical chemistry , a team of German researchers has found a way to estimate how much weed someone has smoked in the past three months .
They described their efforts in a recent issue of Forensic Science International .
Whenever someone uses a drug , a tiny bit of the illicit chemical will become entrapped in keratin – a protein that is the main component of hair .
This serves as a rather accurate record of their illicit recreation .
To determine whether that record is precise enough to calculate how much Maryjane someone has smoked , the German chemists took hair samples from 12 male potheads and 10 of their straightedge peers .
The researchers pulverized the hair into a fine powder , dissolved the powder in a strong base , and then extracted all of the volatile chemicals from it with a solvent called hexane .
Once the extracts were ready , the researchers used a gas chromatography mass spectrometer to separate out each chemical that was withdrawn from the hair and thus measure the amount of each molecule individually .
By adding up the amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol , cannabinol , and cannabidiol present in a man 's hair sample , the researchers could sometimes – but not always – accurately estimate how much weed he smokes .
By measuring the amount of THC alone , they could not make an accurate prediction .
Many factors can prevent this test from being completely reliable .
If someone gets a lot of sun , ultraviolet light will destroy some of the drug molecules in their hair – lowering the estimate of how much weed they smoke .
The same thing will happen if they bleach their hair .
Everyone deals with drugs a little differently .
Some people pee them out faster than others .
Other people have speedy liver enzymes that swiftly destroy drugs .
These pharmacogenetic differences also can affect the accuracy of their measurements .

KANSAS CITY , Mo. , Aug. 21 — Senator Barack Obama said Tuesday that even if the military escalation in Iraq was showing limited signs of progress , efforts to stabilize the country had been a “ complete failure ” and American troops should not be entangled in the sectarian strife .
“ No military surge , no matter how brilliantly performed , can succeed without political reconciliation and a surge of diplomacy in Iraq and the region , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Iraq ’s leaders are not reconciling .
They are not achieving political benchmarks . ”
Mr. Obama , of Illinois , addressed the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars one day after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , one of his leading rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 , addressed the group .
In her speech , Mrs. Clinton , of New York , said elements of the Bush administration ’s troop buildup in Iraq appeared to be working , particularly in Al Anbar Province .
After Mr. Obama made his remarks , he was asked in a brief interview with reporters whether he agreed with that assessment .
This morning , you left the house tagged with a tracking device that the government can use to find out where you have been and where you are going .
I 'm talking , of course , about your cell phone .
Mobile phones communicate continuously with cellular towers in order to receive calls , sending out a signal registering its existence and identity with the provider 's nearest towers .
The provider stores this cell - site data , which can be triangulated to determine the customer 's physical location .
While most courts considering the issue have held that police need " probable cause " to track your movements , a new decision ( . pdf ) last week out of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts holds that law enforcement need show only " relevance to an ongoing investigation " to get a historical record of your past movement ( something like the Jeffy trail in The Family Circus cartoon ) .
Why are courts treating past and prospective tracking so differently , and should they ?
The problem starts with a basic congressional assumption that real - time information in transit is more private than stored information – a bias that is enshrined in various laws that protect wire and electronic communications .
Congress has imposed stronger limits on how real - time information is accessed and used .
The Pen Register statute grants the government access to real - time ( in - transit ) signaling ( to / from ) information upon an assertion that the information requested is " relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation . "
While cell - site data could be considered signaling information , Congress protected location information further under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ( CALEA ) , which specifically prohibits using the Pen Register statute as the sole authority for obtaining physical - location information .
So the government argues that the Stored Communications
Act is additional authority for its obtaining cell - site information with a mere showing of relevance .
The SCA gives the government access to stored records or other information pertaining to a subscriber of an electronic communications service ( not including the contents of communications ) if the government " offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that ... the records or other information sought are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation . "
This standard is very similar to the standard for government access under the Pen Register statute , although under the SCA the government must produce evidence , and not merely certify , that the information is relevant .
Still , most courts have rejected this argument , because the SCA applies only to stored information , and utterly lacks the procedural safeguards ( such as time limits and provisions for sealing , renewal and periodic reports ) typical of prospective surveillance statutes .
In the absence of a statute permitting government access , the majority of courts have ruled that law enforcement can only track your future cell - phone movements with a warrant based on probable cause .
Some of these decisions have further suggested that a warrant is constitutionally required , regardless of what the statutes say , because you have a reasonable expectation of privacy – protected by the Fourth Amendment – for your location information .
These constitutional privacy concerns were given short shrift earlier this month in the U.S. District of Massachusetts ruling .
The new case considers when the government can track your historical , rather than current , movements .
The judge held that cell information which reveals your past movements is squarely covered by the SCA , so the Pen Register statute and the additional CALEA limitations do not come into play .
Further , the court rejected the idea that your past movements are protected by the Fourth Amendment .
Its ruling was based on two Supreme Court cases involving tracking devices .
In one , United States v. Knotts , police placed a tracking beeper in a can of chemicals to find out where the defendant was transporting it .
The Supreme Court found no Fourth Amendment violation because the suspect 's car was visible on public highways , no more private than it would have been to an officer 's naked eye .
In contrast , in United States v. Karo , the Supreme Court held that police violated the Fourth Amendment when the tracking beacon allowed police to monitor the suspect within the protected zone of a private home .
With historical tracking by cell phone , the Massachusetts district court said the case was more like Knotts than like Karo , because there was no indication the information would give away anything that happened within a protected zone .
Something is deeply screwy with this scheme .
While police may be able to trail a suspect 's car with the naked eye , only psychics can track our past behavior without this cell - site data .
There is also a difference of scale .
Allowing police to place a tracking device on a suspect 's car is quite different from allowing them to track any innocent person who 's activities are merely " relevant " to an investigation .
We will continue to see problems like this as courts try to apply existing privacy laws to new technologies .
Congress has not proven itself to be much better at predicting technological changes and protecting privacy , either , but something should change .
Otherwise , the phone in your pocket might as well be a trail of bread crumbs .

Dear Max ,
I would n’t necessarily conflate being more aggressive with being more brutal .
We can patrol more , embed more advisors , shoot and arrest more insurgents , all without being gratuitously cruel or needlessly overbearing to civilian sensibilities .
Here is what I think happened in Iraq after April 2003 .
Bolstered by a 70 - percent approval rating , and still smarting from all the prewar hysteria from the Left , the Bush administration felt that it could run out the clock , so to speak .
Thus , each time a challenge arose — looting , the Fallujah outbreak , the Sadr uprising — their idea was to finesse the crisis as much as possible .
They were afraid to squander the capital of hard - won public support through ( unneeded ? ) escalation , escalation that would increase casualties and only encourage further domestic and international condemnation of the war .
As a result of this policy , public support vanished anyway , in dribs and drabs , each time we did not react strongly and decisively enough to a provocation .
The administration thought , apparently , that using more aggressive tactics would only further incite the growing anti-war movement and that the good news of progress in reconstruction would only continue to be ignored by a biased media .
And so with a whimper rather than a bang , our complacency and over - sensitive attention to perceived public opinion made us ever less aggressive and ever more attuned to “ force protection ” — at precisely the time more and more offensive operations were needed to break the insurgency and win back public opinion .
Now we must shatter that complacency and do in nine months what textbooks warn takes years .
It is still not too late ; history might still record as a considerable military achievement the removal of Saddam and the creation of a constitutional government in Iraq .
The President and the military believe they can pull it off , while the opposition ( whose proposals to withdraw are not matched by votes to reduce budget appropriations ) remains , to say the least , doubtful .
But the American public ’s patience will , apparently , tolerate this final effort .
I am tired of reading the latest declarations of moral outrage from politicians and pundits blaming Rumsfeld , Bush , Cheney , Franks , Sanchez , Casey , Abizaid , etc. , for “ their ” three - year - long occupation that ruined “ our ” perfect three - week war .
What happened in Iraq pales when compared to the horrifying mistakes our government and military made in the Civil War , in World War I and World War II , in Korea and Vietnam .
What would this generation of politicians and journalists have said after Cold Harbor and the Battle of the Wilderness , after the two - year - long nightmare of the fall of France , after our World War II losses in the Atlantic , after the debacle in Greece , after the surrenders at Singapore and Tobruk ?
One can only imagine .
All that matters now is correcting our mistakes , countering the defeatists , and defeating the insurgents .
We have to keep firmly in mind the correct notion that a functional democracy in Iraq would be the worst nightmare of jihadists the world over , of Iran , Syria , and the royal Gulf “ moderates . ”
Allowing Iraq to devolve into the Lebanon of the 1980’s or the Afghanistan of the 1990 ’s , on the other hand , would restore al Qaeda ’s lost sanctuary and provide a new base of operations for Iranian - backed terrorists .
To paraphrase one commentator , such a failure would inflict “ 1,000 Mogadishus ” - worth of damage on the reputation of the U.S. military and on a nascent and necessary U.S. Middle East policy , a policy seeking to transcend the dangerous ( and cynical ) “ realism ” of the past .
Best ,
Victor

The Government Secure Intranet ( GSi ) program replaces their previous system , called Legacy , which has come under some scrutiny in recent years .
The new system , completed on July 31 , has communications company Energis effectively acting as an ISP for a private network within which government departments can communicate .
" Government is an absolute target for worms , viruses and malware .
What we needed to create was a safe network in which government departments can communicate and operate more efficiently , " said Andrew Swaffer , GSi client director at Energis .
The service will feed some 350,000 staff and has already been put into use by some of the larger departments , such as the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) .
All government departments have an option which level of service they take , from the simple peer - to - peer service to anti-spam and content and image control .
Currently around a sixth are using the anti-spam service – the content and image control will be available from September .
If the migration is successful Energis plan to extend it to local authorities .
" It 's a big challenge , but there are business and operational benefits to what we 're doing here , " said Swaffer .
" The biggest obstacle is that in order to get on board local government has to sort it 's own systems out first .
It 's a huge task . "
In June SC reported the U.K. critical national infrastructure was being targeted by hackers intent on delivering malware to systems .
Swaffer and colleague Paul Hayman , director of government and public sector at Energis , said they have already seen examples of such targeted attacks .
According to the company five percent of government emails received contain some sort of virus .
Dictionary attacks were also cited as a growing threat .

Sony clearly does n't have an issue with trying a few different pricing levels for its flagship PlayStation 3 .
The PlayStation 3 debuted with both a $ 500 and $ 600 price tag , but since that time much has changed .
With sales staying modest , Sony initially nixed the $ 500 PS3 and then announced an 80 GB unit , then they dropped the price of the 60 GB unit , and then revealed that the 60 GB unit was " clearance . "
This meant that there is no official " entry level " PS3 , so we 've been waiting for Sony to address that issue .
In the meantime , you can see what Sony has done : the company has focused on reducing the cost of building the PS3 while also closely watching how sales of lower - priced units are doing .
The time is ripe for a new PS3 model to hit the scene , and we strongly believe that the company is about to launch a $ 399 PS3 in time for the holiday season .
We 've been hearing rumors to this effect for some time , but now the evidence of a new PlayStation 3 configuration is almost undeniable : an FCC filing details a new model number for the system .
What this new model number means is impossible to know for sure ; the FCC filing leaves out pictures to " avoid premature release of sensitive information prior to marketing or release of the product to the public . "
The product description tells us that there is no difference in the wireless configuration , CPU , or Bluetooth aspects of this new PlayStation 3 .
The information that details the differences has been conveniently left out of the released paperwork , for the aforementioned reason .
So what does this mean ?
We know something new is coming , but everything else is open to speculation .
Luckily we have sources in the industry who have long been telling us about an upcoming $ 399 40 GB PlayStation 3 .
A $ 399 PlayStation 3 would be a great way to get new consumers into the Blu-ray enabled system for the holidays , and it would help to counter the Xbox 360's lower price and newly announced pack - in software .
We also have a date to pin this information to : our sources tell us that the $ 399 PlayStation 3 hardware will launch on , or before , November 16 .
We 're confident in this information , as our sources in this area have always given us accurate information in the past .
The " sensitive information " in the FCC filing will go public 45 days from September 4 , unless something changes .
We 're confident saying that Sony is readying a new low - priced weapon for the console wars , regardless .
Frankly , we also think it makes good sense .
Why did n't Sony announce this at the Tokyo Game Show ?
We reason that the company will hold off as long as possible on the announcement so as not to stymie existing sales .
A few years ago , Mark Bent and his wife lived in Africa .
They would bring hot meals to children who scavaged dump sites all hours of the day .
Recently , the couple went back to that African village and and were compelled to make a real difference .
There was no light for those villagers .
Sure , during the day , but at night – only the light afforded by a rare hunter ’s moon .
So , Mark quit his job and designed a solar powered flashlight .
How might a flashlight make a real difference ?
Huge difference !
Night light helps keep people safer and gives them opportunities to read , study , and develop their minds at night .
For instance , think back to when you were in grade school .
Trail walking ?
Getting home safe on a really dark night ?
Surely you have memories of reading at night ?
Mysteries ?
Comic books ?
Short stories ?
How much of your own imagination developed over that time ?
Mark now has a great business model to back up delivery of this product around the world .
Specifically , if you buy a flashlight for yourself , he ’ll give another one to a village without lights or to troops in Iraq .
Hence , the name BoGo ( buy one , give one ) .
In this way , reading at night no longer has to be an economic decision or burden .
You ’ll also cut out the need for batteries and will be doing a small part to save the planet from wasteful consumption .
So check out that link above , buy one , and help Mark light up the lives of others around the world .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 29  The annual raise for members of the House is on the verge of being eaten up in political payback .
Republicans , who were attacked by Democrats in the 2006 campaign for accepting annual raises while not increasing the federal minimum wage for 10 years , say they are inclined to oppose any increase for representatives .
And Democrats say they are not likely to enact one on their own , which would open them to attack in the next campaign .
Republican leaders point a finger at the hard - hitting Democratic campaign operation of last year , saying Monday that making the raises a political issue violated a longtime unwritten agreement between the parties .
“ It was absolutely understood and agreed to , ” said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri , the second - ranking Republican .

At humankind ’s current rate of growth , it is estimated that by the year 2050 , the planet will be host to three billion more people than it is today , making for a 40 % increase over Earth ’s current population .
Yet at present , over 80 % of the planet ’s arable land is already in use , which leaves one to wonder how such a large number of people will be fed .
No doubt improvements will be made in the efficiency of farming techniques , but only so many calories can be coaxed out of the fertile portions of the Earth each year .
Dr. Dickson Despommier of Columbia University has been leading an effort to address that very problem before it becomes a crisis , and his proposed solution is interesting and well - researched … it involves a series of high rises in urban areas where fruit , vegetables , and livestock can be raised by utilizing greenhouse growing methods and recycled resources year - round , allowing cities of the future to become self - sufficient .
This concept is called the Vertical Farm .
From the site :
The Vertical Farm is a concept that seeks to address the major concerns of the environmental degradation of the modern city by composting , recycling waste and farming in a standard tenement building .
The “ ecological footprint ” of the city will be lessened and therefore the city will become a more sustainable setting .
The reduction of wastes and the production of foods for consumption will in turn increase the quality of life for all those within the city and its surrounding area .
The reduction in transportation of both wastes and of food products and the use of abandoned buildings will directly increase the quality of the urban settling .
The Vertical Farm Project website goes into great detail on how such a structure could feed up to 50,000 people year - round , assuming 2,200 calories per person .
Plans are currently underway to establish a prototype of the Vertical Farm in New York City in order to further investigate the feasibility of the project , and to address the negative consequences as they might arise .

Sure , Apple TV is pretty close to useless if you wanna watch stuff on your television .
But it 's a godsend to at least one independent filmmaker .
This weekend , at a neighborhood movie theater in Brooklyn , New York , an Apple TV made its way into the projection booth , streaming a high - def digital flick onto the big screen .
And when we say big screen , we mean the really big screen .
With the New York premiere of his debut feature , The Insurgents , writer - director Scott Dacko is using Apple 's video contraption in place of a digital tape deck , bypassing so many of the hassles that plague poorly - funded digital filmmakers struggling to reach an audience .
" As far as I know , we 're the first people to have ever done this , " Dacko told us .
" And it looked great . "
Well , it looked good .
Dacko acknowledges that the image is " a little flawed " in places , thanks to some heavy compression from Apple 's web - centric video codec .
But his Apple TV kludge is cheap .
And it 's easy .
Apple TV makes its big screen debut ?
Since shooting
The Insurgents with an HD camera in early 2006 , Dacko has shown the topsy - turvy political thriller in film festivals across the globe , and each time , he was forced to squeeze the flick onto a different breed of digital media .
He 's shown on DVD , DVcam , DigiBeta , Beta SP , D5 and HDCam .
" For an indie filmmaker , this is a huge cost , and it 's a huge pain in the ass , " Dacko explained .
" And you never know if they 're really going to be able to play .
The theater might say they take HDCam , but then you get there and they do n't take HDCam SR .
Or you 've got 4.4.4 HDCam , and they only play 4.2.2 . "
Then , when the film was picked for a week - long run at the Cobble Hill Cinemas in Brooklyn , he was faced with a new problem .
More comfortable screening films the old - fashioned way - on film - the theater was n't fully equipped for digital projection .
It had an LCD projector - a Sony VPL FX52 - but no tape deck .
Dacko thought about renting a deck for the week .
But even a low - quality DigiBeta setup would cost him $ 1000 .
And if he upgraded to an HDCam deck - which would require an HDCam projector - he 'd end up shelling out a cool ten grand .

Steampunk is a kind of speculative fiction that usually takes place in urban settings where the future meets the past : Victorian era inventions clash with often dark alternate realities .
However , what started as a literary genre has since evolved into an amazing urban art form with incredible real - life inventions , modifications and redesigns .
The following is an introduction to the art of Steampunk , with everything from altered guitars to a Steampunked iPod .
In Steampunk literature , the living computers and flying cars of science fiction are typically replaced by hulking steam - powered machines and floating dirigibles .
Moreover , the art of design in these future - past visions reflects the ultimate integration of form and function epitomized during the periods being referenced : where even gears and buttons on an archaic machine were beautifully crafted .
Shown above are three amazing modifications of contemporary technologies to fit the aesthetic of the Steampunk era : the Villianizer , a re-engineered Stratocaster and a Vespa .
Like Goth , steampunk draws on elements of Victorian dress .
Like Cyberpunk , there is an emphasis on the technology and culture of the material world as shown through and alternate present or future .
Beyond those , however , there is a kind of celebration of the more elemental and tangible science and technology of periods prior to our present computer age .
However , some of the most amazing Steampunk redesigns combine these two eras and involve modifications of computer monitors or even entire laptop computers .
One of the most amazing feats of Steampunk art and engineering is the Steampunk Tree House , constructed for the Burning Man Arts Festival .
This fully - functional interactive art pieces was one of the highlights of this year ’s Burning Man Festival , lit up spectacularly at night and able to withstand strong daytime winds as shown in the above photographs .
Steampunk ideas have also increasingly been retroactively applied to existing cult classics .
Perhaps the most notable of these is Star Wars .
Shown above is one of a series of Star Wars themed Steampunk renderings depicting , in this case , the Death Star reimagined for the Star Wars universe .
Other artists have created tangible works such as a Star Wars Steampunk light saber made from old radio parts and evening a functioning R2D2 Steampunk robot .
Some clever individuals even scripted and filmed a hilarious Star Trek parody set to a Steampunk theme and complete with archaic cinematography and a fitting musical score :

Here 's Thomas Ricks ( a Pentagon correspondent for the Washington Post and the author of " Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq " ) at the World Affairs Council in August 2007 , responding to a question about the media 's failures in the run-up to the Iraq war ( at about 51:30 in the program ) :
You know , I had an argument about this with Noam Chomsky , the leftist at MIT .
He and I were on a radio show together and he kept on going on about the MSM , the mainstream media , this and that .
And it suddenly dawned on me , I said , " Professor Chomsky , when you say the mainstream media , what you 're really talking about is one thing : the New York Times . "
And he said , " Yeah . "
And I said , " I do n't work for the New York Times . "
( The bare words on the page do n't begin to do justice to the smirking condescension of Ricks ' delivery , by the way ; for that you 'll have to listen to the audio . )
Now , anyone who 's read or listened to Chomsky at any length knows that this is a complete crock -- Chomsky does n't use the phrase " MSM " , and he certainly does n't restrict his reading to the New York Times .
So I decided to find out whether Ricks was making this up , or just mangling the facts beyond all recognition .
The radio show Ricks was referring to was " Open Source , " hosted by Christopher Lydon .
Lydon conducted an hour - long interview of Noam Chomsky and to a lesser extent Ricks in August 2006 .
The specific exchange Ricks is referring to goes like so ( at about 30:00 in the program ) :
LYDON : The media did n't ask many questions either [ before the Iraq war ] , and it 's given -- the last month - - a pretty blind eye .
RICKS : I think that 's one of the great myths of our modern times , that the media did n't ask questions .
We asked questions , we did n't get answers .
We wrote stories .
I wrote a story a month before the invasion , I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , " You do n't know where the WMD is , do you ? " , and he said , " No , but I 'm confident that once we cross the border the Iraqis will show us . "
I wrote these stories , Walter Pincus wrote these stories .
Now , yeah , the New York Times screwed things up to a fare - thee - well , but you 're painting with a pretty broad brush if you say " the media " .
LYDON : Fair enough , Tom , I stand corrected , but I do -- I am a New York Times refugee , and reader .
But -- RICKS : Well you should expand your reading base .
LYDON : I stand corrected .
So Ricks ' version of what " Chomsky " said is not only miles off the mark , it did n't even involve Chomsky ; rather , these were Christopher Lydon 's views that Ricks was mischaracterizing .
Ricks had already asked Chomsky several direct questions and had had lengthy exchanges with him ( and Lydon sounds nothing like Chomsky ) , so Ricks certainly would have known who he was talking to at any given time .
And it 's not that these were the only views about the media expressed during the radio show , and so Ricks might understandably have made a simple mistake about the source .
In fact Chomsky explained in detail his own views on the media 's performance before the Iraq war , in direct discussion with Ricks .
Here 's a small excerpt of what Chomsky actually did say ( starting at around 35:00 ) :
CHOMSKY : I agree with Tom Ricks that the media , in a professional sense , did their job .
I suspect the Russian media did too [ regarding Afghanistan in the 1980's ] .
They described the catastrophes , they asked who was responsible , etcetera .
... [ To Ricks ]
While I agree with you about the reporting -- you know , there are brave , serious , honorable reporters there , and people ask questions like " Where are the WMD ? " , but they did n't ask the question , " Do we have the right to commit the supreme international crime ? "
If anyone were to compare the treatment of the Afghan war in Pravda with the treatment of this war in the United States , I think it would be very similar .
Or in other words , not only did Chomsky not " go on about the MSM , the mainstream media , this and that , " but he actually agreed with Ricks , twice -- albeit with the kind of deeply illuminating analogy that is his hallmark .
And Ricks was responding to ( or arguing with ) Chomsky throughout this discussion , as you 'll see if you listen to it for yourself .
So Ricks got a crystal clear summary of Chomsky 's views of the media -- yet he somehow managed to quote , attribute , and summarize them completely incorrectly .
I spared you the tail end of Ricks ' quote from the World Affairs Council ( at the top ) for as long as I could , but now I 'm afraid you must suffer as I have .
Here 's what followed Ricks ' reality - free swipe at Chomsky :
I stand by my coverage .
Are there stories I wish I 'd written differently ?
Yeah .
Are there stories I wish I 'd written more than once ?
Yeah .
But if you go back and read the Washington Post , we did a pretty bang - up job during the run-up to the war .
And my answer to the American people is , do n't blame the media -- look in the damn mirror .
The information was available .
Do n't blame it on the media .
Yes , given the above demonstration of his journalistic rigor , I 'm sure that Ricks did ( and continues to do ) a bang - up job of giving the public all the accurate and complete reporting they need to make informed decisions , and so we should all stop blaming Thomas Ricks .
The American people thought there were WMDs Iraq ?
LOOK IN THE DAMN MIRROR .
The American people thought Iraq was in cahoots with al Qaeda ?
LOOK IN THE DAMN MIRROR .
The American people expected to be crushed under the anvil of Iraq 's awesome power unless Bush attacked Iraq first ?
LOOK IN THE DAMN MIRROR !
It 's not Thomas Ricks ' fault that the American people can't keep the facts straight !
Thomas Ricks reported it all and then let the American people decide !
The American people got it wrong ?
STOP BLAMING THOMAS RICKS !
MIRROR !
MIRROR !
LOOK IN THE DAMN MIRROR !
GEHAAFAFERRRRRAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!
Whoa , sorry .
Got carried away there for a second .
( For some examples of Thomas Ricks ' bang - up job of giving the American people all the information on Iraq , see this Nexis - flexing article by Jonathan Schwarz . )
I 'd highly recommend that you take an hour to listen to the entire Open Source radio interview with Chomsky ( and Ricks ) .
Not only is it filled with useful information , it 's also worth hearing for yourself the contrast between the shallow , mainstream pomposity of Ricks ' views and the humility and depth of knowledge that Chomsky displays in dismantling them .
Ricks is badly outclassed , and he comes out of it looking like a second - rate Thomas Friedman -- which is , I suspect , a large part of the reason that his mind decided to rearrange this embarrassing bit of history to make " the leftist at MIT " look worse and him look better .

タイトルだけ見て一瞬「 smpカーネルの話?」と思ったのだけれども、実はマルチコアなマシンでプログラムをmakeする際の高速化オプションの話。
make -j
このように " - j " を付けるとマルチコア環境では高速にビルドされるとか。さらに以下のように数値も指定できて、これはコア数*2を指定すると速いとのこと。
make -j4
man makeで - jオプションのところ見てみると、なーるほど。
-j jobs 同時に実行できるジョ ブ( コマンド ) の数を指定する。 -j オプションが複数個指定された場合は、最後の指定が有効になる。引き数無しで -j オプションが与えられた場合、make は同時に実行できるジョブの数を制限しない。
Makefileの内容にもよるけれども、実コア数に対して同時実行可能なジョブ数が多すぎる場合、限界速度よりもやや落ちることになるだろうから、-jの後に同時実行するジョブ数の上限値を決めておいた方がちょっとだけいいかも、みたいな感じですな。
会社 のTritonn開発マシ ン( Dual Core Xeon 3.0GHz * 2 発 = 合計4コア)で試してみたところこんな結果となった。
それぞれ 、" make clean " した後 、 " time make " でオプションを付けたりつけなかったりしつつ計測した値。
" make " だけ( オプション無し ) の場合 。

" make - j8 " の場合 。

まぁ、とりあえず " - j " 使っとけということでしょうか。自宅の開発サーバの場合、PentiumM 1.5GHz(もちろん１コア ) なんだけれどもmake cleanした後のビルドがだいたい20分〜30分はかかってる気がする。コア数だけでなくコア単体の性能も大幅に負けてるからかな。
うーん、ここまでマルチコアでビルド速度があがるとなると、やっぱり自宅にも新しいマシンが欲しくなってきたw
Core2Quadマシンかなー。家に帰って2時間くらい開発しようとおもった矢先、ヘッダファイル弄ってmake cleanする必要がでてきて30分ぼけーっと待つのはもう終わりじゃー。というかPentiumMでのビルド待ち時間に耐えられなくて日曜日に会社に来るのも終わりですな。
WASHINGTON , July 9 
The Army missed its recruiting goals in June for the second straight month , as rising casualties in Iraq and a strong economy at home kept the service from enlisting enough new soldiers , Pentagon officials said .
The Army fell more than 1,000 active duty recruits short of its June goal of 8,400 , said a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the figures had not yet been formally released .
Lt. Col. Dan Baggio , an Army spokesman , declined to confirm the numbers , which are due to be made public on Tuesday , but he acknowledged that there had been a shortfall .
“ We ’re not in a doomsday situation , ” Colonel Baggio said .
“ When we do n’t make the goal , that is something of a concern , but we are not panicking . ”
Users may not be able to add Apple features to an unlocked phone
Earlier this week Apple said a planned update would leave the device " permanently inoperable " .
Thousands of iPhone owners hacked their expensive gadget in order to unlock it for use with other mobile carriers and to run a host of unsupported programs .
There are also reports of the update causing issues with unaltered iPhones .
On Monday Apple issued a statement in which it said many of the unauthorised iPhone unlocking programs caused " irreparable damage " to the device 's software .
The company said this would " likely result in the modified iPhone becoming permanently inoperable when a future Apple - supplied iPhone software update is installed " .
That warning has now proved correct as many owners are reporting their phones no longer work following installation of the update .
Apple requires iPhone owners to take out a lengthy contract with AT&T in the United States but there are a number of programs on the net that unlock the device for use with other networks .
Some owners are reporting on technology blogs and Apple 's own forums that the update is deleting contacts information , as well as photos and music , on iPhones that have not been modified in any way .
Refrigeration units began pumping chilly air deep into an Arctic mountain cavern today , launching the innovative and critical " cooling down " phase of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in advance of its official opening early next year as a fail - safe repository of the world 's vital food crops .
Svalbard is now three days into the three - month " Polar Night " period when there is 24 hours of complete darkness .
Engineers working for the government of Norway , which is building the facility on the Svalbard archipelago , launched the cooling operation that , over the next two months , will bring the temperature of the sandstone rock surrounding the seed vault from its current - 5 degrees Celsius ( 23 degrees Fahrenheit ) , to - 18 degrees Celsius ( about 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
The vault is to be officially opened 26 February 2007 .
" It 's very satisfying to see the vault evolve from a bold concept to an impressive facility that has everything we need to protect crop biodiversity , " said Mr. Terje Riis - Johansen , Norway 's Minister of Agriculture and Food .
" The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , " said Cary Fowler , Executive Director of the Rome - based Global Crop Diversity Trust , which has partnered with Norway and the Nordic Gene Bank on the establishment of the vault .
" At these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 1000 years . "
With its capacity to hold up to 4.5 million seed samples , the vault will eventually house virtually every variety of almost every important food crop in the world .
The vast collection is intended as a hedge against disaster so that food production can be restarted anywhere on the planet should it be threatened by a regional or global catastrophe .
Thus , it is critical that the vault have the technical capability to keep seeds cool and viable for a long period of time .
" We ran a lot of computer simulations to determine the optimum approach and believe we have found a very effective and especially energy efficient way to establish reliably cool conditions inside the vault , " said project manager Magnus Bredeli Tveiten with Statsbygg , the Norwegian government 's Directorate of Public Construction .
" We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well - preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility . "
Engineers are essentially using rock as a " cold store , " he said , an approach that has become popular on the Norwegian mainland as a way to establish energy efficient refrigeration systems .
To do this , workers recently brought in a temporary 30 kilowatt refrigeration system from the mainland .
They are using it to establish an - 18 degree temperature approximately 10 meters deep into the sandstone surrounding the vault .
The vault sits at the end of a 120 meter tunnel blasted in a mountain near the town of Longyearbyen on the island of Spitsbergen .

Tveiten said past experience has shown that the rock should stay sufficiently cold over a long period of time to allow a - 18 C temperature in the vault to be maintained by a smaller , permanent 10 kilowatt system .
He said the long - term cooling process also is aided by the natural permafrost in the area and the snow and ice that covers the mountain for much of the year -- all of which ensure that the rock stays at least at - 4 C .
As engineers move quickly to complete the mechanics of the operation , Tveiten said Norwegian officials also are advancing rapidly to ensure that the vault 's aesthetic features are as impressive as its technical qualities .
Norway requires setting aside at least one percent of public building budgets for artwork .
To comply with this mandate , Statsbygg recently approved the design of a large , sparkling metallic sculpture by the Norwegian artist Dyveke Sanne that will be incorporated into the mountain - side entrance portal of the vault , making it visible from miles around .
The installation utilizes multiple pieces of highly polished sheet metal installed along the roof and front of the portal to serve as reflectors .
They are placed so they will sparkle in the Arctic " midnight sun " of the summer months , and will make use of fibre - optics for lighting during the long Arctic winters .
" We really want this facility to inspire , to stand out as a highly visible monument to the often obscure but very important mission of conserving humanity 's agriculture heritage , " said Mr. Terje Riis - Johansen .
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections from around the globe .
If seeds are lost , e.g. as a result of natural disasters , war or simply a lack of resources , the seed collections may be reestablished using seeds from Svalbard .
The seed vault is owned by the Norwegian government which has also financed the construction work , costing nearly NOK 50 million .
An Arizona - based wildlife biologist likely died of the plague , officials from Grand Canyon National Park announced on Friday .
Autopsy reports for Eric York , a 37 - year - old wildlife biologist for the National Park Service , showed that he had plague in his body .
Officials said that 49 of York 's coworkers and others who came within a 6 - foot diameter of him were placed on antibiotics .
As of Wednesday , they were still on medication , but none had become ill or displayed symptoms , officials said .
Officials said York was most likely exposed to the plague when he performed an autopsy on a mountain lion that had been infected and most likely killed by it .
York was the only person to come in contact with the dead mountain lion , according to officials .
York presented symptoms of exposure on Oct. 30 , three days after the mountain lion autopsy .
He went to Grand Canyon Clinic , located on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon , with flu - like symptoms .
York was sent home that day because the symptoms of plague are difficult to detect and are often confused with the flu , officials said .
York , a lifetime wildlife enthusiast from Massachusetts , was found dead in his home on Nov. 2 .
York had been located at the Grand Canyon as an employee of the National Park Service for two years , officials said .
His family will hold a private memorial service for him on Saturday .

A secret draft of regulations ( pdf ) that would fundamentally rewrite the Endangered Species Act was leaked to two environmental organizations , which provided them to the press Tuesday .
An article in Salon quotes Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman saying , “ The proposed changes fundamentally gut the intent of the Endangered Species Act . ”
The changes are fiercely technical and complicated , but make future listings extremely difficult , redefine key concepts to the detriment of protected species , virtually hand over administration of the act to hostile states , and severely restrict habitat protections .
Many of the changes — lifted from unsuccessful legislative proposals from then - Senator ( now Interior Secretary ) Dirk Kempthorne and the recently defeated congressman Richard Pombo — are reactions to policies and practices established as a result of litigation filed by environmental organizations including Earthjustice .
“ After the failure of these legislative proposals in the last Congress , the Bush administration has opted to gut the Endangered Species
Act through the only avenue left open : administrative regulations , ” said Hasselman .
“ This end - run around the will of Congress and the American people will not succeed . ”
A major change would make it more difficult for a species to gain protection , by scaling back the “ foreseeable future ” timeframe in which to consider whether a species is likely to become extinct .
Instead of looking far enough ahead to be able to reasonably determine whether a species could be heading for extinction , the new regulations would drastically shorten the timeframe to either 20 years or 10 generations at the agency ’s discretion .
For species with long generations like killer whales and grizzly bears , this truncated view of the future is n’t nearly enough time to accurately predict whether they are at - risk now .
“ These draft regulations represent a total rejection of the values held by the vast majority [ of ]
Americans : that we have a responsibility to protect imperiled species and the special places they call home , ” said Kate Freund , Legislative Associate at Earthjustice .
According to several sources within the Fish and Wildlife Service quoted by Salon , hostility to the law within the agency has never been so intense .
“ I have 20 years of federal service in this and this is the worst it has ever been , ” one unnamed source is quoted as saying .
In addition , the proposal would allow projects by the Forest Service and other agencies to proceed even if scientific evidence suggests that the projects might drive species to extinction so long as the rate of decline does n’t accelerate owing to the project .
The Bush administration ’s antipathy to the law is shown by the numbers of species it has protected , in each case as the result of litigation — 57 .
By comparison , 253 species were listed during the Reagan administration , 521 under Clinton , and 234 under Bush I .
The administration reportedly had expected to reveal the new regulations in a few weeks .
The draft regulations must be published in the Federal Register for public comment before they can become final , which is likely to be at least a year off .

CNN : Why do Fox News viewers distrust all other news sources ?

CNN 's Howard Kurtz reported Sunday on a new Pew research poll which shows not only that Democrats have a much more favorable opinion than Republicans of network tv news and national newspapers but also that , even among Republicans , those who watch Fox News are more likely to have an unfavorable view of other news sources .
" Does all the media - bashing on Fox convince viewers that news organizations are basically populated by liberal Bush - haters ? " Kurtz asked Jim Garaghty of the conservative National Review .
Garaghty suggested it would be more appropriate to blame Dan Rather and the flap in 2004 over the allegedly - forged Bush Texas Air National Guard memos .
" I think the more offended you are by an incident like Dan Rather , " he said , " the more you say ' well the hell with them , I 'm not going to pay any attention to them ' ... and Fox News is there to fill in the gap . "
Kurtz then asked Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune , " Is it possible that Fox is influencing its viewers in what they think of the media , or do they already distrust the media and that 's why they gravitate towards Fox ? "
" I find this whole poll to be remarkably unsurprisng , " Page replied .
" Roger Ailes ... launched Fox News with the marketing idea that ' we are the alternative to all that ' ... and obviously that 's having an effect . "
Kurtz concluded by turning for comment to Brooke Gladstone of National Public Radio , who pointed out , " There 's a media phenomenon called ' incestuous amplification , ' where if you only talk to the people who already agree with you ... then the more extreme positions get noisier and noisier . "
The following video is from CNN's Reliable Sources , broadcast on August 12 .
The Art of Lisp & Writing
Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge .
 Charles Darwin
Lisp is the language of loveliness .
With it a great programmer can make a beautiful , operating thing , a thing organically created and formed through the interaction of a programmer / artist and a medium of expression that happens to execute on a computer .
Taught that programming or the worse " developing software " is like a routine engineering activity , many find difficulty seeing writing as a model or even a metaphor for programming .
Writing is creative , it is self - expression , it is art , which is to say it is n't a science and unlike science and engineering , it is n't a serious activity .
Judgments like this , though , are easiest made by people who do n't seriously engage in making both science and art .
Art , engineering , and science are in that order part of a continuum of finding truth in the world and about ourselves .
Artists make things and have always done so , gathering knowledge .
There is sometimes no other purpose for what artists make than the need to embody an artistic statement in some formperhaps in an artifact or perhaps on paper .
When an artist makes something , he or she is drawing on two parts ( at least ) of the world at the same time : the part that is driving the construction which could be thought of as being within the artist in a sense , and the part that is in the world providing the substances that combine under physical laws to become the artistic artifact .
The least bit of artistic knowledge - making is that the artist is , in making the thing , making a map of what is possible and how the physical world relates to the metaphorical , imaginative , and interior worlds of people .
And the other extreme is that in trying to make something perhaps grand , the artist is stretching what people know about the world .
Even today there is debate about how some artistic structures were made by ancient artists .
Artists discover the properties of the world .
Artists who create by writing or producing other representations of what the world is or could be are also laying out a map for how the world could become , and in cases where artists need technological explanations in their stories and myths , scientists and engineers in many cases explore how to build what they were delighted to learn about as children or adults from the dream - makers .
For example , in 1587 someone published a set of tall tales about a possibly historical man known as " Faustus " in a book that came to be known as German Faustbuch or Historia von D. Johan Faustus .
The Faustbuch was translated and changed by a man known only as " P. F. " in 1592 into the English as The History of the Damnable Life and Deserved Death of Doctor John Faustus .
In this book Dr. John Faustus rides a wagon pulled by dragons to the sun .
And as time went on , engineers and scientists worked on and devised flying machines , as commonplace today as were sailing ships in the 16th century .
Is it a coincidence that cellphones look suspiciously like Star Trek communicators ?
We can see an early fascination with traveling beneath the sea in the story of Jonah and in the legend of Atlantis .
Greeks and Romans wrote about diving bells , and so did medieval writers .
As people need or want to do things with materials and the world , people with special skill take the fore and devise or discover how to manipulate the physical world to make those things .
To avoid future mistakes , these makers write down rules of thumb , patterns of creation and making , and safety factors as a practical matter .
Today we call them engineers .
When we think of engineering today we think of carefully planned scientific engineering such as building bridges , where it is a fairly linear though costly and complicated process to go from the planning stage to a completed bridge .
We forget the centuries of tinkering with bridge design in prehistoric and ancient times when bridges were gingerly tested as designers searched for principles .
Even still , on November 7 , 1940 , at 11:00 AM , the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed from wind - caused vibrations after being open to the public for a few months , showing that even sophisticated engineering techniques one could even call them contemporary engineering techniques can fail . †
Nevertheless , engineering knowledge has usually preceded scientific knowledge and often has remained constant while scientific theories about the engineering materials came and went .
" Engineers " were able to create sophisticated fires for cooking and metal working using chimneys and other forms of forced oxygen for centuries while scientists flailed from theory to theory .
For example , while advanced fire - based engineering was going on in the 6th century BC in Greece , Anaximenes 's theory was that the source or nature of the cosmos was aer ( air ) .
Aer was constantly in motion .
When aer expanded it became aither ( ether : bright fiery air as on a clear day ) ; when it expanded further , it became fire .
As aer condensed it became clouds ; further condensation led to water , ice , earth , and finally rock .
Throughout history there have been various theories of what fire was ; nevertheless , the chimneys and other artifacts of working with fire remained constant and working properly .
Scientists come along at the end ; they take what artists and engineers have found out or dreamed about the world and try to weave a simplified narrative that explains it all .
Scientists need to find the small set of facts , conditions , laws , forces , and principles that cause the beautiful complexity we experience .
Since Galileo they have agreed to use mathematics as the language of scientific knowledge .
Scientists , though , perhaps because of their desire for accuracy and precision have had the worst luck of all in pinning down the truth of the universe .
Philosophers and historians of science have pointed out and speculated on how scientific theories come and gothrough refinement , through revolution , or even through anarchy .
As the 20th century proceeded , for example , the theory of quantum mechanics and the expanding plausibility of complexity science threw everything we knew about the world into doubt , rendering many of our best theories approximations at best , or at least opening the door for a new kind of formulation ( other than mathematics ) for describing the truth about reality .
Perhaps it 's because they are the most consistent losers when it comes to understanding the world that we love scientists so much , tell them constantly that they are the only true beacons we have pointing out what is true ; we shower them with grants and money for large experiments and take away funding from the arts .
Well , let 's look at the more successful branches of human endeavor : art and engineering .
I was recently reading about writers and mapmakers .
Writers , of course , are among the most imaginative creators of false realities , meaning that they create worlds and characters that are almost like the real thing , but nowhere will we ever find those places or people or circumstances .
We might be tempted to call them liars , but even though all the details are in essence not representative of a particular reality , what is contained in their work is essentially true there may not be a Nick Adams and neither a Big Two - Hearted River in Seney , but Heminway captured something about real life that makes his story not a lie .
A mapmaker , though , is a kind of engineer designing and creating representations of the real world for a purpose , usually the purpose of understanding the lay of the land or how to get from one place to another .
A mapmaker strives for accuracy and precision in representing the geography of the world .
Right ?
Not really .
First , maps of regions of the earth involve some sort of mathematical projection which , unless understood in a way probably few people can , distorts some aspect of reality significantly .
The Mercator projection represents constant bearing paths such as sea routes as straight lines , but whereas meridians converge at the poles , in the Mercator projection they are parallel .
Further , length and area are not preserved .
If a mapmaker makes a local map , the surrounding areas are left out , as if they do n't exist .
If the map is a of a political area , it might leave out places important to people living there especially in gerrymandered political regions .
A mapmaker 's skill lies in knowing how much detail to show and where to leave things out or even tell lies .
The following is perhaps one of the most useful maps in the world today .
It depicts the London underground transportation system the Tube .
This map is indispensable even while it totally distorts the geography and geometry of London .
Using a ruler to measure distances or using a compass to determine headings is useless .
Almost all of London is left out .
The Thames , for example , more closely resembles heat ducting in a remodeled London warehouse than it does the famous river or any river for that matter .
Perhaps mapmakers are liars , too .
Novelists and especially short story writers not to mention poets who do it the mostare in the same business .
There simply cannot be enough detail in a story to be any sort of accurate representation of the actual world .
Many characters in stories apparently do n't work , do n't eat , do n't go to the bathroom , do n't pay bills , do n't work out , do n't shopin fact , all that they do is what 's connected with the story and what we need to know as readers about them .
We do n't know where some characters live , what their childhoods were like , where they grew up , what they look like , or even sometimes their names .
Fictional worlds are partly real , mainly made up , and almost entirely left out .
In this , writers ' work resembles mapmakers ' .
These skills are the skills of guiding they are the skills of perfecting the presentation of the finished product .
For the mapmaker , the available tools include existing maps , computer - aided design tools , and the talent and skill to know what a map is for and how to create one that serves that purpose for human consumption .
In contrast , the writer has only his or her skills ; pens , pencils , computers , and paper ; and the language for simplicity let 's say it 's English he or she is writing in .
The act of creating a good presentation of a story is the act of writing followed by revision .
The writer is guided by the many thousands of writers and stories that have come before , the conventions of the culture , and the extensive reading skills the audience can be expected to have .
But neither writing nor mapmaking are simply guiding .
Guides need to have knowledge of their landscapes , and such knowledge comes from exploration and discovery .
Obviously gathering the knowledge needed to make a map is discovery in fact , when asked to list the best known explorers we think of people who have explicitly set out to complete a map , where a map includes everything that is found there not simply the land and its features but the people , towns , cities , roads , resources , minerals , crops , climate , and local flora and fauna .
Christopher Columbus , Ferdinand Magellan , Marco Polo , Lewis and Clark .
To explore , one simply goes and observes .
To find out what 's on the other side of a mountain range , one just goes there ; to see what an island has to offer one simply wanders .
But these acts of going and wandering require also noticing and noting .
Most of exploration is in the nature of the locally expected :
What is on the other side of that hill is likely to be a lot like what 's on this side .
Only occasionally is the explorer taken totally by surprise , and it is for these times that many explorers live .
Similarly for writers :
What a writer thinks up in the next minute is likely to be a lot like what is being thought this minute  but not always :
Sometimes an idea so initially apparently unrelated pops up that the writer is as surprised as anyone .
And that 's why writers write .
Richard Hugo , the 20th century poet and writing teacher wrote about the use of triggers in creative work .
A trigger is any idea , scene , image , thought , sound , smell , or memory that by its " appearance " in a mind causes that mind to create something .
A trigger can end up being a metaphor , a reminder , a stepping stone , an association , or anything that sparks connections to the creative mind .
Hugo almost goes so far as saying that all creativity is really just an ability and willingness to take up the thread a trigger provides .
A poem can be said to have two subjects , the initiating or triggering subject , which starts the poem or " causes " the poem to be written , and the real or generated subject , which the poem comes to say or mean , and which is generated or discovered in the poem during the writing .
That 's not quite right because it suggests that the poet recognizes the real subject .
The poet may not be aware of what the real subject is but only [ has ] some instinctive feeling that the poem is done .
 Richard Hugo , The Triggering Town
Writing , then , can be viewed as two acts put together : the act of discovery and the act of perfecting the presentation .
One seems creative and the other analytic , and therefore , it would seem to make sense to separate them , using the best tools for each , maybe even using the best people for each .
This is where some of our software methodologists have landed .
But for almost all writers , the act of discovery is mixed up with the act of perfecting the presentation , because the actual words and the need to select and prune act as triggers and forces on the material in ways that can both require more discovery and cause it whether required or not .
And so while each writer may always start with an act of discovery and always end with an act of perfecting , the proportion of each type of act and the order in which they appear will be otherwise as varied as possible .
We might be able to say that the statistical behavior of writers shows that more acts of discovery take place near the beginning and more acts of perfecting take place at the end , but this is unimportant information for any particular writer .
It can be argued that all writing is creative writing , since if one is writing the way one should , one does not know what will be on the page until it is there .
Discovery remains the ideal .
 Richard Hugo , The Triggering Town
Writing a beautiful text takes sitting before a medium that one can revise easily , and allowing a combination of flow and revision to take place as the outlines and then the details of the piece come into view .
Changes are made as features of the writing emerge first the noise , then the sense , the force , and then the meaning and the work of the writer is to continually improve the work until it represents the best words in the best order .
Great writing is never accomplished through planning followed by implementation in words , because the nature of the word choices , phrasings , sentence structures , paragraph structures , and narrative structures interact in ways that depend of each other , and the only possible plan that can be made with which a writer can " reason " about the piece is the piece itself .
This is true of all creative making flow and revision are the essences .
Flow is the preferred state of mind for the writer doing discovery .
Flow means that there are no barriers between the movement of the mind and the placement of words on the page .
When in flow , the writer feels as if he or she is in a vivid and continuous dream in which the relevant parts of the dream flow onto the page .
Revision includes reading material already written and perfecting it as presentation , but as the name suggests , it is more .
Discovery is always mixed in with perfecting , because , as Hugo says , " one does not know what will be on the page until it is there . "
Moreover , revision when performed courageously involves determining what to leave out , just as the mapmaker determines what in the real world can remain unmentioned and unrepresented for a map made for a particular purpose .
For many , this will not sound as if I am describing programming or as some like to put it : software design and implementation .
To satisfy the biases of such folks , I will use untypical words and phrases for concepts that have acquired too strict a meaning .
Following the lead of Paul Graham , I will call Lisp a programming medium to distinguish it from languages like Java which is a programming language .
Very dynamic languages like Lisp , TCL , and Smalltalk are often used for prototyping .
One of the reasons for their success at this is that they are very robust ....
Another reason ... is that they do n't require you to pin down decisions early on .
Java has exactly the opposite property : it forces you to make choices explicitly .
 James Gosling , Java : An Overview
The difference between Lisp and Java , as Paul Graham has pointed out , is that Lisp is for working with computational ideas and expression , whereas Java is for expressing completed programs .
As James says , Java requires you to pin down decisions early on .
And once pinned down , the system which is the set of type declarations , the compiler , and the runtime system make it as hard as it can for you to change those assumptions , on the assumption that all such changes are mistakes you 're inadvertently making .
There are , of course , many situations when making change more difficult is the best thing to do :
Once a program is perfected , for example , or when it is put into light - maintenance mode .
But when we are exploring what to create given a trigger or other impetus when we are in flow we need to change things frequently , even while we want the system to be robust in the face of such changes .
In fact , most design problems we face in creating software can be resolved only through experimentation with a partially running system .
Engineering is and always has been fundamentally such an enterprise , no matter how much we would like it to be more like science than like art .
And the reason is that the requirements for a system come not only from the outside in the form of descriptions of behavior useful for the people using it , but also from within the system as it has been constructed , from the interactions of its parts and the interactions of its parts separately with the outside world .
That is , requirements emerge from the constructed system which can affect how the system is put together and also what the system does .
Furthermore , once a system is working and becomes observable , it becomes a trigger for subsequent improvement .
The Wright Brothers ' first flying machine likely satisfied all the requirements they placed on it , but they were unwilling to settle for such modest ambitions and neither was the world and even today we see the requirements for manned flight expanding as scientific , engineering , and artistic advances are made .
Christopher Alexander spoke of these issues as follows while discussing an initial Bay Area Rapid Transit ticket booth design study he did early in his career :
So it became clear that the free functioning of the system did not purely depend on meeting a set of requirements .
It had to do , rather , with the system coming to terms with itself and being in balance with the forces that were generated internal to the system , not in accordance with some arbitrary set of requirements we stated ....
What bothered me was that the correct analysis of the ticket booth could not be based purely on one 's goals , that there were realities emerging from the center of the system itself and that whether you succeeded or not had to do with whether you created a configuration that was stable with respect to these realities .
 Christopher Alexander
What bothers and surprises me that so many software developers , managers , and thinkers do n't appear to understand this point .
James Gosling in talking about Java acknowledges that at least the object - oriented notion of late or dynamic binding is important to support shipping new ( though constrained ) versions of libraries and to make derived classes , but he seems to forget that the malleability of the medium while programming is part of the act of discovery that goes into understanding all the requirements and forces internal or not that a system must be designed around .
As a system is implemented and subjected to human use , all sorts of adjustments are required .
What some call the " user interface " can undergo radical reformulation when designers watch the system in use .
Activities that are possible using the system sometimes require significant redesign to make them convenient or unconscious .
As people learn what a system does do , they start to imagine what further it could do .
This is the ongoing nature of design .
We see it at work in writing as well .
As the writer reads what 's been written , changes come to mind improvements based on writing gone awry , better words popping up , imperfections , wrong turns , too much left out , too much detail creating distractions , better approaches , or even better ideas and directions .
The acts of discovery and perfecting merge for the writer , and for this to happen it is essential that the medium in which the creation is built be the medium in which it is delivered .
No writer could even begin to conceive of using one language for drafting a novel , say , and another to make its final form .
Many writers share drafts with other writers to get more eyes and minds involved .
There is a tradition of writers ' workshops for helping a writer see what the work really is , to understand how readers will approach it , what will be clear and what obscure .
Like the mapmaker , the writer wants to find out how travelers will get on in the newly created world .
And at any point , the process of discovery can kick in again .
Like many types of artist , the writer is manipulating during the discovery and perfecting stages the very material that represents the work when complete .
In the old days , the manuscript would be retyped or typeset , but not so much anymore .
The word " manuscript " itself refers to the ( hand written ) copy of the work before printing and publication , which the writer constantly revises .
But the manuscript which is constantly worked over differs from a published work only by finally pinning down decisions like fonts , page breaks , illustrations , and design elements .
The distinction some make between prototyping and software development has vexed me my whole career .
I have never seen a version 1.0 of a system that was acceptable .
I find that every software group messes with the software up until the very time it 's deployed or delivered .
At the outset the developers want to get something running as soon as possible they are interested in leaving things out that are not necessary to the purpose of understanding the internal forces and external reactions affecting what has been built .
When prototyping was considered part of the development process , people spoke of prototyping languages or languages good for prototyping as an ideal .
Though these times are long past , software developers still need to go through the same steps as prototypers did and for the same reasons , but what these developers are using are delivery languages or languages designed to describe tightly a finished program .
The idea behind a description language is to create the most complete description of a runnable program , primarily for the benefit of a compiler and computer to create an executable version of it that is as efficient as it can be , but sometimes also for readers who will perhaps be enlightened by knowing all the details of the program without having to do a lot of thinking .
I like to think of a program written in one of these languages as a " measured drawing . "
A measured drawing is a set of plans made by a craftsman of a piece of furniture , for example , which enables an amateur to make an exact copy .
Whereas a master craftsman will be able to take a rough drawing or an idea of such a piece and by virtue of his or her expertise make a perfect specimen , an amateur may not be able to make all the joints perfectly and in the perfect positions without having all the dimensions and distances spelled out .
Often , a measured drawing requires the craftsman to build a prototype to understand the piece and then a second to make one perfect enough to provide the measurements .
The problem with the idea of using a programming language designed to describe finished programs is that programs are just like poems .
Paul Valéry wrote , " a poem is never finished , only abandoned . "
Developers begin work on a project and deliver it when it seems to work well enough they abandon it , at least temporarily .
And hence the series of released versions : 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.5 , 1.6 , 2.0 , 2.05 , etc .
Trying to write a program in manuscript using a finished - program programming language would be like trying to write a poem using a Linotype machine .
Perhaps using a Linotype machine and thereby producing a beautiful printed book of poetry is good for readers , critics , and therefore literature , but it does n't help poets and would make their writing lives intolerable with lousy poetry the result .
The screwed - up way we approach software development is because of what we have done with programming languages .
With some exceptions , we have opted for optimizing the description of programs for compilers , computers , and casual human readers over providing programming media .
Early on , computers were insanely slow , and so performance was the key characteristic of a system , and performance was easiest to achieve when the language required you to " pin down decisions early on . "
Because of this , much work was poured into defining such languages and producing excellent compilers for them .
Eventually , some of these languages won out over ones more suitable for drafting and exploration both in the commercial world and in academia , and as a result it is politically difficult if not impossible to use these so - called " very dynamic " languages for serious programming and system building .
Interestingly , the results of this optimization are well - described by Hoare 's Dictum , often mistakenly attributed to Donald Knuth , which states :
Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming .
 C. A. R. Hoare
Professor Sir C. A. R. Hoare was referring to the practice of worrying about performance of an algorithm before worrying about correctness , but the dictum can be taken to refer to any design problem where optimization is an eventual concern .
In this case , the design problem was to design a usable programming medium that excels at enabling developers and designers to explore and discover , and to continue to enable discovery and exploration once well into the perfecting stage .
Instead of waiting until we understood the ramifications of large system design and implementation using computer programming media , we decided to prematurely optimize for performance and optimization .
And we got program description ( or programming ) languages instead the root of all evil .
We can tell this analysis is correct by observing the current fad of Agile methodologies including Extreme Programming .
These methodologies all emphasize practices in which code is delivered early in order to enable exploring the design space in the presence of the forces generated by the system itself .
As the process continues , the system grows and matures in the context of both internal ( system - derived ) and external forces .
And we can tell that program description languages have taken the field by observing that very dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Lisp have faded into the background .
Lisp is a medium for working with a computation until it is in balance with its external and internal requirements .
At that point it can be decorated with performance - enhancing declarations and perhaps additionally modularized .
In this it is more like an artist 's medium than what many think of as a programming language .
Lisp , viewed this way , is a good vehicle for understanding how programming and software development really take place .
Because programming Lisp is more like writing than like describing algorithms , it fits with how people work better than the alternatives .
The problem , of course , is that writing is considered a " creative " activity , involving " self - expression , " and creativity is a gift while self - expression is hokey .
Not so :
The conventional wisdom here is that while " craft " can be taught , " art " remains a magical gift bestowed only by the gods .
Not so .
In large measure becoming an artist consists of learning to accept yourself , which makes your work personal , and in following your own voice , which makes your work distinctive .
Clearly these qualities can be nurtured by others ....
Even talent is rarely distinguishable , over the long run , from perseverance and lots of hard work .
 David Bayles & Ted Orland , Art & Fear
Writing and programming are creative acts , yet we 've tried to label programming as engineering ( as if engineering were n't creative ) .
Instead of fearing creativity , we need to embrace it .
Moreover , the key to exploratory programming is to be open to triggers and what we happen upon , because the balance a great system needs is not from purely external considerations .
It is ok to have been wrong in one 's assumptions as long as one is willing to change and revise .
In the end one may need to become more of a guide than an explorer , but one must always be open to being an explorer .
Lisp , of course , and especially Common Lisp are my languages .
Not since the 1960s have I programmed professionally in a language other than Lisp .
Sure , some of that was when I was doing AI research , but most of it was writing system software such as the commercial implementations of Common Lisp my company , Lucid , Inc. , produced in the 1980s and early 1990s .
I worked on programming environments , debuggers , compilers , memory managers , assemblers , and language extensions .
In many cases I was exploring what could be achieved with the goal of productizing the results when the ideas were proved out .
Just as I explored the ideas in this essay before revising and polishing it .
Perhaps it 's the coincidence of the same mind apprehending different things , but I used to describe AI as " trying to program what cannot be programmed , " and I currently define poetry as " trying to say what can not be said . "
In 1995 I decided to return to school and get an Master of Fine Arts in creative writing ( poetry ) at a low - residency program where most of the work is done at home with only one 10 - day residency per semester .
At that time , Lucid had been out of business for only a year , and Lisp - based systems had been winning various software - of - the - year awards .
I had been consulting at a company that was doing a Lisp - based product , but they were exploring other implementation languages for business reasons .
The school I attended was Warren Wilson College , which is located in Swannanoa in the western part of North Carolina in the Blue Ridge Mountains .
It is a small school with a world - class writing program .
One of the quaint things about the school is that it has a working farm students are expected to work .
The writing world is different from the computing world in many ways , and soon I was immersed in learning how to write poetry .
Because I had never had a literature background , I needed to do a lot of catching up , so I spent about 60 hours a week working on schoolwork .
I was lucky to find a position as a consultant to Bill Joy on a couple of small projects , and he essentially subsidized me for 2 years learning to write .
When I graduated in 1998 , I expected to come back to computing to support myself , preferably by doing research .
I had made my 25 - year career in Lisp , starting the Common Lisp effort , helping design CLOS , doing research in programming environments , compilation , and parallel languages .
I thought that though Lisp might not have a great commercial future , university and industry labs would still recognize Lisp as a viable research vehicle .
I was shocked to learn that I was wrong .
As examples , the scientific journal Guy Steele and I founded called Lisp and Symbolic Computation ( LASC ) had been renamed Higher - Order and Symbolic Computation ( HOSC ) , and my primary scientific conference called Lisp and Functional Programming ( L&FP ) had been renamed the International Conference on Functional Programming ( ICFP ) .
I was discouraged for two reasons .
One was that during the 1980s when functional programming researchers had few outlets , many of us Lispers kept the lights on at L&FP for them , and later when Lisp was on the decline , they shut the door .
And the other is that this seemed to signal that my field of inquiry had been deleted by the academy .
Now , 5 years later , things are no better even though we face a crisis in computing wherein we cannot build the sorts of systems we need because we as a discipline have embraced a philosophy of inflexibility as part of a fear of large systems when in fact the opposite philosophy is needed .
As Jaron Lanier points out , we have not taken seriously the idea that a system or module should be liberal in trying to accept commands or arguments , in trying to understand what the caller wanted done .
As Jon Postel remarked :
In general , an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior , and liberal in its receiving behavior .
 Jon Postel , RFC 791
This is a statement about flexibility , about keeping a system in balance .
The perfect bridge is not perfectly rigid , nor is the perfect building .
Rigidity works when nothing moves or changes .
Flexibility is required when the ground is prone to shake or the wind to blow .
Had Web browsers required perfectly formed HTML from the outset , there would not have been the Web .
But they were designed to encounter and deal with almost anything that came along .
Discouraged by having no computing career and lamenting static thinking , I was originally heartened by the rising importance of XML  which amounts to some fundamental Lisp data structures reinterpreted by people with bad taste brainwashed by inflexibility .
When I mentioned to some programmers that it might be a good idea for a program receiving XML to use pattern recognition techniques like the ones we used in the old AI days to try to understand what the XML was trying to say , they scrunched their faces as if I had told them that poetry is as true as any scientific theory .
I 'm glad to see a new book on Lisp .
I 'm glad there are starting to be some highly innovative conferences on new thinking about computing .
And finally I 'm glad to see some projects that are throwing off the shackles of inflexible programming : autonomic computing , organic computing , phenotropic computing , acceptability - oriented computing , and the Feyerabend project .
I believe William Stafford captured best what programming is , especially using Lisp , when he defined art this way :
Art is a reckless encounter with whatever comes along .

† Since I wrote this I found two other more contemporary failures worth noting : the Millennium Bridge in London , which opened June 10 , 2000 and closed on June 12 , 2000 after enduring unexpected swaying and wobbling ; and the new terminal at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris , whose roof collapsed on May 23rd 2004 shortly after opening .
The Millenium Bridge was a surprising failure given the high profile of the project and the reputations of the designers and engineering firms involved .
Software pundits are sometimes fond of using bridge engineering as an exemplar that software engineering should mimic .
The design of the bridge was decided by a competition organised in 1996 by Southwark council .
The winning entry was a innovative “ blade of light ” effort from Arup , Foster and Partners and Sir Anthony Caro .
Due to height restrictions , and to improve the view , the bridge ’s suspension design had the supporting cables below the deck level , giving a very shallow profile .
The bridge has two river piers and is made of three main sections of 81 m , 144 m and 108 m ( North to South ) with a total structure length of 325 m ; the aluminum deck is 4 m wide .
Construction began in late 1998 with the main works beginning on April 28 , 1999 by Monberg Thorsen and McAlpine .
The bridge was completed at a cost of £ 18.2 m ( £ 2.2 m over budget ) and opened on June 10 , 2000 ( 2 months late ) but unexpected lateral vibration ( resonant structural response ) caused the bridge to be closed on June 12 for modifications .
The movements were produced by the sheer numbers of pedestrians ( 90,000 users [ [ Note the use of the term . ] ] in the first day , with up to 2,000 on the bridge at any one time ) .
The initial small vibrations encouraged the users to walk in synchronization with the sway , increasing the effect .
This swaying motion earned it the nickname the Wobbly Bridge .
Resonant vibrational modes have been well understood in bridge designs following the failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge .
However this was the first time a bridge had displayed this type of pedestrian excited lateral motion .
As such the motion was not anticipated by the computational analysis of the bridge prior to construction .
It is often thought that the unusually low profile of the suspension cables contributed to the problem , but an analysis by the structural engineer , Arup , shows that it can occur in any suspension bridge which happens to have the appropriate resonant frequencies .
After extensive analysis , the problem was fixed by the retrofitting of 37 fluid - viscous dampers ( energy dissipating ) to control horizontal movement and 52 tuned mass dampers ( inertial ) to control vertical movement .
This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £ 5 m .
After a period of testing the bridge was successfully re-opened on February 22 , 2002 .

Some architectural failures are the result of a set of small design and construction problems which combine to tragic results :
Terminal 2E , with a daring design and wide open spaces , was CDG 's newest addition .
However , on 23 May 2004 , not long after its inauguration , a portion of Terminal 2 ’s ceiling collapsed early in the day , near Gate E50 , killing four people .
Terminal 2E had been inaugurated in 2003 after some delays in construction and was also designed by Paul Andreu .
Administrative and judicial enquiries were started .
Coincidentally , Andreu had also designed Terminal 3 at Dubai International Airport , which collapsed while under construction on September 28 , 2004 .
In February 2005 , the results from the administrative enquiry were published .
The experts pointed out that the there existed no single fault , but rather a multiplicity of causes to the collapse , in a design that had little margins of safety .
According to them , the concrete vaulted roof was not resilient enough and had been pierced by metallic pillars ; and some openings weakened the structure .
Sources close to the enquiry also disclosed that the whole building chain had worked as close to the limits as possible , so as to reduce costs .
Paul Andreu denounced the building companies for having not correctly prepared the reinforced concrete .
On March 17 , 2005 , ADP decided to tear down and rebuild the whole part of Terminal 2E ( the “ jetty ” ) of which a section had collapsed , at a cost of approximately € 100 million .

This essay is that foreword . ] ]
CHINA'S secret plan to bring down capitalism , especially in America , has become a little less secret in the past week or so .
One clue came with a brave piece of whistle - blowing ; a second when China started deploying its huge arsenal of capital .
Congress was right to worry , after all .
Those cunning commies in Beijing have studied capitalism and found its Achilles ' heel : corporate governance .
First , the whistle - blower .
Lynn Turner was director of research at Glass Lewis , a firm that advises institutional shareholders how to cast their proxy votes .
Last week Mr Turner said he was leaving , five months after Glass Lewis was sold to Xinhua Finance , a Chinese financial - information firm .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Mr Turner , a former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission , was worried about potential conflicts of interest with other Xinhua businesses , and by “ another potentially troubling aspect : Xinhua once had ties to China 's Communist Party ” .
If you wonder why it took Mr Turner five months to figure this out , you are questioning an American hero .
One can only worry what the Chinese will do now to sway America 's institutional shareholders — who , let 's face it , are a flock of sheep led easily astray .
What heroes the bosses of corporate America were to oppose changes in corporate - governance rules that could now empower the Chinese foe : prompt action by Congress could still block competitive elections for company directors , and shareholder votes on executive pay .
Even now , lists of useless directors to be imposed on corporate America are being drawn up in Beijing ( though The Economist hears that the Chinese leadership is split over whether it can do more damage to capitalism by voting to pay corporate bosses less , or by sending their salary packages to ever more preposterous heights ) .
It is clear , too , that this proxy - voting strategy will operate in tandem with a direct assault of the commanding heights of capitalism , known to Beijing insiders as “ investing in private equity ” .
Last week China said it would invest $ 3 billion in Blackstone Partners , one of the world 's leading private - equity firms .
No matter that China is buying under 10 % of Blackstone ( which has a public offering under way ) and has given up the voting rights that would ordinarily come with its shares .
You can see where this is heading .
Private - equity firms are the new kings of capitalism .
They buy up controlling stakes in big companies , and raise profitability by improving corporate governance .
Until now , that is .
What better way for China to set back capitalist industry than by buying into private equity , and thereby exerting its pernicious influence beyond the scrutiny of public stockmarkets ?
This is only the beginning .
A Chinese wall of money will be on its way , once the Blackstone precedent has been set .
Hiding behind the bland language of “ diversifying foreign - exchange reserves ” , China plans to deploy abroad at least 40 % of its $ 1.2 trillion reserves .
As the Financial Times has pointed out : “ to invest that you would have to buy more than 10 % of the capitalisation of the Dow Jones Industrial Average . ”
AFP
Private equity , public face
Congress repulsed an earlier Chinese assault in 2005 , when the China National Offshore Oil Corporation tried to buy Unocal , a Californian oil firm .
Let it man the barricades again to stop the Blackstone deal .
It should not be deterred by suggestions that selling a stake to China is a masterstroke by Blackstone 's boss , Steve Schwarzman ( pictured left ) , to get the politicians in Washington to defend his firm as a jewel of American capitalism at the very moment that they were preparing to denounce private equity and to regulate and tax it more heavily .
Nor should Congress be lulled into inactivity by suggestions that the Blackstone IPO , which is expected to value the firm at over $ 33 billion , is evidence of a bubble in private equity — and that China 's investment will prove about as canny as those disastrous purchases of American real estate and Hollywood movie studios in the early 1990s by that previous great Asian threat , the Japanese .
And do n't let 's be fooled by all the recent talk that China has embraced capitalism — to the point of allowing that American business icon , Starbucks , to set up shop in the Forbidden City .
This is surely a Muhammad Ali - style rope - a - dope move to make the enemy complacent before the decisive blow is struck .
This column knows a plot when it sees one .
This is China we are talking about — and capitalists , especially Americans , should be afraid , very afraid .
The once close ally of the United States , General Pervez Musharraf , has almost been abandoned by US President Bush and now , he wants to bring another man to lead Pakistan .
This desire of US President has further aggravated the situation .
There is continued turmoil in the country and abrupt changes in the leadership could worsen the situation .
President Bush is again making a mistake like he made in Iraq by launching an unnecessary war there .
President Musharraf has been fighting against Taliban and terrorists .
Let him accomplish the job .
According to an editorial comment :
The United States is gradually changing its discourse on the situation in Pakistan and sending fairly clear signals to General Pervez Musharraf containing criticism and “ directives ” .
It is quietly taking cognisance of the growing negative opinion of the Washington press and much more up - front anti-Musharraf moves in Congress .
The new refrain is focused more on the “ people ” of Pakistan than on the achievements of General Musharraf .
It has already taken a stand against the Emergency , which it wants lifted , and it wants the general to take off his uniform and become a civilian president after the Supreme Court decides the “ re-election ” case in his favour .
The US Deputy Secretary of State , John Negroponte , has said he will soon try to “ help put Pakistan ’s political process back on track ” during his visit in Islamabad .
The message from him is going to be tough .
The “ pledge ” given by the country ’s Attorney General that General Musharraf will resign in December may not be enough or too late .
In Lahore , an increasingly outspoken US Consul General Bryan Hunt has added another demand : “ The Emergency should be lifted and restrictions on the media also withdrawn ” .
Mr Negroponte is going to talk tough about the suppression of the opposition in general and the arrest and confinement of the PPP leader Ms Benazir Bhutto .
In anticipation , the general has freed Ms Bhutto while also allowing other important persons in the country like the human rights worker Ms Asma Jehangir to get out of house arrest .
There is clearly a concern in Washington that the proposed Musharraf - Bhutto reconciliation has not taken place and in fact the government is now confronting the PPP in the streets of the country .
After the clamping of the Emergency , Ms Bhutto has been less hopeful of ever arriving at an understanding with him .
In fact , she has declared that her “ communication ” with him is at an end .
Her new mode of communication is the Long March that has been firmly put down in Punjab .
Her ability to mobilise the country ’s largest party has however been demonstrated .
Unless Mr Negroponte can dissuade her , she might take the next step of joining the rest of the political opposition to try and organise a final push to actually force General Musharraf to resign .
The End
Designer Roger Arquer has created a series of conceptual mousetraps that are intended " only to catch mice , not to kill them " .
The four different traps - including Mouse in a Pint ( top image ) and Mouse in a Light Bulb ( above ) - are each made of everyday household items .
Arquer first developed the project in 2004 but these images are brand new and have not been published before .
Above : Mouse in a Planting Pot. Below : Mouse in a Bottle
Arquer previously designed the Fish Bowls that were one of the most popular stories on Dezeen in the last few months .
Here 's some text from Arquer :

Mousetraps
By Roger Arquer
These traps have been developed only to catch mice , not to kill them .
It leaves up to the catcher the future of the mouse .
The materials and the mechanics used are not aggressive , which makes it a friendly mousetrap .
Clear glass , metal springs , paper clips , metal nut .
The concept was developed for a very simple , elegant and efficient way to catch mice .
They are almost not being seen as traps , but as altered objects to be used for another reason .
Once the mice problem is solved , the objects can be used again for its original function .
These are generic clear glass objects that we have at home : a pint glass , a light bulb , a bottle and a planting pot .
Mouse in a Pint ( above ) is a beer glass upside down .
It has a breadstick attached to a spring , tilting the glass so the mouse can get in .
Once the breadstick is being nibbled , it breaks and the glass collapses , keeping the mouse inside .
Mouse in a Light Bulb ( above ) is a cut big light bulb with a heavy weigh in the bottom .
The container is positioned horizontal with the nut , held by a paper clip .
Once the mouse steps in , the nut is released and the light bulb tilts straight up , catching the mouse inside .
Of course , this one ca n’t be reused as light bulb again .
Mouse in a Bottle ( above ) is a medium size soy sauce bottle .
This is positioned horizontally with a tapered spring in the neck .
The mouse squeezes in , expanding the end of the spring , to be able to get inside the bottle .
Once inside , it can not go back out because it can not expand the spring from inside .
It works like a lobster trap or a Chinese finger trap .
Mouse in a Planting Pot ( above ) is a glass planting pot which has a long spring attached on the top going down outside .
Once the mouse climbs up and goes at the end of the spring , the spring bends in and the mouse falls inside the container , when it releases the spring .
It gets caught since the spring has returned to its original position .

Two new games for Wii illustrate the disparity .
Super Mario Galaxy got the benefit of Nintendo's top gameplay designers and is appropriately brilliant .
But Donkey Kong : Barrel
Blast is a confusing mess trying to cash in on its title character 's fame .
Super Mario Galaxy
Mario has always represented Nintendo at its innovative best , and Super Mario Galaxy is no exception .
Indeed , this is probably the best game Nintendo has put on the Wii yet — polished , addictive and jam - packed with surprising moments .
If you 've ever played a Mario game before , you 'll feel right at home with the control scheme as you go running and jumping about , scaling walls and stomping on evil mushrooms .
What Galaxy brings to the table is that all the action now takes place on strings of tiny planetoids in deep space .
A small sampling shows the many , varied worlds packed into Super Mario Galaxy .
Video : Nintendo
This accomplishes two things :
For one , players no longer have to worry about manually adjusting the " camera " to see ( an oft - heard complaint about Mario Sunshine for the GameCube ) .
More importantly , it provides for a wide variety of new gameplay mechanisms involving gravity .
You might have to play some planets upside down or figure out how to escape a planet 's orbit , jumping far enough to reach its neighbor .
Wii motion controls integrate gently into the experience :
You shake the controller to make Mario spin into enemies and stun them .
But light shooter elements added to the game prove even more interesting .
Pointing the Wiimote at the screen brings up a cursor you can use to collect " star bits " to fire at enemies .
You can even have a second player pick up a controller and do this for you while you concentrate on moving Mario around .
But seasoned gamers will likely want to do it all themselves .
That 's Mario Galaxy 's real strength :
It 's easy enough for anyone to enjoy clearing a few levels , but finishing the game requires some effort .
And once you 've saved the Princess , many challenges remain that will tax even experts .
I have n't even told you the best parts .
Like surfing on a floating river , riding a manta ray .
Or scrambling over giant 8 - bit pixel art made of disappearing platforms and lava .
Or the beautifully orchestrated score that accompanies everything .
Galaxy is jam - packed with brilliant ideas at every turn .

Donkey Kong : Barrel Blast
An Egyptian sphinx and a Mesoamerican ziggurat ?
I 'm starting to suspect this may not be an entirely realistic game .
Screenshot : Donkey Kong
Looking forward to the Wii iteration of the Mario Kart series ?
Yeah , join the crowd .
In the meantime , Nintendo gives us Donkey Kong : Barrel Blast , a racing game starring Donkey Kong and his B - list brethren who race using , of all things , strap - on rocket bongos .
The percussive propulsion is a throwback to the title 's origins as a GameCube game to be played with the bongo drum controller .
On Wii , motion controls replace drums , making for very odd gameplay .
You shake the controllers up and down like crazy to get up speed .
You shake one controller or the other to move left or right , and other moves make you jump and use power - ups .
Unfortunately , the controls do n't add much .
The main disappointment is that you do n't so much steer as change lanes .
No matter how wild the twists and turns are , your character follows them perfectly .
You never get the thrill of expertly negotiating a hairpin curve .
Controls aside , the game is a fairly standard kart - style race , with wild tracks set in locations like the jungle or a volcano .
You can grab power - ups that let you slow down enemies or speed yourself up , and if you collect enough bananas , you get a power boost .
Up to four human players can race at once .
If you love weird controls and racing games , you might want to check out Donkey Kong : Barrel Blast just because it 's unlike anything you 've played before .
Otherwise , spare your arms and your wallet .

Europe has a drug problem , and knows it .
But the Europeans ’ approach to it is quite different from the American “ war on drugs . ”
I spend 120 days a year in Europe as a travel writer , so I decided to see for myself how it ’s working .
I talked with locals , researched European drug policies and even visited a smoky marijuana “ coffee shop ” in Amsterdam .
I got a close look at the alternative to a war on drugs .
Europeans are well aware of the U.S. track record against illegal drug use .
Since President Nixon first declared the war on drugs in 1971 , our country has locked up millions of its citizens and spent hundreds of billions of dollars ( many claim that if incarceration costs are figured in , a trillion dollars ) waging this “ war . ”
Despite these efforts , U.S. government figures show the overall rate of illicit drug use has remained about the same .
By contrast , according to the 2007 U.N. World Drug Report , the percentage of Europeans who use illicit drugs is about half that of Americans .
( Europe also has fewer than half as many deaths from overdoses . )
How have they managed that -- in Europe , no less , which shocks some American sensibilities with its underage drinking , marijuana tolerance and heroin - friendly “ needle parks ” ?
Recently , in Zurich , Switzerland , I walked into a public toilet that had only blue lights .
Why ?
So junkies can’t find their veins .
A short walk away , I saw a heroin maintenance clinic that gives junkies counseling , clean needles and a safe alternative to shooting up in the streets .
Need a syringe ?
Cigarette machines have been retooled to sell clean , government - subsidized syringes .

While each European nation has its own drug laws and policies , they seem to share a pragmatic approach .
They treat drug abuse not as a crime but as an illness .
And they measure the effectiveness of their drug policy not in arrests but in harm reduction .
Generally , Europeans employ a three - pronged strategy of police , educators and doctors .
Police zero in on dealers -- not users -- to limit the supply of drugs .
Users often get off with a warning and are directed to get treatment .
Anti-drug education programs warn people ( especially young people ) of the dangers of drugs , but they get beyond the “ zero tolerance ” and “ three strikes ” rhetoric that may sound good to voters but rings hollow with addicts and at - risk teens .
And finally , the medical community steps in to battle health problems associated with drug use ( especially HIV and hepatitis C ) and help addicts get back their lives .
Contrast this approach with the American war on drugs .
As during Prohibition in the 1930s , the U.S. spends its resources on police and prisons to lock up dealers and users alike .
American drug education ( such as the now - discredited DARE program ) seemed like propaganda , and therefore its messengers lost credibility .
Perhaps the biggest difference between European and American drug policy is how each deals with marijuana .
When I visited the Amsterdam coffee shop that openly sells pot , I sat and observed : People were chatting ; a female customer perused a fanciful array of “ loaner ” bongs .
An older couple ( who apparently did n’t enjoy the edgy ambience ) parked their bikes and dropped in for a baggie to go .
An underage customer was shooed away .
A policeman stepped inside , but only to post a warning about the latest danger from chemical drugs on the streets .
In the Netherlands , it ’s cheaper to get high than drunk , and drug - related crimes are rare .
Advertisement
After 10 years of allowed recreational marijuana use , Dutch anti-drug abuse professionals agree that there has been no significant increase in pot smoking among young people and that overall cannabis use has increased only slightly .
Meanwhile , in the U.S. , it ’s easier for a 15 - year - old to buy marijuana than tobacco or alcohol -- because no one gets carded when buying something on the street .
--
While the
The Netherlands ’ policies are the most liberal , but across Europe no one is locked away for discreetly smoking a joint .
The priority is on reducing abuse of such hard drugs as heroin and cocaine .
The only reference to marijuana I found among the pages of the European Union ’s drug policy was a reference to counseling for “ problem cannabis use . ”
Advertisement
Meanwhile , according to FBI statistics , in recent years about 40 % of the roughly 80,000 annual drug arrests were for marijuana -- the majority ( 80 % ) for possession .
In short , Europe is making sure that the cure is n’t more costly than the problem .
While the U.S. spends tax dollars on police , courts and prisons , Europe spends its taxes on doctors , counselors and clinics .
EU policymakers estimate that they save 15 euros in police and health costs for each euro invested in drug education and counseling .
European leaders understand that a society has a choice : tolerate alternative lifestyles or build more prisons .
They ’ve made their choice .
We ’re still building more prisons .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices hit a fresh intraday record high Wednesday , passing $ 80 a barrel for the first time ever , after the government said supplies of crude oil fell far more than expected .
U.S. light crude for October delivery set a trading high of $ 80.18 late in the session before pulling back slightly to settle at $ 79.91 a barrel , still up $ 1.68 a barrel and another record close .
The old trading high was $ 78.77 a barrel hit Aug .
1 .
In its weekly inventory report , the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks plunged by 7.1 million barrels last week .
Analysts were looking for a drop of 2.7 million barrels according to a Dow Jones poll .
A reported slowdown in production from Alaska 's North Slope , as well as a gathering storm in the Gulf of Mexico also pushed prices higher .
Traders have been focused on crude inventories in developing countries over the last several weeks as OPEC production cuts from this past winter and an increase in refining activity have eaten into supplies .
Still , EIA said crude inventories in the United States remain above average for this time of year .
Distillates , used to make heating oil and diesel fuel , rose by 1.8 million barrels while gasoline supplies fell by 700,000 barrels .
Analysts were looking for a 1.4 million barrel increase in distillates supplies and a 500,000 barrel decline in gasoline stockpiles .
Gasoline supplies have dropped for the last six weeks straight , and EIA says they remain well below normal for this time of year .
Refineries operated at 90.5 percent capacity , less than the 92 percent capacity predicted by analysts .
Oil prices , which have jumped 30 percent so far this year , have rebounded from under $ 70 a barrel on Aug. 23 as concerns over a slowing economy faded , and attention turned to tight stockpiles and projected strong demand for crude over the next few years .
" The combination of robust long - term demand growth and lagging non-OPEC supply suggests that strong support for oil prices is set to remain a feature of the markets beyond 2010 , " Deutsche Bank chief energy economist Adam Sieminski wrote in a research note Tuesday after reviewing supply and demand projections from EIA , the International Energy Agency and OPEC .
The tight supply and demand picture is the main reason cited for oil 's price surge since 2002 , when it traded at just $ 20 a barrel .
High demand in the United States , as well as developing nations like China , India and Brazil , has not been met with a similar increase in oil supplies .
That means the difference in what the world could currently produce and what it consumes has narrowed , which magnifies the effect of any supply disruption - such as a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico or even a possible war with Iran - as there is less spare capacity elsewhere to pick up the slack .
It has also attracted lots of money from investors betting on crude prices , which one recent study said is adding at least $ 10 a barrel to the price .
OPEC agreed to raise production by 500,000 barrels Tuesday , but the move did little to convince traders that the world will be adequately supplied with crude .
Despite setting a record high price , oil is still below the approximately $ 90 a barrel it would have been in the early 1980s , when adjusted for inflation .
About a week ago , Slate ’s Dahlia Lithwick noted a tidbit that the rest of us missed : TV preacher Pat Robertson ’s Regent University boasts that 150 of its graduates , including former top DoJ aide Monica Goodling , are serving in some capacity in the Bush administration .
Lithwick noted that this is “ a huge number for a 29 - year - old school . ”
That ’s certainly true ; it ’s also a huge number for a small right - wing college led by a radical televangelist who believes Americans brought 9/11 upon themselves .
Lithwick knew about the 150 Regent grads because , as she put it , the school ’s website “ proclaims [ the number ] proudly ” on its About Us page .
That is , until this past week .
Reader J.S. alerted me to an interesting observation : shortly after Lithwick ’s piece was published and the 150 figure quickly drew national attention ( and a Paul Krugman column ) , Regent edited its About Us page — and removed the reference to the 150 Bush - hired alumni .
According to Google cache , as recently as April 12 , Regent ’s “ facts ” page included seven bullets noting graduates in various political positions , with the seventh noting , in all bold letters , “ 150 graduates serving in the Bush Administration . ”
As of yesterday , the same page is identical , except the seventh bullet has been deleted .
Regent stopped bragging about staffing the administration almost immediately after someone from the media noticed .
I ’m open to suggestion , but it seems to me there are two possibilities : either Regent is suddenly embarrassed to be associated so closely with the Bush administration , or the administration is suddenly embarrassed to be associated so closely with Regent .

SOUTH AFRICA has been shocked by scenes of a blind - drunk young woman being sexually assaulted by a Big Brother housemate .
The incident turned the stomach of millions of viewers when it was broadcast live by a pay - TV conglomerate across Africa .
Viewers flooded newspapers and internet message boards with emails expressing outrage .
Many of the emails contained photo clips from the program , which appeared to show housemate Richard Bezuidenhout , a 24 - year - old film student from Tanzania , assaulting Ofunneka Molokwu , a 29 - year - old medical assistant from Nigeria .
9 Propaganda Techniques in Michael Moore ’s Fahrenheit 9/11
The psychological techniques of persuasion used by Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11 .
Back in the Summer of 2004 outspoken documentary - maker Michael Moore brought out ‘ Fahrenheit 9/11 ‘ , his personal view of how the terrorist attacks in the US were used by George Bush to pursue illegal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The response to the film was huge , but rarely ambiguous – audiences either loved it or loathed it .
Some saw it as a brilliant indictment of the lead - up to an unjust war .
Others saw it as unfounded liberal / left - wing propaganda designed to give the Democrats a boost in the lead - up to the 2004 US presidential elections .
At the time Dr Kelton Rhoads , an expert in the psychology of persuasion , wrote a piece detailing the psychological techniques of persuasion used by Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11 , and it provides a good introduction to propaganda techniques .
Each psychological technique is explained with one example from the film .
For a full explanation of the techniques and a fuller list of examples go directly to the document on his website .
Omissions
Psychology :
One of the most obvious techniques of any propaganda is not presenting the whole truth .
As Dr Rhoads points out , “ What gives omissions their power is that often not recognised as missing by their audience . ”
By leaving out important information people are allowed to jump to conclusions about the evidence that is presented .
The propagandist has , at no point , failed to tell the truth , they ’ve just failed to tell the whole truth .
Example :
One of the largest omission is the failure to show footage of the terrorist hijacked planes hitting the twin towers .
Explanation : Showing this would have provoked the viewer ’s anger and turned their thoughts to retribution .
Instead Moore shows the aftermath , which provokes the emotion of sorrow .
Contextualisation
Psychology : Moore is keen on juxtaposition .
This uses an effect psychologists call ‘ structure activation ’ .
Simply put if you feel sad at any particular moment , that tends to colour how you interpret whatever happens to you next .
In propaganda this can be used by creating a bleed - through effect from one scene to another .
The emotion from one scene is used to colour how you interpret the content of the next scene .
Example : Contextualisation often makes Bush look foolish
Explanation : First scene : we see the unbelievable grief and suffering of witnesses to 9/11 .
Second scene cut into this : we see Bush ‘ happy , smiling and confident ’ .
How could he be smiling at a time like this ?
The answer is , of course , that he ’s not , it ’s just the way the film has been cut together to make him look foolish .
Ingroup / outgroup manipulations
Psychology :
This comes down to preferring ‘ people like us ’ over ‘ people who are n’t like us ’ .
Example : The Saudis are represented throughout the film as being part of the ‘ outgroup ’ along with Bush .
Explanation : Moore shows Bush to be close to the Bin Laden family by repeated association .
Then he shows the Bin Laden family to be close to Osama Bin Laden again by association .
Whether these associations are really this close is a point for discussion but the thing to notice is that the only connection is association .
Because a policeman tends to be near criminals , does that make him a criminal ?
Cynicism
Psychology : People tend to attribute selfish motivations to other people , and altruistic motivations to their own behaviour .
On average we have a tendency to be cynical about the reason other people do what they do .
It is easy to make people suspicious about someone ’s motivations by simply questioning them .
Intelligence operatives have an acronym : ‘ F.U.D. ’ which stands for fear , uncertainty and doubt .
Example : Bush is acting in his own self - interest rather than in the interests of the US .
Explanation : Bush is shown sitting reading “ My Pet Goat ” to school children for seven minutes after the Secret Service operative has whispered the news of the terrorist attack into his ear .
The cynical assumption is that he is possibly : confused , does n’t care , did n’t know what to do , etc . .
In reality any President movements are completely controlled by the Secret Service for security reasons .
Presidents are trained to wait to be told where to go by them .
In this situation Bush would probably have been told to stay put while they got information on the best place to go .
Traps
Psychology : Dr Rhoads refers to this as the E.W.Y.G.Y.S. effect or : Either Way You Go Your Screwed .
Example : Bush is presented both as a bumbling fool and as a master manipulator .
Explanation : Bush is shown primping his hair at the start of the film in the moments before broadcasting to the nation .
Here he , and indeed the rest of the administration , are seen as master manipulators .
The points in the film were he is made to look foolish are almost endless so take your pick .
Modelling the convert communicator
Psychology : People copy each other all the time , it ’s human nature .
If you stand in the middle of the street and stare up at nothing , before long you will have gathered a small crowd of people all straining their neck backwards to see the object of your fascination .
If you imagine this situation in terms of people ’s political point of view , then a similar transformation can be observed .
If people are to watch someone else changing their point of view about something it influences them in the same fashion .
Example :
One convert communicator in this film is Lila Lipscomb , a mother grieving for the loss of her son in Iraq .
She appears to complete a full 180° turn in the course of the film , from supporting Bush to opposing him .
From supporting the war in Iraq , to opposing it .
Explanation : Dr Rhoads uncovers evidence that there was no U - turn and it has been manufactured to aid our persuasion .
She in fact voted for Al Gore in the last election and has been quoted as saying that : “ Bush stole the presidency . ”
Pacing and distraction
Psychology : Dr Rhoads : “ Distraction keeps us from thinking . ”
Example :
It is difficult to process some parts of the film whereas others such as the parts with Lila Liscomb seem only too clear .
Explanation :
Those parts of Moore ’s arguments that may be perceived as ‘ weaker ’ fly by with blaring music playing over the top .
The strong parts of his argument ( Lila Lipscomb ) have no blaring music or fast cuts to cause distraction .
Associations
Psychology :
This is an effect that psychologists often talk about in relation to Pavlov ’s dog .
When Pavlov fed his dog , the dog salivated and he rang a bell .
After a while the dog began salivating when he rang the bell , despite the fact there was no food in sight .
So the dog associated the bell with being fed .
Example : Moore shows members of the Taliban visiting Texas .
The automatic assumption is that he was invited by Bush .
Explanation : Bush is shown in association with the Taliban despite the fact that Bush had n’t in fact invited them to Texas .
They were there to discuss an oil pipeline with the previous permission of the Clinton administration .
Numeric deceptions
Psychology : People like statistics , they sound good .
It ’s been found by psychologists that people are happy to believe them and do n’t bother checking them .
Sounds perfect for the propagandist does n’t it ?
Example : Bush was on vacation for 42 % of the time during his first 229 days in office .
Explanation :
What the original statistics are referring to is the time that Bush spent not in Washington .
And the implications is that , if he ’s not in Washington he ’s not doing any work and is therefore on vacation .
Obviously not true .
I ’m sat at home in the UK , sitting back on the sofa as I write this so how can I be working ?
Perhaps I need to move to Washington for this to count as real work ?
This discussion is facile , but parts of Moore ’s arguments revolve on this pivotal point .
Dr Rhoads finishes his article by saying :
“ … is Fahrenheit documentary , or is it propaganda ?
Call it as you will .
For my part , I see a consistent , effective , and clever use of a range of established propaganda tactics .
If only a few of these tactics were used , or if the attempt to deceive were n’t as apparent , I might equivocate … I feel safe in applying the rule : if it flies , walks , swims , and quacks like a duck , it ’s a duck . ”
[ Disclaimer : personally I make no political judgement on Moore ’s film .
It is covered here purely as an interesting study of persuasion techniques .
All these techniques could just as easily be used to support precisely the opposite case . ]

The sediments are an archive of past climate conditions
The evidence comes from sediments drilled up from the beds of Lake Malawi and Tanganyika in East Africa , and from Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana .
It shows equatorial Africa experienced a prolonged period of drought .
It is possible , scientists say , this was the reason some of the first humans left Africa to populate the globe .
Certainly , those who remained on the continent at that time would have had to be extremely resilient to make it through such hard times .
" This was a profound impact on the landscape , " said Christopher Scholz , from Syracuse University , US .
" So it must have had a major impact , not just on humans but on all species in equatorial Africa at this time . "
Tight group
Dr Scholz presented data from the drilling project here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union .
The cores reveal that prior to 75,000 years ago , Lake Malawi , which is currently an inland sea some 550 km long and 700 m deep , was reduced to a couple of pools no more than 10 km across and 200m deep .
Only a prolonged continent - wide drought could have had this effect .
What makes the timing so fascinating is that it ties in with the " Eve hypothesis " of human evolution .
Genetic studies suggest modern human society is descended from a group of around 10,000 individuals who lived in East Africa at the time of this crisis .
Immediately after its end , human populations started to expand rapidly - and many of our ancestors began moving out of Africa and into the Middle East , Asia and Europe .
Driving force
Scientists are increasingly convinced that tragedies in the deep past have shaped human evolution .
The intriguing thought is that we owe our existence to a small band of survivors who clung on to life during a crisis of epic proportions or who simply decided they had to move to find water .
Viewed from space : Lake Bosumtwi is in an old impact crater
" And , also , there may be a connection with the exodus of early modern humans out of Africa and this climatic release .
" There 's been recognition that speciation of hominids is controlled by environmental factors - whether that 's long - term changes in aridfication in Africa or perhaps the dramatic increase in variability in environmental conditions , such as in precipitation , temperature , and so forth . "
With Americans ’ attention riveted on their own housing market , most may not know that many other countries actually experienced bigger booms .

Now , some of those booms are at risk of bust , making it harder for the rest of the world to insulate itself from a U.S. slowdown , Goldman Sachs argues in [ … ]
Please , do n't go insane now .
Of all the apocalypses on this site , the one you ’re about to read is probably the most mind - boggling of them all .
For what will eternity look like ?
Think of a place where everything has ceased to exist , where golden parkings pop out of nowhere , Napoleon Bonaparte comes back to life and the Twin Towers resurrect themselves .
Still , this incredible place is exactly where we are heading , physicists expect .
Empty your mind .
We ’re about to take a BIG leap into the future .
Not just a lousy few billions of years , but 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 years !
billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion times over .
Squeeze the entire history of our Universe into the thickness of a dollar bill , and one googol years would give you a pile of money that reaches one hundred quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion light years high .
It would n’t even fit in our Universe .
One googol years .
That ’s truly staggering .
Beyond anything a human can comprehend .
First , let ’s fast - forward to the not - so - awfully - far future .
For the coming billions of years , scientists predict quite a ride .
The Sun will explode , the Milky Way will slam into another galaxy .
The Cosmos might collapse , or get torn apart -- scientists can’t seem to decide yet which is more likely .
And even if the Universe does n’t do that , we ’re destined to face a weird and horrible crisis , which involves us spending our lifetime as sleeping robots .
The problem is that the Universe gets bigger and cooler .
Ever since the Big Bang , it expands , much like an expanding ball of fire after an explosion .
Right now , the Universe is still young .
It has these cute stars and twinkling galaxies .
But in the long run , that will change .
Slowly but inevitably , the Universe will empty itself .
Big Nothing : Eventually , the Universe will become a dark , sterile place
First , the galaxies will fly out of sight , beyond the horizon of what we can possibly see .
Next , the stars in our own galaxy will burn out , one after the other .
The only thing that will remain , is a dull graveyard of cold planets , dead suns and black holes .
In about one hundred trillion years , the Milky Way will go black , astronomers expect .
And eventually , even this graveyard decays .
One after the other , the dead stars and planets are eaten by black holes , or kicked out of the Milky Way by collisions .
Astronomers expect that in one hundred to one thousand billion billion years , our galaxy has dissolved completely .
Time goes on .
After a while ( more trillions of years ) something else will kick in .
You ’ll notice that even the very stuff nature is made of , is n’t stable .
A proton , the particle you ’ll find in the core of atoms , has an average lifetime of 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 years .
Wait long enough , and it will suddenly vanish .
Poof , gone .
The same goes for light particles , the so - called ‘ photons ’ .
They ’re expected to last a few zero ’s longer , but in the end , they too will kick the bucket , one after the other .
Is n’t that just bizarre ?
The light will go out , literally .
The last thing that survives , are the black holes .
But in the end , they too will vanish .
They will evaporate in a puff of radiation .
So there we are , at our unimaginable one googol years .
Finally , the Universe is totally and utterly empty .
You wo n’t see any light or spot any planet -- in fact , you wo n’t even find the tiniest speck of dust .
The Universe has sterilized itself .
All there is left , is emptiness , and darkness .
Total oblivion .
And worst of all : there ’s nothing we can do to stop it .
We can build fancy machines or futuristic devices all we like -- but in the end , they ’ll all get kicked out of existence , when the matter they are made of simply vanishes .
So there you have it : infinity .
Booooring , we must add .
But do n’t sob .
There ’s an upside .
As the quadrillions of years pass by , something very odd should happen .
In eternity , even the rarest events get a chance to occur .
Weird , bizarre phenomena that only happen once in a zillion years or so , become quite normal .
For example : the nothingness should yield a few surprises .
Already , physicists know that in a vacuum , there are sometimes tiny little energy ‘ blobs ’ .
Little , random fluctuations of the so - called ‘ quantum vacuum ’ .
Out of nowhere , tiny particles pop in and out of existence .
But theory predicts that on very , VERY rare occasions , the fluctuations should be a bit larger .
Out of nowhere , an entire atom might appear !
Or hey , the vacuum may even spit out a few of them !
Think of it like the static on TV .
Wait long enough , and out of the random fuzz , a recognizable image might materialize .
Wait REALLY long , and one day a complete episode of The Bold And The Beautiful should accidentally show up !
In the vastness of eternity , even things that are almost impossible become real .
Like the sudden appearance of , say , a light green buste of Napoleon Bonaparte .
In the Universe , this should give some really surprising results .
With eternity at hand , the vacuum should begin to yield all kinds of objects .
Incoherent lumps of random garbage , most of the time .
But on very , very rare occasions , you ’ll see other objects popping into existence .
The Eiffel tower .
A purple camel .
A golden parking garage filled with chocolate Cadillacs .
Napoleon Bonaparte sitting next to Mike Tyson on top of a stack of comic books .
As the googols of years pass by , it ’s all there .
In the VERY , VERY , VERY long run , the vacuum will even belch up complete planets , and beautiful stars , burning and all .
Theoretically the vacuum should even churn out a complete solar system one day , identical to ours , with a planet Earth inhabited by people .
" In an infinite amount of time , one day , I will reappear " , as physicist Katherine Freese of Michigan University once put it .
" An crazy thought , but true . "
One day the black nothingness should even produce a new Big Bang .
Admittedly , we ’ll have wait really long for it to happen .
Researchers of the University of Chicago once tried to calculate it .

A school apologised today after telling tearful children to line up for a photograph by the colour of their skin .
Parents condemned the decision by Sandhurst Junior School in Lewisham , south London , to arrange the children from the lightest skinned to the darkest .
One parent claimed the intention had been to make life easier for the photographer - so he did not have to keep rearranging his reflector screens .
Scoll down for more ...
More than 100 boys and girls aged between seven and 11 were grouped in this way for the school photo .
In a separate statement later , the school acknowledged that there had been an " error of judgment " .
Sandhurst headteacher Val Hughes said : " On this occasion , teaching staff took the professional advice of the photographer .
" We can see this was an error of judgment and we regret this greatly .
" Our school has an excellent record of promoting diversity and I will personally be writing to apologise to all parents .
" I will also raise our concerns with the photographer to ensure this never happens again . "
One parent told the Evening Standard her daughter had come home in tears and said : " My school 's so racist . "
Now that Marcus Luttrell ’s book “ Lone Survivor : The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of Seal Team 10 ” is a national bestseller , maybe Americans are ready to start discussing the core issue his story brings to light : the inverted morality , even insanity , of the American military ’s rules of engagement ( ROE ) .
On a stark mountaintop in Afghanistan in 2005 , Leading Petty Officer Luttrell and three Navy SEAL teammates found themselves having just such a discussion .
Dropped behind enemy lines to kill or capture a Taliban kingpin who commanded between 150- 200 fighters , the SEAL team was unexpectedly discovered in the early stages of a mission whose success , of course , depended on secrecy .
Three unarmed Afghan goatherds , one a teenager , had stumbled across the Americans ’ position .
This presented the soldiers with an urgent dilemma :
What should they do ?
If they let the Afghans go , they would probably alert the Taliban to the their whereabouts .
This would mean a battle in which the Americans were outnumbered by at least 35 to 1 .
“ Little Big Horn in turbans , ” as Marcus Luttrell would describe it .
If the Americans did n’t let the goatherds go — if they killed them , there being no way to hold them — the Americans would avoid detection and , most likely , leave the area safely .
On a treeless mountainscape far from home , four of our bravest patriots came to the ghastly conclusion that the only way to save themselves was forbidden by the rules of engagement .
Such an action would set off a media firestorm , and lead to murder charges for all .
It is agonizing to read their tense debate as Mr. Luttrell recounts it , the “ lone survivor ” of the disastrous mission .
Each of the SEALs was aware of “ the strictly correct military decision ” — namely , that it would be suicide to let the goatherds live .
But they were also aware that their own country , for which they were fighting , would ultimately turn on them if they made that decision .
It was as if committing suicide had become the only politically correct option .
For fighting men ordered behind enemy lines , such rules are not only insane .
They ’re immoral .
The SEALs sent the goatherds on their way .
One hour later , a sizeable Taliban force attacked , beginning a horrendous battle that resulted not only in the deaths of Mr. Luttrell ’s three SEAL teammates , but also the deaths of 16 would - be rescuers — eight additional SEALS and eight Army special operations soldiers whose helicopter was shot down by a Taliban rocket - propelled grenade .
“ Look at me right now in my story , ” Mr. Luttrell writes .
“ Helpless , tortured , shot , blown up , my best buddies all dead , and all because we were afraid of the liberals back home , afraid to do what was necessary to save our own lives .
Afraid of American civilian lawyers .
I have only one piece of advice for what it ’s worth :
If you do n’t want to get into a war where things go wrong , where the wrong people sometimes get killed , where innocent people sometimes have to die , then stay the hell out of it in the first place . ”
I could n’t agree more , except for the fact that conservatives , up to and including the president , are at least as responsible for our outrageous rules of engagement as liberals .
The question Americans need to ask themselves now , with “ Lone Survivor ” as Exhibit A , is whether adhering to these precious rules is worth the exorbitant price — in this case , 19 valiant soldiers .
Another question to raise is why our military , knowing the precise location of a Taliban kingpin , sends in Navy SEALs , not Air Force bombers , in the first place ?
The answer is “ collateral damage . ”
I know this — and so do our enemies , who , as Mr. Luttrell writes , laugh at our ROEs as they sleep safe at night .
I find it hard to believe that this is something most Americans applaud .
But it ’s impossible to know , because this debate has n’t begun .
It should .
It strikes at the core not only of our capacity to make war , but also our will to survive .
A nation that does n’t automatically value its sons who fight to protect it more than the “ unarmed civilians ” — spies ?
fighters ? — whom they encounter behind enemy lines is not only unlikely to win a war , it is n’t showing much interest in its own survival .
This is what comes through , loud and ugly , from that mountaintop in Afghanistan , where four young Americans ultimately agreed it was better to be killed than to kill .

Israel 's decision to launch an air strike against a suspected nuclear site in Syria allegedly set up with the help of North Korea came after Israel shared intelligence with the US , it was reported today .
The attack on September 6 has been shrouded in mystery , although the Israeli opposition leader , Binyamin Netanyahu , yesterday confirmed in a TV interview that such an attack did take place .
His admission came despite a news blackout over the incident .
The Washington Post today shed more light on the raid , which has sparked widespread speculation that it was a dry run for a possible attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities .
The paper said the Bush administration was initially circumspect about Israel 's claim that North Korea was helping Syria , and decided against an immediate response because of negotiations aimed at persuading Pyongyang to ditch its nuclear programme .
However , the US is believed to have provided Israel with some corroboration of the original intelligence before Israel went ahead with the raid , the Post said .
The operation reportedly was carried out under such strict secrecy that the pilots flying air cover for the attack aircraft did not know the details of the mission and the airmen who conducted the attack were briefed only after they were off the ground , the paper said .
The Israeli attack came three days after a North Korean ship docked at the Syrian port of Tartus carrying a cargo officially listed as cement .
The ship 's contents remain in dispute , with some Israeli sources suggesting it was nuclear equipment .
Others say the ship was carrying missile parts , while some have said the vessel 's arrival and the attack were merely coincidental .
There is also scepticism about the intelligence that prompted the attack , as Syria has actively pursued chemical weapons in the past but not nuclear arms .
The incident remains the subject of much conjecture because , unlike after its destruction of an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 , Israel has made no official comment about the attack and the Israeli media has been under strict censorship .
For its part , Syria has made only muted protests , and Arab leaders have kept quiet .
Meanwhile , North Korea and Syria today held high - level talks in Pyongyang .
The talks were between Choe Tae Bok , the secretary of the central committee of the North 's ruling Workers ' party , and Saaeed Eleia Dawood , the director of the organisational department of Syria 's Ba'ath Arab Socialist party , the official Korean central news agency reported .
The two sides discussed ways of improving friendship and cooperation , and other issues of bilateral interest , KCNA said .
The meeting is bound to increase speculation about the exact nature of relations between the two countries .
Both have denied reports of nuclear cooperation .
Andrew Semmel , the acting US deputy assistant secretary of state for nuclear nonproliferation policy , said last week that North Koreans were in Syria , and that Syria may have had contacts with " secret suppliers " to obtain nuclear equipment .
As the latest details emerged about the Israeli raid , China said talks between North Korea and regional powers about ending Pyongyang 's atomic weapons programme would resume in Beijing next week .
The announcement came a week after the lead US negotiator , Christopher Hill , said he expected to attend the talks despite the reports that Syria might have received North Korean nuclear help .

A 24 - year - old undergraduate from Nigeria is building helicopters out of old car and bike parts .
Mubarak Muhammed Abdullahi , a physics student , spent eight months building the yellow model seen here , using the money he makes from repairing cellphones and computers .
While some of the parts have been sourced from a crashed 747 , the chopper contains all sorts of surprises .

The 12 - meter - long aircraft , which has never flown above a height of seven feet , is powered by a secondhand 133 horsepower engine from a Honda Civic .
In the basic cockpit there are two Toyota car seats , with a couple more in the cabin behind .
Controls are simple , with an ignition button , an accelerator lever to control vertical thrust and a joystick that provides balance and bearing .
A camera beneath the chopper connected to a small screen on the dash gives the pilot ground vision , and he communicates via a small transmitter .
Mubarak says he learned the basics of helicopter flying through the internet after he decided it would be easier to build a chopper than a car .
Flying his creation is easy , he claims .
" You start it , allow it to run for a minute or two and you then shift the accelerator forward and the propeller on top begins to spin , " he explains .
" The further you shift the accelerator the faster it goes and once you reach 300 rpm you press the joystick and it takes off . "

Undeterred that his home - made transporter , which lives in a hangar on campus , lacks the gear to measure atmospheric pressure , altitude and humidity , Mubarak is working on a new machine which " will be a radical improvement on the first one in terms of sophistication and aesthetics . "
A two - seater with the ability to fly at 15 feet for three hours at a time , Mubarak 's new creation will be powered by a brand - new motor straight from Taiwan , normally found in motorbikes .

At Speicher base in Iraq , US Army Spec. Jeremy
Hall got permission from a chaplain in August to post fliers announcing a meeting for atheists and other nonbelievers .
When the group gathered , Specialist Hall alleges , his Army major supervisor disrupted the meeting and threatened to retaliate against him , including blocking his reenlistment in the Army .
Months earlier , Hall charges , he had been publicly berated by a staff sergeant for not agreeing to join in a Thanksgiving Day prayer .
On Sept. 17 , the soldier and the Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) filed suit against Army Maj .
Freddy Welborn and US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , charging violations of Hall 's constitutional rights , including being forced to submit to a religious test to qualify as a soldier .
The MRFF plans more lawsuits in coming weeks , says Michael " Mikey " Weinstein , who founded the military watchdog group in 2005 .
The aim is " to show there is a pattern and practice of constitutionally impermissible promotions of religious beliefs within the Department of Defense . "
For Mr. Weinstein – a former Air Force judge advocate and assistant counsel in the Reagan White House – more is involved than isolated cases of discrimination .
He charges that several incidents in recent years – and more than 5,000 complaints his group has received from active - duty and retired military personnel – point to a growing willingness inside the military to support a particular brand of Christianity and to permit improper evangelizing in the ranks .
More than 95 percent of those complaints come from other Christians , he says .
Others agree on the need for the watchdog group , but question the conspiratorial view and some of its tactics .
They say dealing with religious issues is a complex matter , and the military is trying to address them appropriately .
At the Defense Department , spokeswoman Cynthia Smith says the DOD does n't comment on litigation , but " places a high value on the rights of members of the Armed Forces to observe the tenets of their respective religions . "
Since the Revolutionary War , the armed services have tried to ensure that soldiers can practice their faiths , and that chaplains serve not only those of their own sect but all who may need pastoral care .
The services have also sought to adhere to the First Amendment prohibition of any government " establishment of religion . "
In the 1990s , for instance , the Air Force 's Little Blue Book of core values highlighted religious tolerance , emphasizing that military professionals " must not take it upon themselves to change or coercively influence the religious views of subordinates . "
Weinstein insists , however , that there are improper actions at high levels that not only infringe on soldiers ' rights but , at a very dangerous time , also send the wrong message to people in the Middle East that those in the US military see themselves engaged in Christian warfare .
For example , he says , Lt. Gen. William Boykin , who gave speeches at churches while in uniform that disparaged Islam and defined the war on terror in fundamentalist , " end times " terms , was not fired but promoted .
( Speaking of a Muslim warlord he had pursued , Lt. Gen .
Boykin said , " I knew my God was a real God and his was an idol . "
And our enemies " will only be defeated if we come against them in the name of Jesus . " )
" There 's an eschatologically obsessed version of Christianity that ... is trying to make American foreign and domestic policy conterminous with their biblical worldview , " Weinstein charges .
And " there 's improper pressure within the military command structure to make members join them . "
The most serious allegations from the field cannot be corroborated for this article .
A few will be raised in the lawsuits , but some incidents have been documented .
Perhaps the most visible situation – and the one that set Weinstein off on his mission – involved the evangelizing of cadets on the part of some faculty and staff at the Air Force Academy ( AFA ) in Colorado Springs , Colo. , which came to light in 2004 .
Congress held hearings , DOD conducted an investigation , and the head of the academy acknowledged significant problems .
Weinstein 's cadet son experienced the pressures as a Jew .
Col. David Antoon ( ret. ) , another alumnus of the AFA and now a 747 commercial pilot , says his heart was broken when he took his son , Ryan , to an orientation at the academy in the spring of 2004 .
An overt evangelistic approach during part of the orientation so upset them , he says , that they decided his son would reject the treasured appointment and instead go to Ohio State University .
" My son had dreamed of doing what I had done , but it was no longer the institution I went to , " Colonel Antoon says , his voice cracking with emotion .
The Air Force set about reaffirming basic principles in religion guidelines , as a basis for widespread training , but a pushback by Evangelicals later led to Congress setting them aside until hearings could be held .
The hearings have not taken place .
In 2006 , MRFF learned of a video produced by Christian Embassy , a group that conducts Bible studies at the Pentagon and seeks to evangelize within the armed services .
Aimed at fundraising for the group , the video was improperly taped in the Pentagon and involved endorsements by Army and Air Force generals in uniform .
MRFF 's public alert spurred a DOD investigation .
In a report critical of the senior officers , the Inspector General said they gave the appearance of speaking for the military .
One general defended his role by saying " Christian Embassy had become a quasi- federal entity . "
The report noted that Maj. Gen. Paul Sutton participated while he served as chief of the US Office of Defense Cooperation in Turkey , a largely Muslim nation whose military takes pride in protecting the country 's secular status .
After a Turkish newspaper wrote about the video as promoting a " fundamentalist sect , " General Sutton was called in and questioned by members of the Turkish General Staff .
" They had to give him a lesson in the separation of church and state , " Weinstein says .
" Imagine the propaganda bonanza !
And how this upset Muslims . "
The DOD report on the video recommended " appropriate corrective action " be taken against the officers .
According to Army spokesman Paul Boyce , " The Army has not yet completed any planned actions associated with the Christian Embassy review . "
MRFF claims a victory in the case of the evangelical group Operation Stand Up.
Earlier this year , OSU was preparing to send " freedom packages " to soldiers in Iraq as part of an Army program .
Along with socks and snacks , the packages included proselytizing materials in English and Arabic , and the apocalyptic video game , " Left Behind : Eternal Forces . "
In it , Christians carry on warfare against people of other faiths .
After the plans were made public , the Pentagon announced in August that the materials would not be mailed .
OSU did not respond to a request for comment .
Weinstein – an intense , voluble attorney who prizes blunt , no -holds - barred language – has struck more than one nerve with his bird - dogging .
He says numerous threats have been made on his life .
Last week , the front window of his house was shot out for the second time .
After the lawsuit was filed , talk of " fragging " ( killing ) Specialist Hall surfaced on some military blogs .
The Army is investigating .
Others sympathetic to Weinstein 's concerns say some tactics undermine his efforts , and they question aims .
" He 's uncovered some very disturbing stuff that should n't be going on in the armed forces , " says Marc Stern , a religious liberty expert at American Jewish Congress .
" But it 's important that you not go too far . "
Mr. Stern disagrees , for instance , with Weinstein 's stance on the Air Force guidelines , such as preventing military supervisors from ever speaking of religion to people under their command .
" He did a disservice to his and our cause by taking a position beyond what the law requires , and in fact may intrude on people 's rights , " Stern adds .
Several conservative Christian ministries publicly proclaim an evangelistic aim " to transform the nations of the world through the militaries of the world , " and they are active at US military installations in many countries .
( See www.militaryministry.org or militarymissionsnetwork.org . )
MRFF sees that as a harbinger of a volunteer military falling under the sway of increasing numbers of Christian soldiers .
Others see a military leadership , with the exception of a few generals here or there , well aware of its constitutional responsibilities , but challenged by the demands of training on these issues in a military of millions .
A group such as MRFF can provide a crucial service , they say , if it is willing to work with the military .
Right now , Weinstein is counting on a set of lawsuits to bring serious issues to the fore .
The question is whether those suits will go beyond individual cases of discrimination to prove an unconstitutional pattern within the armed forces .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Does a good role model talk about using illegal drugs ?
Was Sen. Barack Obama 's answer about drug use too honest ?
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama started the debate when he admitted to a high school audience in New Hampshire that he had experimented with drugs while he was in high school .
" There were times when I got into drinking , experimenting with drugs .
There was a stretch of time where I did not really apply myself , " Obama said .
He added that when he left for college he realized he wasted a lot of time using drugs .
" It 's not something I 'm proud of , " Obama said .
" It was a mistake as a young man . "
What a change from Bill Clinton 's 1992 admission that he had smoked marijuana a time or two and did n't like it .
" And I did n't inhale and did n't try it again . "
" I never understood that line , " Obama said , who said he did inhale marijuana when asked by a student .
" The point was to inhale .
That was the point . "
Watch Obama admit he inhaled »
Clinton 's admission has become a cultural joke .
Obama 's comments ?
If you ask Republican rival Mitt Romney , Obama 's comments were too honest .
" I think in order to leave the best possible example for our kids , we 're probably wisest not to talk about our own indiscretions in great detail , " Romney said .
Romney is n't alone in that belief .
When George W. Bush was governor of Texas in 1999 , he talked briefly about his use of alcohol , but refused to talk about other drugs because he feared kids might think what he did was " cool . "
Bush said at the time , " It is irrelevant what I did 20 or 30 years ago .
What 's relevant is that I have learned from the mistakes that I made . "
So what 's a role model to do ?
Should he be discreet or open about past indiscretions ?
According to Steve Pasierb , president of Partnership for a Drug - Free America , Obama is right on the money .
Pasierb says kids are not naive ; they know people in high places have experimented with drugs .
" The key is to be honest and to put it the context of saying I did this and it was a dumb choice , " Pasierb said .
" Obama talked about how it was n't the right thing to do .
When he got serious about his life , he left it behind .
If he were to lie , I think most kids would know . "
Pasierb says the worst thing to do is feed kids a story they 're not likely to believe .
In other words , never tell them that you tried it , but did n't inhale .
" Most kids are going to see right through that and will ask themselves , ' How could you know if you did n't like it if you did n't inhale ? ' "
Pasierb said .
" Clearly not recognizing something when you did it is probably not the best course . "
Pasierb says role models and parents should not be afraid to admit they did the deed .
" Really the truth works best .
You owe your kids honesty , " he said .
" But you do n't need to tell them every little detail .
You do n't have to give them blow by blow . "
Is talking about past drug use the best thing for a someone running for president ?
That 's a question much harder to answer .
According to a 2007 Pew Research poll , 45 percent of Americans would be less likely to support a candidate for president who had used drugs .
Obama has to hope his honesty with kids translates in a good way to the adults deciding whether to vote for him .

Physicians may be losing their lock on Americans ’ medicine cabinets .
For years , consumers have had two options at the drugstore .
They could either show up with a doctor ’s prescription or settle for less powerful medications sold over the counter .
Now the Food and Drug Administration is considering creating a different option , a class of medicines dubbed behind - the - counter drugs .
It would let consumers purchase routine medicines that could include birth control pills , cholesterol drugs and migraine medicine without a prescription -- as long as they discuss it with a pharmacist first .
Pharmacists and drug companies like the idea ; doctors think it ’s dangerous .
If approved , the drug classification could go into effect as early as next year .

“ We believe having certain drugs behind the counter but available only after a consultation with a pharmacist could significantly increase patient access , ” said Ilisa Bernstein , the FDA ’s director of pharmacy affairs .
But doctors are on alert .
Dr. Anmol Mahal , a Fremont gastroenterologist and president of the California Medical Assn. , said the federal agency ’s proposal was ill - conceived and unsafe for consumers .
“ Patients are not clinicians , ” he said .
“ Allowing people to self - diagnose and self - treat is not in their best interest .
Nothing could be farther from the truth . ”
Jaime Abramowitz disagrees .
The 28 - year - old human resources manager from Burbank said she would be comfortable getting at least routine medications without having to visit her doctor .

Abramowitz currently takes birth control and has to take as much as half a day off to get a checkup and refills every 12 months .
“ It ’s a pain going sometimes , ” she said .
Currently , only a few drugs are available behind the counter without a prescription .
Best known is the morning - after birth control pill that was banned for over - the - counter sale in the U.S. until last year .
Girls under 18 still need a prescription for the drug .
However , a much wider selection of behind - the - counter medications is available in Australia , Canada and several European countries .
Several other countries are considering similar plans .
In the U.S. , pharmacists , manufacturers and some consumer groups have made a concerted push in recent years -- with little success until now -- to create a federal regulatory category for medications that are known to have few safety issues and side effects .

Over - the - counter drugs typically sell for less than prescription medicines but often at much higher volumes and thus are potentially more profitable for manufacturers in certain cases .
Much will depend on which behind - the - counter drugs insurers decide to cover .
Most insurance plans today cover prescription drugs but not over - the - counter drugs .
Insurers say they are researching the FDA ’s proposal .
“ Increasing patient control and access to medication while dramatically lowering cost to the consumer is a laudable goal , ” said Nicole Kasabian Evans , a spokeswoman for the California Assn. of Health Plans .
“ We would like to work with the FDA to learn more about their efforts . ”
The FDA announced plans Wednesday to examine the issue and spelled out details in the Federal Register .
The move signals a possible change of heart in public policy and an indication that the government is trying novel ways of increasing the public ’s access to medications and reducing drug costs .

Just two years ago , an FDA panel turned down a bid by Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson to sell the cholesterol - lowering drug Mevacor without a prescription .
At the time , several panel members said the agency should consider a behind - the - counter approval option .
In January , Pfizer Inc. said it was considering seeking approval for its anti-impotence drug Viagra over the counter .
John Tilley , who owns four Zweber pharmacies in Downey and serves as president of the National Community Pharmacists Assn. , sees the FDA ’s proposal as a “ win- win ” for patients .
Pharmacists are trained to consult about routine medical information , he said , and are often more accessible and spend far more time with customers than do their doctors .
He added that greater access to medications might help patients without health insurance who otherwise might not be getting care .
“ It ’s not like people would be getting these medications from a vending machine , ” he said .
“ This would include an adequate level of care . ”

Critics of looser oversight over the nation ’s drug supply , especially doctors , are less optimistic .
Mahal , of the California Medical Assn. , said a main worry was that patients would buy medication and then lack supervision to ensure that their treatment was safe and effective .
Another worry : that women who skip regular doctor visits to get prescriptions for birth control pills may also forgo gynecological examinations .
Bernstein , of the FDA , said the agency had several unresolved questions about how such a proposal would work in practice -- including how it could affect patient safety and whether it really would improve access to medications as much as some predict .
“ We ’re still in research mode , ” she said .

The agency is planning to address those and other issues at a Nov. 14 public hearing about the plan and will seek written and electronic comments until Nov. 28 .
There is no deadline by which the agency must make a final decision , although the process is likely to be concluded in the next several months .
On Thursday , the agency also said it would institute policies to shorten the backlog of more than 1,300 generic drugs awaiting approval by giving priority to decisions on products that are the first of their kind and giving applicants more feedback .
Generic drugs , which cost as much as 80 % less than their brand - name counterparts , are now likely to get faster review , the agency said .

We met on Craigslist .
You were the one with the sensual , alluring title - " Ram your cock inside me and spurt your hot load ! " .
I knew you were the one for me by the way you typed in ALL CAPS and listed enough conditions to make a contact attorney proud .
Your policies of " FACE PICT * ONLY *! NO COCK SHOTS ! " and " NASTY , OLD PERVERTS NEED NOT APPLY ! " really resonated with me .
And you chose me .
of the 357 responses you received , you chose mine .
I like to think it was my charm , wit , and carefully crafted prose .
That or the Abercrombie and Fitch model I chose for " my " picture .
We both were in relationships , but we needed something more .
We needed each other , if only for that one afternoon .
So I took off work early .
Was n't feeling well ; going home to rest .
You just left a note on the counter - " out shopping " .
Why would n't he believe that ?
I lust you , but I do n't trust you .
I can't let you know where I live .
You do n't care , but he could be home any minute .
And I certainly would n't want to be around for that .
Motels are so cliché .
( OK , really we 're cheap . )
Besides , would n't it be totally hot to do it outside , totally exposed to the whole world ?
I 'd never done such a thing before .
Neither had you .
So we met at the park at 4 .
The sun was just starting to go down .
The light though the trees was sublime .
You in your easy - access summer dress .
The shine of your hair .
The look in your eye .
I wanted you .
I needed you .
I simply had to have you .
But where ?
Had to be close .
No time to wander around when sex is imminent .
Somewhere out of the way .
Others can't see .
Up that hill .
In the trees .
Underbrush all around .
I pull it aside for you as we make our slow progress trystward .
You do the same for me .
Then an opening .
Nestled into a copse .
Surrounded by scrub brush .
Perfect .
The blanket goes down and 3 seconds later your tongue is in my mouth .
So warm .
So soft .
So wet .
I can no longer think .
All the blood is in my cock .
I reach my hand down your pants .
It 's like my toiletry kit fresh out of Miami baggage claim - a hot , wet , sticky mess .
You moan and I 'm inspired to keep going .
First one , then two fingers .
Thumb on your clit .
It 's not long be you 're there .
I keep kissing you the whole time , but really I 'm staring at your face .
At the look of pure pleasure .
Then you go silent .
Your body tenses and arches and I can feel the intense contractions inside you .
You reach for me and I 'm ready , clothes off in 6 seconds .
After witnessing your performance , I 'm already close .
Really close .
You stroke me .
You lick me , and less than a minute later I black out for the longest 5 seconds of my life .
Back into focus , and my gaze lands upon your face .
We exchange an awkward look , like we 're back in high school and are n't sure what to make of all this .
You pull your hand back looking with concern at the mess on it .
I pull out a Kleenex and push it at you while I use another to deftly wipe off my stomach .
Nothing left to say , so I get up and start putting on my clothes .
You pick up the blanket .
I make one last effort on the way back to the cars ; I gently brush the cruft out of the back of your hair .
You turn half - way toward me and give me a tight - lipped smirk .
That was yesterday .
Today I am itchy .
And swollen .
I have splotchy rashes on my body
But my cock is the worst .
It 's bright red , raw , and about 50 % bigger than normal .
Now I know the secret of those spammers who claim to increase your girth - poison oak .
I 'm sorry , Casual Encounter girl .
Sorry if I got poison oak on you like you did to me .
Or worse , in you .
I 'd like to say it was worth it , but I can't .
Not now .
Maybe in a few days this will be more funny than painful .
I hope so .
But I do know that next time , we 're splitting the cost of the motel .

A few days ago , I was searching some pictures on Flickr and by mistake I found the rayguns of Lockwasher .
They are pretty interesting , even they are not real .
They remind of the old SF movies I was watching when I was little .

I started putting these intergalactic self - defense mechanisms ( ray guns ) together after being totally inspired by Clayton Bailey , artist / gunsmith .
I also draw inspiration from old 50’s and 60’s space movies , TV , toys … anything retro cool !
I hope you enjoy looking at these as much as I did creating them . ”
But it seems he ’s not the only one who has the strange passion of making toy rayguns .

Why rayguns are fictional , as far as is generally known
* In many science fiction scenarios , the laws of physics and nature of matter and energy are different from in the real world ( i.e. : the fictional Minovsky Physics , which operate in the Gundam universe . )
* With current technology , the amount of power that they would need is beyond the capacity of any handheld device [ citation needed ] .
Actual energy weapons are large and cumbersome and portable versions are barely powerful enough to be considered weapons .
* Many of them need non-existent materials .
* For laser guns , see Directed - energy weapon # Problems with lasers .
* Many fictional ray guns fire a beam which ( unlike lasers ) is visible in vacuum and sometimes also travels much slower than light .
* For plasma rifles and similar , see the possibility of plasma rifles existing in the real world ( from Wikipedia )

( CareerBuilder.com ) -- Fashion designer Coco Chanel had a personal rule :
Before she left the house , the style icon always removed one piece of her ensemble to avoid the faux - pas of wearing too many accessories .
Were Chanel alive today and working as a hiring manager , she would likely offer similar advice to job seekers :
You do n't have to include everything .
Job seekers do themselves a disservice when they send out résumés with more information than they need .
Most employers do n't have the time or patience to sift through the irrelevant details .
Here are 10 things your résumé could do without :
1. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors .
" If you are careless enough to send out this most important document with a mistake ...
I immediately assume you 'll never care enough about the work you send out representing my company , " says Jose Bandujo , president of New York - based Bandujo Advertising .
He recalls one candidate who misspelled Manhattan , despite having worked in the city for a decade and another whose great educational background did n't compensate for the fact that he could n't spell " education . "
2. Opening objectives .
" These are generic ...
They do nothing to differentiate one candidate from another , " says Donna Flagg , president of The Krysalis Group , a human resource and management consulting firm in New York .
3. Personal attributes .
Listing personal information such as height , weight and age and providing photographs is a pet peeve for Heather Mayfield , vice president of training and operations for Snelling Staffing Services .
" It is amazing that we still see this on the résumés of today , but they are out there . "
4. Interests and hobbies .
If these points of information do n't pertain to the job in question , there 's no need to include them .
" Create a mystery and save these kinds of data points when you start the job , " advises Roy Blitzer , author of " Hire Me , Inc. : Résumés and Cover Letters that Get Results . "
5 . Details of every task you 've ever performed in every job you 've ever had .
" It 's too much information .
Managers and recruiters need to know at - a - glance what makes a candidate special , " Flagg says .
Focus on those details that pertain to the job for which you 're applying .
6. Excessive bragging .
Stating one 's accomplishments can be helpful , but when it 's overdone , the candidate can come across as narcissistic , a huge turnoff for employers , Flagg says .
7. Outdated information .
Leave off the activities that you did in high school if graduation was a few years ago and omit jobs you held 10 or more years ago , as the information is probably irrelevant to the position you 're trying for now .
8. False information .
" Putting [ that you have ] a B.S. on a résumé when you do not have one is ' BS , ' " jokes Stephen Viscusi , author of " On the Job : How to Make it in the Real World of Work . "
Not only is lying on a résumé unfair and dishonest , it 's also not very intelligent .
" Companies verify dates of employment -- often after you start .
If you have lied , they fire you ... Nobody wants to hire a liar .
Nobody . "
9 . Unexplained gaps in work history .
While job seekers should account for these gaps , they should be careful with their wording .
" One of the weirdest things that I ever saw on a résumé ... was a candidate who explained a 10 - year lapse in work experience as being in jail during those years for killing her husband , " recalls Linda Goodspeed , marketing recruiting manager at VistaPrint .
In such a situation , she says , the best thing to write would be " left work for personal reasons , " and the candidate would be able to explain the criminal record later .
10 . A lack of professionalism .
Colored paper , cutesy fonts , links to personal websites and childish e-mail addresses all scream unprofessional and are a turn off to hiring managers .
One otherwise qualified applicant did n't get an interview at Bandujo 's firm solely because of the name in her email address : " weird2themax . "
" I recognize the advertising industry is full of talented , interesting ' characters ' , " Bandujo says , " but did I really want one who thought she was weird to the max ? "
No , he decided , he did not .

CNN weatherman considers Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth fiction
CNN reported on Thursday that a British judge has called Al Gore 's Oscar - winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth unfit for schools " because it is politically biased and contains scientific inaccuracies and sentimental mush . "
British schools may now have to preface any showing of the film with a warning .
CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano responded to this story by applauding and saying , " Finally , finally , " before commenting sarcastically that " the Oscars , they give out awards for fictional films as well . "
Marciano said he objected in particular to the film 's claim that global warming causes stronger hurricanes , noting that the current hurricane season has only been average .
Although the number of named storms this season has not been unusual , USA Today pointed out last month that " the first two hurricanes in the Atlantic this season reached the highest Category 5 level , the first time that 's happened since record - keeping began in 1851 . "
In addition , three storms this year shattered records for speed of intensification , leading concerned weather bloggers to suggest that the possible effects of global warming on hurricanes demand far more intensive study .
The following video clips are from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on October 4 , 2007 .
Once the first Government Hospital for the Insane , the western campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital today is an overgrown hillside of dilapidated brick buildings overlooking the Potomac and Anacostia rivers in Washington , D.C.
It 's both spooky and grand , but the scene would change if the Department of Homeland Security gets its way .
With thousands of employees spread over 50 locations in the area , the young federal agency is seeking approval to consolidate its operations in a $ 3 billion complex on the St. Elizabeths site , the largest chunk of federal property left in Washington .
Agency officials say it is the only site large enough to accommodate its workforce — a staff that needs a " common culture . "
The plan , however , is meeting with resistance from historic preservationists who think a high - security compound is a bad fit for such a notable property and from community activists who fear it is the wrong neighbor for a community badly in need of economic revitalization .
St. Elizabeths was established by leading mental - health reformer Dorothea Dix in 1855 to provide the " most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane . "
It was also used during the Civil War to house wounded soldiers .
But in 1975 , underfinanced and understaffed , it lost its accreditation in part because of overcrowding and unsafe housing .
Now controlled by the D.C. government , the newer eastern campus is famous for housing John Hinckley since he tried to assassinate President Reagan in 1981 .
Other notable guests have included President Garfield 's assassin , Charles Guiteau , and the poet Ezra Pound .
The abandoned west campus , with its Gothic revival buildings , is considered one of the nation 's most endangered places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation .
The General Services Administration calls for renovating many of the old buildings , including the 152 - year - old Center Building designed by the architect of the U.S. Capitol dome .
But preservationists worry that the plan , which calls for removing up to 25 buildings , would crowd out the historic structures with new construction and parking lots .
" They need to radically rethink the density , " says Robert Nieweg of the National Trust .
Mr Malik said he had also been stopped and searched last year
The international development minister was stopped and searched at Washington DC's Dulles airport after a series of meetings on tackling terrorism .
Mr Malik , MP for Dewsbury , West Yorks , had his hand luggage checked for explosives when returning to Heathrow .
He said the same thing happened to him at JFK airport in New York last year .
On that occasion he had been a keynote speaker at an event organised by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , alongside the FBI and Muslim organisations , to talk about tackling extremism and defeating terrorism .
' Respect needed '
Mr Malik said he had received numerous apologies and assurances from the US authorities after that incident .
But he was again searched and detained by DHS officials on Sunday .
Mr Malik said two other Muslims were also detained .
" I am deeply disappointed , " he said .
" The abusive attitude I endured last November I forgot about and I forgave , but I really do believe that British ministers and parliamentarians should be afforded the same respect and dignity at USA airports that we would bestow upon our colleagues in the Senate and Congress .
" Obviously , there was no malice involved but it has to be said that the USA system does not inspire confidence . "
The sailors were said to be cold but unharmed
About 20 people were reported missing shortly afterwards , though Ireland 's coastguard later said everyone had been rescued safely .
The children were taking part in a junior sailing regatta off the County Dublin coast , when a sudden squall capsized 91 boats in the Irish Sea .
Lifeboats , helicopters and the navy were all deployed in the rescue effort .
" Suddenly the wind blew up and visibility dropped and we had to get the kids out , " said Paula O'Connor , an administrator with the Royal St George Yacht Club in Dun Laoghaire , where the event took place .
" They are all accounted for , " a coastguard official said .
" Emergency services are on the scene and were treating the children who were taken from the water and were extremely cold . "
Dozens of boats were upturned by the freak gusts
Nobody suffered serious injuries , officials said .
The sudden gust of wind took young sailors by surprise as they took part in the Irish National Yacht Club event .
The competitors were all children under 16 , a coastguard spokesman said .
They were understood to have been sailing dinghies for various yacht clubs when they were hit by the squall at about 1400 local time ( 1300 GMT ) .
They were all wearing buoyancy aids and were rescued within a mile of the coastline .
The over 20,000 file - sharing lawsuits that have been filed over the past few years share a single distinction : not one of them has made it to trial .
The RIAA is trying to keep Virgin Records , et al v. Jammie Thomas from a jury trial , filing a motion for summary adjudication on some specific aspects of the case .
What the RIAA is after is a ruling from the judge that some of the facts of the case are not in dispute .
If that is the case , then there are no issues of material fact that exist to be decided , and therefore no need for a trial by jury .
It 's the same scenario in Novell v. SCO : all the material facts were decided by the judge last month , so there 's nothing left for a jury to decide .
The RIAA is looking for the judge to rule favorably on three issues .
First , it wants the judge to rule that the record labels own the copyrights to the songs allegedly shared by the defendant .
Second , it wants the judge to agree that the copyright registrations are in order .
Those two items may not appear to be that big of deal , but number three is a doozy .
The labels want the judge to rule that the defendant was not authorized to copy or distribute the songs flagged by SafeNet , the RIAA 's investigator in this case .
If the judge decides those three issues in the labels ' favor , the plaintiffs believe that it " will significantly narrow " the outstanding issues and prevent the " unnecessary expense of litigating issues about which there is no dispute . "
Thomas is fighting the motion , saying that the plaintiffs need to prove two things : that they are the true copyright owners and that there was an act of infringement .
Thomas is confident that should the case go to trial , the verdict will go her way .
Who owns the copyright ?
Thomas ' attorneys also raise a number of issues about the copyright claims .
As part of the original complaint , the record labels attached screenshots of the files the defendant was allegedly sharing and stipulated that they owned the copyright to those songs .
But the documentation provided by the labels to support their claims of copyright ownership do n't quite add up .
Here are a few examples cited by the defendant :
Song Copyright holder according to the RIAA Copyright holder according to the certificate of registration " Appetite for Destruction " UMG Recordings The David Geffen Company " The Comfort Zone " UMG Recordings Polygram Records " Control " UMG Recordings A&M Records , Inc. " Frontiers " Sony BMG CBS , Inc. " Let it Loose " Sony BMG CBS , Inc . " Get a Grip " UMG Recordings Geffen Records " Hysteria " UMG Recordings Mercury Records " If You See Him " UMG Recordings MCA Records Nashville
Thomas argues that since she lacks the financial means to conduct a thorough examination of the ownership history ( e.g. , track the ownership of " Hysteria " from Mercury to UMG ) for the songs she is accused of infringing the copyright to , her only opportunity to determine their true ownership is either via discovery or cross-examination at trial .
With the documentation provided by the labels " questionable " and " nonconclusive , " according to the defendant , her only option is to cross -examine the witnesses .
Her attorneys also note that the labels have not taken advantage of some of the deadlines in this case , including one for filing a partial summary judgment .
The conclusion ?
" The issue involved is far too material to preclude cross examination by defendant , therefore plaintiffs ’ motion should in all respects be denied . "
Perhaps the biggest reason that the RIAA does n't want this — or any other — case to go to trial is the possibility of losing .
The RIAA has fought the exoneration efforts of every defendant tooth and nail , trying to simply walk away from the litigation by dismissing it without prejudice .
A handful of defendants have managed to be exonerated , most notably Debbie Foster , Patricia Santangelo , and Tanya Andersen — who is now suing the RIAA for malicious prosecution .
A loss at trial would be even more catastrophic for the RIAA .
It would give other defense attorneys a winning template while exposing the weaknesses of the RIAA 's arguments .
It would also prove costly from a financial standpoint , as the RIAA would have to foot the legal expenses for both itself and the defendant .
Most of all , it would set an unwelcomed precedent : over 20,000 lawsuits filed and the RIAA loses the first one to go to a jury .
A subtle change in strategy
There is one more subtle shift in strategy on the part of the music industry .
The RIAA appears to have dropped the " making available " argument in its most recent filings .
It is absent from the RIAA 's motion for default judgment in Interscope v. Rodriguez and , in Virgin v. Thomas , the labels are accusing the defendant of " distributing " music over KaZaA .
If they can make the distribution charges stick , it will be problematic for the defendants .
But given that the only cases of " distribution " ever witnessed occurred when only the RIAA 's investigators were watching , it is by no means a slam dunk .
If the judge denies the RIAA 's motion , there is a September 24 settlement conference scheduled .
Should that fail to bear fruit — and there is no reason to think that it will — Virgin Records , et al v. Jammie Thomas is scheduled to go to trial on October 1 .
In a move that has stunned New York , the Bloomberg administration is in discussions to escort the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to ground zero during his visit to New York next week , Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said today .
Click Image to Enlarge Behrouz Mehri / AFP / Getty President Ahmadinejad addresses the parliament on Iran 's fourth development plans in Tehran , September 17 , 2007 .
The Iranian mission to the U.N. made the request to the New York City Police Department and the Secret Service , which will jointly oversee security during the leader 's two - day visit .
Mr. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to arrive September 24 to speak to the U.N. General Assembly as the Security Council decides whether to increase sanctions against his country for its uranium enrichment program .
Mr. Kelly said the NYPD and Secret Service were in discussions with the Iranian Mission about the logistics for the possible visit , and whether it will take place at all .
He said that for safety reasons related to ongoing construction at ground zero Mr. Ahmadinejad would not be allowed to descend into the pit .
" There has been some interest expressed in his visiting the area , " Mr. Kelly said .
" It 's something that we are prepared to handle if in fact it does happen . "
Mr. Kelly said Mr. Ahmadinejad had not indicated why he wants to visit the site of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Several presidential candidates quickly condemned the proposed visit .
" It is an insult to the memories of those who died on 9/11 at the hands of terrorists , and those who have fought terrorism for years , to allow the president of the world 's top state sponsor of terrorism to step foot at ground zero , " a spokeswoman for Senator Thompson , Karen Hanretty , said .
" Iran is responsible for supplying weapons and supporting extremist who are killing U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan to this very day . "
A Republican candidate , Mitt Romney , called the plan " shockingly audacious . "
" It 's inconceivable that any consideration would be given to the idea of entertaining the leader of a state sponsor of terror at ground zero , " Mr. Romney said in a statement .
" This would deeply offend the sensibilities of Americans from all corners of our nation .
Instead of entertaining Ahmadinejad , we should be indicting him . "
A major American Jewish leader , Malcolm Hoenlein , said a visit by Mr. Ahmadinejad " would violate the sanctity of the sacred place and the memory of those who perished there . "
Mr. Hoenlein , the vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations , is a leading figure in organizing a protest against the Iranian leader Monday in front of the U.N .
He told The New York Sun that the Iranian president should be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the U.N. and should not be permitted to travel the full extent of the 25 - mile radius that is normally allowed for foreign dignitaries attending meetings at the world body .
Iran has been called the world 's " most active state sponsor of terrorism " by the U.S. State Department .
The History of Atari : 1971 - 1977
By Steve Fulton
Mt. Fuji towers 3776 meters as Japan ’s highest mountain .
It ’s a striking landmark , one that rises almost impossibly out of an unassuming plain to a pinnacle of ice - capped beauty .
After its mammoth breadth is realized , it settles back down again into a valley as if it was never there .
It was formed by a volcanic eruption about 10,000 years ago , and has since been worshipped as a sacred landmark by the Japanese .
In the shadow of that mountain , the people of Japan have played a strategy game named Go for thousands of years .
Mount Fuji , taken by Asela Jayarathne
First created in China about 2000 B.C. , Go is a compelling and subtle strategy game .
It vies with Parcheesi as the world ’s oldest game that still exists in its original form .
Go is unique , in that there are literally trillions -- if not an infinite number -- of board combinations .
So many , in fact , that it is theorized that no two Go games played have ever been , or will ever be the same .
Yet the game looks so simple -- just a series of black and white stones placed on a 19x19 grid .
Some players have described the binary pattern of stones as a thing of beauty , with the game attaining a level of complexity at times so vast , the players put more emphasis the complex stone patterns to help them decide their next move , then on any sort of strategy .
It ’s no small wonder that the simple beauty of a game like Go appealed to the college campus computer hackers of the 1960s .
While chess was still very popular , its regimented opening moves and seemingly finite strategies were more in - tune with the “ powers that be ” than with new movements based on social change .
Computer hackers were opening new doors to information that were only dreamed about a decade prior .
Go ’s binary nature -- like that of a computer -- appealed greatly to these pioneering computer enthusiasts .
It was a game of infinity , that could be explored and experimented upon , just like the computing machines the hackers coveted so much .
However , the infuriating part of Go is that it ’s almost impossible to master .
For a group of people who wanted to explore every nook , cranny , and corner of a computer , the inability to “ master ” , this must have been both cathartic and frustrating .
Atari founder Nolan Bushnell was a Go player who learned the hacker ethic at the University of Utah .
When Bushnell finally decided on the name for his pioneering video game company , he called it “ Atari ” .
In Go terms this is like saying “ watch the hell out , I ’m just about to win the game ” .
A couple years later , Atari would adopt a curious looking logo -- a three - part , vertically split triangle , that looked a bit like an “ A ” , but more like a mountain .
This symbol would commonly be known as the “ Fuji ” , and it was under its shadow that an entire new industry was created .
It was also under this shadow that the simple lessons of Go would affect the design of video games in their first decade .
The “ simple to learn , difficult to master ” game design philosophy is the one that helped propel Atari ’s games from mild parlor amusements into the psyche of an entire generation .
The Engineer Entertainer
Born in 1943 in Clearfield , Utah , the founder of the modern video games industry , Nolan Bushnell , always loved playing games .
“ I can remember playing Monopoly and Clue with my neighborhood friends , chess incessantly .
I played tournament chess .
I played # 2 board at Utah State University .
I ’ve always been a game player , period ” i - Nolan Bushnell
He also loved science .
His world was upended in 3rd grade he was given a science assignment by his teacher Mrs. Cook .
“ The spark was ignited when I was assigned to do the unit on electricity and got to play with the science box .
I remember constantly making stuff as a kid that amazed my friends using electricity . ” ii - Nolan Bushnell
With a love of play , and a love of science , an engineer entertainer was born .
Bushnell ’s love of electricity led him to Utah State University where he studied for a BS degree in Electrical Engineering .
While in the engineering department , Bushnell was exposed to a DEC PDP - 1 computer , and Steve Russell ’s game Spacewar !
He fell in love with the quirky little one - on - one space battle game , and was fascinated by the impact it had on the other students , especially in how much free time the other students spent playing it .
At the same time , Bushnell was working his way through college by working at Lagoon Amusement Park in Farmington Utah .
There , he worked the midway games like a master carnival barker .
“ I think that working at the amusement park gave me a sense that I had a special knack for that .
I was able to have a lot of people have fun and spend their money while doing it .
Those were two good characteristics ” iii - Nolan Bushnell
Near the midway was a small arcade that featured mostly pinball machines .
Bushnell envisioned the day that the pinball games would be replaced by machines playing games like Spacewar !
He noted how much free time his classmates were spending on the game .
He realized that if he could figure out a way to monetize that time , he could be very successful .
However , after much pondering , it seemed impossible .
A DEC PDP - 1 computer cost $ 120,000 , and there was no way someone could break even on a game that cost that much create .
" When you divide 25 cents into an $ 8 million computer , there ain't no way , " iv - Nolan Bushnell
He put the notion aside so he could start a career as an engineer .
After graduation from Utah State as a “ Distinguished Fellow ” in 1968 , Bushnell moved to California where he continued his graduate education at Stanford University .
He wanted to work for Walt Disney , because he felt they were doing very interesting things with technology .
Even though Bushnell thought of his endeavors as technical feats , he still felt the need to entertain people .
“ I always considered myself an engineer .
A guy who used technology to solve problems .
I was fascinated with Disney who used technology to entertain people .
I felt technology was truly magical . ” v - Nolan Bushnell
However , since , Disney did not hire engineers straight out of school , so he had to look elsewhere .
" When I graduated from college , my vision of the perfect job was to work in the research section of Disneyland .
But they were n't hiring new engineering grads .
" vi - Nolan Bushnell
Bushnell found a job at Ampex Corp , in the Silicon Valley and started working as computer graphics department research designer .
He worked at Ampex for a couple years , where he met fellow engineers ( and future Atari employees ) Al Alcorn and Steve Bristow .
However , Bushnell was never able to settle down as a line engineer .
The need to entertain people kept biting at him .
Soon after , he was introduced to a free - standing version of Spacewar !
named Galaxy Game , designed by Bill Pitt , another Stanford graduate .
Galaxy Game was a full version of the DEC PDP version of Spacewar ! , right down the mini-computer that was necessary to run it .
While the technical feat of a free - standing Spacewar !
game was impressive , the $ 40,000 cost associated with basing a game on mini-computer was not .
Bushnell knew he could do better .
His day dreams of electronic games replacing pinball machines from working at Lagoon were rekindled .
He felt he could engineer a machine that could entertain people , and still make money at the same time .
Simplifying A Revolution
In the Spring of 1971 , while still working for Ampex , Bushnell along with fellow engineer Ted Dabney , started crafting their own version of Spacewar ! named Computer Space .
They worked out of Bushnell ’s daughter Britt ’s bedroom , turning it into a computer lab in which they could engineer their masterpiece .
All sort of ideas crossed their minds , including using a minicomputer like Galaxy Game , and using a series of terminals for a multiplayer experience , but these ideas were far too expensive for this bedroom outfit .
Instead , it hit them one day to go in the opposite direction and simplify their design to cut costs as much as possible .
The pair decided that they did not need thousands of dollars in hardware to make their dream come to life , instead choosing a much simpler solution .
They crafted a working game using TTL ( Transistor To Transistor Logic ) vii to create a computer whose sole purpose was to play Computer Space .
While this might have seemed like a step - back technology wise , it was a huge leap forward for creating a commercial game .
With a black and white G.E. TV and $ 100 worth of electronic parts , they created the first viable , commercial video game .
“ I worked it out and the economics were overwhelming .
" viii - Nolan Bushnell
This seemingly simple decision towards simplification fueled the entire video game industry for most of the 1970’s .
“ 100 % of the video games up until 1977 used my discreet logic technology ... that I had a patent on . ” ix - Nolan Bushnell
However , before a video game revolution could be started , it would need a game that people wanted to play .
Unfortunately , Computer Space was not that game .
Bushnell and Dabney sold their idea to Nutting Associates in late 1971 .
It landed in the coin - op industry with a resounding “ thud ” .
Amusement operators who were used to buying jukeboxes and pinball machines had no idea what to do with it .
The controls were too complicated , and the game too confusing for the average barroom ( read : drunk ) player .
" Nobody wants to read an encyclopedia to play a game " x - Bushnell on Computer Space
In the spring on 1972 , while still working with Nutting to sell Computer Space , Bushnell visited Magnavox to take a look at the TV video game system that Ralph Baer had developed for the company .
Bushnell left unimpressed .
The analog computer used in the game ( a computer used for applications that require a continuous change of one or more variables ) was only useful for very simple games , and the graphics looked fuzzy .
However , a simple tennis contest on display stuck with him , and the idea for a ping pong - type game was born .
1972 : Atari Is Born
On June 27th , 1972 , Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney officially created their own company named Syzygy Co. , each contributing a $ 250 share -- mostly from the meager profits earned from Computer Space .
xi Bushnell said they decided on Syzygy because “ I thought it was a cool name when I found it in the dictionary ” .
xii
However , they soon discovered that the name Syzygy was already taken by a roofing company .xiii
Although they continued to use it for couple years afterwards to describe their engineering process , they had to choose another name .
xiv
Bushnell suggested “ Atari ” , a hold - over from his days as Go player at Utah State .
Atari roughly translated to “ you are about to be engulfed " xv , which they thought sounded pretty cool at the time and also served another purpose .
“ I thought Atari was a good warning to the competition in the gaming industry ” xvi - Nolan Bushnell
They started their new business on two fronts .
While Bushnell went ahead to start designing a new video game , Ted Dabney used some existing equipment to start a coin operated game service business .
“ When we did Computer Space there were about 7 prototype units that were really not to standard that could be sold to 3rd parties .
We saw them as an opportunity and we put them on location and collected the quarters every week .
When we did that some of the places wanted pinball so we started buying equipment and collecting the quarters .
That was one of the early ways we financed the business . ” xvii - Nolan Bushnell
In the spring and summer of 1972 , Atari began the engineering process for their first game .
To augment their team , Atari hired one of Bushnell ’s fellow Ampex employees , Al Alcorn , as a senior engineer .
To lure Alcorn to Atari , Bushnell told him a little white lie : that he had a contract with G.E. to create a home version of Pong .
“ Nolan told me that we had a contract from General Electric to design a home video game on a ping - pong theme .
“ xviii - Al Alcorn
Atari did have a tentative contract ( with Bally , to create a driving game ) but Bushnell wanted Alcorn to cut his teeth on something simple for his first effort .
The primitive ping - pong game Bushnell had seen at Magnavox seemed like a good candidate .
" I had to come up with a game people already knew how to play ; something so simple that any drunk in a bar could play . " xix – Nolan Bushnell
Neither Alcorn nor Bushnell were impressed with Odyssey and its analog components , so the game would have to be improved .
In any event , Pong was only practice , and Bushnell did not plan to take it seriously .
“ I thought it was going to be a throwaway , ” Bushnell told Playboy Magazine , " but when he ( Alcorn ) got it up and running , it turned out to be a hell of a lot of fun . ”
xx
Just like Computer Space , Pong was a TTL discreet - logic machine .
It had no microprocessor , but instead used individual chips to create the logic for the game .
The key to saving money was to design the game so well that it used the fewest number of chips .
“ I had the prototype running in three months and I was very disappointed because it had about 75 TTL IC 's and would cost way too much for a high volume home machine .
It turns out that Nolan had something else in mind .
He lied about the contract with GE and gave me this project because it was the simplest game he could think of and he just wanted me to practice on something . ” xxi - Al Alcorn
Alcorn added small details like ball English and simulated physics that went beyond Bushnell ’s original concept , but still kept the design elegant , and cheap .
“ Since I was under the impression that this was to be a real product I worked hard to make it playable and inexpensive . ” xxii - Al Alcorn
After Nolan Bushnell saw how well Pong was turning out , he and Ted Dabney decided to test - market it at one of the locations on their pinball route , Andy Capp ’s Tavern in Sunnyvale California .
xxiii
It was an almost instant success .
People started lining up before the bar opened just to play the game .
Some would n’t even order anything -- just play Pong .
Unlike the pages of instructions for Computer Space , Pong instructions are the model of simplicity : “ Avoid missing ball for high score . "
“ Two weeks after installing the game , Al Alcorn got a late - night phone call from the manager of the bar .
The game had broken down , and he wondered if he could fix it .
When Alcorn went to check the machine , he found a most unusual problem .
There were so many quarters jammed into the coin drop that the game had stopped working .
xxiv
Under the coin - drop was a plastic milk jug with the top cut off , and it was filled with quarters , making the “ credit ” mechanism not work .
“ When we first put it on location I asked Nolan what would constitute good performance .
I think he said that if it did $ 25 a week that would be a good game .
It was doing over $ 100 per week right away . ” xxv - Al Alcorn
“ At that point in time , I knew I had a successful business . ” xxvi - Nolan Bushnell
A successful test - market , however , did not mean instant sales .
In the fall 1972 Bushnell set out on a road trip with a portable version of Atari's Pong machine to look for potential buyers .
The Pong game was offered to Bally first , but they declined to purchased it , preferring a game that did not require 2 players .
Bally had contracted Atari to do a driving game , and Nolan tried very hard to get them to accept Pong instead , but Bally refused .
Other amusement manufacturers at the AMOA trade show did n’t “ get it ” either .
In 1972 , the pinball and other amusement game manufacturers made machines with many electromechanical and moving parts .
Pong had only two moving parts and this baffled them .
They did n’t understand or envision the industry changing .
Instead of persuing established manufacturers , Bushnell decided to manufacture Pong himself .
It was not an easy sell to Dabney or Alcorn , who thought Atari was a technology company that would license its inventions , not manufacture them .
“ Nolan had to convince us to be in the manufacturing business .
In the end it turned out to be the best strategy ” xxvii - Al Alcorn
It was his boldest move yet , and would prove ultimately successful .
He leased an old roller rink in Santa Clara and converted it into a production line manned by low - paid hippies .
The first Pong game shipped from this facility in November 1972 .
xxviii
On November 19th , 1979 Pong was officially released , xxix and the “ Steam Age ” of the coin operated video game began .
1973 : Pong Is A Smash Hit !
" As a result of Pong , a player can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest Newtonian physics . "
xxx - Carl Sagan
By March of 1973 , Pong was deemed a bona fide phenomenon for Atari .
They had sold 8000 - 10000 machines , and would eventually sell upwards of 35,000 .
The day Pong was released is marked by the coin - op industry as the first nail in the coffin of pinball .
xxxi
Atari was so successful in its first year for two reasons .
First , they used an early version of a “ Just - In - Time ” manufacturing processes .
“ With expensive parts , such as cabinets , we tried to get them out the same day they came in and we made sure that 75 % of the cost turned over in less than a week . "
xxxii - Nolan Bushnell
Secondly , Atari also took advantage of the soaring demand for Pong by insisting on cash payments from distributors instead of going along with the longer terms common in the coin - operated game industry .
xxxiii
By March of 1973 , Atari had made a little over $ 3.2 million dollars .
However , there was a black side to this fortune .
Atari ’s patent for Pong took a long time to clear -- too long to stop a myriad of copycats from showing - up almost immediately .
“ I filed for a patent , but in those days patents took 3 years to issue .
I do n’t think my patent issued until 1975 or 1976 . ” xxxiv - Nolan Bushnell
Since the game was designed using a discreet logic TTL design , there was very little they could do to protect their intellectual property .
Anyone who owned a machine could open it up , examine the circuit board , and copy it chip for chip .
By the end of 1973 , there were so many competitors selling Pong - style games that Atari was no longer the leading manufacturer of its own game .
Some of the copies were made so well that they looked exactly like the original Atari versions .
Some of the Pong competition in 1973 included : Elepong from Taito , Davis Cup by Taito ( each player had two paddles ) , Computer Space Ball ( 1972 ) from Nutting Associates , Hockey by Ramtek , Hockey TV from Sega , Leader from Midway ( a very innovative 4 - player Pong variant with a wall in the middle for deflection ) , Olympic Tennis from See - Fun ( 2 or 4 players ) , Pro Tennis from Williams Mfg. Co. ( 4 players ) , Paddle Battle from Allied Leisure ( exact copy of Pong ) , Paddle - Ball from Williams ( exact copy of Pong ) , Pong - Tron from Sega ( exact copy of Pong ) , Pong - Tron II from Sega ( exact copy of Pong ) , Pro Hockey from Taito , Rally from For -Play , TV Hockey from Chicago Coin ( exact copy of Pong ) , T.V. Tennis from US Billiards ( exact copy of Pong ) , TV Ping Pong from Chicago Coin ( exact copy of Pong ) , Table Tennis from Nutting Associates ( exact copy of Pong ) , Tennis Tourney from Allied Leisure ( 4 player Pong ) , Winner from Midway ( an exact copy of Pong ) and Winner IV from Midway .
Atari could have fought each one of these copycats -- but they could not afford to do it .
According to Nolan Bushnell
“ Atari was always scrambling for cash , and we thought to spend money on attorneys was not a smart thing to do . ” - Nolan Bushnell
However , it was n’t just the copycats Atari had to worry about , it was other legal problems as well .
Magnavox and Ralph Baer did not take kindly to the success of Atari ’s Pong , especially since they had created a very similar game more than a year earlier .
They took Atari to court , suing them over Pong .
They used the sign - in - sheet for the 1972 Magnavox demo that Bushnell attended as proof that he saw the Magnavox video games before he came up with his own idea .
However , Bushnell maintained that while he might have seen the Magnavox product , his was far superior :
“ They did an excellent job of creating a game using analog circuitry , but it just was n't fun . ” xxxv - Nolan Bushnell
Skillfully , Nolan Bushnell turned this legal problem into an advantage for Atari .
Atari settled with Magnavox , and the case never went to court .
They paid a licensing fee close to $ 500,000 and became the sole licensor of Pong from Magnavox .
“ It was a strategic thing .
Magnavox was desperate to settle with me .
They had seen lab books and I had been in business for two years before the Odyssey game was supposed to hit the streets .
We settled basically for an amount of money that was less than I was spending on attorney ’s fees at the time .
$ 500,000 paid over five years .
Less than 1/10th of 1 % .
It was a usage royalty . ” xxxvi - Nolan Bushnell
" As far as we were concerned , that was the end of our problems with Atari " xxxvii - Ralph Baer
Magnavox then agreed to go after all of Atari ’s competitors as part of the deal , which basically freed Atari to create new and different games while the competition was stuck in court .
“ In our agreement we required that they go after all our competitors .
Literally , I felt that if we could keep everyone else distracted and paying money , that could only help our business .
I was not worried about Magnavox being a competitor .
It was a strategic business move .
Any time you can damage your competitors , walk away from it with token royalty and have everyone else sweating bullets because they knew that had copied my stuff .
It was a good thing for Atari . ” - Nolan Bushnell
The final analysis of these early lawsuits shows that it really did not matter who invented “ the video game ” , but it did matter who made it successful .
“ I did n't invent the video game -- I commercialized it . ” xxxviii - Nolan Bushnell
1973 : Innovative Leisure
Besides fighting copycats and legal battles in 1973 , Atari continued to strengthen their engineering team , and create new games .
At this point , creating games was almost entirely an engineering process .
All the gameplay , graphics , and controls were governed by the TTL discreet logic and mechanical engineering skills of the technical team .
For this reason , Atari continued to hire as many good technical people as possible .
In June of 1973 , Al Alcorn hired Steve Bristow to help create new games .
Bristow was a fellow Ampex employee , and great engineer .
He would stay at Atari for more than 10 years .
Bristow and Alcorn , along with a couple of electrical engineers , set out with a directive from Bushnell to develop more games in vein of Pong .
xxxix
However , while Bushnell concentrated on the engineers , the manufacturing process was in trouble .
Pong games were breaking down , and customers were complaining that Atari ’s machines were not reliable .
Part of this problem was that Atari was not able to pay enough money to its manufacturing staff .
“ We were hiring people as fast as we could and paying them hippie wages , which was still above minimum wage .
It was a situation where we were doing an awful lot of training ” xl - Nolan Bushnell
Equipment “ disappeared ” from their facilities daily .
They needed to make some kind of move to allay the fears of their customers .
To do this Atari created the “ Durastress ” trademark and began marketing their games as meeting “ Military Specification 883 ” to their customers .
“ Military Specification 883 ” is defined by the Department Of Defense “ Standard Test Methods and Procedures for Microelectronics ” , and was a requirement for defense contractors .
While their arcade games might not have required this process , it sure looked good on their advertising and showed that Atari , at least in print , was trying to seem more reliable .
To improve manufacturing , Atari hired outside experts and began giving benefits to their line staff that were almost unheard of at the time .
“ ... all employees received the same medical benefits as the executives ” ” xli - Nolan Bushnell
At just about the same time , Atari created the first real slogan to describe their products :
“ We define our product as innovative leisure .
We will build the best products possible , and serve our markets in such a way that through time the Atari name is synonymous with : quality , imagination , research , after - sale service , and social responsibility . ” xlii - Nolan Bushnell
On July 16th , 1973 saw Atari second coin - op release , Space Race .
It might not have been the complete innovation they needed , and while it was not exactly Pong , Atari made sure their customers knew it did not fall far from the tree .
“ From The Originators Of Pong ... ” xliii - Space Race flyer
Space Race was designed by Al Alcorn as a two player - only timed game involving two ships flying towards the top of the screen .
Players controlled the vertical position of the ships , and attempted to dodge asteroids to get to the top of the screen ..
If they made it to the top , they received 1 point .
The service manual has " Pong " scratched - out and " Space Race " written over it.xliv
The machine is basically Pong with different TTL logic .
Atari licensed the game to Bally / Midway under the name Asteroid .
Atari quickly followed - up Space Race with their second Pong - style game , Pong Doubles , in the Autumn of 1973 .
It was a 2 - 4 player version of Pong designed to stave off some of their growing competition .
“ Atari ’s New Video Game .
2 Or 4 Players ” xlv - Pong Doubles Flyer
1973 : Partner ’s Split
By late 1973 the growing competition in the games manufacturing business made Nolan Bushnell ’s partner Ted Dabney very nervous .
He decided to leave the company .
“ We only had so much money and somewhere along the line he said ‘ let ’s split , I ’ll take the operations business ’ because at that time operations was making more money than manufacturing ” - Nolan Bushnell
Bushnell was not immune to Dabney ’s fears , but he still believed in the arcade games business .
But instead of quitting , Bushnell decided to expand the business .
To do this he had to do something very creative .
In October of 1973 , Bushnell decided to grab as much market share as possible by signing exclusive contracts with distributors in each geographic area to buy only Atari games .
Because most geographic areas had two distributors , Bushnell separately ( and semi- secretly ) created Kee Games , named after Bushnell friend Joseph Keenan who became president of the company .
Kee would sign exclusive contracts with the second distributor in a geographic area .
The games that Kee and Atari produced individually were eventually released by both companies with unique names and some cosmetic differences .
Steve Bristow went to work for Kee as their head of engineering .
“ Joe Keenan was my next door neighbor .
I told him , “ I ’d like to hire you to set up a company called Kee Games .
We ’ll make it look like it ’s Kee for Keenan , and it will look like you ’ve come in and started up a new coin - op manufacturer ” xlvi - Nolan Bushnell
1973 : Pong At One
After one year of operations , in November 1973 , Atari had built and sold 6000 Pong machines , and sales were about $ 1,000,000 a month , with $ 15,000,000 in sales expected by the end of the fiscal year ( June 1974 ) .
xlvii
Even though there many competitors , Atari was still tried to push Pong in directions that the competition had never considered .
Some of these ideas included prototypes , limited - run and unreleased versions of Pong such as Pong In A Barrel , Doctor Pong , and Puppy Pong.
xlviii
At the same time , they worked on new ideas .
The November AMOA show that year was quite different from 1972 , when no one would give Atari ’s Pong a passing glance .
This time , Atari generated much interest with a showing of Pong Doubles , and a new game , Gotcha .
“ An Amazing Maze Of Fun !
Another innovative winner from Atari , the leader in video skill games ” xlix - Gotcha flyer
Gotcha showed that Atari 's investment in engineering paid off .
It was the first ever maze game , and featured a technical marvel for the time : an ever - changing maze .
Gotcha was another 2 - player game , featuring a scantily - clad woman chased by a man on the side of cabinet , suggesting sexual overtones that could not be conveyed by the rudimentary graphics of the time .
Gotcha was another “ simple to learn , difficult to master ” game aimed at the bar crowd .
In December of 1973 , Newsweek published an article that called Bushnell “ King Pong ” .
The name stuck for many years .
Bushnell told the magazine ( referring to Pong ) “ We ’ve created a whole new market ” l Players liked Pong because no luck is involved , and the more you played the more skillful you became .
Bushnell described Atari ’s successful process for game design thus : “ We have to walk a tightrope between reward and frustration ” .
li
At this time , Atari acquired one of their most infamous employees : Steve Jobs as was hired as a wiring technician by Al Alcorn .
Even with all their success , by the end of the year , more well - established competition was winning out .
By the end of 1973 , Midway has sold 9000 Pong - type machines opposed to Atari ’s 6000.
lii Atari was now up against the big boys , and they were n’t about to give Atari any credit for their inventions .
“ The small companies will be in trouble when the crunch arrives ” liii - 1973 , Jack Mittel , Vice President of Sales for Williams Electronics
1974 : More Of The Same
Atari started 1974 on a high note .
Pong had sold well in ’ 73 , and they were creating new and innovative games almost every month .
In January they released another Pong variant named Superpong .
" An Improvement On a Proven Money Maker From The Originators Of Pong ” liv - Superpong Arcade Flyer
Superpong was a one or two player contest , an evolution over Pong that used variable ball speeds , angles , and three paddles ( vertically aligned ) for each player .
To further spice - up the game , the ball was served from random positions on the screen .
Atari described Superpong as “ not easily mastered .
” lv
In February , the first sign of Bushnell ’s Kee Games ploy arrived in the form of Atari ’s Rebound , and Kee ’s clone of it , Spike .
“ It ’s A Whole New Ball Game ” lvi - Rebound Arcade Flyer
Rebound was a simple game of volleyball -- in fact the Schematic dated 11/31/73 describes this game as “ volleyball ” .lvii
It 's formed from a vertical version of Pong with simulated gravity .
Hitting the ball would send it on a parabolic path over 4 short lines that represented a net .
" The Spike - Man Cometh ... from Kee " lviii - Spike Arcade Flyer
Spike Was Kee ’s copy of Atari ’s Rebound .
Kee ’s products were mostly copies of Atari ’s games with innovative features added to differentiate them from their Atari cousins , and create the feeling of a “ rivalry ” between the two companies .
In this case , “ the Spike button ” was added .
March of 1974 brought another Pong variant named Quadrapong .
Quadrapong was a distant cousin of the Atari coin - op to come , Warlords .
The game featured 2 - 4 - player action in table - top , look - down cabinet .
" Another Video Action Favorite !
Quadrapong is the newest addition to Atari ’s Line of unique video skill games . "
- Quadrapong Arcade flyer
Each player was given four points , and tasked with defending one - side of a diamond - shaped screen .
Players lose a point each time one of the others score in his goal , and is eliminated if this happens 4 times .
At that point , their goal is sealed , and it becomes a solid wall .
Quadrapong was actually an Atari copy of Kee game named Elimination .
1974 : The Crunch Hits
While these variations on Pong were very interesting from a game design perspective , they were not as thrilling to the public or arcade operators are Atari had hoped .
Sales were off , competition up , and Atari needed something new .
Sensing the need for some serious innovative development away from the grind of company , Nolan Bushnell contracted with two ex-Ampex engineers , Steve Mayer and Larry Emmons at Cyan engineering , and created the Grass Valley Think Tank , an R&D lab for new Atari products .
The first project for the Grass Valley Think Tank was to finally create the racing game that Bally had contracted Atari created two years prior .
However , this time the game would be for Atari itself , and Bushnell was hoping it would be a new direction away from Pong .
Grass Valley was tasked with creating an all - new cabinet and control mechanism for video games .
Gone were the simple buttons and potentiometers used for control of Pong games , and instead there would be a steering wheels , gear - shift , gas , and brake pedals to give the game a realistic feel .
It was a tough assignment , and for Grass Valley , it was a rough entry into designing video games .
Al Alcorn had to step in and fixed the flawed design before it could be sold .
“ We had built about 100 and they were badly engineered that they had to take them back .
I came off of sabbatical and re-designed it . ” lix - Al Alcorn
Besides the innovative cabinet and controls , the game included realistic ( for the time ) sound effects , and , in addition to the TTL logic , used ROM memory in the form of diodes to store graphics information .
“ From the ‘ Pong People ’ , New video game concept , big racing action , fantastic sound effects , worldwide market in millions ! ” - Gran Trak 10 marketing flyer
The game is a race against the clock on a single track .
There are no other cars on the track except the player .
Oil slicks make the player ’s car spin-out .
The side of the track had to be avoided .
Besides all the costly rework and delays for the game , an accounting error had Gran Trak 10 selling for $ 995 , when it cost $ 1095 to manufacturelx .
All of this led to the near financial collapse of the company .
For the fiscal year of 1973 - 1974 , Atari lost $ 500,000 .
Pong competition , Gran Trak 10 , and a failed venture into Atari Japanlxi ( sold off to Namco for $ 500,000 ) left the company near bankruptcy .
Nolan Bushnell was forced to lay - off half of Atari ’s staff , and rethink his next moves .
1974 : Corporate Retreats
In dire need of new ideas , Nolan Bushnell started taking his key engineers on corporate retreats to relax and come up with and innovative ideas .
These were not simple marketing brainstorms , but “ assisted ” technical and game design discussions .
These sessions started at the local Holiday Inn , but soon moved out to Grass Valley , and later into the hot tub at Nolan ’s house and into the one that he has installed in the engineering building .
lxii
While these sessions were legendary for alcohol and marijuana consumption , those activities were not the focus .
It was Bushnell ’s attempt to get his engineering team to come up with new ideas to save the company and move it forward .
Most of the best game and product ideas game from these sessions , including coin-ops and consumer products such as the home version of Pong .
They also solidified the notion that the “ laid back engineer ” ruled the day at Atari in these early years .
The effect of this brainstorming could be seen in the games that Atari produced thereafter .
The second half of 1974 showed a marked difference in game design from the first .
Atari started with a redesigned version of Gran Trak 10 that fixed technical issues and added a second player .
The game also offered the pinball - like feature of a free game for a high score .
Gran Trak 20 featured two complete sets of controls ( steering wheel , brake pedal , gas pedal , 4 speed gear shift ) and offered operators more money per play ( 2 quarters for two players ) .
Double your pleasure ... double your earnings !
- Gran Trak 20 marketing flyer
The innovation continued into October with Pin-Pong -- a kind of pinball game with a patented “ ball movement circuit ” .
“ In Pin-Pong a gravity algorithm accelerates the ball downward to give realistic pinball action on the screen ” .
- Pin-Pong marketing flyer
Atari finished out 1974 with two more games .
One was their first light - gun game Qwak ! , a duck hunting game that included a realistic - looking rifle , complete with an alarm that would sound if it was stolen -- plus the ability for the operator to set time limits , extended time and free games .
The other was Touch Me , a screen - less coin - op game and precursor to the hand - held game Simon ( incidentally created by Ralph Baer for Milton Bradley ) .
1974 : The Rise Of Kee Games
While Atari continued to struggle , Kee games was operating at maximum efficiency .
Joe Keenan , as it turned out , was not too bad at running an arcade games business .
As well , Steve Bristow was designing up a storm .
While Kee continued to copy Atari games ( Formula K and Twin Racer were their answers to Gran Trak 10 and Gran Trak 20 ) , they also started to design a few games of their own .
One of their first was Tank ! , and what a first it turned out to be !
The game featured two tanks battling it out on the playfield filled geometric shaped barriers .
It was the same type of game that Atari would make famous in their Combat !
cartridge for the VCS three years later .
Steve Bristow designed the game and Lyle Rains finished it .
It was one of the first games to use actual ROM to store graphics .
" I was working on it when I hired Lyle then I gave it to him and he finished it .
A lot of the implementation was his , but the original idea was mine .
" lxiii - Steve Bristow
The importance of Tank ! in the history of Atari can not be understated .
It was the game that saved Atari from bankruptcy in 1974 .
The game became so popular that the exclusivity agreements Atari demanded from distributors were thrown out the window .
Everybody wanted it , and Atari made sure they got it .
Bushnell ’s cash flow problems at Atari were suddenly reversed .
Atari and Kee merged at the end of 1974 , and Joe Keenan became president of Atari , Steve Bristow became head of engineering and Al Alcorn became head of R&D.
Atari was suddenly infused with new engineering and game design blood from Kee , like Lyle Rains .
Nolan Bushnell also moved into a new role .
“ I really became the CEO .
I was still doing what I call game producing , but I was not doing any of the design .
We would sit down in creative sessions and I would pretty much decide which games we would be doing , but I became less and less involved in the actual engineering . ” - Nolan Bushnell
Atari ended 1974 on the same high they had just one year earlier .
They had surmounted their cash flow problems and cemented engineering and game design as the most important parts of the company .
1975 : Innovate Or Die
With his newly fully - realized company , Bushnell was firing on all cylinders .
The parties and game design sessions continued , and Atari started getting reputation as the place to “ work hard and party harder ” .
As the engineering group grew in size and importance , it got the reputation of being a very informal and laid - back place to work .
About this time , Nolan Bushnell created a manifesto that described their business .
Bushnell was pushing to define Atari ’s place in the entertainment world .
“ We define our product as innovative leisure .
We will build the best products possible , and serve our markets in such a way that through time the Atari name is synonymous with : quality , imagination , research , after - sale service , and social responsibility . ” - Nolan Bushnell 's Atari Manifesto
The manifesto also described Bushnell ’s ideas for the ideal workplace :
“ A corporation is simply people banding together in an organized fashion to produce products or accomplishments which would not be possible otherwise .
When the goals of Atari and the goals of its people are in harmony , Atari is strong and its people are happy and satisfied . ” - Nolan Bushnell 's Atari Manifesto
It went on to describe a couple ways people would be treated :
“ Maintain a social atmosphere where we can be friends and comrades apart from the organizational hierarchy .
Encourage and promote personal growth through education and training such as that we may all reach our individual potentialities . ”
- Nolan Bushnell 's Atari Manifesto
However , if it seemed like a fun place to work , Atari was also a very difficult job .
For instance , while there were no set hours , you had to make games well or get out .
There was little room for time wasters or people who were not interested in making games , and making them well .

“ Atari 's strategy was actually quite simple and , I think , quite elegant .
We were known as a party place , but the important thing is that parties did n't happen unless quotas were made .
We had a lot of parties because people made their numbers . ” lxv - Nolan Bushnell
1975 : Coin-Op Division
The coin-operated games that Atari produced in 1975 built on the success of Tank !
And the strides in innovation they had made the previous year .
Since the success of Tank ! had brought more people into the arcades and proved that more than Pong could be successful , it was easier to sell more and different types of games .
While there still were a couple Pong - style games ( i.e. Goal IV ) , and the odd R&D offshoot ( Compugraph Photo Machine ) many were Tank !- inspired military concepts .
In January Atari released Pursuit , a WWI game in which you shoot down enemy planes in your crosshairs .
Later that year came Anti-Aircraft , which played much like the VCS launch title Air Sea Battle that would appear two years later ( it also included an undocumented switch that could turn the planes into UFOslxvi ) .
Still later , in October 1975 came Jet Fighter , another game that would see its home debut two years later on the VCS Combat cartridge .
" Atari ’s Jet Fighter is a video action game in which players pilot two airplanes across the sky in a fast - moving duel . " -

Throughout the year , new versions of Tank !
arrived as well , including Tank 2 , Tank III , and a cocktail table version of the original Tank .
Tank 2 added land mines represented by X's .
Throughout 1975 , Atari continued producing racing games .
One of the first of the year was in March with Hi-Way , a sit - down cockpit - style driving game , the first with a scrolling playfield that Atari patented ( and perpetuated ) for many years .
They also continued to produce the single screen , multiplayer racing games that they invented with Gran Trak 20 , but now allowing many more people to play once .

Indy 800 was an 8 - player racing game with a full - color screen .
An optional control module allowed an official “ starter ” to facilitate tournaments .
The game included a mirrored canopy to allow spectators to view the racing action , and even equipped each driver with their own horn .
The entire cabinet took up 16 square feet of space .
Another multi-player racing game was released in October 1975 with Steeplechase .
This time the theme was horse racing , and the game could be played by as many as 6 people at once .
Atari also tried its hand at a demolition derby style game with Crash 'n Score in October of 1975 .
“ Atari ’s Crash 'n Score is a video action game in which one or two players drive race cars on a rectangular playfield and earn score points by driving through lighted score flags .
During play a player has to maneuver his car around certain obstacles and has to avoid the opponent car . ”
- Crash 'n Score service manual
Atari ’s most notorious coin - op game from 1975 was probably Shark Jaws .
Shark Jaws was a one player game designed to capitalize on the movie Jaws .
Legend has it that Atari tried to secure the rights to the movie Jaws , but failed .
Instead of jeopardizing Atari , Bushnell created “ Horror Games ” specifically for this game , and released it anyway .
The game was very simple , consisting of a swimmer , fish , and shark .
The swimmer had to catch the fish , without being eaten by the shark .
“ Atari had a real crude attitude about things .
Jaws was such a big movie and we decided we would do a game that was sharks eating people .
We decided we would do it under the nom de plum of ' Horror Games ' .
Shark Jaws was actually a huge success , we sold a couple thousand . ” lxvii - Nolan Bushnell
1975 : Home Pong
At one of the Grass Valley retreats , when Atari was struggling in 1974 , the subject of a home version of Pong was brought up to Nolan Bushnell by engineer Bob Brown .
Fellow engineer Harold Lee and Bob Brown had been bouncing the idea around as far back as 1973 , but at the time it did not amount to a serious discussion .
However , with Atari on the brink of financial disaster in ‘ 74 , the time seemed right to investigate the possibility once more .
To make a home version of Pong viable required that the entire game be placed on a single microchip .
Up until that point , Atari had never used microchips in its products , so it was a huge step for them to attempt to enter that arena .
" I got to talking about Pong with an engineer friend of mine named Harold Lee , who was working in coin - op .
I really wanted to do a consumer product so I asked him whether we could put Pong on a chip .
It would be a dedicated home game for TV that would essentially be like the coin - op Pong .
He said it could be done , and then we sold Atari on the idea . " lxviii - Bob Brown
By the fall of 1974 , Al Alcorn had joined Harold Lee and Bob Brown , working on a home version of Pong , now code named “ Darlene ” .
Discussions at the Grass Valley retreats tended to move into two directions : technology and women .
It just so happened that when Home Pong was discussed , so was a particularly attractive Atari employee named Darlene .
The name stuck , and so did the trend of Atari to use female names as code words for their most secret of projects .
“ We were all young , it was the '70s , it seemed like the right thing to do . ” lxix - Nolan Bushnell
By early 1975 , the success of Tank ! left Atari in a good position to start to seriously work on home Pong .
They earned $ 3.5 million on $ 39 million in sales for fiscal 1974 - 1975 , and could afford new R&D .
The cost of microchips had come down to a level that would make the project economically viable , so Atari decided it is the time to go full - bore and enter the home market .
Even though Bushnell was urged by advisors to stay away from the home market ( the same one that Magnavox was struggling in ) , he decided to do it anyway .
“ The next epiphany , if you would , was when we figured out we could put Pong on a single LSI chip ...
All of a sudden , we knew we could put one in every home .
All of a sudden , we went from a very successful coin - op business to a potential consumer business . ” lxx - Nolan Bushnell
Alcorn , Lee and Brown worked through 1974 and into 1975 perfecting a microchip - based home Pong unit that could not be easily copied by the competition .
By mid-1975 , they had succeeded , but then had no idea what to do next .
Atari had never marketed anything to the public before .
Most of their previous marketing materials consisted of flyers sent out to amusement operators to announce their new games .
Gene Lipkin , their VP of marketing , had experience in the coin - op world , but this was very new to him .
What was good enough for a company based on engineering and game design that sold to a limited audience for $ 1,000 or more per unit would never work in the high - volume , low - margin world of consumer goods .
Atari took Home Pong to industry trade shows like the New York Toy Fair , directly to toy stores , and offered it to various departments at Sears ( toys , appliances ) but all refused .
The only person even remotely interested was Tom Quinn , who managed the buying for the the Sporting Goods department at Sears .
He initially ordered 50,000 units which increased to 150,000 by Christmas .
It was the perfect way to start .
If any company had experience in consumer goods it was Sears and Roebuck , then the largest consumer goods retailer in the country .
Aside from a lack of marketing experience , Atari also had no experience manufacturing consumer goods in the amount required to service a huge account like Sears .
New facilities had to be created , processes put in place , employees and hired .
To make their Sears quota Bushnell enlisted the aid of Donald Valentine to help secure venture capital for Atari .
He came through with $ 600,000 in the summer of 1975 , and another $ 300,000 in December , which was enough to help get the home Pong manufactured .
The home Pong unit ( sold under the Sears Tele - Games label ) was a huge seller in the Christmas 1975 season .
The gamble paid off -- Atari was now a technology leader in two separate markets , arcade and home , something no one had ever done before .
“ We risked the company every year on new ideas .
We were young and if it failed we could always get jobs in Silicon Valley ” lxxi - Al Alcorn
1976 : Coin-Op Business
Coming off the success of home Pong , Atari did not rest on its coin - op laurels .
It started the year releasing more games based on TTL discreet logic .
The first came in February with Stunt Cycle .
“ Now the people who brought motor sports racing to a video track brings your customers a fantastic motorcycle jump and stunt attraction . ” - Stunt Cycle marketing flyer
The action in Stunt Cycle was influenced by the then reigning king of motorcycle jumping and crushed pelvic bones , Evel Knievel .
Much like Shark Jaws though , inspiration was enough -- no license was acquired .
The cabinet included realistic motorcycle handlebars , and a handle - grip throttle .
Stunt Cycle was followed by Quiz Show and Indy 400 ( a cheaper , smaller 4 - player version of Indy 800 ) in April , and the racer LeMans in July .
However , it was the March release of Outlaw that was more significant ... for the wrong reasons .
Inspired by the success of Midway ’s Gun Fight from 1975 ( the first game to use a microprocessor ) , Outlaw was a discreet logic TTL game , and the technology was showing its age .
The difference between the sharp graphics from Gun Fight , and the blocky designs of Outlaw were unmistakable .
And while the two - player action in Gun Fight was thrilling , Outlaw ’s simple quick - draw seemed ancient by comparison .
Atari ’s game looked behind the times , and they needed to act fast .
Atari engineering was already working on games that used 8 - bit microprocessors , but before any were released , the last and greatest TTL discreet logic game would take the arcade by storm .
“ Nolan Bushnell wanted a game that was like a single player Pong with bricks that you would hit and the ball would go behind them ” lxxii - Steve Wozniak
Atari ’s Breakout coin- op was released in May of 1976 , and it was an instant classic .
Designed by Nolan Bushnell , the game was engineered by Steve Wozniak in a 4 - day challenge to see how few TTL chips could be used to create a fully functioning game .
Wozniak ’s forte was designing systems with as few chips as possible .
His friend , Steve Jobs , had been working as a technician at Atari for a few years , and asked Wozniak to see if he could design a game with as few parts as possible .
There was incentive , in the form of bonuses for Jobs -- who shared part of it , but not all , with Wozniak -- but also incentive on Atari ’s part to move away from cumbersome designs that used hundreds of TTL chips .
" The reason Atari wanted me to design it is they were tired of their games taking 150 , 200 chips , and they knew I designed things with very few chips , so we had incentives for getting it under 50 or under 40 chips .
" lxxiii - Steve Wozniak
The final design used 46 TTL chips , and was so intricately created that it had to be sent to Grass Valley to be re-engineered for manufacture .
“ The design was so minimized that normal mere mortals could n't figure it out . ” lxxiv - Al Alcorn
Breakout generated sales of over 11,000 units priced at $ 1095 each.lxxv
However , it did more than just that .
It made people want to go back to the arcade .
The game was also a worldwide success .
Atari sold the Japanese rights to their old partner , Namco .
Since supplies were so low , Atari could not get enough units to Namco , so the company made their own knock - off ( everyone else was doing the same ) and it helped make them a huge player in the Japanese game industry .
lxxvi
Even though Breakout was a huge success , and showed how few TTL chips could be used to create a great game , the days of discreet logic design were nearly over .
8 - bit microprocessors had come down in price to the point where they were a feasible alternative , and could provide much more power with a standardized architecture .
The first two chips Atari engineers used were the MOS 6502 and the Motorola 6800 .
Plus , there were things that you could do with microprocessor that were nearly impossible with a TTL logic design .
A.I. , for example , was so difficult to recreate with discreet logic , that Atari ’s games had continued to increase the amount of human players they could support to compensate , and in turn increased the games ' size and cost , while decreasing the ability for an amusement operator to buy them or find space to display them .
Developing a microprocessor - based game was much different than designing one with only TTL chips .
Most of the early microprocessor - based gamed were hybrids of TTL and microprocessor , and it made the job that much harder .
Owen R. Rubin was one of a new breed of coin - op designers hired around 1976 to help move Atari into the microprocessor age .
His first game , the unreleased Cannonball , was one of Atari ’s initial forays into microprocessor based games .
“ The hardware was rather simple .
You have a number of ' motion objects ' which could be placed anywhere on the screen .
Early version simply took graphics from a PROM and the programmer simply set a value in a register to select which picture .
There were missile graphics , 2x2 or 1x1 objects to use as bullets .
The playfield was a " stamp " based graphics made up of 8x8 or 16x16 graphic stamps that were also pulled from a PROM . ” lxxvii - Owen R. Rubin
The power of microprocessor - based hardware could be seen almost immediately .
Cops ‘N Robbers , released in July , was essentially a modernized version of Gun Fight .
Two very detailed cars were controlled by the players as they attempted to shoot each other across a roadway .
“ New programming and electronic design give the players more action , movement , and larger , more animated figures ” - Cops ‘N Robbers marketing flyer
Fly Ball , a two player baseball style game ( more “ over the line ” than baseball actually ) featured animated players of a kind Atari had never produced up to that point .
Sprint 2 , released in November , was a major update on the Gran Trak - style game .
It included multiple tracks , on - screen text , and for the first time , A.I. cars to compete against the player .
“ A solo driver sprints against the clock in a white car , but he is not alone .
He competes against a black car and two grey cars that drive automatically . ”-
Sprint 2 marketing flyer
Arcade operators saw $ 200 - $ 300 a week from the machine .
“ Sprint 2 is earning extremely well ... we feel it will surpass many of the other video games ” - Ray Galante of Music Vend Seattle in Coin Connection Feb . 1977
Sprint 2 went on to became a huge hit , selling more than 8200 unitslxxviii , and spawning multiple sequels .
Also a success was an update of Tank ! for 8 players named appropriately enough , Tank 8 .
However , it was the October release of Night Driver that really showed the power of the microprocessor .
One of the very first games viewed from a first - person , 3D perspective , the game was designed by Dave Shepperd .
It featured a winding road at “ night ” ( you could only see white dots that represented the side of road ) that needed to be traversed by the player .
“ I have fond memories of spending time watching the white lines in the street and fence posts whiz by my car as I drove to and from work , trying to work out in my mind 's eye what kind of math I can use to make little squares on a TV kind of do the same thing . ” lxxix - Dave Shepperd
The game was a sizable hit for Atari , and it proved that advanced technology could not only improve video games , but could open up new styles of play that were once nearly thought to be impossible to produce .
1976 : The Home Front
Even with successful coin - ops using new technology , Atari was still finding the competition for arcade floor space suffocating .
With a $ 250,000 cost to develop a game , and about 10 % chance it would be successful , Atari had to become serious about their second front : the home .
However , that would not be easy .
After being successful in 1975 and early 1976 with home Pong , sold through Sears , Atari created more versions of home Pong to market both themselves and through Sears including C - 140 Super Pong , C - 160 Pong Doubles , C - 180 Super Pong Ten .
However , by that time , Atari was not the only company selling a chip - based Pong unit .
At least 75 companies announced their intentions to get into the business in early 1976 .
Atari might have made the first home Pong , but just like its experience with their coin - op Pong , dozens of imitators were in pursuit of the same dollars .
Atari tried to combat the imitators by generating a sense of loyalty in consumers to buy " A Real Atari " , but compared to some of the newer models , Atari ’s home units looked primitive just 6 months after they went on sale .
In early 1976 , General Instrument created the AY38500 microchip that included 6 paddle and shooting games in one unit .
Coleco was the first buyer of the chip , producing the Telstar Arcade , an impressive - looking console that was competitively priced with Atari ’s Pong .
Worse for Atari , in the summer of 1976 came the Fairchild Channel F system , the first console that used interchangeable games on cartridge .
The Channel F was never a huge seller , but , coupled with the Christmas best - seller Coleco Telstar , these moves rendered Atari ’s dedicated home business almost worthless in less than a year .
1976 : The Apple Mistake
With the focus on home video games and coin-ops , Atari did make one move in 1976 that , in hind - sight , could have been their biggest mistake .
Steve Jobs , who had left Atari and was working for HP at the time , brought a piece of equipment to Al Alcorn that he and Steve Wozniak had been working on in their garage .
It was a computer based on the same MOS 6502 processor that Atari had started using in their coin - op games .
Alcorn thought it was a “ neat engineering project ” but did not think it was right for Atari .
“ we said ‘ no thank you ’… but I liked him , I thought he was a nice guy , so I introduced him to venture capitalists ’” lxxx - Al Alcorn
Atari did not have the resources enter a third , unproven market .
They let the opportunity go .
The machine became the Apple I computer , and rest is history for Jobs and Wozniak .
Atari learned to regret this mistake as they tried to enter the home computer market a few years later .
1976 : Building The 2600
Bushnell was convinced that Atari needed to outthink their competitors -- and could .
The 1975 hit coin - ops Tank ! and Jet Fighter were suggested as dedicated follow - ups to the Pong units , but Atari was tired of designing and selling dedicated hardware that cost $ 100,000 to developlxxxi with only two to three months of shelf - life before it became outdated .
The company needed to design a platform that could sustain a life of two or three years , and at the same time support incremental game sales to an already established user - base .
Months before the Fairchild Channel F appeared on store shelves , Atari was well on its way to creating a similar , yet much more flexible system .
The R&D team at the Grass Valley Think Tank started working on ideas for a programmable unit that could use interchangeable games as early as mid-1975 .
The problem was , most suitable microprocessors , like the Motorola 6800 , cost $ 100 each .
This was too much for a consumer product .
In September 1975 , Steve Mayer and Ron Milner met Chuck Peddle ( who had recently left Motorola ) at Wescon and made a deal to buy his microprocessors ( MOS 6502 ) for $ 8 apiece .
The 6502 met the minimum specs required for the reprogrammable system they were planning to create , and could also be used as the basis for microprocessor based coin -ops .
In December 1975 Atari R&D at Grass Valley hired Joe Decuir , and one of his first projects was to help debug a piece of hardware that would become the Atari VCS console .
“ Steve Mayer and Ron Milner conceived of the VCS , and designed the first prototype of its ancestor . ” lxxxii - Joe Decuir
Soon , the VCS project attained the name “ Stella ” , named after Decuir ’s bicycle .
The first programmable system prototype used controllers from Kee ’s Tank coin - op , the custom Stella chip , a 6502 hobbyist board , and a 5 volt power supplylxxxiii .
A second prototype was developed in Los Gatos in March 1976 lxxxiv , as Joe Decuir worked as an apprentice to Jay Miner , a legendary Silicon Valley hardware designer , and the only person Al Acorn knew of who could pull off the project .
They set out to create a machine whose inner workings were accessible to the programmer , and could be exploited by those who got to know the hardware well .
Work on the VCS took place in Grass Valley , and in Los Gatos , California .
“ In March of 1976 I moved to Los Gatos CA to apprentice for Jay Miner , the lead chip designer . ” lxxxv - Joe Decuir
There , Jay Miner and his team designed the guts of the Stella .
This included the 6507 processor , TIA sound chip , cartridge slot and controllers .
For most of the team , the project was thrilling .
“ I would bicycle to work and back marveling that I was getting paid to do this . ” lxxxvi - Joe Decuir
In the fall of 1976 , Atari showed how serious they were about this new “ programmable console ” , so much so that they bought out the Grass Valley Think Tank ouright , and moved the entire development team to Atari ’s new headquarters in Sunnyvale , California .
They incorporated the team into Atari ’s R&D staff , and Steve Mayer led the team .
We had to wait until we got to the 6502 or the 6800 series before there was even a possibility .
Even then , they were too slow .
We had to develop the Stella chip ... which basically did all the screen refresh and other things that have to happen in real time , much faster than a microprocessor running at 300KHz could possibly do . ” lxxxvii - Nolan Bushnell
It was at this point that Nolan Bushnell pulled off one of the most brilliant moves of his already brilliant career .
Since Atari had been beaten by their competition at their own game more than once , he decided to head them off at the pass .
Instead of waiting for competitors to emerge after the Stella project was released , he decided to tie - up all available chip fabricators that could possible make a similar piece of silicon .
It would not matter if someone tried to copy Atari -- because this time they would not be able to get any chips produced .
“ I always played business as a game .
What a lot of people do n’t realize is that I tied - up every N - Channel manufacturer in the world , except for IBM , who had no interest in the game business .
In those days when you built with slight modifications to tie them up .
I wanted to have everybody working for me contractually .
They did not necessarily know about one another . ” lxxxviii - Nolan Bushnell
However , these projects were very costly , to the tune of $ 100,000 each per year .
To finish the Stella project , Atari needed an infusion of cash .
They had finished fiscal 1975 - 1976 with $ 3.5 Million profit on $ 39 million in sales , but with growing competition , Bushnell did not think they would have enough money to finish the project .
“ When you 're a little company , and you hear that National Semiconductor is going to build a game and that Magnavox is going to build a game , then all of a sudden you say , I 'm this little tiny ... do I have the resources ? "
You do n't realize at that time that big companies tend to be really screwed up , so that they 're sometimes really easier to beat than a good , well - tuned entrepreneurial operation . ” lxxxix - Nolan Bushnell
In the summer of 1976 , Nolan Bushnell enlisted Donald Valentine again to help raise capital for the company .
This time though , Valentine suggested Bushnell try to find someone to buy them out .
“ What happened is a growing business consumes capital at prodigious rates .
And Wall Street had a hard time distinguishing between the frivolity of our product and the fact that it was a serious business .
Raising capital was very , very difficult for us .
In order to go into the consumer marketplace , we just needed much deeper pockets , and that 's why we decided to sell .
” xc - Nolan Bushnell
About the same time Manny Gerard was hired by Warner Communications to look for ways to expand the business .
They wanted key acquisitions that would help the company move beyond its reliance on selling 7 ” singles , a product line that had been declining for a number of years .
He heard about Atari being offered for sale , and was very interested .
While negotiations are being held , Bushnell tried to keep the true “ laid - back ” nature of the company away from the Warner executives who he as sure would frown upon Atari ’s liberal attitude toward dress and drug use .
One story says that right before a surprise visit from a Warner executive , Bushnell had all the assembly line employees hide inside game cabinets for 45 minutes , so as not be seen by the Warner visitors.xci
However , no insurmountable roadblocks appeared , and by November of 1976 , Atari was sold for $ 28 million dollars , with Bushnell himself pocketing nearly $ 15 million , and Joe Keenan a sizeable sum as well .
Warner was smart enough to see something special in Bushnell , and they kept him on as Chairman and CEO , while Joe Keenan acted as president .
$ 100 million was pumped into Atari , and Stella was put into the forefront as the company 's most important project .
In a matter of a few months , one of the greatest R&D and entertainment engineering companies of its day was suddenly matched with a one of the biggest entertainment marketing companies on earth .
At the beginning , it seemed like a good marriage .
“ ... we had originally made a grocery list of 10 companies we would be willing to merge Atari with and Warner was not on that list .
But through a connection , we made contact with Warner .
We were really impressed with them , and I think they liked what they saw . ” xcii - Gene Lipkin , Atari V.P. Of Marketing
The “ creative ” atmosphere that Bushnell fostered at Atari seemed like it would match well with a company that saw much of its revenue from the music business .
If the two could find a way to stay in sync , they could prove to be an unstoppable force .
1977 Coin-ops
With all the drama on the consumer side , the coin - op division of Atari sailed into 1977 building off of Breakout and its successful microprocessor advances from 1976 .
The infusion of marketing people from Warner had an almost instant effect , as the coin division launched a monthly newsletter named “ Atari Coin Connection ” .
This monthly newsletter would act as Atari ’s official mouthpiece to amusement operators for game announcements , promotions , etc .
The downside to the influx of new marketing people into Atari was that some creative freedom got lost in the process .
The days of batting around games in a hot tub that were quickly green - lit and put into production were over .
Fierce brainstorming sessions still existed , but the days of engineering and R&D leading the charge at Atari were quickly evaporating , with the newly bolstered marketing department filling the void .
Coin - op designers like Owen R. Rubin would come up with ideas that were quickly shot down by the V.P. of marketing .
“ It happened so often , that we would have the hardware engineer add a button under the table that would cause the hardware to crash , so when the VP came into the lab , we could not show him them game .
That only worked for a while .
“ xciii - Owen R. Rubin
For the most part , the coin-ops of 1977 took few chances and built on already established concepts .
Racing contests continued to fill up much of Atari ’s 1977 coin - up lineup .
Sprint 4 and Sprint 8 ( 4 and 8 players respectively ) were multiplayer follow - ups to phenomenally successful Sprint 2 microprocessor - based racing game from 1976 , which itself was a distant cousin of Gran Trak 10 .
However , the new power of the microprocessor - based coin - ops allowed Atari ’s coin - op division to move into other types of racing games .
In June they released Drag Race , which allowed one or two players too complete in a side - view drag race , complete with detailed , animated cars .
September saw the release of Super Bug , designed by Howard Delman , a top - down , multi- directional scrolling racing game .
“ Super Bug was my first coin - operated video game .
It presented a top down view of a city street .
( Its original name was ' City Driver ' . )
The player had a fixed amount of time to drive his bright yellow ' bug ' as far as he could .
Obviously , the idea was to drive as fast as possible .
This was made difficult by sudden turns in the road , surprise oil slicks , sand traps , and parked cars . ” - Howard Delman xciv
Beyond racing games , Atari was trying to design a multitude of other games based co concepts that could not have been easily created in the pure TTL logic era .
Dominoes ( designed by Dennis Koble ) released in January , took the concept of Gremlin ’s Blockade coin - op and added a Domino theme .
Pool Shark , released in June , played a top - down game of pool , complete with realistic physics .
“ Pool Shark is an Atari game that simulates the game of Pocket Pool ( no pun intended ) on 23 ” monitor . ” - Actual introduction from Pool Shark operations and service manual
The concentration on military themed coin - ops continued unabated as well , with Destroyer in September , another game that would be mined for the VCS game Air - Sea Battle later that year ( along with Anti-Aircraft from ‘ 76 ) .
More significant was Canyon Bomber , released in November .
A strikingly different game from most in the arcade , Canyon Bomber took the basic concept of Breakout , and turned it on its head .
“ As the aircraft fly over the canyon at random speeds , players press a simple push - button control to bomb as many targets as possible without missing ” - Canyon Bomber marketing flyer
Canyon Bomber was another game by Howard Delman , one of the new crop of coin - op designers who helped bridge the gap between the TTL games of old and the new microprocessor - based games .
“ I designed the hardware and wrote the software .
The logic was still all TTL , but now the micropressor was the MOSTEK 6502 .
I wrote the code in assembly , and won a friendly bet with my supervisor by fitting the code into a single 2 K ROM .
( Take THAT Windows programers ! ) ” xcv - Howard Delman
Not quite military , but a gun-based game nonetheless , Triple Hunt , designed by Owen R. Rubin , was significant in that it was a single arcade game that could be converted into three separate light - gun games : Hit The Bear , Witch Hunt , and Raccoon Hunt .
However , one of the best selling games ( 3500 unitsxcvi ) for Atari in 1977 came in June : Starship 1 .
'' Sensors detect another quarter in your pocket , deposit it to be the captain of Starship 1 ' ' - Starship 1 message on attract screen xcvii
Starship 1 was a space combat game that used 3D perspective , and space ships that looked remarkably similar to those from Star Trek .
It was obvious though , that the mammoth success of Star Wars , released in the movie theaters just a month earlier , had an effect on the timing of Starship 1 , as the game included “ proton torpedoes ” , and allowed the player to destroy entire planets .
1977 Atari Pinball Division
Even though Atari had been making coin - op video games for 3 years , the industry itself was at a crossroads in 1975 .
The average video game was only making about $ 43 a week , which was far less than a pool table could make in the same period , and much less than the first Pong machines made .
xcviii Amusement operators were getting nervous , and Atari decided to try its hand at an age - old staple of the arcade : the pinball machine .
“ I got in because I felt there was a market for a novelty pinball .
There was a lot of innovation that pinball needed and in those days in the coin - op world you really wanted to be a full - service supplier .
There were places that just wanted pinball , period .
We knew that we had such a large market - share of video , so we felt that it would make sense to do pinball .
” xcix - Nolan Bushnell
However , Atari did not want to just make typical pinball machines .
In 1975 Atari created its Pinball Division with the hope of using the type of innovation it put into their video games for new and different types of pinball machines .
Atari needed to do this , because the margins on standard pinball games were very low .
If Atari was going to get into pinball , it would have to price their games higher than the competition , and to do this , it needed to offer something different .
“ So we had about $ 100 cost differential and the pinball machines in those days were kind of commodity priced .
I felt we could make a business , but we could not do a commodity pinball , one that looked like it was the same size , so we created these wide bodies and these various other innovations which allowed us to price them anywhere we wanted to ” c - Nolan Bushnell
After merging with Kee in ’ 75 , Gil Williams ( who had “ left ” Atari with Steve Bristow to help form Kee in the first place ) was put in charge of the new Pinball Division .
The first decision was to make the games “ solid state ” .
This meant that they would use electronics instead of the electromechanical parts of standard pinball machines .
This meant they would be cheaper to maintain , and offer video - game like features such as digital sound effects .
Starting with five employees , Williams set out to create the best solid - state pinball games ever produced .
“ You need steel balls to play Atari pins . ” ci - Gil Williams
Atari ’s first solid - state pinball game , The Atarians , was finished and test - marketed in late 1976 , after nearly 2 years in development .
Besides a solid - state design -- like all Atari pinball games , The Atarians utilized a Motorola 6800 processor -- it included a wide - body with a much larger playfield than standard pinball machines , and ball sensors under the playfield instead of switches.cii
“ The Atarians introduces a new generation of advanced coin operated amusement products .
Two years of research , planning and development and an extensive field - test program has verified strong player acceptance of the game . ” - The Atarians marketing flyer
The game was released in February 1977 to early success .
Early tests of The Atarians showed that the game drew players who usually did not play pinball games .
The Atari name was now known by the arcade - going public , and they were eager to what Atari had to offer in the pinball arena .
In December 1977 , Replay magazine cited Atari ’s entry into the pinball arena as “ clear proof that pinball is the industry ’s number one favorite .
" ciii
Two more pinball machines were released in 1977 -- Time 2000 in September , and Airborne Avenger in October .
Airborne Avenger had a playfield designed by Steve Ritchie , who would go on to design the legendary Black Knight for Williams , and was programmed by Eugene Jarvis ( creator of the Defender and Stargate video games for Williams ) .
1977 : Chuck E. Cheese
One of the more interesting ideas spawned by the engineer entertainers of Bushnell ’s Atari was The Chuck E. Cheese 's Pizza Time Theater .
The idea was spawned in about 1974 when Atari was having trouble getting games placed in the limited arcade space of the day .
In an attempt to appeal to families , Atari came up with the idea of a pizza restaurant with animatronic animals , and as large an arcade as they could build .
While families waited for their pizza , they could play Atari ’s video games .
The concept took a very long time to establish into an actual business .
It was not until May 16th , 1977 that the first Pizza Time Theater made its debut in San Jose .
“ The grand opening on May 16th was a great success .
Mayor Janet Gray
Hayes , together with many other prominent people from the community and the press , came to welcome Chuck E. Cheese and the Pizza Time Theatre to San Jose .
This new concept in family entertainment is another amusement innovation from Atari . ” - Coin Connection , June 1977
The restaurant was filled with animatronic figures developed originally at the Grass Valley Think Tank .
Besides Chuck E Cheese , they created Crusty the Cat , Jasper T. Jowels the singing dog , Pasqually the Italian chef , and a team of three singing magpies known as the Warblettes .
The brass at Warner Communications looked the other way over Chuck E. Cheese because it kept Bushnell busy as they went about discovering all the ins and out of the new company they had acquired .
“ They sort of tolerated it but they figured it was going to be something that would go away .
They did n’t understand it . ” civ - Nolan Bushnell
1977 The Home Division
Besides continuing work on Stella , Atari ’s Home Division released several products in 1977 .
The most interesting was named Atari Video Music .
Video music was designed by designed by Bob Brown , and reportedly , conceived during one the Bushnell ’s infamous offsite “ retreats ” .
“ Bob Brown had designed Video Music , our weirdest product ever .
Hook it up to your stereo and TV at the same time , and the sound triggered some pretty psychedelic visuals .
The Sears guys took one look and asked what we'd been smoking when we did that .
Naturally , one of our techs lit up a joint and showed them . "
cv - Al Alcorn
The unit was designed to be stacked with other stereo components .
RCA audio - in jacks would take a music feed , and then output a graphical pattern to a TV screen .
There were multiple patterns , and they animated according to the audio spectrum of the particular song being played .
“ We feel that Video Music will add excitement to the audio market . ” cvi - Kerry Crosson , Atari ’s manager of new consumer products
The unit made its debut at the January 1977 CES show , but never struck a chord with the public .
It was sold for about year and then discontinued .
Even though the Stella project was in full swing , several dedicated home game units were released in 1977 , including Super Pong Pro-Am ( C-200 ) , Super Pong Pro - Am Ten ( C - 202 ) , Ultra Pong ( C - 402 ( S ) ) , and Ultra Pong Doubles ( C - 402 ( D ) ) .
They also created some unique consoles that played home games other than Pong , including Video Pinball ( C- 380 ) and Stunt Cycle ( C- 450 ) .
Sears released many of these units under their own naming scheme.cvii
1977 was pretty much the end of these types of units for Atari .
Rumors have it that some time in 1978 , Atari had so many dedicated game units left unsold , that they were just going to throw them away .
Instead , they took them outside their warehouse on Borregas Street , ran them over with a semi cab , and threw them into dumpsters so no one could reuse them.cviii
1977 Video Computer System
The most important project at Atari in 1977 was the interchangeable games console , Stella .
The final version of “ Stella ” , now renamed by marketing as the Atari Video Computer System ( VCS ) contained the following :
6507 processor ( 6502 derivative ) running at 1.2 MHZ
128 bytes of RAM , 4 K bytes of ROM addressable on cartridges
TIA custom video and audio chip
6532 timer
Two controller ports that could support 8 - way joysticks with a fire button , potentiometer - based paddles , driving controllers , or keypads
The target was to support Pong and Tank !- style games .
For this they included 2 8 - bit “ player ” objects , and 3 1 - bit “ ball ” objects plus a low - resolution playfield supported in hardware .
With the millions of dollars Warner poured into the company , Atari was able to attract some of the best engineering talent around to make games for the system .
Atari put an ad out to hire programmers for the their new machine .
Larry Kaplan was one of the first to get hired , along with Alan Miller , Larry Wagner and Ed Riddle .
" I saw their ad in the Mercury News and applied for the job .
I was among 100 applicants and Bob Brown later told me they hired me because I had purchased an Altair 8800 ( the first home computer kit . " cix - Larry Kaplan
All the new programmers soon learned how difficult Stella was to program .
Programmers had to learn the quirks of the VCS to get as much power out of it as possible .
There were few objects to work with , and and very little memory , so everything had to be done on the fly .
A typical game would use the “ Vertical Blank ” ( the time between refreshes of the TV screen display ) to do collision detection , take input , compute game conditions and new graphics locations , and then use the “ Horizontal Blank ” to write everything to screen.cx
It was a complicated process that forced programmers to count the computation cycles of every instruction to make sure they could fit their code into these small intervals .
" Writing the kernels that make up the game programs , is like solving acrostic puzzles with lots and lots of possibilities .
There 's a certain class of programmer that can deal in the microcode like that .
If it were easier to program , we would n't have these programmers , because they 'd be bored .
The VCS is an absolute challenge . " cxi - Steve Mayer
“ In the early days , the extreme hardware constraints eliminated most obvious game designs .
So , game concepts had to be developed with those constraints expressly in mind .
After I came up with a concept that I thought would be fun and could be implemented , I wrote it up and discussed it with others in the group , like David Crane , Bob Whitehead , and Larry Kaplan .
” cxii - Alan Miller
The 2600 as designed was a hacker 's machine .
It was deceptively simple , but with enough “ open ” and explorable parts that more and more power would be squeezed out of it for almost 20 years .
" Most early VCS ROM carts were only 2 K bytes .
Programmers had to put tremendous effort into implementing a decent game in that small space . " cxiii - Alan Miller
To program the VCS developers had to “ unlearn ” good programming practices to get their code to fit within the bizarre hardware .
Tricks were passed around by programmers , and new programmers would have to pick them up quickly if they were going to be successful .
Joe Decuir developed the color - cycling routine of the VCS to help stop “ burn - in ” that was a complaint of the Pong systems , which also doubled as a feature in games .
“ Flicker ” ( objects flashing on the screen ) was caused by a trick that let programmers get more objects on the screen than were allowed .
Atari showed the VCS at the Summer CES in 1977 , and prepared it for release in October .
They knew that had the best product on the market , but they did not know how to inform the public of that fact .
During the manufacturing process , they ran into some problems that delayed the release of the unit .
The VCS was very difficult to produce and test .
The design required two types of screws that were difficult for assembly line workers to distinguish .
Also , the cases were created as two plastic parts that would warp if not used quickly after being manufactured .
The multiple integrated circuits and reliance on both cartridges and a television made testing the 2600 units extremely difficult .
Some supplier chips were not fast enough for production 2600 ’s , but passed inspection because they worked fine in individual unit tests -- but not when the machine was put together .
All of these things led to shipping delays and disappointed retailers .
By late November 1977 , the Atari VCS shipped to retailers , including Sears who marketed their own version named the Sears Tele - Games Video Arcade .
The system cost $ 199 and included the console , TV switchbox , two joysticks , a set of paddle controllers , and the pack - in game Combat .
Eight other games were released with the console , most of which were conversions of Atari ’s most popular coin - op games from years past .
Combat was programmed by Joe Decuir , Larry Wagner .
Larry Kaplan .
It was based on the Tank ! and Jet fighter coin-ops .
It was the perfect pack - in game for the VCS .
It displayed incredibly addictive two player action , and contained one of the best two player games ever designed , Tank Pong .
“ The first time I saw Combat on display in the local Fedmart TV section , I was blown away .
There were actual arcade games up on that screen . ”
- Anonymous Atari Fan
Air -Sea Battle was programmed by Larry Kaplan .
It was based on the Destroyer and Anti-Aircraft coin-ops .
“ Air - Sea Battle was based on an Atari coin - op called Anti-Aircraft .
In those days , we just ripped off anything we could make work .
” cxiv - Larry Kaplan
Besides engrossing two player action , Air -Sea Battle was packaged behind some of the best box - art ever created for a video game .
The art was painted by Cliff Spohn , who also painted the amazing art for Combat , Street Racer and several later games .
" Those paintings on the box detailed exactly how I felt about the games .
The graphics were so minimal at the time , the boxes formed an important part of game play experience .
When I was playing Air -Sea Battle , I was playing in that painting . "
- Anonymous Atari Fan
Video Olympics was programmed by Joe Decuir .
It included every imaginable variation of Pong .
The idea was to make any and all dedicated Pong units obsolete with this cartridge .
The game allowed 1 - 4 players , and contained many variations and was based on Atari coin - ops like Pong , Pong Doubles , Goal IV , Quadrapong and Rebound .
Street Racer was programmed by Larry Kaplan .
It contained 27 1 - 4 player top - down racing games with very basic graphics and sound .
Its saving grace was the strangely addictive “ Number Cruncher ” , where players raced to catch the biggest numbers possible .
Surround was programmed by Alan Miller in four months.cxv
It was based on the Dominos coin - op with added variations .
“ Surround was based on a game play concept implemented in several arcade games in the mid-70s , such as Atari ’s Dominos , Gremlin ’s Blockade , and Meadow ’s Bigfoot . ” cxvi - Alan Miller
Indy 500 was programmed by Ed Riddle .
It was based on the Gran Trak 10 , Gran Trak 20 , Indy 4 , Sprint , LeMans , and Crash n' Score coin - ops .
Indy 500 shipped with the “ Racing Controllers ” included in the box .
“ A total of 14 game variations enliven this auto sports cartridge .
It is priced somewhat higher than all the other early Atari releases because it includes a pair of specially designed game controllers .
” cxvii - Arnie Katz And Bill Kunkel
Also released were Star Ship programmed by Bob Whitehead and based on the Starship 1 coin - op , Blackjack programmed by Bob Whitehead , and Basic Math programmed by Gary Palmer .
The late shipments and consumer indifference led to soft sales for Christmas 1977 .
The VCS was the best selling console that season , but that did not amount to much .
By the end of the 1977 - 1978 fiscal year in June , Atari had sold most of the 400,000 units manufactured , and had sales of $ 120 million , but still lost money on the VCS.
cxviii
" People did n't know whether to spend $ 30 to $ 50 on the numerous dedicated games that were still on the shelves or slap down $ 180 for the VCS , a considerably larger expense .
” cxix - Alan Miller
The nine original cartridges were thought to stretch the Atari VCS to the limit .
Just before its release , Bushnell quickly started to work on a follow - up machine .
He , wanted to create a next - generation VCS that fixed all the limitations of the original unit .
“ In the Summer of 1977 , I went back to Grass Valley to work with Ron and Steve on the next generation machine .
” cxx - Joe Decuir
Nolan Bushnell was convinced that hardware only had a 2 - year life - span , and he wanted to make sure Atari was ready with a follow - up to the VCS as soon as possible .
However , with sluggish initial sales , the VCS had to prove itself in the marketplace first before any new consoles could be fully developed .

Former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten , the current Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush , will likely be charged with contempt by the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday this week .
“ This investigation , including the reluctant but necessary decision to move forward with contempt , has been a very deliberative process , taking care at each step to respect the Executive Branch ’s legitimate prerogatives , ”  said Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , in a statement .
“ I ’ve allowed the White House and Ms. Miers every opportunity to cooperate with this investigation , either voluntarily or under subpoena .
It is still my hope that they will reconsider this hard - line position , and cooperate with our investigation so that we can get to the bottom of this matter . ”
( Original Article )
Scientists in Southern California have discovered a mysterious booming population of endangered desert pupfish in man-made research ponds designed for an entirely different purpose .
Although no one knows exactly how they got there , the fish probably took a 1.5 - mile joyride through the piping used to deliver water to the ponds .
Last year , Douglas Barnum , a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey ’s Salton Sea Science Office , and his colleagues built four small ponds to study how ongoing changes in the Salton Sea — the largest lake in California , which is 25 percent saltier than the ocean — will affect nearby wildlife as part of the state ’s ongoing Salton Sea Restoration Project .
The Salton Sea , an important habitat for migratory birds , is slowly drying up and growing saltier .
It is also becoming tainted with selenium as it is fed by a number of rivers , including the Alamo River , contaminated by selenium from the upper Colorado basin .
The element , which may be leaching into the basin from agricultural sites , can be toxic to wildlife , especially as it accumulates through the food chain .
“ The birds are potentially eating a very toxic time bomb , ” Barnum told LiveScience .
To study how birds respond to the growing selenium levels as well as the changes in salinity , the scientists created man-made ponds , mixing the salty water from the Salton Sea with water from the nearby freshwater Alamo River to create a series of four ponds of varying salinity , all slightly contaminated by selenium .
The plan was to study how bird populations respond to the different ponds , which are all carefully filled so as to prevent fish and other wildlife from being pumped in too .
The water first travels through a trench with a rock barrier and then continues through one and a half miles of piping until reaching the ponds .
It was therefore surprising when Barnum and his colleagues noticed a number of larger fish swimming around in the ponds this year .
They assumed that all of the fish were a common species known as tilapia and that they had somehow survived the long trip from the lake or river to the ponds .
But when they started doing some maintenance work a few weeks ago , they “ noticed something that was a little bit odd , ” Barnum said .
They saw smaller fish in the ponds , too .
“ These were not Tilapia , and they did n’t look like anything else we had seen , ” Barnum said .
The tiny fish , they discovered , were actually endangered desert pupfish — populations of which have declined over the course of the past few decades thanks to a loss of habitat and changes in environmental conditions , such as dam - building , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
The scientists estimate that there are thousands of these endangered fish living in the research ponds , although most of them are young , and no one knows how many will survive into adulthood .
They also are n’t sure whether the pupfish are coming from the Salton Sea or the Alamo River , but it ’s likely that they somehow made it through the rock barriers and made the voyage through the piping .
Young pupfish are smaller than a fingernail , so “ they may be able to make it through the cracks in the rocks , ” said Barnum .
“ It does n’t sound possible , but who knows . ”
He added that it only takes two pupfish — a male and a female — to start a population .
While it could be that pupfish are more prevalent in California ’s rivers and lakes than anyone realized , it may also be that a few brave individuals just happened to make it to the ponds and , upon their arrival , mated like mad .
This exciting windfall has prompted the scientists to try to broaden their research goals to include studies of the elusive pupfish as part of their project .
“ Let ’s take advantage of this golden opportunity to learn something about this endangered species , ” said Barnum .
Man Sexually Assaulted in Pakistan After Refusing to Convert to Islam
Lawyers in Pakistan are investigating a report that up to 30 men tortured and gang - raped a young Christian man for refusing to convert to Islam .
The victim is seriously injured and unable to move , Release International 's partner in Pakistan has reported .
However , according to the Centre for Legal Aid Assistance and Settlement ( CLAAS ) the police are keeping him locked up and have denied him medical treatment .
The police are also refusing to register the rape following a counter - claim made by his principal attacker - " a man of influence " , Release International has told Christian Today .
According to CLAAS , the Christian was invited to a game of cricket .
A quarrel broke out and he was beaten up .
Later that evening , the father of one of the Muslims asked the Christian over to his house .
Joseph Francis , the National Director of CLAAS , explained : " When he entered the drawing room , he found it filled with unknown people .
They began to beat him severely .
They threatened him with dire consequences if he did not accept Islam .
After his refusal , they committed sodomy with him one by one for the whole night . "
Francis said that they later threw their victim out on the street unconscious .
CLAAS has visited the victim and his family .
They believe the counter accusation that he stole money and a mobile phone is false .
They say the charges were drawn up by the attacker , who has used his influence to put pressure on the authorities .
" We 're deeply concerned about the growing number of attacks against Christians in Pakistan , " says Release International 's CEO Andy Dipper .
" We are receiving reports of rape , abductions and forced conversion .
Pakistan is becoming an increasingly difficult place for Christians to live .
" To make matters worse , the government is pushing through a law which could impose the death penalty for any Muslim man who converts to Christianity - and life imprisonment for any woman . "
" As well as being an attack on the basic human rights of Muslims , this will also make things harder for Christians who preach the gospel , " concluded Dipper .
Release International is appealing to Christians to pray for the victim and for the lawyers at CLAAS , who are dealing with a growing number of atrocities against Christians .

It is one of the rarest and most magical sights in the natural world .
A bottlenose dolphin goes into labour . . . then a calf emerges , tail first .
Mother guides baby gently to the surface , where they swim together for the first time .
Very few dolphin births have been captured on film in such astonishing detail .
Scroll down for more ...
This one was recorded at a wildlife park pool in Rimini , Italy , where photographer Leandro Stanzani was in exactly the right place at the right time .
" To take good pictures is not easy , " said Mr Stanzani , who has been taking photos of dolphins for 14 years .
" Most births happen during the night when the light is very poor .
Scroll down for more ...
" Sometimes dolphins prefer to stay far away from windows .
Sometimes water quality is poor .
" This time I was extremely lucky .
It was daytime first of all .
There were three photographers , one at each of the three underwater windows - and I was at the right one !
" The others could n't even see the event . "

A recent study of our team on how to better our Windows XP systems comissioned to create an eBook on the subject for the main team at MPortela led us to investigate a countless number of details on how to better your performance and machine .
Some of the working tweaks you can do to your Windows XP can really be a blessing to your system ’s speed .
So I thought about sharing with you the safe tweaks on how to have a faster Windows XP .
As a disclaimer do the following tweaks at your own risk , however they were all tested and are in use by most of our team members and friends .
A. DISABLE INDEXING SERVICES
Indexing Services is a small little program that uses large amounts of RAM and can often make a computer endlessly loud and noisy .
This system process indexes and updates lists of all the files that are on your computer .
It does this so that when you do a search for something on your computer , it will search faster by scanning the index lists .
If you do n’t search your computer often , or even if you do search often , this system service is completely unnecessary .
To disable do the following :
1. Go to Start
2. Click Settings
3. Click Control Panel
4. Double - click Add / Remove Programs
5. Click the Add / Remove Window Components
6. Uncheck the Indexing services
7. Click Next
B. OPTIMISE DISPLAY SETTINGS
Windows XP can look sexy but displaying all the visual items can waste system resources .
To optimise :
1.Go to Start
2. Click Settings
3. Click Control Panel
4. Click System
5. Click Advanced tab
6 . In the Performance tab click Settings
7 . Leave only the following ticked :
- Show shadows under menus
- Show shadows under mouse pointer
- Show translucent selection rectangle
- Use drop shadows for icons labels on the desktop
- Use visual styles on windows and buttons
C. SPEEDUP FOLDER BROWSING
You may have noticed that everytime you open my computer to browse folders that there is a slight delay .
This is because Windows XP automatically searches for network files and printers everytime you open Windows Explorer .
To fix this and to increase browsing significantly :
1. Open My Computer
2. Click on Tools menu
3. Click on Folder Options
4. Click on the View tab .
5 . Uncheck the Automatically search for network folders and printers check box
6. Click Apply
7. Click Ok
8. Reboot your computer
D. IMPROVE MEMORY USAGE
Cacheman Improves the performance of your computer by optimizing the disk cache , memory and a number of other settings .
NOTE : This program is shareware and some features require activation .
Once Installed :
1.Go to Show Wizard and select All
2.Run all the wizards by selecting Next or Finished until you are back to the main menu .
Use the defaults unless you know exactly what you are doing .
3.Exit and Save Cacheman
4.Restart Windows
E. OPTIMISE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION
There are lots of ways to do this but by far the easiest is to run TCP / IP Optimizer .
1. Download and install
2. Click the General Settings tab and select your Connection Speed ( Kbps )
3. Click Network Adapter and choose the interface you use to connect to the Internet
4. Check Optimal Settings then Apply
5. Reboot
F. OPTIMISE YOUR PAGEFILE
If you give your pagefile a fixed size it saves the operating system from needing to resize the page file .
1. Right click on My Computer and select Properties
2. Select the Advanced tab
3. Under Performance choose the Settings button
4. Select the Advanced tab again and under Virtual Memory select Change
5 . Highlight the drive containing your page file and make the initial Size of the file the same as the Maximum Size of the file .
Windows XP sizes the page file to about 1.5X the amount of actual physical memory by default .
While this is good for systems with smaller amounts of memory ( under 512 MB ) it is unlikely that a typical XP desktop system will ever need 1.5 X 512MB or more of virtual memory .
If you have less than 512MB of memory , leave the page file at its default size .
If you have 512MB or more , change the ratio to 1:1 page file size to physical memory size .
G. SPEEDUP FOLDER ACCESS - DISABLE LAST ACCESS UPDATE
If you have a lot of folders and subdirectories on your computer , when you access a directory XP wastes a lot of time updating the time stamp showing the last access time for that directory and for ALL sub directories .
To stop XP doing this you need to edit the registry .
If you are uncomfortable doing this then please do not attempt .
1. Go to Start and then Run and type “ regedit ”
2. Click through the file system until you get to “ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem ”
3. Right - click in a blank area of the window on the right and select ‘ DWORD Value ’
4. Create a new DWORD Value called ‘ NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate ’
5 . Then Right click on the new value and select ‘ Modify ’
6. Change the Value Data to ‘ 1 ′
7. Click ‘ OK ’
H. MAKE YOUR MENUS LOAD FASTER
This is one of my favourite tweaks as it makes a huge difference to how fast your machine will ‘ feel ’ .
What this tweak does is remove the slight delay between clicking on a menu and XP displaying the menu .
1. Go to Start then Run
2. Type ‘ Regedit ’ then click ‘ Ok ’
3. Find “ HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop \ ”
4. Select “ MenuShowDelay ”
5 . Right click and select “ Modify ’
6 . Reduce the number to around “ 100 ″
7 . This is the delay time before a menu is opened .
You can set it to “ 0 ″ but it can make windows really hard to use as menus will open if you just look at them - well move your mouse over them anyway .
I tend to go for anywhere between 50 - 150 depending on my mood
I. IMPROVE XP SHUTDOWN SPEED
This tweak reduces the time XP waits before automatically closing any running programs when you give it the command to shutdown .
1. Go to Start then select Run
2. Type ‘ Regedit ’ and click ok
3. Find ‘ HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Control Panel\Desktop\’
4. Select ‘ WaitToKillAppTimeout ’
5 . Right click and select ‘ Modify ’
6 . Change the value to ‘ 1000 ′
7. Click ‘ OK ’
8. Now select ‘ HungAppTimeout ’
9 . Right click and select ‘ Modify ’
10 . Change the value to ‘ 1000 ′
11 . Click ‘ OK ’
12 . Now find ‘ HKEY_USERS \ .DEFAULT \Control Panel\Desktop ’
13 . Select ‘ WaitToKillAppTimeout ’
14 . Right click and select ‘ Modify ’
15 . Change the value to ‘ 1000 ′
16 . Click ‘ OK ’
17 . Now find ‘ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ System\CurrentControlSet\Control\’
18 . Select ‘ WaitToKillServiceTimeout ’
19 .
Right click and select ‘ Modify ’
20 . Change the value to ‘ 1000 ′
21 . Click ‘ OK ’
J. IMPROVE SWAPFILE PERFORMANCE
If you have more than 256MB of RAM this tweak will considerably improve your performance .
It basically makes sure that your PC uses every last drop of memory ( faster than swap file ) before it starts using the swap file .
1. Go to Start then Run
2. Type “ msconfig.exe ” then ok
3. Click on the System.ini tab
4. Expand the 386enh tab by clicking on the plus sign
5 . Click on new then in the blank box type ” ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 ″
6. Click OK
7. Restart PC
K. ENSURE XP IS USING DMA MODE
XP enables DMA for Hard - Drives and CD - Roms by default on most ATA or ATAPI ( IDE ) devices .
However , sometimes computers switch to PIO mode which is slower for data transfer - a typical reason is because of a virus .
To ensure that your machine is using DMA :
1. Open ‘ Device Manager ’
2. Double - click ‘ IDE ATA / ATAPI Controllers ’
3. Right - click ‘ Primary Channel ’ and select ‘ Properties ’ and then ‘ Advanced Settings ’
4 . In the ‘ Current Transfer Mode ’ drop - down box , select ‘ DMA if Available ’ if the current setting is ‘ PIO Only ’

The creature has been dubbed a " furry kite "
Colugos are the " sisters " of primates , sharing a common ancestor some 80 million years ago when dinosaurs had their heyday , say US scientists .
Until now , many experts thought tree shrews were closer to primates .
Writing in Science , the team calls for urgent action to decipher the full genome sequence of colugos .
Colugos are known colloquially as flying lemurs ; despite this they do not fly and they are not true lemurs .
Bat - like in appearance , and the size of a large squirrel , they use a special fold of skin to glide from tree to tree in tropical rainforests .
Rare mutations
An international team took a two - pronged approach to investigating the evolutionary origins of these shy , nocturnal tree - dwellers .
This study resolves a long - standing question on who the closest relative of primates was
Dr William Murphy
After comparing the three groups to about 30 other mammal species , they found that primates and colugos shared seven genetic changes that were very rare in other mammals .
In the second study , researchers used computer programs to search for similarities and differences in 13,000 DNA building blocks from five close animal groups - primates , the colugo family , tree - shrews , rodents and the order that includes hares and rabbits .
The research revealed that colugos and primates are more closely related than tree shrews and primates , solving a decade - long debate .
Colugos were once thought close to the ancestors of bats
" This study resolves a long - standing question to primatologists and mammalologists on who the closest relative of primates was , " co-author William J Murphy of Texas A&M University told BBC News .
" This will help us better interpret early primate evolution and those changes at the DNA level and in skeletal appearance that led to modern primates and ultimately to the human lineage itself . "
The research team wants this new knowledge to be used to ensure that colugos have their full genome sequenced rather than only a less complete " draft " sequence as planned .

Closing words
With all the buzz about E8 recently I want to give an introduction to it that 's pitched slightly higher than pop science books , but that does n't assume more than some basic knowledge of geometry and vectors and a vague idea of what calculus is .
There 's a lot of ground to cover and so I can't possibly tell the truth exactly as it is without some simplification .
But I 'm going to try to be guilty of sins of omission rather than telling outright lies .
Consider a perfect cube .
If you turn it upside - down it still looks just like a cube in exactly the same configuration .
Rotate it through 90 degrees about any axis going through the centre of a face and it looks the same .
Rotate it through 120 degrees around a diagonal axis and it also looks the same .
In fact there are 24 different rotations , including simply doing nothing , that you can perform on a cube , that leave it looking how you started .
( Exercise : show it 's 24 . ) These 24 operations form the symmetries of the cube .
Note how you can take any pair of symmetries and combine them to make another symmetry simply by applying one and then another .
For example , if A represents rotation by 90° about the x-axis and B represents a rotation by 180° about the same axis then we can use shorthand to write AB to mean a rotation by 270° .
The convention is that we read from right to left and so AB means " do B first , then A " .
If we define C=AB think about what AC means .
It 's a 270°+90° rotation , ie .
a 360° rotation which does nothing .
The convention is to call that 1 .
So C is the opposite or inverse of A because AC=CA=1 .
When you have a bunch of operations that you can combine like this , and every operation has an inverse , then the operations form what mathematicians call a .
The 24 symmetries of the cube form a group of size 24 .
Although you can think of a group as a bunch of operations on something , you can also think of a group as a thing in its own right , independent of the thing it acts on .
For example , we can write down some rules about A , B and C above .
AC=CA=1 , C=AB , AAB=1 , BB=1 , C1=1C=C and so on .
In principle we can give a single letter name name to each of the 24 symmetries and write out a complete set of rules about how to combine them .
At that point we do n't need the cube any more , we can just consider our 24 letters , with their rules , to be an object of interest in its own right .
We can think of the group as acting on the cube , but if we specified some suitable rules , we can make this group act on other things too .
For example , we can use the coordinates ( x , y,z ) to specifiy any point in space .
We used B to mean a 180 degree rotation around the x-axis .
If we apply that rotation to any point in space ( x , y, z ) it gets mapped to ( x , -y , - z ) .
Similary A maps the point ( x , y, z ) to ( x , z , -y ) .
So the the 24 element cube group also acts on 3D space .
This is an example of a , and I 'll get onto that later .
( So far I 've been talking about rotations we can perform on the cube .
But imagine you could also reflect the cube - as if looking at the cube in a mirror and then pulling the reflection back out into the real world .
You can't do this with a real cube but you could with an imaginary one .
How many symmetries do you think you get now ? )
With the cube example above , all of our rotations had to be multiples of certain angles like 90° and 120° .
Any kind of rotation through an angle like 37° leaves the cube in a weird orientation that does n't look like the original .
So the symmetries of the cube form a discrete group because there 's only a discrete set of possibilities .
But there are also continuous groups where you can smoothly slide from one symmetry to another and everything in - between is also a symmetry .
For example consider a perfect 3D sphere at the origin .
You can rotate it through any angle and it still looks like the same sphere .
Any rotation about the origin is a symmetry of the sphere , and given two symmetries you can slide from one to the other .
At every stage , the sphere will still look like the original sphere .
Like in the discrete case , this set of symmetries forms a group , because you can combine and invert operations .
But there are now infinitely many operations .
We can rotate around any axis by any angle we choose and it 's still a sphere .
But even though there is an infinity of such rotations , it 's still manageable .
In fact , any rotation can be described by three parameters , for example the three that aeronautical engineers might use called pitch , roll and yaw .
Mathematicians call the group of 3D rotations SO ( 3 ) .
That 3 refers to the fact that we 're talking about rotations of 3 - dimensional space .
But because it takes three parameters to describe a rotation , SO ( 3 ) is itself 3 - dimensional .
This double appearance of the number 3 is a ' coincidence ' , as we 'll see in the next section .
There 's one more thing I need to add about continuous groups .
Some are also differentiable .
You do n't need to worry in too much detail about what this means but it ultimately says that we can do calculus with these groups .
For example , we can ask questions not only about the orientation of a sphere , but also about the rate of change of its orientation .
So SO ( 3 ) is a differentiable group .
The usual name for these is , after the mathematician Sophus Lie SO ( 3 ) is the group of 3D rotations .
But all of the 24 symmetries of the cube we considered are also rotations .
So the cube is actually a subset of SO ( 3 ) .
And as it's a subset of a group that 's also a group , we call it aNow consider the set of all rotations we could perform on a 2D space .
These also form a group .
In fact , given an element of this group we can apply it to some text to rotate it in 2D .
As above , use 1 to mean " no rotation " , use A to mean " rotate 45° anticlockwise " and B to mean " rotate 45° clockwise " .
We can illustrate how these act on Hello :
If you 've ever playing with a drawing package , like the one I just used , this will all be very familiar .
And it should also be obvious that 1=11111=AB=BA=AAAAAAAA=BBBBBBBB .
( Note how I 'm only talking about the orientation of the word .
If we were taking into account the position of the word on the page it'd be more complex .
But there would still be a group describing it . )
Although the screen the text Hello is on is flat and two - dimensional , it can be considered to be embedded in the 3D space around it .
And all of the 2D rotations can be considered to be 3D rotations also , just 3D rotations that happen to be oriented along the axis pointing straight into the screen .
So 2D rotations can be considered to be particular 3D rotations and and SO ( 2 ) is a subgroup of SO ( 3 ) .
Note that 2D rotations can be described by just a single number , the rotation angle .
So SO ( 2 ) is 1 - dimensional , even though it 's defined through its effect on a 2D space .
The two threes that appear in connection with SO ( 3 ) above really are a coincidence .
In 4 - dimensions we have SO ( 4 ) which is actually a 6 - dimensional group .
In 4D you need 6 numbers like pitch , roll and yaw to define your orientation .
But I 'm not asking you to try to visualise that now .
Imagine a sphere tumbling around .
At any moment its orientation in space can be described by an element of SO ( 3 ) .
So we might naturally be led to ask the question " what is its rate of change of orientation ? " .
What would such an answer look like ?
Let 's review basic calculus first .
Consider position instead of orientation .
Suppose a vehicle is driving along a road .
At time t it 's at distance A and at time t+1s it 's at distance B .
Then its average velocity over the 1s is ( B - A ) / 1s .
But that 's an average over a period .
What 's its velocity exactly at time t?
We could compute its distance , say C , at time t+0.0001s , and compute ( C- A)/0.0001s .
But that 's still an average over a short period of time .
The tool for telling us about instantaneous rates of change is calculus , and here it tells us that if the motion is continuous we can take a limit .
So if at time t+d , its position is given by D , then the velocity is the limit , as d tends to zero , of ( D - A ) / d. Back to the tumbling sphere .
We could say " at time t it has orientation A and time t+1s it has orientation B " .
But as with velocity , that tells you what happened between t and t+1s , not what it was doing at any instant .
We have n't said what the rate of change is precisely at time t.
Imagine we take some kind of limit of the above statement as we consider the change from time t to time t+d where d becomes arbitrarily small .
One thing we can say is that if the motion is continuous then the start and finish orientations , say A and D , will become arbitrarily close .
The difference between them will be an infnitesimally small rotation .
You can describe an infinitesimally small rotation by an infinitesimally small vector : let the direction of the vector be the axis of rotation and its length be the angle of rotation .
Suppose this vector is V .
Then the rate of change of orientation is V/d .
This is commonly known as angular velocity and it's a vector .
Note that it's not an infinitesimally small vector because the small V and small d will usually cancel to give a nice finite size angular velocity , just as the ordinary velocity calculation above gives a finite answer .
In fact , we can easily interpret the angular velocity vector .
Its direction is the axis of rotation and its length is the rate of change of angle around that axis ( in degrees per second for example ) .
At this point you might say " why not represent any angle by a vector , not just an infinitesimal one " .
For example , you might think v=( 180°,0,0 ) could be used to mean a rotation through 180° around the x-axis .
You can do that if you like , but this does n't resepct the additive properties of vectors .
For example , it'd be useful if v+v= ( 360°,0,0 ) then represented " no rotation " because a 360° rotation is no rotation at all .
But " no rotation " should be represented by ( 0,0,0 ) .
So this is n't a very convenient way to talk about rotations .
But rates of change of orientation are different .
If we define w=( 180°/s,0,0 ) then w represents rotation around the x -axis at one revolution every two seconds .
w+w=( 360°/s,0,0 ) is also a perfectly good angular velocity , one that 's twice as fast .
Unlike angles , angular velocities do n't wrap around when you get to 360° .
You can crank angular velocities up as high as you like .
So vectors are a good way to represent rates of change of orientation , even if they 're not good at representing orientations .
Let 's do this in 2D .
It 's much easier .
All rotations are in the plane and so we do n't need to specify an axis .
We just need to specify a single number to define an orientation , and a rate of change of orientation is just given by a single number also .
That one number can be thought of as a 1 - dimensional vector .
So what kind of thing is this rate of change object ?
In each case it can be thought of as a vector ( in the case of SO ( 2 ) it's a 1 - dimensional vector ) , but it 's not an element of the group because an angular velocity is not the same thing as an orientation .
Mathematically it 's called an element of a Lie algebra .
Theof a Lie group is the set of vectors that describe rates of change of elements of the group .
I mentioned above that SO ( 4 ) is 6 - dimensional .
This means that the Lie algebra is made of 6 - dimensional vectors .
You can think of the 6 components of these vectors as describing how the 6 generalised pitch , roll and yaw parameters vary over time .
There 's a convention that we use lower case names for Lie algebras .
So the Lie algebra of SO ( 3 ) is called so ( 3 ) .
That makes a sort of intuitive sense , so ( 3 ) describes really small rotations and SO ( 3 ) describes full - sized ones .
That brings me close to the end of Part 1 .
But I can now say one very important thing .
There are a number of things that mathematicians call E8 , but one of them is a Lie algebra .
And that 's the thing that Garrett Lisi is talking about PS I welcome feedback from anyone .
I want to make this as understandable to as many people as possible .

Nation Analysis says war could cost $ 1 trillion Budget office sees effect on taxpayers for decade WASHINGTON --
The war in Iraq could ultimately cost well over a trillion dollars -- at least double what has already been spent -- including the long - term costs of replacing damaged equipment , caring for wounded troops , and aiding the Iraqi government , according to a new government analysis .
The United States has already allocated more than $ 500 billion on the day - to - day combat operations of what are now 190,000 troops and a variety of reconstruction efforts .
In a report to lawmakers yesterday , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that even under the rosiest scenario -- an immediate and substantial reduction of troops -- American taxpayers will feel the financial consequences of the war for at least a decade .
The calculations include the estimated cost to leave some US forces behind for at least several years to support the Iraqi government , but they also predict other long - term costs , such as extended medical care and disability compensation for wounded soldiers and survivor 's benefits for the families of the thousands of combat - zone fatalities .
The cost of the war in Iraq and other military operations has soared to the point where " we are now spending on these activities more than 10 percent of all the government 's annually appropriated funds , " said Robert A. Sunshine , the budget office 's assistant director for budget analysis .
Those costs -- both to sustain the current mission in Iraq and to pay longer - term " hidden " expenses like troop healthcare and replacement equipment -- are far more than US officials advertised when Congress gave President Bush the authority to launch the invasion in March 2003 .
At the time , the White House and then - defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld predicted a quick , decisive victory and counted on Iraqi oil revenues to pay for the war .
And when Lawrence Lindsey , one of Bush 's top budget advisers , estimated in 2003 that the entire undertaking could cost as much as $ 200 billion , he was fired .
Even that estimate -- which the Bush administration described at the time as far too high -- was still well off the mark .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as of June , up to $ 500 billion has been spent on combat operations in Iraq .
In the coming years , the price tag will be substantially higher .
Testifying before the House Budget Committee yesterday , Sunshine told lawmakers that he used two scenarios -- an optimistic one in which most US troops are withdrawn , and another in which a sizable contingent remains for several years -- to calculate anticipated costs .
If the United States gradually reduced its troop level in Iraq to 30,000 by 2010 , the US Treasury would still have to provide up to $ 500 billion more to sustain those troops , as well as pay other expenses , he said in the report .
In the alternative scenario -- in which 75,000 US troops remain stationed in Iraq over the next five years -- the nation would have to pay an additional $ 900 billion , according to the analysis .
Members of Congress welcomed the report , noting that the Pentagon has requested only annual expenditures and has refused to provide long - term estimates .
When the committee yesterday asked Gordon England , deputy secretary of defense , whether he agreed with the estimates , he maintained that " we do n't have that degree of certainty " about the future costs of the war .
Representative John Spratt a South Carolina Democrat and the Budget Committee chairman , responded that the budget office numbers are " an extrapolation from existing costs .
And we 've got five years of experience , so they 're . . . not building an assumption out of the air .
They 're extrapolating from known costs to what future costs are likely to be at certain force levels . "
Some of the future costs will be incurred long after major combat operations end , according to the report .
The 16 - page analysis estimated that the medical costs would be more than $ 9 billion if the United States stations 30,000 troops in Iraq , and would cost almost $ 13 billion if 75,000 troops remain there for the next several years .
The report estimates that training police and ground forces in Iraq and a relatively smaller number in Afghanistan over the next decade will require at least an additional $ 50 billion .
Meanwhile , the government will have to spend at least $ 20 billion more for US diplomatic operations , to assist local governments , and to promote economic development in Iraq through 2017 -- regardless of how many US troops remain in the country .
Lawmakers expressed concern that the White House is not adequately preparing the country for the financial burden .
Representative James P. McGovern , a Worcester Democrat and a member of the budget panel , said that England could n't give a firm answer when asked how much the Pentagon needed to pay for Bush 's decision to dispatch 30,000 more troops to secure Iraq earlier this year .
England said the costs the Pentagon anticipated a few months ago for military operations in fiscal year 2008 -- about $ 142 billion -- will no longer be enough .
The military will need more money because of the " surge " and the purchase of hundreds of armored vehicles capable of withstanding the roadside bombs responsible for most of the US combat deaths .
England said the Pentagon will provide a revised 2008 cost estimate in September .
But McGovern said he is worried about the long - term financial impact of the war , adding that his primary concern is that the United States is borrowing money to pay for it .
Some leading economists have predicted that , depending on how long troops remain in Iraq , the endeavor could reach several trillion dollars as a result of more " hidden " costs -- including recruiting expenses to replenish the ranks and the lifelong benefits the government pays to veterans .
" It is being paid for on the national credit card , " McGovern said .
" It is being put on their backs of our kids and grandkids .
That is indefensible . "
McGovern said he is considering proposing that a " war tax " be levied on all Americans to cover the ballooning expenses .
" We should find a way to pay for it so that when this war is over we are not bankrupt , " he said .

The court ruled the mother and child should remain anonymous
The Court of Appeal ruling came after a county court ordered the 20 - year - old to tell both her parents and the father .
The three appeal judges agreed " the ultimate veto " over who is told about the birth lay with the mother .
Fathers ' groups said the ruling treated the child as the property of the mother " to be disposed of as she sees fit " .
The woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , also kept the pregnancy hidden from her family .
No access
She said she wanted the baby girl , who is now 19 weeks old , adopted at birth without the knowledge of either them or her father .
HAVE YOUR SAY
So I presume the mother will expect the state to be paying for the childs upkeep , instead of the father !
Jon , UK
Send us your comments
A legal guardian and a local authority made the county court application to ensure the father and the woman 's parents were told about the child .
But the Court of Appeal ordered the local authority not to take any action to inform the father .
They also prevented the local authority from taking any steps to allow the girl to meet any of her mother 's family in order that they be assessed as potential carers .
The judge said the mother became pregnant when she was 19 , and as she lived on her own , kept it secret from her divorced parents who she did not think would provide a good home for the baby .
Lady Justice Arden said the father 's rights had not been violated because he did not have any to violate .
It is now clear that the Government believes children have no entitlement to a relationship with their fathers
Michael Cox , Fathers 4 Justice
John Baker , chairman of Families Need Fathers , said " It treats the child as the property of the mother , to be disposed of as she sees fit . "
He said the ruling , taken in conjunction with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill which could remove the requirement for IVF clinics to recognise the need of a father , was " intensely worrying " .
He said : " A strong message seems to be sent that makes fathers redundant in the upbringing of children . "
' Ultimate veto '
Fathers 4 Justice barrister Michael Cox said : " This father is the victim of a wicked deceit in which the State has been complicit .
" It is now clear that the Government believes children have no entitlement to a relationship with their fathers and that children are the property of their mothers and of the State . "
Lord Justice
Thorpe said : " The law improves the opportunity of the child of anonymous birth to search out its biological origin .
" However , the ultimate veto remains with the mother .
Registers of information are in place to lead the searching child to the mother 's door but the child has no right of entry if the mother , despite counselling , refuses to unlock it . "
That message recall function ?
It does n’t work .
No , really .
It just compounds the error .
When you send me an email by mistake , and try to recall it , I get
the original message , followed by
another message , saying , ‘ Joe Bloggs would like to recall the message , “ Blah ” . ’
And then I scrutinise the original message .
I ’m like that .
LOS ANGELES , Aug. 31 -- Stonewalling by the Veterans Administration is putting U.S. cancer surveillance and research in jeopardy , according to many of the researchers involved in those fields .
After decades of sharing data freely and allowing researchers to get in touch with its patients , the agency has been blocking such activity for the past several years , according to Dennis Deapen , Dr. PH. , of the Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program and the University of Southern California .
The result , Dr. Deapen said , is that California state data on cancer incidence rates are being skewed .
And that , he said , is likely to have serious effects on national data .
The California Cancer Surveillance Program has seen a sharp drop in the agency 's reporting of new cases to Californian cancer registries beginning in late 2004 -- from 3,000 cases in 2003 to almost none by the end of 2005 , according to an article in the September issue of Lancet Oncology .
But the problem is not restricted to California , according to Holly Howe , Ph.D. , of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries ( NAACCR ) in Springfield , Ill .
" California has been very energetic in evaluating the impact of the loss of VA cases on completeness and the ability to produce accurate incidence data , " Dr. Howe said .
" But it 's not just California -- it 's nearly every state , " she said .
However , California and Florida -- where VA reporting of cancer cases has also been blocked -- have large populations of veterans and large VA medical facilities , she said .
Missing data from those two states has the potential to warp national estimates , she said .
Lancet Oncology quoted Raye Ann Dorn , the VA 's national coordinator of cancer programs , as saying that only California and Florida were withholding data , mainly because of privacy concerns .
Dorn was not immediately available for comment on the eve of the Labor Day weekend .
Lancet Oncology said other VA officials pointed out that of the 130 medical centers that collect cancer data , only 29 withheld cases from state cancer registries in 2006 .
But the journal also said that , according to CDC data , VA centers in seven states are not reporting cancer cases and in six others , at least one VA facility is not reporting .
All told , " 40 000 to 70 000 cases are potentially missed nationally each year , " the journal quoted a CDC spokesman .
Dr. Howe said her organization and others have been trying to persuade the VA to resume wholehearted data - sharing , but with little success .
" We 've been trying to solve this for over five years , " she said .
Asked if she knows what 's behind the policy , Dr. Howe said flatly : " No . "
Representatives of a " whole cadre of associations " -- including NAACCR , the CDC , the American Cancer Society , and the National Cancer Institute -- met in early August to discuss the issue , Dr. Deapen said .
He said the VA position has two main effects .
The skewing of national and state cancer incidence rates , he said , is " correctable . "
" The VA still has the data , " he said .
" They could hand it out and then we could correct incidence rate data . "
What is " incorrectable , " he said , is the effect the data blockade could have on research .
Dr. Deapen said , for example , that researchers investigating the causes of a particular type of cancer might be misled if they were not aware of a cluster of cases being treated in VA hospitals .
" Once that study is done , ( the researcher ) does n't get to go back and do it over , " Dr. Deapen said .
Research during this period " will forever require an asterisk " to remind other researchers that it might not be correct .
But even when states get VA data , some cases may slip through the cracks under a related VA policy that forbids interstate data - sharing , he said .
For instance , he said , it 's common for veterans in some eastern states to seek treatment in neighboring states .
The host state does n't count them , because they live next door .
And the VA refuses to notify the home state or let the host state do so , so that some cases are simply never counted , Dr. Deapen said .
Several of the cancer registries that are being locked out of VA data take part in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER ) program , according to Brenda Edwards , Ph.D. , of the National Cancer Institute , which operates the database , a valued resource for epidemiological research .
" This will significantly impact reporting in SEER , " Dr. Edwards told Lancet Oncology .
The collection of disease incidence data is a state responsibility , Dr. Deapen said , but the VA -- as a federal agency -- is under no obligation to comply with state laws .
Nonetheless , for years the VA voluntarily shared its data and allowed access to patients , he said .
" We had it right and we were doing a good job , " Dr. Deapen said .
" Now we need to get back on track . "
THE number of NYPD cops using drugs , stealing property – even from the dead – and committing other acts of corruption , including extorting sex from female suspects , spiked sharply last year , according to a confidential NYPD report .
The astonishing wrongdoing in cluded everything from cops solicit ing sex in exchange for overlooking crimes to stealing credit cards from the homes of dead people to hiring a hit man to commit murder .
The tawdry tales include stories of cops not only betraying their badges , but also their brother and sister officers in blue .
In one case , two cops allegedly disclosed the identity of an undercover officer who came into a restaurant while they were bartering for sex with a woman they had once arrested .
In another case , two Manhattan cops were caught looting money from a precinct house ’s kitty that included cash collected from T - shirt sales for the cancer - stricken daughter of yet another cop .
“ It was ugly , ” a source said .
In yet another incident , a cop teamed up with a “ police impersonation ” robbery ring after she could not find another corrupt cop to work with the gang .
And then there was an officer who hung out with drug dealers who also made “ friendly ” bets on sports events – with the payoff in marijuana .
The revelations contained in the NYPD ’s Internal Affairs Bureau 2006 Annual Report – obtained by The Post – include :
* Arrests of New York ’s Finest rose 25 percent in 2006 over the previous year , from 91 to 114 .
* The number of cops caught using drugs last year jumped 138 percent , from eight incidents the previous year to 19 , including one cop using PCP ( phencyclidine ) , and another shooting steroids into his butt .
* Fraud allegations involving insurance , credit card and welfare swindles rose 85 percent to 50 complaints from 27 the previous year .
* The number of cops stripped of their guns and badges and placed on modified duty jumped 55 percent , from 137 to 212 , but suspensions fell 11 percent from 159 to 142 .
The Post pieced together the accounts using sources , court records and district attorneys ’ offices , along with the tightly guarded annual IAB study .
For its part , the NYPD insisted The Post submit in writing its requests for specific case information and names of fired or disciplined cops , which the newspaper did on Aug. 14 .
Since then , follow - up reminders , in person and via e-mail , have fallen on deaf ears .
The IAB states that cops accused of stealing property made up 34 percent of the 1,057 corruption cases launched last year – with 357 thefts reported , an 8.5 percent jump over the previous year ’s 329 cases .
Among them were two cops at a Manhattan precinct who handled thousands of dollars collected from T - shirt sales and vending - machine proceeds for their stationhouse “ club . ”
Investigators determined the duo skimmed about $ 4,000 from the club ’s bank account , purchasing tires for their cars , paying Internet hookup fees and cellphone bills .
Adding insult to injury , the sources said , some of the stolen cash was raised to defray medical costs incurred by the cancer - stricken daughter of an NYPD sergeant .
The duo was convicted of grand larceny at a departmental trial and fired .
The DA declined to prosecute , primarily because bank records had been destroyed , sources said .
There ’s also Mammianne Zadja , who reportedly tried to steal from her own family , changing the deed to her father ’s home and removing her brother ’s name from it .
The 32 - year - old initially obtained power of attorney for her healthy father by filing phony medical papers showing he had Alzheimer ’s , court papers alleged .
She then axed her brother from the deed and applied for a second mortgage on the house .
The cop was caught after a bank loan officer became suspicious when he held a conference call with Zadja and her “ father , ” who turned out to be someone posing as her dad .
She was fired , but at the family ’s request , the Staten Island DA did not press charges .
Perhaps the most ghoulish thievery involved Officer Eduardo Saillant , 38 , of the 60th Precinct , who swiped credit cards from the homes of four dead people last year .
Saillant was accused of responding to 911 calls involving people who died of natural causes and taking their cards and using them at Home Depot hardware stores in New York and New Jersey and to buy gasoline for his car .
Saillant , a divorced father of two , resigned from the NYPD .
His criminal case is pending , according to Brooklyn DA Joe Hynes .
The most notorious crime involved the widely reported conviction of police recruit Kabeer Din , 22 who tried to hire a hit man for $ 3,000 to assassinate his Suffolk , L.I. , girlfriend .
But the worst betrayal might involve cops allegedly in the process of extorting sex from a woman .
Two officers came under investigation after a woman arrested in a drug roundup claimed they offered her drugs for sex .
IAB zeroed in on the cops , listening in on a call in which one cop was heard offering marijuana for sexual favors .
The cop , his partner and the woman then met in a popular Manhattan eatery , El Malacon on Broadway and 175th Street , where the officers bragged about their coziness with drugs .
The rendezvous became even more untoward when an undercover cop walked in and one cop quickly gave up his identity , “ warning her to be careful since he works in the area , ” according to the report .
The officer who ratted out the undercover resigned the force .
The other cop was suspended , but remains a cop .
In The Bronx , a veteran NYPD detective was found guilty of getting a woman who was implicated in an identity - theft case to perform oral sex on him .
Detective Dominic Calvanico initially insisted the woman sign a confession and cooperate , according to the report .
He then told her that if she would “ take care of him ” – engage in sexual activity – he would “ talk to the DA and make the case go away , ” according to the report .
“ Fearful of being arrested and having just started a new job [ at a hospital ] , the victim met the detective in her car , where she performed oral sex on him , ” the report says .
She spit his sperm into a tissue , which was thrown into the center console .
Afterward , she alerted Internal Affairs and the Bronx DA .
IAB later retrieved the detective ’s investigative case folder , where they found the woman ’s written confession , but no mention of it in the file .
The detective , who claimed the sex was consensual , was found guilty at his NYPD trial of bribe receiving , coercion , associating with a criminal and filing false statements .
In an extraordinary plea deal worked out among the NYPD , the DA ’s office and his union , Calvanico – a cop for 19 years and 11 months – agreed to resign and surrender a portion of his pension to avoid criminal charges .

The US said it would not allow Mr Ahmadinejad a " photo op "
The Iranian president will arrive in New York on Sunday to address the United Nations General Assembly .
A New York police spokesman said the World Trade Center site was closed to visitors because of construction work .
He said requests by Mr Ahmadinejad to visit Ground Zero would be opposed on security grounds .
New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said the Iranian leader had asked the permission of the police department , the US Secret Service and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to visit the site .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters it seemed " more than odd that the president of a country that is a state sponsor of terror would visit Ground Zero " .
And Zalmay Khalilzad , the United States ambassador to the UN , told journalists that the US would not support Iran using the site for a " photo op " .
But a spokesman for the Iranian mission to the UN said they were still hopeful of finding some way for Mr Ahmadinejad to pay respect to the victims of the 2001 attacks .
Tensions between the US and Iran are high amid Washington 's claims that Tehran is arming militants in Iraq and seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , left , and Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , right , share a laugh .
GOP Funk : Top Dems Have Twice As Many Donors
From Congress to the presidential campaign , Republican fundraising is lagging while Democratic donations are surging .
Yet beneath the record - breaking million - dollar totals lies another statistic that could be more ominous in 2008 for Republicans : a yawning gap between the presidential primary fields ' donor bases .
According to campaign figures , the Democrats ' top three candidates received donations from about 204,000 individuals .
The first - tier Republican trio drew checks from 110,000 , roughly half as many .
That donor disparity helped give the Democrats a big first - quarter financial advantage .

The Democrats ' top three candidates reported having $ 61 million in cash at the end of the quarter , compared with $ 29 million posted by the top Republicans .
Of the nine presidential hopefuls who raised more than $ 1 million , six are Democrats , compared with three Republicans .
Two of the Democrats ' second - tier candidates -- New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd -- matched or beat the quarter - end cash balance of the Republican front - runner , Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
The risks to Republicans extend well beyond the first three months of this year .
The gap also could be a disadvantage to that party 's candidates in such grass - roots activities as voter registration drives and door - to - door get - out - the - vote efforts .
Campaign experts say people who give as little as $ 5 to a campaign are more likely to put out a yard sign , attend a rally or volunteer for a local campaign office or event .

In the general election , the donor base imbalance could become a decisive factor , since both party nominees are expected to opt out of the taxpayer - subsidized campaign finance system and raise as much money as possible for their candidacies .
Assuming the Democratic and Republican primary donor bases unite around the two party nominees , whichever side has the biggest pooled list of potential donors also captures a distinct fundraising advantage , said Democratic campaign strategist Joe Trippi .
Republican Scott Reed , who ran Bob Dole 's 1996 presidential race , said the trends are " a warning signal on where the race stands now , and the Democrats are winning the enthusiasm category hands down .
Part of the lack of enthusiasm is because of the cloud over President Bush and the administration .
The constant drip of domestic and governing mistakes coupled with Iraq is just depressing the party . "
The dynamics of the 2008 election cycle represent something of a reversal from 2000 .
Back then , it was the Democrats who were exhausted from impeachment and other scandals that plagued the Clinton administration , and many worried that vice president and nominee Al Gore did n't present a compelling new direction for the party .
Meanwhile , Republicans rallied behind their nominee , George W. Bush , who banked unprecedented campaign cash and reported a then record - breaking 171,000 donors at the end of the fourth quarter of 1999 .
Today , Republican ambiguity about the party 's front - runners is evident when the mere mention of potential candidates such as former U.S. senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee can reshuffle the lineup in public opinion polls .
An April 10 poll of Republicans by Rasmussen Reports , an independent polling organization , found former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani at the top of the polls , followed by McCain .
Thompson , who has n't announced his candidacy , was in third place , followed by Republican fundraising winner Mitt Romney , who had just edged out former speaker Newt Gingrich , another party leader who is n't in the race .
" The guys in 2000 who knew where to put their money -- on Bush -- because they were betting on a sure thing do n't have a place to go yet , " said Grover Norquist , a leader of the party 's anti-tax wing .
" There are many Republicans holding back trying to decide who is going to win .
There are also some Republicans who are spending a little bit of time focusing on the guy who is president while the Democrats are entirely focused on who could be president . "
While the Republicans are hedging their bets , the Democrats are pushing to improve their odds .
A Campaign Finance Institute analysis shows that big donors still rule .
Seventy - nine percent of the donations to the major candidates for both parties amounted to $ 1,000 or more .
That 's a typical pattern for the start of a primary season , as candidates appeal to their core supporters .
But in today 's competitive environment , small donors are getting new attention .
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , who reported 104,000 donors to his campaign , continued on Monday a series of events aimed at building his small - donor base .
With an entry fee of just $ 25 , thousands of people were expected to turn out in Milwaukee to see the Illinois senator .
Similar low - dollar events have been held in Louisville , Ky. ; Tampa , Fla . ; and other cities , allowing the campaign to add thousands of new names to its e-mail list for a relatively small cost to the campaign .
The Obama camp also set up Internet tools modeled after the Bush campaign 's Pioneer and Ranger bundling operations that allow small donors to gather modest donations from their friends and family , which they then deliver to the campaign under their name .
Thus far , 7,000 people have opened up small - donor bundling pages for Obama .
Those donors are particularly valuable , since they are n't likely to hit the maximum contribution limit of $ 2,300 .
That means the Obama camp can go back to them month after month for small checks that add up to real money when collected from many people .
In Obama 's case , for instance , he reported raising more than $ 6 million from Internet donations .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) raised around $ 4 million , and John Edwards collected about $ 3 million online -- and most of those givers were first - time donors .
Combined , the Democrats ' online donations alone match what McCain 's team raised in the entire first quarter .
To be sure , Republicans are also working the Internet and sending direct mail letters to generate their own small - donor bases .
Romney has invested more than $ 1 million to build up his Web operation , and McCain , whose 2000 presidential bid saw a spontaneous influx of Internet cash after his surprise New Hampshire win over Bush , reported having 50,000 donors -- a number competitive with Clinton and Edwards .
The challenge , Trippi said , is that the Republicans now must try to catch the Democrats .
" Once you 've grown the base as big as the candidates have , we 're not going to stop , " he said .
" This will only become a much bigger problem for the Republicans . "
As Howard Dean 's campaign manager , Trippi helped break all donor records by drawing about 200,000 contributors to Dean 's unsuccessful bid .
It 's a record Trippi believes could be easily broken this year .
" ( Bill ) Richardson is well ahead of our pace .
That 's how exponential this thing is growing , " he added .
Republican strategist Reed believes his party can overcome its slow start .
But that day wo n't come until " you have all of the Republican candidates talking about a post - Bush era , not in a confrontational way , but just in the context of moving on .
You do that with new ideas . "
Since 1987 annual emissions of carbon dioxide — the leading greenhouse gas warming the globe — have risen by a third , global fishing yields have declined by 10.6 million metric tons and the amount of land required to sustain humanity has swelled to more than 54 acres ( 22 hectares ) per person .
Yet , Earth can provide only roughly 39 acres ( 15 hectares ) for every person living today , according to the United Nation 's Environmental Program 's ( UNEP ) Global Environment Outlook , released this week .
" There are no major issues , " the report 's authors write of the period since their first report in 1987 , " for which the foreseeable trends are favorable . "
Despite some successes — such as the Montreal Protocol 's 95 percent reduction in chemicals that damage the atmosphere 's ozone layer and a rise in protected reserves of habitat to cover 12 percent of the planet — humanity 's impact continues to grow .
For example :
Biodiversity — The planet is in the grips of the sixth great extinction in its 4.5 - billion - year history , this one largely man-made .
Species are becoming extinct 100 times faster than the average rate in the fossil record .
More than 30 percent of amphibians , 12 percent of birds and 23 percent of our own class , mammals , are threatened .
Climate — Average temperatures have climbed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.76 degree Celsius ) over the past century and could increase as much as 8.1 degrees F ( 4.5 degrees C ) over the next unless " drastic " steps are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from , primarily , burning fossil fuels .
Developed countries will need to reduce this globe - warming pollution by 60 to 80 percent by mid-century to stave off dire consequences , the report warns .
" Fundamental changes in social and economic structures , including lifestyle changes , are crucial if rapid progress is to be achieved . "
Food — The amount of food grown per acre has reached one metric ton , but such increasing intensity is also driving rapid desertification of formerly arable land as well as reliance on chemical pesticides and fertilizers .
In fact , four billion out of the world 's 6.5 billion people could not get enough food to eat without such fertilization .
Continuing population growth paired with a shift toward eating more meat leads the UNEP to predict that food demand may more than triple .
Water — One in 10 of the world 's major rivers , including the Colorado and the Rio Grande in the U.S. , fail to reach the sea for at least part of the year , due to demand for water .
And that demand is rising ; by 2025 , the report predicts , demand for fresh water will rise by 50 percent in the developing world and 18 percent in industrialized countries .
At the same time , human activity is polluting existing fresh waters with everything from fertilizer runoff to pharmaceuticals and climate change is shrinking the glaciers that provide drinking water for nearly one third of humanity .
" The escalating burden of water demand , " the report says , " will become intolerable in water - scarce countries . "
The authors — 388 scientists reviewed by roughly 1,000 of their peers — view the report as " an urgent call for action " and decry the " woefully inadequate " global response to problems such as climate change .
" The amount of resources needed to sustain [ humanity ] exceeds what is available , " the report declares .
" The systematic destruction of the earth 's natural and nature - based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged , " Achim Steiner , UNEP 's executive director , said in a statement .
" The bill we hand our children may prove impossible to pay . "

Downing an “ energy drink ” may boost blood pressure as well as energy , researchers said in a small study presented at the American Heart Association ’s Scientific Sessions 2007 .
In the study , conducted by Wayne State University researchers , blood pressure and heart rate levels increased in healthy adults who drank two cans a day of a popular energy drink .
While the increases did n’t reach dangerous levels in the healthy volunteers , the increases in blood pressure and heart rate could prove to be clinically significant in patients with heart disease or in those who consume energy drinks often , said James Kalus , Pharm .D. , senior manager of Patient Care Services at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit , Mich . , and a former Wayne State researcher who led the study .
“ Individuals with high blood pressure and heart disease should be advised to avoid these drinks . ”
Most energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine and taurine , an amino acid also found in protein - containing foods such as meats and fish .
Both have had effects on heart function and blood pressure in some studies .
In contrast , “ sports drinks ” in general contain various mixtures of water , sugars and salts alone , without chemicals aimed at increasing “ energy ” or alertness .
The 15 healthy young adult participants ( 53 percent female , average age 26 ) were asked to abstain from other forms of caffeine for two days prior to and throughout the study .
On the first day baseline measurements of blood pressure , heart rate and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) were taken .
Then the participants drank two cans of an energy drink that contained 80 milligrams of caffeine and 1,000 milligrams of taurine .
Researchers then measured blood pressure , heart rate and ECG again at 30 minutes , one , two , three and four hours after consumption .
This continued for the next five days , and then , on the seventh day , the researchers followed the same procedures used on the first day .
The researchers compared average baseline measurements on days one and seven to maximum values during the observation period .
Within four hours of energy drink consumption , maximum systolic blood pressure ( the top number that represents pressure while the heart contracts to pump blood to the body ) increased by 7.9 percent on day one and 9.6 percent on day seven ; diastolic blood pressure ( the bottom number that represents the pressure when the heart relaxes between beats ) increased by 7 percent and 7.8 percent , respectively , within two hours of energy drink consumption .
Heart rate increased by 7.8 percent on day one and 11 percent on day seven .
Over the duration of the study , heart rates increased five to seven beats per minute and systolic blood pressure increased 10 millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) after energy drink consumption , the researchers reported .
No significant ECG changes were observed .
“ This occurred while participants were sitting in chairs watching movies , ” said Kalus .
“ The increases in heart rate and blood pressure were n’t enough for something to happen acutely , but a person on hypertension medication or who has cardiovascular disease may not respond as well . ”
“ While energy drinks increase concentration and wakefulness , people with risk factors for heart disease could have a bad reaction .
The subjects in this study were healthy with low blood pressure . ”
Kalus feels that the increases in blood pressure and heart rate may be due to the caffeine and taurine in the drinks .
However , the energy drink used in the study had as much caffeine as one to two cups of coffee , and usually the effect of this amount of caffeine on blood pressure would be expected to wane over 2 or 3 days of regular intake .
Some of the other energy drinks contain much higher levels of caffeine , he said .
“ Thousands of young adults are using these drinks , ” Kalus said .
“ Some are mixing the energy drinks with alcohol .
We do n’t necessarily know how much they are drinking at a time or whether they are drinking before exerting themselves playing basketball or dancing . ”
Some of the marketing for energy drinks is combined with extreme sports , he said .
The researchers are unsure what effect exercise or the combination with alcohol has on a person who drinks energy drinks ; however , some countries advise against using energy drinks to quench thirst while playing sports .
Blood pressure and heart rate naturally go up during physical activity , Kalus said .
“ This could be further augmented by energy drinks .
Energy drinks could affect some individuals if they did n’t know they had a problem in the first place , ” he said .
“ The study raises some concerns . ”
Until further study , Kalus said people with high blood pressure or heart disease should avoid energy drinks because they could affect their blood pressure and may even alter the effectiveness of their medications .

The next year , newly elected president Jimmy Carter launched yet another inquest , which similarly found that no American P.O.W.'s remained alive , but added that " it is probable that no accounting will ever be possible for most of the Americans lost in Indochina . "
Meanwhile , there ensued a flood of reported " live sightings " of American P.O.W.'s by refugees streaming out of Vietnam , several of which were deemed credible enough to prompt further investigation .
In 1981 , human intelligence reports about a possible American P.O.W. prison in Central Laos , reinforced by air reconnaissance photos , were tantalizing enough to prompt President Reagan to order a Delta Force team to prepare a rescue operation .
( It was abruptly called off , however , for reasons that remain unclear . )
The scrubbed rescue attempt in particular remains a bitter point of contention among P.O.W./M.I.A. families and their supporters ; it calcified the conviction among many that the U.S. government was lying to them .
Yet even as his interest in prisoners of war deepened , Egan viewed the P.O.W./M.I.A. movement with skepticism .
The rallies struck him as noisy and ineffectual ( and again , he was never a joiner ) .
Ultimately , acting on an impulse that seems too naïve to believe ( and that McCreary , the lead Senate Select Committee attorney , would challenge over and over during the deposition ) , Egan says he decided , rather than banging on doors , to simply walk in .
He had been amazed during a high - school trip to the United Nations that diplomats from " enemy countries " such as Vietnam could live and work in New York , and it was toward these insiders that he directed his energies , as he recalled in his deposition .
Egan :
My intention was always to form a relationship with the Vietnamese so I could be of some assistance on the POW issue .…
McCreary : How did you first meet Vietnamese officials ?
Egan : I just called them up …
You have to understand something .
At the time here , they did n't have a lot of friends .
Over a period of several months , Egan had called the Vietnamese U.N. mission nearly every day , chatting up whoever had answered the phone .
" I said I wanted to form a friendship , [ that ] I have some concerns , [ that I want to understand ] why I have this hate inside me for them , " Egan recounted in the deposition .
His persistence paid off .
He was eventually invited to meet representatives from the mission , and began seeing them regularly , usually for coffee in one of the diners around the U.N.
Egan would pepper them with questions about Vietnam — its history , its politics , the envoys ' experiences in country during the war .
However , he would never mention his interest in P.O.W.'s .
" I did n't want to blow my cover , " he told McCreary in the deposition .
The seemingly bemused Senate Select Committee lawyer stopped him there :
McCreary :
When you say cover , that 's usually a term used by intelligence people .
Are you using it in that sense ?
Egan : Yes .
McCreary :
Are you an intelligence person ?
Egan : No. Could I comment on that ?
McCreary : Please .
Egan : I think that now , after my many , many years of involvement on this issue and my many years involvement with the Vietnamese , that I 've learned from the best …
McCreary :
So you just took it upon yourself ; is that right , to butt into this ?
Egan :
Not to butt in .
To become a part of the solution … I could n't believe that none of our intelligence agencies — and still cannot believe none of our intelligence agencies have infiltrated the Vietnamese in the manner that I did .
Egan says he realized early on how vulnerable the envoys were .
" They were lost in New York City , " he explains .
" I could n't believe that the feds and the C.I.A. did n't exploit their human nature of being lonely , being bored , sitting around for years on end and not be able to go to a movie because their resources were very short , you know ?
So I chose that area to exploit them , to make them comfortable here . "
He 'd take them out for dinner , to football games , fishing .
" I maintained my position with them , right , at the lowest of all possible levels , " he says .
" I was a chauffeur .
Sometimes I was the doorman for their embassy , at times for [ embassy ] functions .
Sometimes I was the gofer — go get them this , go get them that … I was their jackass .
I was their coolie . "
Dollar weakness centres on US economy concerns
The dollar fell to $ 1.4659 against the euro by late afternoon trade in New York , and dropped to 110.04 yen .
At the start of November , the dollar hit a record low of $ 1.4752 against the single European currency .
The strength of the dollar had been undermined further by weak US economic data released on Friday .
Interest rate cuts
As a growing number of US banks reveal their exposure to bad US mortgage debt , data on Friday showed the biggest drop in American industrial production since January .
As long as housing remains a downside risk , people will think the Fed is biased to cut rates in the near term
David Watt , senior currency strategist , RBC Capital Markets
Taken together , analysts say this suggests further cuts in US interest rates .
" There are no fundamental reasons to buy the dollar , " said Tsutomu Soma , senior manager of foreign securities at Okasan Securities .
The US Federal Reserve last cut interest rates in October to 4.5 % , in an effort to kick - start the faltering housing and credit markets , as well as making borrowing cheaper to encourage consumer spending in the run-up to the key Christmas shopping period .
Despite signalling that it will adopt a wait - and - see approach to the future direction of interest rates , most economists expect a further cut in rates when Fed officials next meet in December .
" Are there inflation fears in the United states ?
Yes , " said David Watt , senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto .
" But as long as housing remains a downside risk , people will think the Fed is biased to cut rates in the near term . "

We have more people locked up than any other country in the world .
A full 25 percent of all the prisoners in the world are in American jails .
In December 2006 , that amounted to 2.25 million people .
Those numbers are from a report by the International Center for Prison Studies .
The facts raise a lot of interesting questions .
Do we just have more criminals than anyone else ?
Apparently so , since by definition people sentenced to be locked up in jails and prisons are criminals .
So the next question is , Why ?
Could it be that our laws create criminals , in the sense that acts that used to be considered noncriminal have been criminalized by overeager legislators ?
That ’s certainly part of the problem .
I can cite one example from Florida .
Suppose two men get into an argument and one of them feels threatened by the other .
He gets a pistol , points it at the person he feels is a threat and tells him to leave .
The guy leaves .
Nobody gets shot .
In the past , that might never have been considered a crime .
Today , it is classified as aggravated assault and carries a mandatory prison sentence .
Legislators , who have no real responsibility for law enforcement , cannot resist doing something when some particular act makes the news .
Their usual response , if whatever made the news is n’t a crime , is to make it a crime or to increase the penalty if it already is a crime .
One example is the federal law against the murder of a federal agent .
It is completely unnecessary .
State laws against murder do not exclude federal agents and never have .
In fact , state laws against murder do n’t exclude anybody .
When carjacking made the news , Congress passed a federal law against it .
Again , entirely unnecessary .
State laws already covered the act .
Hate - crime laws are another example of legislative grandstanding .
Murder is already against the law in all 50 states .
To the victim , the murderer ’s motive is irrelevant ; you are just as dead if you are murdered by a thief or by someone who does n’t care for your religion or race .
Hate - crime advocates think punishment should be based on motive , with crimes motivated by prejudice receiving tougher penalties .
Never mind that this degrades the pain and suffering of other victims of identical acts .
It clearly sends the message that your death ( and therefore your life ) is less important than this other guy’s .
Of course , the motive of the hate - crime crowd is to legislate against hate speech .
It ’s already happened in some states .
This , of course , is legislating against thought , which , however obnoxious , deserves the protection of the First Amendment .
If a white man does n’t like black people or if a black man does n’t like white people , both should be free to say so .
Criminal laws should be confined to actions that cause death , injury , theft or destruction of property .
The sole purpose of criminal laws should be to administer punishment .
They should not be used in an attempt to accomplish some kind of social purpose , no matter how worthy .
Finally , of course , a sensible criminal - justice system would confine only people who are dangerous .
In fact , only a third of the people in state prisons are there for violent crimes .
Many are there for selling contraband — namely , common drugs , which the federal government has decided people should n’t use .
It would be a good social policy to try to dissuade people from using drugs that are harmful to them , but criminal laws should not be employed as a bludgeon .
Going to prison has never educated anybody except in the ways of crime .
Like the war in Iraq , the war on drugs is a failure , and like Prohibition , it has created criminal gangs and widespread corruption .

HE noticed it when his cellphone , stuffed with too many text messages , voicemails and phone numbers , started flashing at him : “ Memory almost full . ”
It was remarkably like his own brain , weighted down with half - written songs , daughter Bea ’s schedule , the lyrics to old Beatles B - sides , the blurring faces of long - buried loves and friends .
Delete ?
Re-record ?
Which parts go , and which -- the carpets of bluebells outside Liverpool in spring , sitting on twin beds in a hotel room with John Lennon writing “ She Loves You ” -- stay locked in the hard drive of time ?
“ Your memory is always almost full these days .
There ’s so much going on , so I thought it was a poetic way to sum up modern life .
Just overload , information overload , ” Paul McCartney says of his 21st solo album , “ Memory Almost Full , ” which explores the persistence of memory , preparing for the settling of scores and a life too full to hold it all .
“ It ’s been pointed out to me that since the album is heavy on retrospective stuff , there ’s a sort of finality about it .
‘ Memory almost full , ’ any second now it will be full , and , ‘ Goodbye cruel world . ’
It ’s not what I meant about it at all , but I can see that meaning , and I like , you know , people to have different interpretations .
“ Abbey Road ” to us was a crossing outside the studio .
I ’m sure to some people , it meant Monastery Lane , and we liked that sort of quasi- religious feel of it too . ”

The album ( out Tuesday ) marks the 64 - year - old McCartney ’s plunge into another kind of digital age .
Ending his relationship with Capitol Records / EMI that began in 1962 , McCartney has hooked up with Starbucks ’ new Hear Music Label and unlocks the new album ( along with the rest of his solo catalog ) for online downloads .
McCartney also says the Beatles catalog is on deck for online release near the end of the year , although EMI has not announced a date .
The video for “ Dance Tonight , ” the party - tune , mandolin - laced foot - tapper that opens the record , made its world premiere on YouTube , in a bid to charm a third generation with the kind of winsome songs their grandmother should know .
“ I was bored with the old record company ’s jaded view , ” McCartney says , plopped on a sofa in the large , comfortable farmhouse that doubles as a rehearsal studio here in the rolling , tree - studded hills of rural East Sussex .
Outside , there is an old windmill , and in the near distance , the hazy blue carpet of the English Channel .
“ They ’re very confused , and they will admit it themselves : that this is a new world , and they ’re a little bit at a loss as to what to do .
So they ’ve got millions of dollars and X budget ... for them to come up with boring ways -- because they ’ve been at it for so long -- to what they call ‘ market ’ it .
And I find that all a bit disturbing .

“ I write it , I play it , I record it , and that ’s all fun .
And you go to the record company , and it gets very boring .
You sit around in rooms with people , and you ’re almost falling asleep ” -- he rolls his head down midchest --" and they ’re almost falling asleep .
“ My record producer [ David Kahne ] said the major record labels these days are like dinosaurs sitting around discussing the asteroid .
They know it ’s going to hit .
They do n’t know when , they do n’t know where it ’s coming from .
But it ’s sort of hit already .
With iTunes , and all of that . ”
McCartney heard that Starbucks ’ content development guy , Alan Mintz , loved his music ; better , he was a bass player .
They arranged to meet in New York , along with Howard Schultz , the chief executive who turned Starbucks from a high - fallutin ’ bean roaster in Seattle into a multibillion - dollar global purveyor of expensive coffee drinks and cool ambience .
The vision from Starbucks and its Concord Music Group partner in Hear Music : Roll out “ Memory Almost Full ” across time zones on the in - store music systems at more than 10,000 coffeehouses in 29 countries ( copies available as you pay for your latte , and at dinosaur record stores too , of course ) .
That means an estimated 6 million people get a listen on the first day .

“ We felt we were in a unique position to really transform the way music is discovered and delivered to the music consumer , ” said Ken Lombard , president of Starbucks Entertainment in Los Angeles .
“ When we heard the album , we just knew it was really a landmark in a number of ways .
Musically , it ’s the most personal and revealing album that Paul ’s created in his solo career .
Thematically , many of the songs are a reflection of his life , his career , his jobs and the tragedies , a reflection of the remarkable journey his life has been . ”
McCartney had the same reaction to Apple founder Steve Jobs -- with whose company Apple records was locked in trademark litigation for years -- as he had to Schultz .
“ He too is very cool , very passionate , they really care about working with your music .
“ I just thought , right , I ’m going to put a package together on that side of things that will keep me and my producer excited .
And that ’s what we ’ve done .
So we ’re working with websites , Internet things , young kids .
Just people who are hungry .
People who come up with ideas rather than people who ’ve been at it too long and are frightened for their jobs . ”

Contrary to British media reports , he said , longtime Apple Corps chief Neil Aspinall ’s departure in April had nothing to do with clearing the way to the online music market .
“ He wanted to retire .
Simple as that .
I ’ve known Neil longer than I ’ve known anyone in the music business , including all the Beatles .
Neil was at school with me when we were 11 , he was in my class .
But he just wanted to retire .
He ’s 65 .
So he did .
So we have a new guy now [ Jeff Jones ] , he ’s very good .
Nobody considers he ’s going to replace Neil , you know , emotionally , because we grew up with Neil ....
But there are new sorts of things , new openings , the online thing is a huge opening , and so it ’s a new chapter now . ”
McCartney and the band are rehearsing for an upcoming trio of “ surprise ” live gigs in the U.K. , New York and Los Angeles , and there is a definite bachelor air around the place , now that wife Heather has split in the messiest divorce to hit the London tabloids since Chelsea soccer team owner Roman Abramovich dumped his wife for leggy young “ Dasha ” Zhukova .
The band is playing with enough volume these days that they ’re annoying daughter Bea , a frequent visitor .
“ We play a bit loud , just because we can , ” McCartney says with a sly smile .
“ We ’re allowed to , there ’s no grown - ups around .
We ’re allowed to turn our amps up , you see ? ”

The off - limits topic
WHAT he wo n’t talk about are Heather Mills McCartney ’s allegations about what went on during their four - year marriage : that McCartney slashed her arm with a broken wine glass , ordered her not to breastfeed Beatrice because “ I do n’t want a mouthful of breast milk , ” and refused to let her keep a chamber pot in the bedroom , forcing her , because she is missing a leg , to crawl to the bathroom in the middle of the night .
“ I do n’t like to talk about it , because we ’re still in the middle of a divorce , ” he says .
“ A somewhat public divorce .
And you know we have a 3 1 / 2 year - old daughter .
So I ’m trying to make every effort to say as little as possible about it .
I ’m moving through it , hopefully with some kind of dignity . ”
It ’s hard not to find a hint of Heather and the apparent pride McCartney once must have felt in his determined and ambitious young wife in “ See Your Sunshine ” from the new album : “ Step out in front of me baby / They want you in the front line / They want to see your sunshine . ”

But many of the songs were written even before 2005 ’s Grammy - nominated “ Chaos and Creation in the Backyard , ” and the memory files they plumb go deep into a boy ’s lush and lovely summers ( on the exquisite “ Tell Me ” ) , McCartney ’s days as a Boy Scout , beaning his friends on the head with chestnuts .
Then , less - ancient files : the Beatles “ sweating cobwebs ” and playing the Cavern Club in Liverpool .
In a final , five - song suite similar in form to the “ Abbey Road ” medley but progressing through the milestones of a life , McCartney reaches the surreal and unsettling “ House of Wax , ” where “ poets spill out on the street / To set alight the incomplete / Remainders of the future . ”
And there is the “ End of the End ” -- a swan song so McCartney in its essential optimism : “ It ’s the start of a journey to a much better place / And a much better place would have to be special , ” he reassures .
“ No reason to cry . ”
He has buried Linda McCartney , John Lennon and George Harrison .
By now , he is surely accustomed to partings .
Yet he seems to remember , like the bluebell forests of England ( that once formed the backdrop to a frolic in “ Help ” ) , the tender times , the days when it was easy to bend over a guitar with Lennon on the other rumpled bed and work magic on cue .
“ We were writing ‘ She Loves You ’ because we ’d been told by our manager that we needed a single .
And we were just , ‘ OK . ’
It was great .
We just responded well to direction .
They ’d say , ‘ You ’re going into studio next week , so you ’ll need to write the album . ’
And we ’d go , ‘ OK . ’
Ha !
Never once do I remember us going , ‘ A whole album in a week ? ’
Which , you know , we should ’ve thought .
Advertisement
“ But we go , ‘ Yeah , great , OK . ’
We were just so innocent and enthusiastic .
So yeah , that ’s what we did all the time .
We wrote just under 300 songs , and that was done in about 300 sessions .
We never had a dry session . ”
How could that be ?
“ Because we were bloody brilliant .
Pure genius , that ’s all .
‘ We were very good , ’ he said modestly , ’ ” and he smiles for his failure to conjure up the requisite humility .
“ The good thing is , now you can say that .
People used to say , ‘ Do n’t you think you ’re a bit conceited ? ’
And I ’d say , ‘ I know what you mean , you could say it ’s conceited , but I really do know we ’re good .
I can feel it every time we write a song . ’
Because John and I were very good collaborators .
We really helped each other massively and admired each other greatly . ”
He thinks for a moment .
“ It was a joy , ” he says .
Advertisement
He trips into the rustic farm kitchen , where the band is swallowing whole a spread of mozzarella sandwiches and samosas before heading back to the studio .
He cuts a few roses from the garden and rummages for a glass to put them in water , singing the trippy chorus of “ The things I think I did / I di - i - di- i did ” from “ Ever Present Past ” under his breath .
Almost time for the imperious and charming Bea to show up .
Time to play “ very , very , very quietly , ” he says .

“ Memory Almost Full ” ( Hear Music )
* * 1/2
MEMORY is the brain ’s rear - view mirror -- an instrument that ’s exceedingly useful for navigating life ’s highway but one that can quickly turn hazardous if stared at for too long .
McCartney ’s wistful gaze into his storied past gets mired in simple nostalgia from time to time in his 21st solo album , and his sugary romanticism often goes unchecked in this virtual one - man show .
Advertisement
But high points outpace the lows , from the joyful leadoff track “ Dance Tonight ” to the reflective “ Ever Present Past , ” in which his lyrical reverie is countered with a propulsive rhythm and melody that keep him philosophically moving forward .
It ’s a relief that he does n’t finish the album with “ The End of the End , ” his endearing auto - epitaph , even if it means wrapping things up with a rocking love song as routine as “ Nod Your Head . ”
Even as he ’s about to turn 65 , McCartney appears to recognize that the past is a nice place to visit , but you would n’t want to live there .

Sutton Financial –
It does n’t matter what newspaper you picked up .
It does n’t matter what TV show you watched .
Records fell like no time in recent history with perhaps the exception of Carl Lewis running loose at the Olympics in his heyday .
I wonder how much his Gold medals are worth now ?
$ 1.55 on the Euro , $ 100 on the Yen , $ 1000 Gold , $ 110 oil .
The three pillars of what we have been writing about for almost 2 years in this column are falling into place exactly as we said they would .
Gold and oil up , the Dollar down .
This was no stroke of genius mind you , but rather a dead - wringer given the circumstances surrounding the financial system .
Things are starting to get interesting , but AGAIN , rather than stand up and admit how bad this problem is , the powers that be continue to offer fairytale assertions of how things are fine and that the bottom is in .
Crying bottom has already cost a number of forecasters their reputations and in some cases , their jobs .
Yesterday , Standard & Poor ’s took their turn on the stump saying that the writedowns from subprime mortgages are basically over .
A few weeks ago , CNBC trotted out T. Boone Pickens in an attempt to talk down the price of oil .
The effort fell flat on its face and Mr. Pickens ended up looking rather badly .
He also lost quite a bit of money if he was actually short oil , which I seriously doubt .
This has been the way of things .
Every time I watch one of these interviews , I feel the need to dig through cereal boxes looking for the special glasses they used to include to help you see the magic patterns on the back of the box .
So the latest is that the subprime writedowns are over ; blue skies are here again .
What ?
We are only about halfway through the mortgage reset process , and even though there has been a lot of talk about freezing rates , nothing is in stone yet .
Unlike the easy ‘ economic stimulus ’ package , it is a harder sell when asking bankers to part with profits .
Given the cloak and dagger nature with which this problem first emerged and has stealthily worked its way through the financial system , gobbling balance sheets along the way , I am surprised anyone would risk their reputation at this point .
Maybe I should n’t be .
The stock market rallied heavily after the comments , and after all , that is what is needed right now .
Minus intervention , the markets are looking downright ugly and Wall Street needs your money .
Pure and simple .
It just is n’t fun shuffling around billions of dollars between big banks .
Without your 401 ’s , they are done .
I think that deep down there is an understanding of the difference between real capital ( foregoing of consumption in favor of investment ) and the stuff rolling off the printing presses .
The Fed can print dollars , but it cannot print capital .
Capital formation encourages real growth , whereas the additional fiat created while in crisis mode only destroys the value of the existing capital .
Retirement plans are essentially the last bastion of genuine savings in our economy .
Speaking of 401’s , the problem is that people are cashing in 401 ’s in record numbers right now so they can avoid foreclosure .
Just when the markets need buyers , the little guy is selling .
This will be a short term Band - Aid at best .
The penalties and taxes alone on an early withdrawals will take over 1/3 of the money .
Most people with any kind of retirement plan from the bull market of the 1990 ’s got cleaned out in the tech wreck .
Only in 2006 did they finally ‘ break even ’ again ( see article here ) .
They had a short window of about a year to get out of the market before the barber showed up and gave the major indices a 15 % haircut .
So in reality , how much money do these people have left ?
Not much .
Robbing Peter to pay WaMu will last a little while , but the long - term effect of having no retirement funds coupled with failing Social Security will be much worse than a foreclosure .
Against this backdrop , the Bernanke Fed continues to make history before our very eyes .
Day after day , move after move they place another nail in the coffin and further cement their role as the facilitator of the next US Depression .
So perfectly wrong has Fed policy been over the past 18 months that it will likely become the test case for what not to do in the future .
This should not be a surprise to anyone .
This is all they know how to do .
The irony here is that Ben Bernanke has always thought that the reason we had the Great Depression was because the Fed did n’t print enough money .
So now he will take us back there again , this time by printing too much .
The Planners are limited by their understanding of economics , and more importantly , their lack of desire to do anything politically unpopular .
The fact that we are in an election year will only exacerbate the situation .
There has been much talk , but precious little meaningful action and even that has been dead wrong .
At this point their best bet would be to stop their acronym - denoted inflation creating devices ( TAF , TSLF ) and let the bad apples rot to nothing , particularly Bear Stearns which is now officially on life support .
This would cause economic pain .
But once the system cleanses , normal economic growth could resume .
By not allowing the system to cleanse , they are guaranteeing that the pain will be worse and last much longer than necessary .
It appears that they are willing to accept that in exchange for a few more months of status quo .
They have a serious problem in that inflation is running out of control , and at the same time , the economy is sinking .
Stagflation is upon us .
The more money the Fed prints to solve the liquidity and banking problems , the higher prices will climb at the consumer level .
This is great if you ’re an investor in anything tangible , but a downright disaster if you ’re a consumer .
This week has been unlike any other week in recent memory .
Things are moving quickly , and it is important to stay tuned and keep your eye on the ball .
The protective measures discussed in My Two Cents over the past two years are still in play , granted at much higher costs now , but as the saying goes , the best time to plant an oak tree was fifty years ago ; the second best time is right now .
Make sure yours is planted while there is still some growing time left .

Twelve senators introduce bill to outlaw voter ' caging ' RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This
In a press release late Monday afternoon , Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) announced that he had introduced legislation to ban the practice of " voter caging , " a practice in which groups send mail to voters ' addresses and then use " return to sender " envelopes to challenge the legitimacy of individual votes .
Wikipedia defines ' caging ' as " a term of art in the direct mail industry , as well as a term applied to a technique of voter suppression .
A caging list is a list or database of addresses , updated after a mailing program is completed , with notations on responses received from recipients , with corrections for addresses that mail has been returned undelivered from , or forwarded onward from . "
In October 2004 , the BBC reported on a list of " caging " targets that had been culled from an email allegedly sent by the Bush campaign .
The email , which was errantly sent to GeorgeWBush.org instead of GeorgeWBush.com , contained " a list of 1,886 voter names and addresses in largely African - American and Democratic areas of Jacksonville . "
 The practice of caging  is reprehensible and has absolutely no place in our democracy , " Kerry said in the release .
" Here in America , every citizen , regardless of race , gender , religion or sexual orientation has the right to cast his or her vote .
These are the very foundations of our democracy and this bill will ensure that we protect fundamental freedoms for millions of voters across our country . 
The remainder of the release follows .
Caging is a voter suppression tactic in which a political party , campaign , or other entity sends mail marked  do not forward  or return to sender to a targeted group of voters  often minorities or residents of minority neighborhoods .
A list of those whose mail was returned undelivered  is then used as the basis for challenges to the right of those citizens to vote , on the grounds that the voter does not live at the address where he or she is registered .
There are many reasons that mail could be returned undelivered , however ; an eligible voter could be overseas on active military service or a student registered at a parents address .
There is evidence that caging lists were assembled in Florida , Ohio , and Pennsylvania during the 2004 elections , possibly intended as the basis for massive voter eligibility challenges .
The Florida incident made headlines again earlier this year during Congresss investigation into the firing of several U.S. Attorneys , when allegations resurfaced that Tim Griffin , the former RNC opposition researcher then serving as an interim U.S. Attorney in Arkansas , had been involved in an effort to cage voters in Jacksonville .
The Caging Prohibition
Act would prohibit challenges to a persons eligibility to register to vote , or cast a vote , based solely on returned mail or a caging list .
The bill would also mandate that anyone who challenges the right of another citizen to vote must set forth the specific grounds for their alleged ineligibility , under penalty of perjury .
Senators Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , Russ Feingold ( D - Wis. ) , Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) , Amy Klobuchar ( D - Minn . ) , Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) , Bob Menendez ( D - N.J. ) , Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , and Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) joined Kerry as cosponsors of the Caging Prohibition Act .
To date , the bill has also been endorsed by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law , the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , and People for the American Way .
This month ’s American Bar Association Journal has a fairly good article about the District of Columbia gun ban case currently under consideration by the Supreme Court , and the surprising role that the National Rifle Association took in trying to derail the lawsuit in its infancy :
Though the NRA champions individual ownership under the Second Amendment , its critics say the association shares one concern with gun-control advocates :
Both fear that a definitive Supreme Court statement against them on the Second Amend­ment would cripple , if not kill , their causes .
“ The NRA wants to be the one to define the meaning of the Second Amendment , ” says Josh Sugarman , executive director for the anti-gun Violence Policy Center in Washing­ton .
Sugarman ’s 1992 book , National Rifle Association : Money , Firepower & Fear , is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative histories of the organization .
“ They do n’t want the Supreme Court to do it , because the [ NRA view ] is good for [ the fundraising ] business . ”
Discouraging freelance plaintiffs is important to the NRA , whose lawyers worry they tend to file complaints that throw multiple theories against the wall to see what sticks .
Such cases can hurt the larger cause , the lawyers say , because they increase the risk of setting unfavorable precedents that may be difficult to undo over time .
In California , they call such plaintiffs “ orange robers , ” says NRA lawyer Michel — a reference to the brightly clad Buddhist monks who torched themselves on Saigon streets during the 1960s in futile demonstrations against the Vietnam War .
And so , when the D.C. case was just beginning , the NRA did everything they could to discourage the Plaintiffs from going forward and , even to this day , it lobbies Congress to repeal the D.C. Gun Ban itself — which would make the case , and any Supreme Court consideration of the Second Amendment implications of the law , entirely moot .
Now that the case is on the verge of being accepted for appeal , though , the NRA is jumping on the bandwagon :
The U.S. Supreme Court had not even decided whether ­to take the case when National Rifle Association lobbyist Wayne LaPierre fired off the distress flare : “ The biggest Second Amendment court battle in history is about to begin — one that will have a huge impact on you , your children and every other American gun owner for generations to come , ” LaPierre wrote in an August fundraising letter to the NRA ’s 4.3 million members .
“ And I ’m not exaggerating a bit . ”
He ’s probably right there .
The NRA wants money — lots of it — to make sure the District of Colum­bia ’s handgun ban stays buried good and deep .
That ’s where an appeals court left it after an unprecedented decision early this year that killed it as a violation of the Second Amend­ment ’s right to keep and bear arms .
(…)
If the tone of LaPierre ’s letter did n’t sound urgent enough , he used plenty of underlined boldface type and capital letters to drive home his point .
He told the faithful a top - notch brief may cost as much as $ 1.2 million .
“ For gun owners and NRA members , this is the biggest legal battle that we have ever fought , or will ever fight — and its outcome will probably impact every law - abiding American gun owner , ” LaPierre wrote in the five - page letter .
“ It is a battle we simply cannot afford to lose . ”
Here ’s where LaPierre heads into a wrong turn :
It ’s not an NRA case .
In fact , the gun rights supporters who filed it complain that lawyers working for the NRA , concerned the case could backfire , spent considerable time and money trying to scuttle it .
The association finally was dragged kicking and screaming before the Supreme Court after the prospect of review appeared more likely than it has in years .
“ They recognized this was a good case and D.C. was the perfect place , ” says plaintiffs lawyer Robert A. Levy , a senior fellow at Washington ’s libertarian Cato Institute .
“ That ’s what concerned them . ”
The Supreme Court will decide on Friday whether to accept the appeal , and we ’ll probably know the answer to that question a week or so later , and then the stage for the biggest Second Amendment case in more than 50 years will be set .
But do n’t thank the NRA for getting it there .

In 2006 , a bottlenose dolphin with palm - sized fins near its tail was found in Japan .
The extra set of fins could be the remains of hind legs .

Every once in awhile , an unsuspecting scientist will come across an animal with a very strange trait -- like a whale with legs .
That 's right , a whale with legs .
Obviously , most whales do n't have legs .
So how did this happen ?
Our mammal friend the whale gives us the perfect example of an atavism , a trait from a distant evolutionary ancestor that has reappeared in a modern - day organism .
Millions and millions of years ago , the ancestors of whales walked on land .
Over time , they went from land dwellers to sea creatures , possibly in search of food , and lost the legs and other traits they would n't need in the ocean .
To understand how this happened , let 's talk a little bit about how evolution works .
Advertisement

The theory of evolution posits that DNA can change .
These changes in an organism 's DNA can be good , bad or neutral .
Over time , these changes , or mutations , lead to new species .
Natural selection is part of evolution .
The organisms with good mutations -- beneficial changes -- thrive and reproduce , while those with bad mutations die out .
Natural selection chooses the pick of the litter every time .
( For a more in - depth explanation , see How Evolution Works ) .
The whales that took to the sea no longer benefited from legs , so their DNA mutated to get rid of this trait .
The whale ancestors whose bodies adapted best to their environment thrived and passed these adaptations down to their offspring .
Dollo's law states that evolution is n't reversible , and that things that have been lost during the course of evolution do n't reappear .
Once it 's gone , it 's gone -- sayonara , whale legs .
Later scientists modified the law to say that the probability of this happening is low .
But what if Dollo 's law is wrong ?
A whale with legs is just one example of an atavism - they crop up more frequently than you would suppose .
Maybe evolution works differently from what we had supposed .
Maybe understanding atavisms will help us unlock some of the mysteries of evolution , a theory that still has some holes .
Atavisms have been misunderstood for a long time , partly because of a man named Cesare Lombroso , a social Darwinist who believed that criminals are throwbacks to a primitive human ancestor .
He declared that criminals are born criminals , and you can recognize them by their physiology .
According to Lombroso , certain facial characteristics denote a criminal .
( Interestingly , Lombroso also thought that criminals must have a higher pain threshold than the average citizen because many of them have tattoos from prison .
His ( faulty ) logic was that since criminals have tattoos , and tattoos are painful , then they must have a higher tolerance for pain . )
Lombroso's erroneous ideas persisted in some fashion despite evidence that his conclusions were n't scientific at all .
People still sometimes associate atavisms with distasteful stereotypes , even though that is n't what the word means .
So what does it mean ?
Next , we 'll look at traits that people mistakenly think are atavisms and how they might happen .
ISPs are n't known for encouraging users to share bandwidth , but that 's exactly what BT wants UK customers to do .
The Spanish WiFi specialist FON offers routers that enable people to " securely " share their high - speed connections with strangers ; in return , the sharers get access to any other FON access point in the world .
Now , the model is coming to the UK as BT partners with FON .
BT will encourage its three million broadband users to pick up a FON router and start sharing signals .
The router provides two channels : one for public access , and one for access by the owner .
The public channel is bandwidth - limited so as not to disrupt the user 's own connection .
Other " Foneros " can access the public channel for free , while non-Foneros can pay a few dollars a day to use the access points .
FON has currently signed a similar deal with Time Warner Cable in the US .
For those who travel often , one of the benefits of the system is its global reach .
FON members can freely access any of the 190,000 FON hotspots around the world .
For BT , the move makes its broadband offering more useful to customers , who can access the Internet from more places , and BT does n't need to build out a new wireless network itself .
BT's Gavin Patterson , a managing director , holds out hopes that the FON scheme can someday " cover every street in Britain . "
" We are giving our millions of Total Broadband customers a choice and an opportunity , " he added in a statement .
" If they are prepared to securely share a little of their broadband , they can share the broadband at hundreds of thousands of FON and BT Openzone hotspots today , without paying a penny . "
Assuming that FON 's routers really do keep home networks secure , this sounds like an excellent idea .
Given WiFi 's limited range , though , it may prove to be of limited value outside of urban areas , unless you like sitting with an open laptop in the front yard of total strangers .

Most of the recipient countries cannot afford brand - new equipment on their own ; the Philippines , Morocco and the Dominican Republican have been recent shoppers .
But first - world countries like Australia and Canada have picked up some cheap castoffs , as well .
There is no central site where all the weaponry is gathered for inspection by would - be buyers .
Instead the merchandise is offered on an “ as is , where is ” basis , with the buyer having to pay for shipping and repairs — which can sometimes make the bargain less appealing and accounts for why not all the merchandise moves .
Few shoppers , however , complain — and they often observe the hand - off of weapons in ceremonies in their home countries , with American officials in attendance .
“ We ’re grateful , ” said Sgt. Maj .
Irving Estrada , assistant to the military attaché of Guatemala .
His country has received used body armor , flight suits , boots and computers which were presented by the American ambassador at a ceremony in Guatemala City last April .
“ This is very important to us , ” said Sergeant Major Estrada .
“ Everything is useful and we use everything that we get . ”
The program is not without its critics , who say it contributes to a global arms race and may be a short - sighted way of winning friends .
“ Are n’t there more constructive ways for the United States to make friends ? ” asked Danielle Brian , executive director of the Project on Government Oversight , a watchdog group that studies Pentagon spending .
“ We are arming countries that otherwise would not afford to be armed .
If we want to make friends , we should have something better to offer . ”
Critics also say the tag sale are giveaway metaphors are not apt , and prefer to describe it in terms of a business giving out free samples .
The program , they say , gives nations a taste of weapons that they might like to purchase later , often with foreign aid from the United States .
To get ahead in life , you need to be in the business of selling .
If this statement makes you cringe , it is probably because the word “ sales ” evokes images of annoying telemarketers and pushy car dealers .
Relax , though , as this article is about a product so wonderful and special you should have no qualms in selling it .
The product ?
You .
There are endless situations in life where the key to success is the ability to sell yourself to others .
In your career , the ability to convince an interviewer that you are the best person for the job is critical .
When it comes to relationships , your ability to show your best qualities can be the crucial factor in clinching a date with the girl or guy you want .
When you think about it , if you cannot sell yourself as a person to others , you are going to have a difficult time selling them your ideas , your wishes , your needs , your ambitions , your skills , and your experience .
Despite the necessity of being able to sell yourself to others , for many people like myself it does not come naturally .
Introversion , shyness , and lack of self - worth are just a few of the obstacles that can potentially get in the way .
To overcome such obstacles , I suggest focusing on the following :
Be Sold on Yourself
This is the first , and perhaps most important , aspect to successfully selling yourself to others .
Unless it comes naturally , this is probably also the hardest .
Being sold on yourself comes down to this : you must be aware of your own self - worth .
This means you believe in yourself , have faith in yourself , and have confidence in yourself .
Being sold on yourself is not something that usually happens overnight .
For many years , I did not like myself .
I can , however , personally attest that it is possible to change your life and gain a sense of self - worth when there was once none .
If you struggle with your sense of self - worth , here are just 3 ideas that may help :
Live in such a way that you would want to be friends with yourself
Find some time to reflect on what you like about yourself .
If this seems hard , start with the smallest of attributes .
Do n’t do anything that will give you cause to feel ashamed later .
Have a Saleable Package
This article is predominately about letting others know about the inner contents of your package .
That being said , there is no getting around the fact that people judge others based on their appearance .
Some questions you may consider asking yourself are : am I looking after my appearance to the best of my ability ?
Are my clothes appropriate for the image I wish to project ?
Be Positive and Enthusiastic
Can you remember the last time you received poor customer service ?
Did the person look bored , disinterested , and as if they wanted to be anywhere but that place ?
Do n’t be that person .
Positivity and enthusiasm can both be developed , but once again it takes work .
Here are a few tips to help you :
Look for the best in people
Associate with positive people
Care deeply about something
See life as an adventure
Smile
Be Real and Authentic
Rather than being about who you appear to be , selling yourself is about letting others know who you are as a person .
For this reason , lies and half - truths are a recipe for disaster later down the line .
By telling the truth , you will earn both trust and respect which , in turn , will help you build a great reputation .
Not only that , it will make you feel good about yourself .
The last thing you want to do is sell yourself out by compromising your values and principles .

Bush 's watchdog for intelligence kept quiet for 5 1/2 years /
It failed to report any misdeeds in terror war until '06
2007-07-15 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
An independent oversight board created to identify intelligence abuses after the CIA scandals of the 1970s did not send any reports to the attorney general of legal violations during the first 5 1/2 years of the Bush administration 's counterterrorism effort , the Justice Department has told Congress .
Although the FBI told the board of a few hundred legal or rules violations by its own agents after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , the board did not identify which of them were indeed legal violations .
This spring , it forwarded reports of violations in 2006 , officials said .
The President 's Intelligence Oversight Board -- the principal civilian watchdog of the intelligence community -- is obligated under a 26 - year - old executive order to tell the attorney general and the president about any intelligence activities it believes " may be unlawful . "
The board was vacant for the first two years of the Bush administration .
The FBI sent copies of its violation reports directly to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
But the board 's mandate was to provide independent oversight , so the absence of such communications has led critics to question whether the board was doing its job .
" It 's now apparent that the IOB was not actively employed in the early part of the administration .
And it was a crucial period when its counsel would seem to have been needed the most , " said Anthony Harrington , who served as the board 's chairman for most of the Clinton administration .
Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , added : " It is deeply disturbing that this administration seems to spend so much of its energy and resources trying to find ways to ignore any check and balance on its authority and avoid accountability to Congress and the American public . "
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Friday that " the president expects every single person working in counterterrorism and intelligence strictly to follow the law -- and if there are instances where that has not occurred , either intentionally or non-intentionally , he expects it promptly to be corrected . "
She said the White House was relying on the presidentially appointed director of national intelligence to monitor problems .
Through five previous administrations , members of the board -- all civilians not employed by the government -- have been privy to some of America 's most secret intelligence operations and have served as a private watchdog against unpublicized abuses .
The subjects of their investigations and the resulting reports are nearly all classified .
The Bush administration first appointed board members in 2003 .
Since then , the CIA and the National Security Agency have been caught up in controversy over interrogation tactics at secret prisons , the transfer of prisoners to countries that use torture , and domestic wiretapping not reviewed by federal courts .
Until recently , the board had not told the attorney general about any wrongdoing .
" The attorney general has no record of receiving reports from the IOB regarding intelligence activities alleged to be potentially unlawful or contrary to executive order or presidential directive , " the Justice Department told the House Judiciary Committee in a May 9 letter .
White House officials said the board began forwarding reports of problems shortly thereafter .
White House officials declined to discuss the board 's interactions with President Bush , and said its members could not be interviewed for this report .
President Gerald Ford created the board in the mid-1970s after the Church Committee identified numerous abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies .
President Ronald Reagan made the board permanent with an executive order in 1981 and gave it the mission to identify legal violations .
Harrington said that under President Bill Clinton , the board sent reports of legal violations by intelligence agencies promptly to the attorney general .
Officials said it concluded that the administration showed poor judgment in supporting Iranian arms shipments to Bosnia , and it complained about the CIA 's policy of employing known torturers or killers as informants in Latin America .
Perino said that during the first two years of the Bush administration , a career intelligence officer at the White House collected and reviewed reports in which the FBI and other intelligence agencies self - disclosed violations of civil liberties and privacy safeguards .
The board 's three or four members -- it has alternated over the years -- are usually drawn from the larger President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , which advises the commander in chief on U.S. intelligence policy and performance .
The board now in place is led by former Bush economic adviser Stephen Friedman .
It includes Don Evans , friend of the president and a former Commerce secretary , former Adm. David Jeremiah and lawyer Arthur Culvahouse .
Perino said the board 's " original unique mission and primary oversight role has been supplemented " in recent years by new layers of government .
The administration now relies on the director of national intelligence -- a job created in 2005 -- to watch for abuses , along with presidentially appointed inspector generals .
As a result , Bush is considering changes to Reagan 's executive order , she said .
On Friday , the FBI and the Justice Department announced several reforms meant to strengthen internal oversight , including the creation of a legal " compliance office " inside the bureau and a review office inside the department that will regularly examine all violations .
Separately , Gonzales wrote the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , to defend his 2005 testimony that there had been no verified civil liberties abuses during the first three years of the efforts against terrorism .
The Washington Post reported last week that the FBI had sent Gonzales a half - dozen reports of violations of civil liberties and privacy safeguards before his testimony .
Gonzales wrote Friday that he did not consider the conduct in those reports to be abuses because the violations involved mistakes , not deliberate misconduct .
" My testimony was completely truthful , and I stand by that testimony , " he wrote .
BANGKOK , Sept. 28 — Myanmar ’s armed forces appeared to have succeeded today in sealing tens of thousands of protesting monks inside their monasteries , but they continued to attack bands of civilian demonstrators who challenged them in the streets of the main city , Yangon .
Witnesses and diplomats reached by telephone inside Myanmar said troops were now confronting and attacking smaller groups of civilians around the city , sometimes running after them through narrow streets , sometimes firing at protesting groups .
“ Today has been quieter than previous days , meaning far fewer protesters came out , but the military is being very quick to use violence , tear gas , guns and clubs to break it up , ” said the chief diplomat at the United States Embassy , Shari Villarosa .
Diplomats said there was no way to estimate the numbers of dead and wounded in Yangon or other cities , but they said it was certainly far higher than the number the junta has reported .
Were our ancestors water apes , hairless bipeds that lived an aquatic existence ?
Did Canadian inventor Troy Hurtubise really build an " Angel Light " that makes any object transparent when bathed in its glow ?
How come fish sometimes fall from the sky ?
Can pets actually predict earthquakes ?
These are some of the questions that scientists throughout history have seriously examined .
For two years , Mark Pilkington , the fantastic Fortean behind Strange Attractor Journal , explored these weird experiments , scientific failures , and downright kookiness in his column Far Out that appeared in The Guardian 's science supplement .
Now , he 's compiled those columns into a fantastic small book , Far Out : 101 Strange Tales from Science 's Outer Edge .
Each short entry tackles a single anomalous report or invention from science 's cabinet of curiosity : electronic voice phenomena , The Cerebrophone , the memory of water , Skinner 's Box , plant sentience , just to name a few .
My only complaint about this terrific text is that it's not much , much longer .

Conventional wisdom about the sexes — and most movies marketed to men under 24 — work from the premise that men’s and women ’s brains are just fundamentally different .
The medical spin on this has been that testosterone , in addition to providing extra oomph for muscles , is a key component in the wiring of the male brain .
The male brain is first exposed to testosterone in utero , changing basic brain biology and imposing masculinity .
Then during puberty , another wash of testosterone results in distinctly male thoughts — the fodder for all that guns - girls - and - parties cinema — in the previously testosterone - primed brain .
Deprive the brain of testosterone at either time and you risk perturbing the sublime development of maleness .
Well , it turns out that life may not be quite that simple — at least for mice .
A new study in Nature suggests that the brain pathways for male sexual behavior are also present in female mice , and with those pathways comes the potential for male behavior .
Even more intriguing is that the activation of these pathways appears to be regulated by the animal ’s sense of smell .
Mice , like many other animals , use chemicals known as pheromones to transmit sexual signals , among others .
Investigators have recently found that disabling the part of the nose that receives these signals — the vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) — produces some pretty strange effects on the way a mouse acts out its sex .
Males without a functioning VNO appear to have trouble distinguishing between male and female .
They will try to mate with either one and wo n’t fight other males .
This is certainly strange , but our existing model can live with it .
Maybe some pheromone turns on those testosterone - sculpted parts of the male brain .
No pheromone , no male behavior .
But when female mice do n’t have a functioning VNO , even stranger things begin to happen .
Like their male counterparts , these mice will try to mount both male and female mice and they engage in the peculiarly male ( and particularly attractive ) behaviors of butt sniffing and pelvic thrusting .
These female mice will also mate in the more traditional way .
However , their maternal instincts are altered : they spend less time with their pups and are less aggressive in defending their nests .
What does this mean for us ?
Well , human mating is a bit more complicated than it is for mice , and our perfumes have far less power over our brains ( whatever the beliefs of pushy department - store perfumers ) .
But it may hint that biological gender differences are a bit less hardwired and more flexible than the conventional wisdom suggests .
For now , let ’s just inhale deeply and say that these studies raise important questions about how far apart Mars and Venus truly are .

A letter from Eric , a reader , who elaborates on the theme of my column today on “ Dynasties and Democracy “ :
I wish to point out that there have been other American observers who noted the rise of dynastic politics in the United States .
To be specific : Kevin Phillips , in his book American Dynasty : Aristocracy , Fortune , and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush , published in 2004 .
The key point the book makes is that four generations of the Bush family have been involved with the rise of the national security state .
There have been other prominent political families throughout America history , but stronger parties and strong public sentiment kept it under control .
The Republican Party in the 14 elections between 1952 and 2004 , has nominated either Richard Nixon or a Bush family member on the presidential / vice presidential ticket in 11 of those elections .
This streak is unprecedented in American history .
Here are the details :
Â
Richard Nixon â€ “ 1952 VP , 1956 VP , 1960 Pres , 1968 Pres , 1972 Pres
George Herbert Walker Bush â€ “ 1980 VP , 1984 VP , 1988 Pres , 1992 Pres
George Walker Bush â€ “ 2000 Pres , 2004 Pres
Â
The three exceptions during the period : 1964 , 1976 , 1996
Â
The Democratic Party only has one streak that even approaches this in length :
Â
Franklin Delano Roosevelt â€ “ 1920 VP , 1932 Pres , 1936 Pres , 1940 , Pres , 1944 Pres
This fits in neatly with the premise of my piece : that the rise of politicalÂ dynasties is linked to our interventionist foreign policy .
Since the War Party took up residence in the GOP , the dynastic factor has weighedÂ heavily in their internal politics .
And of course the reign of “ Dr. Win - the - War ” fits the same pattern .
Are you ready to get out of debt ?
Run through these suggestions and you ’ll be better prepared to start your journey .
Admit your past mistakes – and work to correct them .
Let ’s face facts – we ’ve all made poor financial decisions .
It really does n’t matter what you did yesterday .
What really matters is what you do today ( and what you plan to do tomorrow ) .
Make a list of your current debts – ALL of them – and create a plan to pay them off .
Balance your checkbook – and find out how much money you actually have .
How much money do you have in your checking account ?
How about your savings account ?
I cannot overstate the importance of organized , accessible , reliable financial records .
You need to know how much money you have – right now – so that you can begin to get out of debt and change your future .
Commit to change – and send in an extra payment , right now .
If you are serious about getting out of debt , I challenge you to send an extra payment to one of your creditors , right now .
Seriously , log - in to your checking account or grab your checkbook , and make an extra payment .
If you can only make a payment of $ 1 , that ’s $ 1 of debt that will be gone , forever .
Decide to be different – and refuse to back up .
If you stop using your credit cards ( and forgo those wonderful rewards points ) , if you stop buying new cars ( and miss out on that awesome zero percent financing ) and if you keep your old television ( and miss out on 90 days , same - as - cash ) – your friends and family will begin to think that you are nuts .
Guess what ?
GOOD !
Being ‘ normal ’ is being ‘ broke ’ – and being ‘ broke ’ is being ‘ normal ’ .
I do n’t care how ‘ good ’ the deal is .
If you do n’t have the money , do n’t make the deal .
Challenge yourself to stick to your convictions and refuse to be moved by the comments of friends and family .
( Also , do n’t be surprised when , in two or three years , they start coming to YOU for advice ! )
Enjoy the process – and learn from your missteps .
Getting out of debt takes time , money , and discipline .
Learn to enjoy the simplicity of living without credit cards .
Focus on small victories and celebrate every dollar that you payoff .
Continually remind yourself of the long - term benefits of being debt free .
If you make a mistake , take a mental - note , and move on .
Remember , once you get out of debt , you will join a select group of human beings who are free from the burden of payments .
Polar Ice Cap Collapse
There have been a number of news stories published in the past several days reporting on the acceleration of the annual summer retreat of the Arctic ice cap .
The shrinkage is at its greatest extent in the month of September , before the colder winter temperatures start the refreezing process , but this has been a year like no other ever recorded :
As of September 9th , about 1.63 million square miles of sea ice remained — 20 % less than the lowest ever known — and it is still shrinking .
In order to illustrate the extent of the recession , I put together an animation using the daily images of sea ice concentration from the National Snow and Ice Data Center .

This huge area of ice - free ocean has been exposed for the first time .
The Northwest Passage is completely open , and the Northeast Passage across the top of Russia is blocked by only a thin tongue of ice .

All I want to do , ever , is play chess .
— Bobby Fischer
Between the ages of 14 and 18 , I wanted nothing more than to be the next Bobby Fischer .
Sure , I started a bit late by World Champion standards , but I was n’t going to let that slow me down .
I read several books on Fischer ’s life and games , including the most famous one written by the man himself , My 60 Memorable Games
.
When I was at school , I thought about chess .
When I was working , I thought about chess .
And during the rest of my waking hours , I was studying or playing chess .
I never became a World Champion , unfortunately , but I did enjoy a great deal of success .
I won my section of the 1994 Canadian Open .
Within a couple years , I was beating my uncle , a National Master , with increasing regularity .
I even scored a tournament win over FIDE Master Jack Yoos , who was and still is one of the top players in the country .
Rating - wise , I ascended to the top two percent of all competitive players .
I ’ve found myself able to repeatedly make this leap into the upper echelons of almost anything I do .
This might sound like bragging , and if I were issuing these examples in a look - what - I - can - do - and - you - ca n’t sort of way , it would be bragging .
But the truth is , you ’re probably a lot more intelligent , disciplined , articulate , and talented than I am .
The only thing I ’ve got going for me is the thing that matters most , the thing that can turn any dream into reality , and any Clark Kent into Superman .
The key to achieving the biggest , hairiest , most audacious goals in life is obsession .
The Genius Myth
Genius .
It ’s a word .
What does it really mean ?
If I win I ’m a genius .
If I do n’t , I ’m not .
— Bobby Fischer
I do n’t believe in genius .
I do believe in talent , but I think it ’s an entirely optional component of achieving the impossible .
In my opinion , the idea that some people are just supernaturally gifted is a fear - based model of human achievement ; it gives second through last place a convenient safety net to avoid having their egos bruised too badly .
Instead of taking responsibility for an inferior work ethic , a weaker effort in learning from their mistakes , or even the completely wrong choices they ’ve made to pursue dreams they ’re not really passionate about , they can simply say that the guy who won is a “ genius ” .
But let ’s consider this rationally .
Continuing with the chess example , an obvious question arises :
How can you be a “ natural - born chess player ” ?
How can nature equip you at birth to excel at something as completely artificial as chess ?
And even if nature somehow did equip certain people to excel at an artificial invention like chess , what are the odds that , generation after generation , those “ extremely rare talents ” also coincidentally keep stumbling on what nature built them for ?
Of all the possible fields of human endeavour , and the supposed rarity of the geniuses that inhabit the top levels , should n’t we see at least some sports in some generations where the top levels take a huge dip in ability , because none of the “ extremely rare talents ” of those generations found what they were really talented at ?
Of course , that does n’t happen .
The highest levels of almost every discipline in which human achievement can be objectively measured ( e.g. competitive sports ) are actually increasing , year after year , generation after generation .
But there ’s yet another astounding coincidence .
Not only does every generation apparently give birth to these amazingly rare talents , and not only do these superachievers somehow keep figuring out what they ’re good at , but they all seem to discover their talent as a young child and follow a strikingly similar path of single - minded devotion .
For example , Bobby Fischer is considered by many to be one of the greatest chess players who ever lived .
But consider how he got there :
He started playing chess at age six .
By age seven , he already showed a lack of interest in all but those who shared his passion for the game .
He became so preoccupied with chess at an early age that his mother took him to a mental hospital to have him looked at .
He was constantly getting in trouble at school for studying chess during class .
At 16 , he dropped out of high school to focus entirely on chess .
When he started living on his own , he devoted 10 – 14 hours a day to studying chess , and did almost nothing else .
He was n’t a genius .
He was a maniac .
It ’s incredibly hard to do what Fischer did , but it ’s not incredibly hard to imagine that superhuman effort equals superhuman results .
Indeed , every World Champion since Fischer started playing chess between the ages of four and eight years old and they all followed a similar work ethic , with perhaps a little less eccentricity than Fischer himself .
Even more interesting is the well - known story of the Polgar sisters , Susan , Sofia , and Judit .
Their father , Laszlo , a Hungarian psychologist , believed that genius was made , not born .
He set out to find a wife to help prove his hypothesis and that ’s how he met Klara , a schoolteacher .
They had three daughters , all of whom were homeschooled and trained from the beginning to be chess champions .
The results were nothing short of amazing .
In 1989 , at age 14 , Sofia won a strong grandmaster tournament in Rome , with a score of 8.5/9 , producing by far the highest tournament performance rating of any player ever , man or woman .
Susan Polgar became a Grandmaster and a Women ’s World Champion .
The youngest sister , Judit , became ranked among the top ten players in the world , making her by far the strongest female chess player in history .
As Carlin Flora asks in her article The Grandmaster Experiment , “ What are the chances [ … ] that three girls destined for stellar achievement would be born to a man convinced that geniuses are made ? ”
In fields where the measures of success are subjective , like art , music , writing , or acting , the word genius is thrown around even more liberally , giving it even less reason to be taken seriously .
I ’m not claiming that anything I say above is scientific proof one way or the other — it ’s no more conclusive than anything that the Church of Sciencology would try to sell you — but I ’m fairly certain that nobody ever became a World Champion at anything by convincing themselves that poor genetics relegated them to a life of mediocrity .
Your beliefs have a profound impact on your results .
The most empowering belief you can have for achieving any goal , and the one which will give you the greatest results , is the belief that hard work is the true nuclear weapon .
The Power of Maniacal Determination
Action trumps intelligence .
If you want to get smart , get doing .
In my experience , few things are impossible if you ’re willing to exert an extraordinary , almost fucked up amount of effort to make your dreams come true .
True genius goes by the name of obsession .
But what is obsession , exactly ?
And how do you cultivate it to achieve great things ?
I define obsession as the intersection of passion and commitment .
Obsession provides the fuel to put in the necessary work to get where you want to go .
It leaves no opportunity for failure , and makes you work extremely hard to learn from every mistake , even when things already seem to be going well .
Obsession gives you the courage to constantly venture outside your comfort zone , changing your strategies and taking new risks — anything to gain a new level of insight .
Obsession maximizes your resourcefulness and can turn a hopeless position into a draw .
Or even a win .
I ’d go even further and say that the only way you can ever know the full extent of your potential in anything is by practicing an unshakable commitment to achieve the desired result .
If you give anything less than every fibre of your being , you ’ll never know if your business idea sucked , your training methods lacked effectiveness , or if you just did n’t try hard enough .
Cultivating obsession requires understanding the forces that guide our actions .
In Awaken the Giant Within
, Tony Robbins suggests that all human behaviour is guided by our desire to avoid pain and gain pleasure .
I can think of many examples in my own life of how this principle has shaped my results .
In chess , for example , I got a huge amount of satisfaction from winning .
There was a profound joy in working really hard on my game , gaining new insights , and seeing my results rapidly improve .
Elsewhere , my goal of losing weight several years ago was made easy by the fact that I was so overweight that I developed stretch marks .
I was devastated when I found out what they were — permanent scars — and my desire to avoid more of them was so great that I felt no other option than to lose the weight .
( If you have them , they never go away , but the good news is that they fade to invisible when you get skinny . )
An obsessive drive comes from setting goals in activities for which you associate massive pleasure to success and massive pain to failing .
For me , this has always been a pretty natural process .
I find my passions by trying a lot of different things , and a natural polarity seems to emerge that pushes me strongly towards what I want , and strongly repels me from what I do n’t want .
This is actually one of the few times where the ego can come in handy and act as a catalyst for growth .
The immense pleasure we get from winning , getting promoted , or seeing our business take off , and the massive pain we associate to losing , getting fired , or crashing our startup into the ground , are often fuelled by our need to protect our notion of who we think we are , i.e. , our egoic identity .
In Awaken the Giant Within , Robbins offers a technique he calls Neuro - Associative Conditioning , where he teaches you how to consciously wire the right kinds of pain and pleasure sensations into your nervous system to create the drive and zeal that will carry you towards your purpose .
I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a more structured , analytical approach to personal growth .
My own latest obsession is the game of Go. I ’m deeply fascinated by the fact that I have absolutely no understanding of how this game works .
A
Go board is almost six times the size of a chessboard , and even the best computer
Go programs in the world are barely stronger than a good novice .
This is much different from chess , where the best computers can beat world champions .
But do I have the passion and commitment , the obsession to generate the kind of results I want ?
I ’ve only just started , so I do n’t yet know .
I ’ve committed myself to learning Go for 30 days to see how it feels .
No matter what , I want to study the game for at least one hour per day , and play at least one game a day .
I believe that one month will be enough to show me whether my interest in this game is more than skin deep .
So what are your goals ?
Are you obsessed with achieving them or are they just nice - to - haves ?
If you still have n’t found that passion that lights you up , what have you tried so far ?
What could you do next ?
Feel free to join me on a 30 - day exploration of something new .
Good things come to those who wait .
Great things come to those who do n’t .

The astronauts are scheduled to make five spacewalks
ISS spacewalk
Scott Parazynski and Doug Wheelock moved about the 14 - tonne unit as it was hauled by robotic arm from Discovery 's cargo bay and put in a temporary site .
The " Harmony " node will be locked into a permanent position once the shuttle has left the station .
Harmony gives station crews 18 % more room in which to move about .
It is the first expansion of living and working space since 2001 .
It will provide a passageway between three science laboratories : the existing US Destiny lab ; the European Space Agency 's Columbus module ; and the Japanese Kibo experimental units .
Safety inspection
Built in Italy by the company Thales Alenia Space , Harmony is 7 m by 4.6 m ( 23 ft by 15ft ) .
The installation was being led by Italian astronaut and mission specialist Paolo Nespoli .
It has been attached to the US Unity module for now but will be moved to the end of the Destiny unit in due course .
Shuttle Discovery performed a back - flip as it approached the ISS , allowing crew members aboard the station to inspect its wings and nose for any launch damage .
The shuttle then docked with the orbiting space platform high above the Earth , both travelling at 28,000 km / h ( 17,400mph )
On Wednesday , astronauts used a robot arm to check the shuttle 's wings and nose for signs of damage in what has become a routine inspection since the loss of space shuttle Columbia in 2003 .
Nasa engineers did not spot anything significant in a preliminary look at images captured during Wednesday 's examination , said John Shannon , head of the mission management team .

The US is the world 's second - largest producer of cotton
The World Trade Organisation ruling is a victory for Brazil 's cotton industry and for West African states which say the payments harmed their producers .
Brazil hailed the ruling , saying US subsidies had hit world prices , hurting farmers in Brazil and elsewhere .
But US officials believe the payments comply with international trade rules .
Washington is expected to make an appeal against the ruling .
Roberto Azevedo , the Brazilian foreign ministry 's trade chief , said that the three - member WTO compliance panel had upheld the findings of its interim report released in July .
" It was n't changed , " he told the Associated Press ( AP ) news agency just after the ruling was released confidentially to US and Brazilian officials in Geneva .
The office of the US Trade Representative in Washington confirmed the news , saying the US was " very disappointed " .
Brazil has reserved the right to impose annual sanctions of up to $ 4bn on the United States but would probably seek less in retaliatory measures because the US has removed some of the offending subsidies , AP notes .
Oxfam official Gawain Kripke told the BBC that the ruling would also have a beneficial impact on African cotton farmers , if Brazil is successful in reducing American cotton subsidies .
But if they are not then small countries , like Mali or Burkina Faso , would n't really hurt American producers very much .
" The truth is that it takes a bigger country to really make the US comply , because the market has to be big enough that the US is worried about it , " he said .
A peaceful demonstration at the corner of Curlew Road and US 19 in Palm Harbor attracted no less than five squad cars due to the presence of a sign deemed " obscene " ( the sign said " Fuck Bush " ) .
In yet another display of heavy handed police tactics , the protester was arrested even though he had put down the sign and followed the " orders " of the cops .
According to a St. Petersburg Times article , " sheriff 's deputies said [ the activist ] stood in the road forcing cars to steer around him . "

Wonders of the world .
How many have you seen ?
Travel the world in search of destinations certain to inspire .
Religion has always been used to sanctify inequality here on Earth , in the present no less than in the past .
By teaching their followers that they are God ’s chosen rulers , religious authorities can accustom the flock to obedience and ascend to positions of power without the consent of the majority .
The fundamentally oligarchic and anti-democratic nature of most established religions , in which the church leaders choose their own successors , testifies to this .
These anti-democratic beliefs are all too readily exploited to justify the most horrendous abuses of power .
One of the most obnoxious and sickening tendencies of fundamentalist religion is the way in which its leaders use their supposedly God - given status to claim the pretense of moral superiority over their followers , even when they are the ones in the wrong .
Two recent criminal cases bear witness to this phenomenon .
First , take Warren Jeffs , the fugitive Mormon cult leader who was captured last year and whose trial has now begun .
Jeffs was the patriarch of a polygamist Mormon enclave in the deserts of Utah , and from all accounts ruled with an iron fist .
Women in this community live like prisoners , indoctrinated into absolute obedience from a very early age , and are usually “ given ” in marriage to far older men who already have many wives before they are old enough to give consent .
It is this practice that has led Jeffs to be charged as an accomplice to rape .
A witness for the prosecution , a former member of Jeffs ’ cult who , at the age of 14 , was married to an older male cousin without her consent and then raped , gave horrifying testimony of the ordeal she endured :
“ I ca n’t do this , please do n’t , ” she said she told her husband .
“ I was sobbing .
My whole entire body was shaking I was so scared .
He did n’t stop .
He just laid me onto the bed and had sex . ”
Afterward , the woman said she felt dirty and took two bottles of painkillers .
“ I just wanted to die .
I did n’t want to deal with ( my husband ) anymore .
I did n’t want to deal with Warren , or the prophet , or my mother …
I was so hurt by them , ” she said .
When she sought out Jeffs , the only authority she knew , and pleaded for help , he harshly rebuked her and sent her back to her abusive marriage :
“ I told him ( Jeffs ) I was sorry I had failed so severely …
He told me that I needed to repent , that I was not living up to my vows , I was not being obedient , I was not being submissive and that was what my problem was , ” she recounted .
Jeffs told her to go home “ and give myself mind , body , and soul ” to her husband .
Thankfully , this woman later escaped Jeffs ’ cult , but there are doubtless many young women who still suffer in its clutches .
Criminal considerations aside , Jeffs ’ awful reaction to this woman ’s cry for help – telling her to go back and submit to her rapist husband , and blaming her for not being submissive to his wishes , rather than giving her shelter and seeking legal help as a good person would have done – shows clearly that he totally lacks empathy and human feeling .
Religious authorities , who see human beings as pawns to be moved around at whim , too often take such a stance .
On another note , there are further developments in the story of Thomas Weeks , the megachurch leader accused of savagely beating his estranged wife in a parking lot .
In his first statement since his arrest , Weeks asked his fellow believers not to pass judgment and then , in an act of supreme arrogance , announced that he forgave his wife .
For what ?
He should be begging her forgiveness , not acting as if she did something wrong and he was graciously choosing to pardon her !
Fortunately , we live in a society that has separation of church and state , and a civil justice system that does not recognize any accused person ’s delusions about being the anointed servant of God ’s will .
Still , even when facing lengthy prison terms , it ’s incredible that these religious leaders continue to act as if their alleged victims , not they , are the ones who have done something wrong .
As both these stories show , women especially suffer the results of this , since they are most often on the receiving end of theological justifications for inequality .
LATE -BREAKING UPDATE ( 9/25 ) : Warren Jeffs has been convicted and faces up to life in prison .
Oh , they say that ’s not what they ’re doing , but let ’s take a look at the facts .
In its never - ending quest to one - up the Americans on who can violate their citizens ’ rights quickest , the EU is going to be collecting all sorts of arcane , and troubling , information on American air travelers , just like the US is collecting on Europeans ( with the EU ’s consent ) .
The info they ’re going to collect may include :
The data , including names , telephone numbers , credit card information and travel itinerary , would be sent to E.U. member states so they could assess passenger risk for counterterrorism purposes , according to a draft copy obtained by The Washington Post .
The European Commission proposal would allow the data to be kept for 13 years or longer if used in criminal investigations and intelligence operations .
It would cover all passengers flying into and out of Europe , not just Americans … .
Under the proposal by Franco Frattini , European commissioner for freedom , security and justice , airlines or computerized reservation systems would send at least 19 pieces of data on each passenger to data - analysis units set up by each state .
The data fields also would include e-mail addresses , names of accompanying passengers and open ones for such special requests as meals or medical service .
Under the proposal , no personal data that could reveal race , ethnicity , political opinions , religion , trade union membership or health or sex - life information could be transmitted .
Any such data that was shared would have to be deleted immediately by the data - analyzing units , the proposal says .
Yeah , no data about your ethnicity , religion , health or sex - life will be transmitted .
But they will collect and retain data about any “ medical service ” you need , and somehow that wo n’t tell them anything about your “ health . ”
Are they high ?
That kind of bald - faced lie is usually the kind of thing you expect from the Bush administration , rather than Europeans .
But let ’s examine this further .
They ’ll collect no information on your religion , they say , but they will collect info on your special meal requests like , oh , I do n’t know , the fact that you want a kosher meal .
No , does n’t suggest that you ’re Jewish at all .
And in any case , European governments keeping databases of who ’s a Jew – I mean , what kind of damage can that do anyway , right ?
As for your sex - life information , the fact that you always travel with your same - sex friend who has a different last name but the same home phone , and you charge the tickets on one card when you fly to Ibiza , does n’t suggest anything either .
Jon Stewart to Gen. Sanchez : ' Now you tell us ! '

Print This Email This The Daily Show turned its attention on Tuesday to General Ricardo Sanchez , who commanded coalition forces in Iraq after the invasion but is now speaking out against Washington 's policies .
Jon Stewart began by showing clips from 2003 of Sanchez saying , " There is tremendous progress going on in Iraq .
...
We 're not in a quagmire .
The progress is unbelievable . "
" I like the cut of his soundbite , " said Stewart enthusiastically .
" He 's optimistic !
Hey , what 's he doing now ? "
He then played a current clip of Sanchez intoning , " There is no question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight . "
" Apparently one of the medals General Sanchez received was for distinguished service in the art of bullshitting everybody , " Stewart commented wryly .
Stewart further showed Sanchez complaining that " there has been a glaring , unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders ... the National Security Council has been a failure ... there is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope . "
" Why did n't you tell us this back then ?
demanded Stewart .
He got his answer from another clip , in which Sanchez stated , " The last thing that you want is for currently serving general officers to stand up against our political leadership . "
" Let 's look at Sanchez 's hierarchy of bad things , " Stewart summarized .
" The worst thing ever ?
Standing up to political leadership .
And that 's preferable to -- uh , what 's the phrase ? -- ' a nightmare with no end in sight . ' "
General Ricardo Sanchez retired in 2006 after questions questions had been raised regarding his role in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal .
According to the New York Times , Sanchez 's " own role as commander in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib scandal leaves him vulnerable to criticism that he is shifting the blame from himself to the administration that ultimately replaced him and declined to nominate him for a fourth star , forcing his retirement . "

NOVEMBER 27--NBC late night host Carson Daly , who today announced that he is returning to the air in the face of the ongoing writers strike , wants his friends and family to help with his scab efforts .
In an e-mail , Daly asked a small group of contacts to call in ' suggested jokes ' to a telephone hotline , noting that he would ' play some , most , or all of your jokes on the air . '
The bit , Daly stressed , was not meant to ' make fun ' of his striking writers .
He added that his goal was to just ' play a fun collage of random people trying to ' help me out . ''
The bit 's set - up , Daly wrote in his Sunday night e-mail ( a copy of which you 'll find here ) was that ' the devastating writers strike ' led to 'A TON of my friends and family ... calling me , leaving messages , offering their help with jokes because they know that I do n't have any writers working and hosting a latenight show without them will be nearly impossible for me . '
At the bottom of his note , Daly included brief messages to some of his associates seeking jokes from some of their ' celeb friends , ' golfing pals , or ' random peeps . '
As of this writing , Carson 's Joke Hotline is open for submissions .
We 've fogged out Daly 's AOL address as well as the names and addresses of the e-mail 's recipients , which included Daly 's mother , father , sister , the executive producer of ' Last Call with Carson Daly , ' and the performer 's New York doctor .
Scott London , a Daly pal who got the e-mail , told TSG that he would gladly submit a joke to the hotline , adding that the performer 's gambit was not a bid to draft friends into a strikebreaking effort .

Olbermann : Surge debate already over , Bush wins ' shell game ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday September 7 , 2007
Print This Email This Since last spring , the White House has been saying the nation should reserve debate about America 's presence in Iraq and the possibility of withdrawal until after General Petraeus delivers his report on the effectiveness of the surge .
However , according to Keith Olbermann , " Today we learned that by then it will have been too late .
...
The president has already made up his mind .
We are staying . "
In an interview with USA Today on Wednesday , White House chief of staff John Bolten confirmed that " Bush wants to make 'it possible for his successor  whichever party that successor is from  to have a sustained presence in the Middle East . ' "
" America 's purpose in Iraq now officially , just to be in Iraq , " Olbermann commented .
Olbermann 's larger point , however , concerned the tactics by which the administration regularly avoids any debate of its policies .
" Whether it be about disbanding the [ Iraqi ] army or about the surge , we have seen this congenital aversion to debate before , " he stated .
" The shell game is an old and practiced one , the nation debating withdrawal while the administration has only seemed to . "
Olbermann reminded viewers of events last fall , when Bush indicated he was taking the Baker - Hamilton Report seriously and considering all options , including the possibility of a drawdown .
White House press secretary Tony Snow promised reporters , " Wait until you see the whole package , and then the debate will begin . "
But just days later , the surge was announced , effectively forestalling debate of any kind .
The same thing is happening now with the build - up to the Petraeus Report .
" The administration is expected to cite a 75 % decrease in sectarian attacks in Iraq , " Olbermann stated .
" That sounds great , does it not ?
But it appears to have been accomplished by severely tightening the definition of a sectarian attack . "
For example , mass bombings are no longer counted in the totals , only isolated murders .
Olbermann was joined by Newsweek editor and political analyst Jonathan Alter , who called the claim of a 75 % reduction " the big lie " and " a joke " and said " they 're cooking the books yet again . "
" We 're going to be sold a bill of goods in the next couple of weeks , " Alter concluded .
" The Democrats have been cowed by this minimal progress .
...
They 're going to have -- and deserve -- real problems with the Democratic base for not showing more guts on Iraq this fall .
September was supposed to be the moment of truth .
It 's not going to work out that way . "

Russian Police Crush Another Opposition Protest
November 25 , 2007 ( RFE / RL ) --
Riot police in St. Petersburg have broken up a demonstration by a loose alliance of opposition groups and detained dozens of opposition activists .
It was the second time in as many days that Russian police had dispersed a crowd gathered to express its opposition to the Kremlin and demand fair elections , with the first action targeting more than 1,000 marchers in the capital on November 24 .
Both the Moscow and St. Petersburg marches were organized by Other Russia , a broad anti-Putin coalition of mainstream politicians , leftists , and nationalists .
RFE / RL's Russian Service said the detainees in St. Petersburg included Union of Rightist Forces ( SPS ) leader Nikita Belykh and Olga Kurnosova , a local leader of Garry Kasparov 's United Civil Front .
Police also arrested and subsequently released former SPS leader Boris Nemtsov , who was last week proposed as a possible unity candidate for the March presidential election .
Nemtsov , a former Kremlin insider , and Belykh are registered SPS candidates in December 2 elections to the State Duma .
The pro-Putin Unified Russia party is widely expected to dominate that vote .
The Council of Europe 's secretary - general responded with concern over official actions in one of the council 's 47 member states .
" I am very concerned about the arrests of Garry Kasparov , Boris Nemtsov , and a number of their supporters in Moscow and St. Petersburg over the weekend , " Council of Europe Secretary - General Terry Davis said in a statement .
Davis noted that Russia is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights guaranteeing freedom of assembly and added , " These are preconditions for a real democracy . "
About 10 opposition activists were reportedly beaten and many others arrested when authorities moved in after hundreds of demonstrators defied a ban against rallying near St. Petersburg 's historic Winter Palace .
The protesters , who were wearing white carnations to show their peaceful intent , were stopped immediately after starting off toward the rally from the local headquarters of the Yabloko Party .
Police charged the group after someone in the crowd unfurled a black flag of the radical National Bolshevik Party , seizing people and beating them with batons .
Opposition organizers had warned that agents provocateurs might try to spur the police to action .
Other Russia sources initially said that 300 people were detained .
Other reports suggested that number was between 100 and 200 .
Boris Nadezhdin , secretary of the presidium of the SPS political council , told RFE / RL's Russian Service after the incident that his party will continue its effort to counter what he described as the Kremlin 's strong - arm tactics .
" The gist of the matter is the following :
If previously it was groups of activists in the regions who were arrested , now , without legal grounds and despite all laws , the authorities have decided to seize the leadership of the Union of Rightist Forces , " Nadezhdin said .
" Of course , we wo n't stop .
If the president personally declares us the enemy and law enforcement organs detain our leadership , that just proves that we 're on the right path .
We will just increase our criticism of Unified Russia and Putin 's program .
It is not possible to detain everybody .
We have tens of thousands of people everywhere in the country . "
Authorities Pounce
Former chess champion Kasparov was among those arrested in Moscow on November 24 , after police halted an estimated 1,000 - 2,000 protesters hoping to march to the headquarters of the Central Election Commission .
Kasparov was sentenced to five days in jail for leading an opposition protest and resisting arrest .
The Central Election Commission has barred Other Russia candidates from the December elections .
Police have broken up several so - called Dissenters '
Marches in the past year , beating demonstrators with truncheons and detaining many .
Kremlin officials say the marches are aimed at attracting the attention of the West and that the demonstrators are a mixed bag of marginal politicians with little public support .
Putin , ranked by opinion polls as the most popular politician in Russia , is credited by supporters for cementing political stability and presiding over the longest economic boom for a generation .
The KGB veteran has vowed to step down as president when Russia elects a new president in March , as the constitution bars him from seeking a third consecutive term .
But Putin has said he will use the Unified Russia party to preserve influence , and a seemingly well - orchestrated campaign has emerged that professes millions of Russians ' support for him to remain in power as " national leader . "
Putin is heading Unified Russia 's candidate list , and the party is set to win a strong majority in the polls .
A recent RFE / RL poll suggested that nearly two - thirds of voting - age Russians do not think December 's Duma elections will be conducted honestly , while fewer than one in five thinks the results will reflect the true will of the electorate .
' Another Black Day '
Also on November 24 , police in Russia 's southern Republic of Ingushetia used force to break up an antigovernment protest .
Several hundred people gathered in the republican capital , Nazran , to protest against unexplained kidnappings , police violence , and economic woes .
The reports said 100 protesters were detained .
Earlier in the day , Oleg Orlov , who chairs the Human Rights Center Memorial , said masked armed men in uniform dragged him and three journalists from the federal REN - TV television channel out of their hotel , beat them , and drove them out of Nazran .
The four -- who were later released -- were there to cover a protest against the Ingush government .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) said the abductions had a " clear political motive . "
Amnesty International called on Russian authorities to launch an investigation .
The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights called November 24 " another black day for human rights and democracy in Russia . "

Almost $ 268 billion was paid last year in subsidies to farmers in the 30 mainly rich countries of the OECD , down from $ 281 billion in 2005 .
This huge support , both directly from taxpayers and indirectly through higher prices paid by consumers , fell from 29 % of total farm receipts to 27 % .
The drop was mainly because of higher world food prices , which reduced the need to prop up domestic prices , rather than changes in policy .
Even so , crop and livestock prices in OECD countries were on average 21 % higher than world market prices in 2006 .
The level of support varied widely , from 1 % of farm receipts in New Zealand to more than 60 % in Switzerland .
In America it amounted to 11 % , whereas in the EU it came to 32 % .
Eric Wilkinson , the producer of the independent film " The Man from Earth " , wrote an email to RLSlog in which he thanks them for the free promotion they gave him .
" In the future , I will not complain about file sharing " he wrote , " when I make my next picture , I just may upload the movie on the net myself ! "
All the attention for his film was boosted by a positive review on RLSlog , a weblog that reviews some of the new releases on BitTorrent .
It turns out that a lot of people who downloaded the movie off BitTorrent liked the movie , as they started to write positive reviews on Amazon , IMDB and other websites .
Wilkinson was pleasantly surprised by all the attention .
He explained in his email to RLSlog that the people who illegally downloaded his film actually helped to promote it .
He writes : “ Our independent movie had next to no advertising budget and very little going for it until somebody ripped one of the DVD screeners and put the movie online for all to download .
Most of the feedback from everyone who has downloaded “ The Man From Earth ” has been overwhelmingly positive .
People like our movie and are talking about it , all thanks to piracy on the net ! ”
To illustrate this , on IMDB the film received close to 700 votes with an average rating of 8.2 which makes it one of the most popular movies of the last 2 weeks .
Wilkinson continues to praise the pirates and adds : “ What you guys have done here is nothing short of amazing .
In the future , I will not complain about file sharing .
YOU HAVE HELPED PUT THIS LITTLE MOVIE ON THE MAP !!!!
When I make my next picture , I just may upload the movie on the net myself ! ”
This example once again illustrates what a powerful promotion tool filesharing networks are , especially for independent productions with a small budget .

hand , to record the event for posterity .

But far from being embarrassed by her behaviour , Samantha has become something of a poster girl for a generation of hard - drinking ladettes .
Once she had sobered up enough to operate her computer , the art student could hardly wait to post the offending photographs on Facebook , the internet social networking site , for everyone to see .
" I find it funny , " says Samantha .
" If you can't laugh at yourself , who can you laugh at ? "
Meanwhile , over on video - sharing site YouTube a click or two quickly brings up a segment of footage entitled " Twenty Six Second Bottle of Wine " .
And while the production techniques and cheesy backing - track certainly
wo n't win any Oscars , 18 - year - old Colette Murray certainly lives up to the billing - downing three - quarters of a litre of strong alcohol in less than half a minute .
What happens next one can only imagine but when the camera cuts back to the Scottish teenager , five minutes have passed and the booze has had the inevitable effect .
Huddled in the corner of a sofa she is seemingly unconscious , unable to move .
Idiotic behaviour ?
Undoubtedly .
Exceptional ?
Far from it .
In villages , towns and cities the length and breadth of Britain , women are matching men drink for drink - with shocking consequences .

The numbers dying at an early age from alcohol abuse have almost doubled in 15 years , while unplanned teenage pregnancies and alcohol - fuelled female crime have all soared .
But what makes it so much more depressing is the way in which this behaviour is increasingly being glorified as an " achievement " - something to be celebrated , a way of enhancing one 's social standing .
And , of course , in the 21st century , what better way to spread the word than through the internet ?
" There is nothing surprising with young people going out for a drink - I think most people have done it , " explains Frank Furedi , professor of sociology at the University of Kent .
" But there is a problem if young people are using drunkenness itself as a way of reaching out and communicating , of forging camaraderie and bonds .
" People have always wanted to be noticed but in the past it was by the way you dressed , the job you did , the impression you made by the way you talked and the language you used .
" Today it is all about posting a picture on the internet and stating : ' Hey , do n't I look outrageous . '
" It 's very sad , almost tragic , that young people feel they have to become caricatures of themselves and go to such desperate lengths for the simple sake of being noticed . "
Of all the online groups dedicated to the glorification of female inebriation , " 30 Reasons Girls Should Call It A Night " is almost certainly the most popular with 150,000 members worldwide .
Part of the Facebook phenomenon ( 6.5 million active users in the UK alone and growing by the day ) , it was set up by an American student and as its name suggests has as its basis a 30 - strong list of telltale signs that the " sisterhood " should recognise as being indicative of home - time .
They include having " no idea where your friends are " , sitting down and the room starting to spin , passing out at a party and waking up with " writing all over your face and limbs " , making out with five different guys , stripping off and falling over .
The site has clearly hit a nerve with its target audience .

Members are able to post their own comments on the site and tens of thousands have done so .
There 's Stephanie from Portsmouth : " OH MY GOD !
I need to have these reasons tattooed down my arm - I think over the course of the weekend I could at least check off 20 of them - he , he , he . "
And Becky from the Midlands : " The falling down one happened to me in Magaluf - I ended up with blood all down my arm - it did n't hurt ' till I noticed it HA ! "
Then there are the so - called discussion boards where users can post their observations under specific headings such as : " Funniest / Stupidest things you did while drunk . "
Over to you , Purdy , from Nottingham : " When I was 18 me and my friend told a stag party that we were lap dancers .
" We ended up doing the stupidest moves ever and we still do n't know how but we ended waking up with about £ 100 stuffed in our bras . "
Or how about What Age Did You Start Drinking ? , a topic that Vicki , a British public school girl , has contributed to : " I think it would have to be on a leavers ' trip in Year 8 !!
So age about 12/13 !!!
Went down hill from there !! "
But most eye - catching are the 5,000 - odd pictures posted on the site .
These include women , the majority identified by name , vomiting in toilets or over themselves , collapsing on the ground , urinating in public or inadvertently exposing themselves .
Some of the images are shocking .
Most are deeply depressing .
And what is extraordinary is that the majority of these pictures are posted onto the web by the subjects themselves .
Professor Furedi believes social networking sites are used by young people to signal that they are " out there " and that they want to be noticed .
" Although there is now a fairly deeply entrenched drinking culture amongst young people where basically people drink for its own sake , it is also being used as a way to show people what a daring , risk - taking , funky young person they are , " he says .
" Part of the statement young women are conveying is that they are as daring and as laddish as young men are .
" But at the same time the way young women get plastered and binge drink is a little bit different .
" In the case of men there is a long tradition of demonstrating that you are one of the lads and that you do n't care about the consequences .
" With young women it is almost a way of making a statement that you are in control of your identity , like a positive affirmation of who you are . '
The existence of the " 30 Reasons ... " group on Facebook site only become more widely known earlier this week .
After details of it were revealed in the Mail a number of other publications picked up on it and it was soon making headlines around the world .
Bizarrely , many of the women who had posted their pictures on the site - a public forum - were outraged to find themselves and their behaviour being discussed and dissected .
Ashley Spellmeyer , an American pictured seemingly unconscious in an empty bath , is typical : " I do n't think this is funny at all , it 's only funny to everyone else .
" I 'm not like that on a typical night or at all any more and it was posted jokingly .
Scroll down for more ...
" I would n't care so much if my name was n't turned into national smut .
" I do n't want to risk losing the person I love or embarrassing my parents . "
Another , who had posted a comment on the site which was reproduced in the Press , responded angrily : " I only joined the group in the first place because the comments on it made me laugh and reminded me of either something my friends have done or I MIGHT have done about two years ago . "
As for Samantha Jenkins , the girl pictured down and out on her 21st birthday in June , she insists that her behaviour was exceptional - and therefore justifiable .
" We had gone out for a few at a local pub , but in the end it did n't turn out to be a few , " the third - year student at the University College for the Creative Arts , in Rochester , Kent , told the Daily Mail .
" Everyone just bought me a drink .
It was just drink after drink that got bought for me .
" On the way back home , outside a friend 's house , I tried to get out of the car and I fell over .
" I do not go out and get that drunk all the time , that is the most drunk I have ever been .
" I think a 21st birthday is a night you can go out and get drunk .
" I find it funny because it was a one - off .
Everyone has times in their lives when they have one - offs . "
Doubtless some will agree , and some will disagree .
But it 's a big step to understand why anyone would subsequently want to post evidence of their behaviour on the internet for all the world to see .
Samantha explains that a friend had introduced her to the " 30 Reasons ... " website and that she decided to put her pictures on there herself " for a laugh " .
She thought nothing more of it until earlier this week when the site gained wider notoriety .
" I found out it was in the newspapers because I had lots of messages from people that I had never met before saying things like ' you must have been really gutted that your photos were in the paper ' , " she says .
" I was shocked but did laugh it off and my mates just thought it was funny .
" My parents are fine , they are happy with the way I am , that I am not like it all the time .
" It was my choice to put it on Facebook .
I know what Facebook is .
" I know that if I put a photograph on the group I am allowing people to see it .
" I do not care what people think , personally I would never judge anyone because everyone gets drunk . "
And she adds : " Maybe some girls do drink too much , but they are treated unfairly .
" Boys can go out and get drunk but if we do it , we should be ashamed of our actions . "
That argument is one that 's been bandied about a lot over the last few days - that bras were burned so that women could be free to copy even the most idiotic behaviour of their male counterparts .
But the truth of the matter is that these female galleries of drunken shame are newsworthy for two very good reasons .
Firstly , young women in Britain really are drinking harder and more often than ever before .
Statistic after statistic backs this up .
Secondly , while Samantha is clearly an intelligent and articulate young woman who has quickly learned to drink responsibly , others , particularly the very young , are not so blessed .
Earlier this month it emerged that the number of under - 18s being treated for alcohol abuse has soared by 40 per cent in a year .
More than half are female .
Further , a report found that young girls are drinking nearly twice as much alcohol as they were seven years ago .
It showed that female drinkers aged between 11 and 13 consumed an average of eight units a week , equivalent to four large glasses of wine - more than a bottle .
This is 83 per cent more than they were drinking in 2000 .
That they are doing so is partly to do with the cheapness and availability of alcohol but also to do with its glamorisation by " ladette " celebrities such as Amy Winehouse and Kate Moss .
TV programmes such as Booze Britain and Ibiza Uncovered coupled with the posting of pictures on the internet only serve to reinforce the message that drinking is cool - that it's all just " a laugh " .
Andrea Carey is a 34 - year - old mum of three from Darlington .
She was n't laughing earlier this year when she discovered that her 14 - year - old daughter Casey had gone missing .
" She had told me she was going to a friend 's for a sleepover but when I rang to say goodnight to her , she was n't there , " said Andrea .
" It turned out the friend had told her mum she was having a sleepover with us .
" For two hours I and the other parents frantically searched for the girls .
" Finally we found them , along with a number of their friends , in a nearby field .
They were all completely drunk .
" She had been sick and her tracksuit was caked in mud .
I was furious .
" Not only was I concerned for her health - after all , you occasionally hear about youngsters dying from excess drink - I worried that anything could have happened to her .
" She could have been attacked and she would have known nothing about it . "
Looking back , Casey , who wants to be a nurse and takes her GCSEs next year , accepts that what she did stupid but says she was egged on to do it .
" It 's seen as cool for girls to drink or get totally drunk at the weekends , " she says .
" Often you hear them saying : ' I ca n't wait to get trashed at the weekend ' - it is something they look forward to .
" It 's as if it makes girls look cooler and more daring .
" They think it will get them lots of attention and impress people , especially boys . "
And come Monday morning , they 'll all be talking about one thing - the latest photo doing the rounds on the internet .
" Although they say they are , it 's hard to know whether or not they are really embarrassed at all by it , " she says .
" Often I think that secretly they are pleased .
" That they are proud of everyone seeing them legless .
It 's sad , I guess .
Really sad . "
As if the hype around Black Friday was n’t enough , some retailers are trying to get the jump on their competition by going against the time - honored tradition of the day - after - Thanksgiving human stampedes .
As you ’ll see on numerous Black Friday websites , this year ’s Kmart flyer has been leaked and contains many noteworthy deals :
Magellan Maestro 3100 Navigation System – $ 129.99
Several Men ’s shirts and fleeces – $ 9.99 and under
Polaroid 8 MP Digital Camera – $ 79.99
The only caveat is that you ’ll have to drag yourself into Kmart at 7 am on Thanksgiving Day ( or “ Brown Thursday ” as the retailers call it ) to snag these items .
Of course , you ’re also free to hit up Best Buy and Circuit City the day after for a more traditional Black Friday event .
Check out some of the awesome deals they ’re offering this year :
This space left intentionally blank .
Indeed , BB and CC’s BF offerings are total BS this year .
Punny Money is officially awarding the Black Friday 2007 victory to Kmart .
Every aspect of George Bush 's foreign policy has now collapsed .
Every dream of neoconservatism has become a nightmare .
Every doctrine has turned to dust .
The influence of the United States has reached a nadir , its lowest point since before the second world war , when the country was encased in isolationism .
Russia 's president Vladimir Putin - whose soul Bush famously claimed to peer through - is scuttling arms control agreements and cutting his own deals with the Iranians .
The Turkish army is poised to invade northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish militants that the Iraqi government and the US allowed to roam freely .
The resurgent Taliban , given a second life when Bush drained resources from Afghanistan for the invasion of Iraq , is besieging the countryside , straining the future of the Western alliance in the form of Nato .
Pakistan , whose intelligence service and military contain elements that sponsor the Taliban and al - Qaida , remains an epicenter of terrorism .
General Pervez Musharraf 's imposition of martial law in Pakistan on November 3 was his second coup , reinforcing his 1999 military takeover .
Facing elections in January 2008 that seemed likely to repudiate him and an independent judiciary that refused to grant him extraordinary powers , he suspended constitutional rule .
Toothless US admonitions were easily ignored .
Gone are the days when the stern words of a senior US official prevented rash action by an errant foreign leader and when the power of the US served as a restraining force and promoted peaceful resolution of conflict .
In the vacuum of the Bush catastrophe , nation - states pursue what they perceive to be their own interests as global conflicts proliferate .
The backlash of preemptive war in Iraq gathers momentum in undermining US power and prestige .
The resignation last week of Bush 's close advisor , Karen Hughes , as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy , whose mission was to restore the US image in the world , signaled not only failure but also exhaustion .
The administration 's ventriloquism act of casting words into the mouth of the president 's nominee for attorney general , former federal judge Michael Mukasey , who would not declare waterboarding torture , demonstrated that Bush is less concerned with the crumbling of America 's reputation and moral authority than with preventing an attorney general from prosecuting members of his administration , including possibly him , for war crimes under US law .
The neoconservative project is crashing .
The " unipolar moment , " the post - Cold War unilateralist utopia imagined by neocon pundit Charles Krauthammer ; " hegemony , " the ultimate goal projected by the September 2000 manifesto of the Project for the New American Century ; an " empire " over lands that " today cry out for the sort of enlightened foreign administration once provided by self - confident Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets , " fantasized by neocon Max Boot in the Weekly Standard a month after September 11 , have instead produced unintended consequences of chaos and decline .
Dick Cheney's and Donald Rumsfeld 's presumption that successful war would instill fear , leading to absolute obedience and the suppression of potential rivalries and serious threats - the " dangerous nation " thesis of neocon theorist Robert Kagan - has proved to be the greatest foreign policy miscalculation in US history .
The quest for absolute power has not forged an " empire " but provoked ever - widening chaos .
The neocons have been present at the creation , all right .
But this " creation " is not another American century , in emulation of the post - second world war order fashioned by the so - called wise men , such as secretary of state Dean Acheson , a consummate realist , who Condoleezza Rice continues to insist is her role model .
Squandering the immense influence of the US in such a short period has required monumental effort .
Now the fog of war clears .
On the ruin of the neocons ' new world order emerges the old world disorder on steroids .
Musharraf 's coup spectacularly illustrates the " Bush effect " .
His speech of November 3 , explaining his seizure of power , is among the most significant and revealing documents of this new era in its cynical exploitation of the American example .
In his speech , Musharraf mocks and echoes Bush 's rhetoric .
Tyranny , not freedom , is on the march .
Musharraf appropriates the phrase " judicial activism " - the epithet hurled by American conservatives at liberal decisions of the courts since the Warren - led Supreme Court issued Brown versus Board of Education , which outlawed segregation in schools - and makes it his own .
This term " judicial activism " has no other source .
It is certainly not a phrase that originated in Pakistan .
" The judiciary has interfered , that 's the basic issue , " Musharraf said .
Indeed , under Bush , the administration has equated international law , the system of justice , and lawyers with terrorism .
In the March 2005 national defense strategy , this conflation of enemies became official doctrine : " Our strength as a nation state will continue to be challenged by those who employ a strategy of the weak using international fora , judicial processes , and terrorism . "
Neoconservative lawyers , in and out of the administration , have strenuously argued that the efforts to restore the Geneva conventions , place detainees within the judicial process and provide them with legal representation amount to what they denigrate as " lawfare " - a sneering reference to " welfare " and the idea that detainees are akin to the unworthy poor .
Lawyers for detainees , meanwhile , are routinely insulted as " habeas lawyers , " as though they were agents of terrorists and that arguing for the restoration of habeas corpus proves complicity " objectively " with terrorists .
Rather than cite these neoconservative talking points directly or invoke the authority of Bush , whose feeble protestations he brushed aside , Musharraf slyly quoted Abraham Lincoln , who suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and southern Indiana during the American civil war .
( The US circuit court of Maryland overturned his act .
In 1866 , the Supreme Court ruled in Ex parte Milligan that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals when civil courts were functioning . )
In Musharraf 's version , Lincoln is his model , taking executive action in order to save the nation : " He broke laws , he violated the Constitution , he usurped arbitrary powers , he trampled individual liberties , his justification was necessity . "
Musharraf , of course , as he suspends an election , leaves out the rest of Lincoln , not least the difficult election of 1864 , which took place in the middle of the civil war .
But where did Musharraf get his warped idea of Lincoln as dictator and America as an example of tyranny ?
Not quite from diligent study of American history .
According to a 2002 interview with Ikram Sehgal , managing editor of the Defense Journal of Pakistan , Musharraf received this notion from his reading of Richard Nixon 's book Leaders , published in 1994 , in which Nixon discusses Lincoln 's measures taken under extreme duress with ill - disguised admiration .
Thus , for Musharraf , as for Cheney and Bush , Nixon 's vision of an imperial president lies at the root of their actions in creating an executive unbound by checks and balances , unaccountable to " judicial activism " .
Since declaring a state of emergency , Musharraf has rounded up thousands of lawyers and shut down the courts , while halting offensive military action against terrorists .
In the name of combating terrorism , even as parts of his government are in league with them , he launches an attack on those who profess democracy .
The Bush administration finds itself devoid of options .
Neoconservatives are left , happily at least for some of them , to defend torture .
They have no explanations for the implosion of Bush 's policies or suggestions for remedy .
Self - examination is too painful and in any case unfamiliar .
Bush regrets Musharraf 's martial law , yet tacitly accepts that the US has no alternative but to support him in the war on terror that he is not fighting - and is using for his own political purposes .
On the rubble of neoconservatism , the Bush administration has adopted " realism " by default , though not even as a gloss on its emptiness .
Bush still clings to his high - flown rhetoric as if he 's warming up for his second inaugural address .
But this is not rock - bottom .
There is further to fall .

When the Fed wants to set an untenable position it tends to do so with non-voting members .
That is happening again today as Plosser does n't soften hawkish tone on rates .
In a speech at the University of Rochester , Plosser said the Fed cannot resolve the cause of the tension in financial markets , uncertainty over the value of complex securities tied to subprime and other mortgages and who holds these derivatives .
" It is important to recognize that the Fed cannot resolve this price discovery problem .
The markets will have to figure this out , " Plosser said in his prepared remarks .
" Arbitrarily lowering interest rates or providing liquidity to the market does not provide the answers the market seeks , " Plosser said .
Indeed , rate cuts might only delay the painful process , he said .
Philadelphia Fed President Charles
Plosser strongly suggested that he is not in favor of an additional rate cut at the next policy meeting on Dec. 11 .

Detecting single - particle nonlocality :
The yellow path is Hardy ’s original scheme .
The red path is part of the modified version , where a reference state is created in the “ black box . ”
The reference state is split off by beam splitter 1 toward Alice , and the other part is reflected off a mirror and then split off by beam splitter 2 toward Bob .
This ensures that Alice and Bob can consistently compare their measurement results , and that the nonlocality must stem from the original single - particle state .
( Modified image from Dunningham and Vedral )
Usually when physicists talk about nonlocality in quantum mechanics , they ’re referring to the fact that two particles can have immediate effects on each other , even when separated by large distances .
Einstein famously called the phenomena “ spooky interaction at a distance ” because information about a particle seems to be traveling faster than the speed of light , violating the laws of causality .
Although the idea is counterintuitive , nonlocality is now widely accepted by physicists , albeit almost exclusively for two - particle systems .
So far , no experiment has sufficiently demonstrated the nonlocality of a single particle , although explanations have been proposed since 1991 ( starting with Tan , Walls , and Collett ) .
Since then , the issue has been strongly debated by physicists .
In 1994 , Lucien Hardy proposed a modified scheme of Tan , Walls , and Collett ’s claim .
However , others ( notably Greenberger , Horne , and Zeilinger ) objected to Hardy ’s scheme , claiming that it was really a multi- particle effect in disguise , and could not be demonstrated experimentally .
Now , Jacob Dunningham from the University of Leeds and Vlatko Vedral from the University of Leeds and the National University of Singapore have modified Hardy ’s scheme , publishing their results in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
By eliminating all unphysical inputs , their scheme allows for a real experiment , and ensures that only a single particle exhibits nonlocality .
Plus , Dunningham and Vedral ’s scheme not only applies to single photons , but to atoms and single massive particles , as well .
“ The greatest significance of this work is that it shows how superposition and entanglement are the same ‘ mystery , ’ ” Dunningham explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ Feynman famously said that superposition is the only mystery in quantum mechanics , but more recently entanglement has been widely considered as an additional fundamental feature of quantum physics .
Here we show that they are one and the same . ”
In Hardy ’s original scheme , one photon and a vacuum state arrive at a beam splitter , a glass prism that splits a beam of light in two .
Two observers , Alice and Bob , have the option to either measure one of the beams , or to combine their beam with a coherent light beam , split the resulting beam with another beam splitter , and then measure the two outputs ( also known as a “ homodyne detection ” ) .
Alice and Bob ’s decisions could result in four possible combinations .
First , if they both measure their beam from the original beam splitter , only one will detect a photon .
Second , if Alice adds a coherent state to her beam while Bob measures his original split beam , Alice has two chances of detecting a photon , at the two outputs ( c 1 , d 1 ) of her beam splitter .
Hardy showed that , if Alice detected a photon at c 1 , Bob would not detect a photon ; but if Alice detected a photon at d1 , Bob must detect a photon .
In the third possibility , the roles of Alice and Bob are simply switched , with the same results .
In the fourth possibility , both Alice and Bob make homodyne detections .
If they both detect particles at their d detectors ( d 1 and d 2 , respectively ) , then they both infer that the other must detect a photon from the original source .
This is a problem , because they cannot both be right — there is only one original photon .
Hardy argued that this scheme demonstrates the nonlocality of a single particle when one eliminates the implicit local assumption that Alice ’s result is independent of Bob ’s measurement ( and vice versa ) .
Rather , one observer ’s result does depend on the other ’s measurement , so that , due to a nonlocal influence , the second observer ’s measurement is determined by the first observer ’s measurement .
“ If we try and interpret this experimental scheme using only classical physics , it turns out that it is not possible for the outcomes of all four of the proposed experiments to be consistent , ” Vedral explained .
“ The outcome of experiment four is not consistent with the others .
Classical physics assumes that the particle exists independent of our observing ( or measuring ) it , and also that one measurement cannot influence a particle at a distance .
“ For example , what Alice does cannot affect Bob ’s particle , ” he continued .
“ Since the outcomes of this scheme are not consistent with classical physics , we must drop one of the assumptions .
This means that if we wish to maintain the view that reality exists independent of our measurements ( e.g. the moon is there even if we do n’t look at it ) , we are forced to accept that the world is nonlocal .
This is how Hardy based his argument for nonlocality on the contradictory outcomes . ”
However , Greenberger , Horne , and Zeilinger took issue with Hardy ’s argument , pointing out that combining a photon and a vacuum does not result in an observable state , and therefore could not be performed in a real experiment .
They even attempted a scheme that did n’t use these so - called “ partlycle ” superpositions , but found that the entire system then demonstrated nonlocality , making it impossible to attribute nonlocality to a single particle .
Dunningham and Vedral ’s proposal makes a few key changes to Hardy ’s scheme .
First , instead of using coherent states of a photon and vacuum , they use mixed states — a mixture of coherent states averaged over all phases of the particles .
In this way , they do n’t violate superselection rules and so avoid objections that have been raised before .
Then , for the homodyne detections , they ensure that the coherent light beam combining with the original beam has the same phase .
Having the same phase is key , as it ensures that Alice and Bob can consistently compare their measurement results .
The coherent states are only classically correlated with the single particle state .
This means that , when Alice and Bob perform their homodyne detections , and one detection influences the other , the nonlocality must stem from the original single - particle state .
Because the main importance is maintaining a common average phase — but not a specific phase — Dunningham and Vedral ’s scheme could , in principle , be carried out in the laboratory .
Also , the researchers suggest that , by using beam splitters for atoms and atom detectors , their scheme could conceivably verify the nonlocality of a single massive particle , in addition to a massless photon .
“ An important feature of this work is that it shows how this experiment could be carried out without violating the number conservation superselection rule , ” Dunningham said .
“ This is important because people are often happy to accept such violations for massless particles ( e.g. photons ) but not for massive particles such as atoms .
By avoiding this violation altogether , we show that the outcomes of this proposed experiment should be the same for both massive and massless particles . ”
The scientists note an interesting comparison of their result to a principle of Leibniz ’s metaphysics , the identity of indiscernibles .
According to the principle , a pair of entangled quantum particles must be indiscernible from a single particle , since both objects have in common all the same properties — this is the only stipulation of the principle , number being irrelevant .
The single - state nonlocality demonstrated here reinforces the equivalence of a single state and an entangled state — giving more credence to the position that quantum field theory , where fields are fundamental and particles secondary , is a close representation of reality .

The video shows Mr Dziekanski being pinned down by police .

Amateur video
Robert Dziekanski , 40 , of Pieszyce , Poland , was restrained by police after becoming agitated at Vancouver International Airport on 14 October .
Mr Dziekanski , who spoke no English , was declared dead at the scene by an emergency medical team .
The incident is being investigated by police , the airport and the coroner .
Police spokesman Cpl Dale Carr said the video was just one piece of evidence , and urged people to wait for the results of the inquest .
Mr Dziekanski , a construction worker , was emigrating to Canada to join his mother , who lived in the western province of British Columbia .
The incident has prompted a debate about the use of Taser stun guns by police in Canada .
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation says up to 18 people have died after being stunned by a Taser in Canada since 2003 .
Screams
The video was shot by Canadian traveller Paul Pritchard and handed over to police , and has only just been returned to him .
It starts before the police arrive , with Mr Dziekanski seen through a glass wall in a customs area .
He appears agitated , sweating and breathing heavily .
Airport security officials and passengers watch from the other side .
Mr Dziekanski was agitated and sweating .

Having landed 10 hours earlier , he is seen pacing back and forth through an automatic door , standing briefly in the doorway with a small folding table , and then later with a chair .
At one point , he takes what looks like a laptop computer off a counter and throws it to the ground , and then throws the small table against the glass wall .
Four policemen then walk into view .
They walk through the glass doors towards Mr Dziekanski , who turns his back on them .
Witnesses say he appeared to pick up a stapler .
Seconds later , Mr Dziekanski is stunned by a Taser and falls down screaming and convulsing .
He is stunned a second time , and then the police officers restrain him on the floor .
Mr Dziekanski's screams die down , and he is seen lying still .
A voice is heard saying " code red " , which is code for a medical emergency .
An autopsy found no sign of drugs or alcohol in Mr Dziekanski 's system , and failed to pinpoint the cause of death .
Airport mix -up
Walter Kosteckyj , the victim 's family lawyer , said Mr Dziekanski's mother had seen portions of the video and had approved its release to the public .
" She had a son in distress , he was looking for help , he was frightened , and he did n't get that help , " Mr Kosteckyj said .
He said he was disturbed by the video because Mr Dziekanski was not violent .
" I was expecting to see a confrontation , a discussion and things go sideways , then the tasering ...
That 's not what you see , " he said .
Mr Dziekanski was coming to Canada to be with his mother , Zofia
Mr Dziekanski , who had not flown before , had boarded a plane a day earlier in Germany , and arranged to meet his mother at the baggage carousel in the international terminal .
Neither of them knew the baggage carousel was inside a secure area , with no view of the public arrivals hall area , except for a short distance through sliding glass doors , Mr Kosteckyj said .
No airport , customs or security employees at the airport apparently tried to help either of them , he added .
Eventually Mr Dziekanski emerged into the public area , but his mother had left after six hours and Mr Dziekanski apparently panicked , the lawyer said .

For background on Russia at TOD , I would recommend the excellent summary by Dave Cohen last year , and also a recent comment by Gail Tverberg which summarized a variety of warnings on the potential for Russian production to go into decline ( for the second time ) .
Also excellent is the book Russian Oil Supply by John Grace .
Here I just want to update and extend a fairly simple analysis of the situation .
But first let me set some context .
We have been discussing the plateau in global oil production on this site for the last two years ( pretty much since the plateau first began ) .
The latest statistics show the plateau continuing , indeed there is even some hint of decline now in both the IEA and EIA series for total liquid fuel production :
Average daily total liquid production , by month , from EIA ( green ) and IEA ( plum ) , together with 13 month centered moving averages of each line , recursed once ( LHS ) .

continue ,
end in renewed production climbs , or
begin declines
However this decline is not likely to be statistically significant , so we can not set much store in it at present .
Nonetheless , a key question is whether the plateau will This is obviously of great interest .
Rembrandt gave his view a couple of weeks back , arguing that the peak was likely at least a few years away and significantly higher than oil production at present .
I have been of the view for a year or two that peak oil is happening as we speak .
The fact that production is plateaued tells us that over the last two years or so , all new capacity brought on has been cancelled out by the forces of entropy and chaos : production declines in existing field production , geopolitical problems , the depradations of hurricanes and other accidents , and any voluntary cuts made by OPEC ( I am with Jim Hamilton in being deeply sceptical that any voluntary cutting is actually going on ) .
Thus future lists of new projects must be balanced against estimates of the future forces of chaos , and our ability to enumerate those with any precision is extremely poor .
I find it more instructive to look at trends in particular countries .
If we look back before the plateau , during the period 2001 - 2004 when production was increasing robustly as the world economy came out of a slump following the Internet stock crash , we can examine the key declining countries and key increasing countries :
Average annual increase / decrease in daily oil production for top five increasing and decreasing countries 2001 - 2004 .
Source : BP ( includes NGLs ) .
As you can see , the two most significant countries making for the production increase , by far , were Saudi Arabia and even more so Russia , with everyone else a long way behind .
This is what things looked like when supply was able to increase in response to increased demand .
If we then look at the period 2004 - 2006 ( when supply was roughly plateaued ) , we see this :
Average annual increase / decrease in daily oil production for top five increasing and decreasing countries 2004 - 2006 .
Source : BP ( includes NGLs ) .
As you can see , Saudi Arabia stopped increasing ( and went on to decline somewhat ) .
Russia has continued to increase , but much more slowly .
No other country has managed to fill the gap to any material degree , and thus supply has stopped increasing .
Let us now focus more closely on Russian statistics .
The next graph shows the monthly production statistics from three different sources , together with counts of rigs operating in the country .
This is from 1997 - 2007 so it encompasses the entire period of the Russian revival in which Russia 's oil industry first got its infrastructure working again following the collapse of the Soviet Union , and then began applying the expertise of Western service countries to boost declining production ( particularly in the fairly mature West Siberian fields that counted for more than half of Russian production during late Soviet times ) .
Monthly Russian oil production according to three data sources : EIA Table 1.1c , IEA Table 3 , and JODI .
Solid smooth lines are 13 month centered moving averages , recursed once ( note last 13 months rely on an incomplete window ) .
Graph is not zero - scaled .
Rig data are from Schlumberger data and include both oil and gas rigs .
As you can see , all data sources agree that production has been increasing throughout this period , though there is some disagreement over the exact pattern and level of that increase .
Furthermore , rig counts have increased dramatically .
Before we go any further I want to stress an important caveat here .
Baker Hughes does not produce figures for Russia , which means we only have the Schlumberger counts , which do not separate out oil and gas rigs .
It 's also unclear how accurate counts in Russia might have been especially during the chaotic years of the 1990s .
For the purposes of this analysis we shall make the simplifying assumption that the number of oil rigs is roughly proportional to the total number of rigs , and that the counts are accurate enough to be useful .
However , this caveat has to be borne in mind in considering the strength of evidence for the conclusions of this post .
After noting that production has been increasing , the second observation is that the rate of increase is falling steadily .
In particular , if we take the year on year change in the moving averages , we get the following picture :
Year - on - year change in centered moving average of Russian oil production according to three data sources : EIA Table 1.1c , IEA Table 3 , and JODI .
Black line is an extrapolation of the current trend and is a scenario , not a forecast
The rate of increase peaked at about 10 % per year in the 2003 timeframe , and has been falling steadily since , being down to only around 1.5 % per year now .
The black line shows an extrapolation to zero in early 2008 .
Zero percent increase would be a peak in production .
Furthermore , this would imply the total cumulative increase in production between now and the peak would only be around 1 % ( about 100kbd ) .
However , some caution should be applied since the curves had a sideways dogleg in 2006 , and perhaps this could happen again , delaying the ultimate peak .
Hence I emphasize that the early 2008 peak is a fairly plausible scenario , rather than a firm prediction .
If we take into account the rig count picture , things look more serious .
This next graph shows how much increase in production occurred for each rig in the country ( expressed in thousands of barrels per day increase , per year , per rig ) .
Rate of increase in Russian oil production per rig in country .
Production is 13 month centered moving average , recursed once , of IEA Table 3 production estimates .
Rig data are from Schlumberger data and include both oil and gas rigs .
The absolute level of this graph should n't be taken too seriously since it 's dividing an oil production increase by a rig count for oil and gas rigs .
However , the general trend is probably meaningful , and what it shows is a complete collapse in this metric from around 10,000 barrels / day / year / rig at the height of the revival to only around 200 barrels / day / rig today .
A much larger number of rigs is producing much smaller production increases .
This suggests either that the opportunities for new drilling projects are much poorer than during the height of the revival , or that the base production is declining faster so that it 's harder for new projects to increase overall top line production .
Probably some of both .
Either way , it tends to the view that Russia cannot increase production much further , even if the rig count goes up a lot more .
And if Russia were to begin declining next year , it 's likely we would see the world as a whole move out of plateau , and into unmistakable decline .
