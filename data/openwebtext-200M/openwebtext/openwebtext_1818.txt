The standard refrain regarding this points is " nothing bad has happened yet .
Therefore we should n't worry about these things . "
While it is true that nothing bad has happened , we have to ask ourselves a fundamental question : " Is this the way we want to build and manage the largest economy in the world ? "
Debt
When used properly , debt can increase leverage and allow an investor to increase his return .
When used poorly , debt is a crutch that hides the basic problems of an economy .
Unfortunately , the US is using debt poorly at the federal and household level .
At the federal level we have once again seen an explosion of debt issuance .
While the White House is claiming the budget deficit is decreasing , the amount of debt issued for the last 6 years indicates otherwise .
According to the Treasury Department , the total debt outstanding on September 30 2001 was $ 5,807,463,412,200.06 .
That number was $ 8,713,570,341,089.42 as of February 12 , or an increase of nearly $ 3 trillion dollars .
The amount of interest on that debt is increasing :
2006 $ 405,872,109,315.83
2005 $ 352,350,252,507.90
2004 $ 321,566,323,971.29
2003 $ 318,148,529,151.51
2002 $ 332,536,958,599.42
2001 $ 359,507,635,242.41
Here is a chart from the St. Louis Federal Reserve that shows the year - over - year increase in interest payments .
As we enter a period when higher interest rates are more likely simply because rates have been at generational lows for the last 4 years , these number will obviously go higher .
At the household level we have also seen an explosion of debt use , especially in the last 5 years .
Here 's a chart of total household debt outstanding from the St. Louis Federal Reserve :
Notice the higher arc of the last few years that occurred during this expansion .
The next chart shows how the year over year change in household debt is twice as high during this expansion as the previous expansion .
The following chart shows how total debt service payments are at record highs of disposable income .
All of this has occurred at a time when wages for most Americans have been stagnant , despite some large productivity increases we have seen ( thanks to Tula Connell for the graph ) .
So , the great increase in the standard of living has not come from higher wages , but instead by borrowing today in hopes of repayment tomorrow .
Stagnant Wages
In case you were wondering , the graph above indicates that wages for the average American have been stagnant for the last 6 years as well .
Here 's another graph from Kash at the Streetlight economic blog
Here 's how he sums up the chart :
In recent months the drop in gas prices has pushed real earnings noticeably higher , but those earnings are still only around 2 % above where they were seven years ago .
So after accounting for consumer price inflation , the average production worker takes home about $ 10 more per week than he or she did in the year 2000 .
It 's no wonder that lots of people feel that economic growth is passing them by ...
Savings ( or lack therefor ) .
So , what happens when a person with all of this debt loses his job ?
Well , there is n't much to fall back on .
Here is a chart from the St. Louis
Fed that shows the national savings rate :
There has been a fair amount of ink devoted to proving the official savings rate is not a good measure .
Unfortunately for this argument , three other studies have confirmed the savings crisis is very real .
The short version is simple : one financial catastrophe and the average American family is knee - deep in trouble .
The trade deficit
The US is consuming more than it produces .
We buy far more goods than we sell , as evidenced by the mammoth US trade deficit :
The trade deficit is a primary reason why foreign investors have almost doubled their investments in US debt securities over the last 5 years .
Like the savings situation , some have tried to argue the deficit is n't a problem because either nothing bad has happened yet or this calculation is wrong or a combination of both .
The problem with this argument is the forex market clearly disagrees , as they have sent the dollar on a four - year long downward trajectory .
Conclusion
So where does this leave the economy ?
Massively in debt and vulnerable to random events .
Now we can bury our heads in the sand or try to claim that " something is fundamentally different with this current situation " that makes standard economic analysis fruitless , or we can start to change the way we conduct business .
But then again , nothing bad has happened yet , so why worry ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices slipped Thursday , having dipped below the $ 50 mark , following a government report that revealed a bigger than expected increase in U.S. crude inventories .
U.S. light crude for February delivery fell as low at $ 49.90 a barrel , its lowest trading level since May 25 , 2005 , but pared some of its late - session losses to finish $ 1.76 lower at $ 50.468 a barrel .
In its weekly inventory report , the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks jumped by 6.8 million barrels last week .
Analysts were looking for a build of 100,000 barrels , according to Reuters .
" Clearly this was a much bigger number than the market was expecting , " Scott Hanold , energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets , told CNNMoney.com
" We 've obviously had a lot of pressure put on oil prices here and I think you 'll continue to see some added pressure here . "
The build in crude stocks was helped in part by a surge in crude imports , which averaged 11.1 million barrels per day last week , up nearly 1.6 million barrels per day from the previous week .
The data were released a day later than usual because of the U.S. holiday on Monday .
Distillates , used to make heating oil and diesel fuel , climbed 900,000 barrels , compared to expectations for an increase of 1.9 million barrels in distillate supplies .
Gasoline supplies rose by 3.5 million barrels , exceeding expectations for a build of 2.2 million in gasoline stockpiles .
Peter Beutel , an oil analyst at Cameron Hanover , said there was a bullish element within the weekly inventory report , pointing at U.S. gasoline demand , which is up 1.2 percent from the same period last year .
" For this time of year we normally see gas demand drop very substantially , but that has not happened this year , " said Beutel .
" It is a factor that is somewhat bullish for the market . "
Oil prices have tumbled in recent weeks , hitting a 20 - month low near $ 50 a barrel Wednesday , after Saudi Arabia said OPEC production cuts were working and an emergency meeting of member countries was unnecessary .
Warm weather , high inventories and a slowing economy have been largely to blame , while some speculative money has poured out of the market .
Even though some firms that deal in energy trading , such as Goldman Sachs , have trimmed their 2007 forecast for crude prices , many economists are still betting that oil prices will average above $ 60 a barrel this year .
The decline in crude prices , which are down some 35 percent from the record highs hit last summer , has also comforted markets on speculation that inflation pressures will begin to ease .
Gasoline prices have been slow to follow crude 's recent decline , but they have turned lower recently .
As of Thursday , the average U.S. retail price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was $ 2.209 , down nearly a dime from $ 2.306 last month , according to AAA .
Stocks of oil majors , including BP ( up $ 0.02 to $ 63.61 , Charts ) , ExxonMobil ( down $ 0.50 to $ 71.96 , Charts ) , ConocoPhillips ( down $ 0.94 to $ 62.61 , Charts ) , Chevron ( up $ 0.10 to $ 70.92 , Charts ) and Royal Dutch Shell ( down $ 0.13 to $ 68.11 , Charts ) , have followed crude prices lower , and the AMEX oil and gas index is down 5.6 percent so far this year .
Why gasoline follows oil up but not down
" The power of quantum computers comes from their ability to follow a coherent superposition of computation paths . "

A popular view of quantum computation is that its power ( at least the power of certain well known quantum algorithms ) derives from a form of parallel computation coming from the fact that the state of a quantum computer can be a superposition of many classical states .
I want to argue that this is in fact a bit of a red herring because there are other models of computation that allow formal superpositions and yet clearly do n't provide a form of parallel computation .
Instead , the essence of quantum computing is derived from a kind of non-convexity property and this is the common feature of all of the well known quantum algorithms that is n't shared by classical algorithms .
Before continuing there 's something important I should say .
Let me quote Bennett et al. in Strengths and Weaknesses of Quantum Computing
In other words , what I am saying is in direct contradiction with what is said by some of the founding fathers of quantum computing .
Actually , I think that 's a good thing , it means that whether I 'm right or wrong , I must be saying something non-trivial .
Consider a probabilistic computer .
We can represent the probability of its being in any state by an element of a vector space whose basis is the set of possible states and where the coefficient of each basis element is the probability of the computer being in that state .
Given any pair of vectors that represent possible ditributions of states .
vand v , then av+bv , where a , b>=0 and a+b = 1 is also a possible distribution .
In other words we can form superpositions exactly analogously to the way we can form superpositions of quantum computer states .
The mathematics that describes the notion of a quantum computer performing computations in parallel by superposing N states is formally almost identical to the mathematics describing a probabilistic computer as a superposition of states .
So if we can superpose N states in both classical probabilistic computers and quantum computers , why do neither seem to offer an N times speedup ?
In the case of quantum computers one popular explanation is that then though we run N states in parallel , we can't perform I/O with those N states in parallel .
When we observe a quantum computer we cause a wavefunction collapse ( it does n't matter whether you are a believer in such collapse , that is how we model quantum computers ) and instead we make a single observation from a probability distribution .
Mathematically this is identical to what happens in a probabilistic machine - a superposition is nondeterministically mapped into one of many definite states .
So whatever the difference is between probabilistic computers and quantum computers , it does n't lie in the fact that you can form superpositions .
Mathematically speaking , probabilistic computers and quantum computers are almost identical in this respect .
But we know that quantum algorithms can do things that no probabilistic algorithm can , so there must be some difference .
There is of course .
Here 's an approach to seeing what it is .
Consider a probabilistic branching process : Starting at state 1 we can either go to state 2 or state 3 , and from there we end up at either A , B or C. Assume that the choice of branch is nondeterministic and that we can assign probabilities to each branch .
Suppose also that the branch probabilities are all non-zero .
The important thing to note in that diagram is that there are two ways to reach it .
The probability of reaching A is the sum of the probabilities for each of the different ways to reach A .
The key point I want to make here is that A is more likely because there are two ways to reach it .
If I were to replace one or other of the A's with a D then the likelihood of finding our process in state A at the end is reduced .
But in quantum mechanics we replace probabilities with complex ' amplitudes ' .
When we make our observation at the end , the probability of any outcome is given by the modulus of the amplitude squared .
The amplitudes still add , just as in probability theory .
But this has a very important consequence .
If the amplitudes for the two different ways to reach A lie in opposite directions in the complex plane , then the probability of ending up in state A after observation is reduced by having two ways of reaching A .
This is completely different to the probabilistic case .
We can paradoxically make something less likely by adding a new way to achieve it .
This is where the essence of quantum computing lies .
Pick up just about any paper describing a quantum algorithm and you 'll see that the important step is a ' conspiracy ' to make the amplitudes of ' undesirable ' states sum to zero ( or at least something small ) .
Probably the simplest example is counterfactual computation where it is arranged that the computation is executed along two different branches with equal and opposite amplitudes .
The neatest example is probably Shor 's cycle discovery algorithm that forms the basis of his factoring algorithm .
By clever use of the Fourier transform he arranges that branches leading to non-cycles cancel each other out leaving only the periods of cycles with high amplitudes .
However , I think it 's important to stress that given any individual quantum computer Bennett et al .
and I probably do n't disagree on what it actually does .
This is an issue of semantics .
But semantics does make a difference .
The notion of a quantum computer as a super - parallel machine is one being promulgated in the popular science press and I think this causes much confusion with people expecting all kinds of algorithms to run in O ( 1 ) time .
So why do people talk about parallel computation if that 's not what quantum computer do ?
I think it 's because people are n't comfortable with quantum computers yet .
This means they do n't want to think of quantum computers as something fundamental and irreducible and instead want to reduce them to something classical .
The easiest classical model is the parallel one and so they ' reduce ' it to that .
PS
This is essentially a specialisation of an old post to the context of quantum computing .

Some campaigners and politicians are against the move
The £ 8 - a - day road toll scheme now takes in most of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in west London .
Transport for London ( TfL ) said the first morning rush hour had gone well , but the AA said half - term holidays had reduced the number of cars .
About 55,000 residents in the new zone will receive a 90 % discount on the fee - sparking a fear of more congestion .
The daily time frame for the entire congestion charge area also changes - it will end 30 minutes earlier at 1800 .
West London residents staged a peaceful demonstration against the new charge .
They said it will damage businesses and cost residents hundreds of pounds a year .
According to TfL , traffic in the original central congestion charge zone has fallen 20 % since the scheme began in 2003 .
It expects a further fall of 15 % when the new charge kicks in .
It also said the toll has helped fight pollution , reduce road injuries , increased the number of cyclists and caused more people to turn to public transport .
This extension of the charge zone is a lose - lose situation for Londoners
Nationals Alliance Against Tolls
First day of new zone
Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said : " Today 's morning rush hour has seen a successful start to the congestion charge western extension .
" Traffic is flowing freely inside the extended zone , on its boundaries and the through route .
" The zone was , until now , one of the most congested areas in the UK and first indications are that traffic levels have been reduced as expected by the scheme .
" London is again taking the lead in tackling the problem of traffic congestion and emissions which blight virtually every major city in the world . "
Paul Watters , head of roads policy for the AA , said the rush hour had been generally quiet across the newly - extended zone .
" The free route has been very busy , as expected , " he said .
" It is half - term in many parts of the home counties and that will have a reducing effect .
" In addition a lot of people are nervous of using the system , as happened when it was first brought in .
" I think it wo n't hit home for another couple of weeks . "
Angie Bray , of the London Assembly Conservatives , said : " Fewer cars are using the roads yet congestion increases .
HAVE YOUR SAY
You cannot have such taxes until there is a viable alternative to travel by car
Paul , Taunton
Send us your comments
" The reasons are poor planning and use of road space .
Bus and cycle lanes in conjunction with re-phased traffic lights are making London travel slower . "
The city 's transport watchdog , London Travelwatch , has supported the congestion charge and the expansion .
But chairman Brian Cooke said a two - zone system would have been better than having one large congestion charge area .
He said : " The inclusion of more residents in the discount scheme will mean increased congestion in the existing zone , thereby lessening the benefits seen over the last few years from the congestion charge . "
Darren Johnson , leader of the London Assembly 's Green Party , said : " The westward extension of the congestion charge will mean more people enjoy the benefit of safer , less polluted streets and more efficient bus services . "
A spokesman for the National Alliance Against Tolls said : " This extension of the charge zone is a lose - lose situation for Londoners .
" It will increase congestion everywhere else including the existing zone . "
Verizon denies giving out phone info
Telecom firm rebuts newspaper report that it gave out phone records or call information to National Security Agency .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) - Verizon Communications Inc. denied earlier media reports that it entered into a contract with the National Security Agency , providing the government office with info about its customer phone calls .
" One of the most glaring and repeated falsehoods in the media reporting is the assertion that , in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , Verizon was approached by NSA and entered into an arrangement to provide the NSA with data from its customers ' domestic calls , " the company said in a statement issued Tuesday .
Verizon ( Research ) said it was not asked by the government agency to provide , nor did Verizon give out , customer phone records from any of its businesses , or any customer call data .
Last week USA Today reported that the National Security Agency was secretly collecting phone records from the country 's three biggest phone companies -- Verizon , BellSouth ( Research ) and AT&T ( Research ) -- in an effort to detect terrorist plots .
Verizon neither confirmed nor denied whether it has any relationship to the classified NSA program .
( Read the Verizon statement here )
A Verizon spokesman told CNN the company decided to issue Tuesday 's statement since certain media reports alleged they had been asked by the NSA to provide phone records .
Verizon issued a similar statement Friday , saying it would provide customer info to a government agency " only where authorized by law for appropriately - defined and focused purposes . "
The company said that it would not provide any government agency " unfettered access " to customer records .
President Bush reiterated earlier Tuesday that the government does not listen to the phone calls of ordinary Americans without a court order .
" I 've also been clear about the fact that we do not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval and this government will continue to guard the privacy of the American people , " he said .
" But if al Qaeda is calling into the United States , we want to know , and we want to know why . "
Under federal law , the government is required to obtain a court order to tap the phones of American citizens inside the country .
Following Bush 's comments , White House spokesman Tony Snow would neither confirm nor deny the USA Today story .
BellSouth Corp. , the No. 3 U.S. local telephone carrier , spoke out against the USA Today story on Monday , denying that it handed over customer phone records .
" We have provided no customer information whatsoever to the NSA , " BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher told CNN .
A lawsuit that could turn into a $ 50 billion class action was filed against Verizon on Friday on behalf of all Verizon subscribers .
The suit contends that collecting phone records violates the Constitutional right to privacy and federal law .

Suddenly heroin prescription is back in the news , so here ’s an archaeological find from the hard - drive : an essay I wrote in praise of heroin prescription , for the “ Roger Hole Essay Prize in Medical Scepticism ” , as a young undergraduate in medicine , in 1998 .
The prize was judged by Lewis Wolpert , and winning it netted me the enormous sum of Â£ 250 ( a month ’s rent ! ) and a signed certificate from Prof Souhami ( of Souhami and Moxham fame ! ) .
Bit of background in the box , if you ’re interested , otherwise skip to the essay below .
This essay , weirdly , also served up an early insight for me in the lameness of reporting on science and health in the media , and their obsession with quoting “ authority ” .
A friend of mine who worked for a drug law reform pressure group gave my number to somebody working on campaigning journalist Nick Davies ‘ heroin addiction documentary , a couple of years later .
( Addendum Aug 2010 : I posted this entry in 2006 , long before he was known for Flat Earth News , I think Nick is great ) .
They called me , said they ’d heard I was a doctor , had researched the issue , and asked if I would do an interview .
I ’d be happy to help , I said , but explained that I had only qualified as a doctor a few weeks previously , that I would feel a bit uncomfortable being an “ authority ” , that I was in no sense a medical expert on anything much , in fact I was n’t even fully registered with the GMC for another year ( I was a PRHO ! ) and that I looked about 12 .
They seemed to think all this might be a problem , but I chatted through what I knew on the subject , and casually offered to email this essay I had written when I was a medical student .
I never heard from them again .
So imagine my surprise when , completely by accident , I happened to catch a TV show on heroin prescription a few months later .
It did n’t even really occur to me that it might be connected to that brief phone call , but suddenly , the screen went black , with a dramatic pause and , if I remember correctly , a deep bass synthesiser tone in the background , and then , from nowhere , quotes from my medical student essay appeared , in big , sombre letters , filling the screen , ascribed to “ Dr Ben Goldacre ” , as if I was some kind of aged , leading world authority and the absolute last word .
I should mention that I was watching this sat on my mattress , which was on the floor , eating toast , in my underpants , like a proper student bachelor .
The disparity was striking .
I ’ve never been so embarrassed , I prayed that nobody I knew had seen it , and it ’s one of the many reasons why I still vaguely avoid being billed as “ Dr Ben Goldacre ” .
There ’s just no need .
Anyway , here ’s the essay , I hope you enjoy it , forgive the slightly pompous and youthful authorial style , it was over 8 years ago , I was practically a kid , Billie was top of the hit parade with “ Because We Want To ” and the Spice Girls were still together .
I might see a few things very slightly differently now , with more clinical experience , and a better feel for research literature in general , and it was an “ exercise in medical scepticism ” , but for the most part , looking back at myself , I have to say , I think I make a pretty tonky argument , and it ’s a pretty strong survey of the historical context .
Methadone and Heroin :
An Exercise in Medical Scepticism
~ by Ben Goldacre , 1998 ( aged 23 and 3/4 ) ~
I have often fantasised about living through an age when science was truly adversarial : to have seen Darwin at the Royal Society , or Galileo recant .
But the lie of the land , the structure of our scientific territory , and our modes of warfare across it , have become domesticated and tame .
Although there may be differences of opinion , we each tend to tinker at the expanding edges of our understanding , and truly mutually exclusive explanatory frameworks for reproducible phenomena rarely co-exist for long .
If we want to see real friction , some other factor must come to bear on the essentially healthy structure of the mainstream scientific community : a funding issue , for example , might influence the general trajectory of research , but for the most part temporarily ; we may be transiently confounded by partisan research from a given drug - company , but only in whatever microcosm of physiology their drug acts and , albeit slightly behind schedule , we can be sure that the truth will out .
But we want the big prize : we want wholesale irrationality , we want to see the axial skeleton of our concepts truly and chronically deformed , and only politics can muster contorting forces of such magnitude .
I intend to show how this influence has perverted rationality in one area , our medical treatment of those who are addicted to heroin , to such an extent that our theory and practice is now so polluted as to be scientifically untenable .
Until recently , it was common practice in Britain to prescribe heroin to heroin addicts .
This apparently paradoxical practice was well founded and successful , as we shall see below .
However , since the late 1960 ’s , addicts have mostly been prescribed oral methadone , a long acting opiate agonist with a less euphoriant effect , as a heroin substitute .
I shall demonstrate that the maintenance of addicts on methadone is less effective at reducing the use of heroin , and the harm that goes along with heroin use , than the prescription of heroin itself .
I shall also show that methadone is a more dangerous drug than heroin , and causes more deaths than even adulterated street heroin .
Ultimately , the case I shall make is that heroin prescription is more effective , by all reasonable outcome indicators , than methadone ; and that the reasons for its unpopularity have little to do with evidence of best practice , and much to do with our emotional and moral attitudes towards those who are addicted to drugs .
To begin , we must consider the history of opiate addiction and its treatment , in order to understand how and why politics intervened , and how we arrived at the state we are in today .
A Brief History of Opiate Addiction and Rehabilitation
Heroin , or diamorphine , was first marketed by Bayer in 1898 , after being developed as a cough suppressant by the same team who introduced aspirin .
Although the use of psychoactive drugs ( and specifically opiates ) began to be considered as a medical problem in the late nineteenth century ( Berridge & Edwards 1981 ) , they were legally available until well into the twentieth , and opiates could be purchased from pharmacies with a minimum of formalities up until 1920 .
At this time , the principal medical concern over drug use was the risk of accidental poisoning through the non-medical pursuit of pleasure , and the prevalence of drug addiction ( frequently caused by chronic medical use ) was so low that its social impact was negligible .
The 1920 Dangerous Drugs
Act confined the availability of opiates to prescription only and , over the next few years , penalties for offenders against the possession laws were increased , a reflection of similar developments abroad ( Mott 1991 ) .
However , where Britain departed from the rest of the world was with the Rolleston Committee report from the Department of Health in 1926 .
This emphasised that persistent drug use , in line with newly emerging medical and social theory , should be seen as a disease : â€˜as a manifestation of a morbid state , and not as a mere form of vicious indulgence .â€™ ( Rolleston , HMSO 1926 ) .
By pursuing this line , Rolleston arrived almost accidentally at the sympathetic modern day conception of the drug abuser , over half a century before Hartnoll et al ( 1980 ) found evidence of serious childhood disturbance in his patients at a drug dependency clinic in UCH .
In many ways Rolleston was the first proponent of the guiding philosophy of most modern drug work , â€˜harm reductionâ€™ , which I shall later consider in detail .
The progressive attitude to drug use institutionalised in this report established the framework of public policy for the next five decades , and following 1926 the â€˜British Systemâ€™ prosecuted dealers and dilettantes , but permitted medical prescription of heroin to addicts after â€œevery effortâ€ had been made for the â€œcure of the addictionâ€ , but when the drugs could not be fully withdrawn without â€œsevere distress or even risk of lifeâ€  or â€ œexperience showed that a certain minimum dose of the drug was necessary for the patients to lead useful and relatively normal lives … capable of work.â€ 
This twin policy of â€˜policing and prescribingâ€™ effectively contained the heroin problem ( which ran at below a hundred notified heroin addicts ) for the next four decades .
With the Sixties came an atmosphere of moral panic at the scale of a well - publicised increase in drug use ( Plant , 1987 ) .
Although the drugs in question were mostly cannabis and amphetamines , not heroin , attitudes to drug use and regulation were re-appraised : amphetamines and LSD were brought under tight statutory control , and the government began to fear that with a rising demand for drugs , the licit opiate supply system might start supplying the illicit market .
From 1959 to 1964 the number of addicts notified to the Home Office increased from 68 to 342 ( Spear 1969 ) , and it was noted that an unusually large proportion of these new addicts were of non-therapeutic origin , that is , an unusually large proportion of new users had not come to addiction via chronic medical treatment for physical disease or injury .
In 1964 , the government convened the Brain Committee , an interdepartmental re-incarnation of the Rolleston Committee , who found that â€ ˜the major source of supply had been excessive prescribing by a small group of doctorsâ€ ™ ( HMSO 1965 ) .
They recommended that the prescription of drugs to addicts should be restricted to specialist clinics , â€ ˜Drug Dependency Unitsâ€™ , and although heroin for physical ailments could still be freely prescribed , laws were passed requiring that doctors who prescribed heroin for addicts should be specifically approved by the Home Secretary .
From the beginning of the seventies , there was a major sea change in the treatment of addicts ( Stimson & Oppenheimer 1982 ) .
This was characterised by an emphasis on abstinence as the primary goal of treatment , and a refusal to prescribe heroin : instead , on condition of abstinence from all other drugs , and under â€˜treatment contractsâ€™ , heroin addicts were prescribed a new drug , methadone , to be taken orally .
It has been proposed that the reluctance of doctors to prescribe heroin was probably , in a number of cases , due to the fact that most addicts were so keen to obtain this drug : this made doctors working in the field uneasy , and Glossop ( 1995 ) believes that prescribing a medicine which was less desirable for the client was more easily rationalised .
In the mid-1970 ’s there was an upsurge in the illicit heroin market in London .
The factors alleged to have contributed to this include : an upsurge in illicit demand following the change in DDU policy ; the end of the Vietnam War , requiring the South - East Asian producers to find new markets after the GIs went home ; wealthy Iranian exiles using heroin as a means of getting their capital out of the country after the downfall of the Shah ; and political troubles in Afghanistan and Pakistan ( Mott 1991 ) .
Over the course of the decade , the market ceased to be run by amateurs , as professional criminals extended their interests from the cannabis market to heroin ( Clark 1980 ; Lewis 1985 ) .
Driven in part by a pyramid dealing network , where addicts at the bottom of the distribution chain had an interest in selling to fund their own use ( Gilman & Pearson 1991 ) , heroin use expanded enormously throughout the next twenty years .
The Contemporary Heroin Problem
The Home Office were notified of 35,000 heroin addicts in 1994 : due to incomplete reporting , and other obstacles in reaching the addict population , this is widely believed to represent between a third and a fifth of all addicts ( ISDD 1994 ) , thus putting the true figure at between 100,000 and 160,000 .
Contemporary heroin addiction is no longer an issue between the individual and their metabolism .
The nature of the drug , the scale of its use , and its position in modern society , all mean that addicts experience more diverse problems , and cause more diverse problems , than the heroin addict of the nineteenth century .
The generally poor health of chronic addicts is usually not a direct result of the opiates as such .
Heroin is very addictive but does not in itself cause any serious illnesses , nor does it harm any organs or tissues : the indirect consequences are of course more serious .
Pain sensations are suppressed , with the results that certain signals ( for example , problems with teeth , infections , cold , heat and hunger ) are not noticed .
Because opiates also suppress feelings and emotions , the ability to enter into social relations with others is also seriously affected , so not only physical but social functioning worsens .
Another important issue is how the addict can maintain a supply of heroin .
The enormous cost of heroin on the black market is met for the most part by acquisitive property crime .
The economics of the illicit market are remarkable : at the farmgate in Pakistan , a kilogram of opium costs $ 90 ; when it has been converted to heroin it costs $ 3,000 in Pakistan ; wholesale in the USA it costs $ 80,000 ; and its final retail price on the street ( at the DEAâ€™s quoted average purity of 40 % ) is $ 290,000 per kilogram ( United Nations Drug Control Program Report , 1997 , p126 ) .
On the streets of the UK , a gram of heroin costs between Â£50 and Â £ 120 ( UNDCP 1997 p194 ) .
The cost of acquisitive crime committed to pay for this heroin has been estimated at Â £ 1.5 billion per year .
Addicts in the UK generally steal to fund their addiction : thus they risk likely impoverishment and imprisonment .
One study showed that 80 % of addicts attending a DDU clinic had been convicted of at least one offence in the course of their drug taking careers ( Hartnoll et al 1980 ) .
More crucially for long - term outcome , since they often steal from family and friends , addicts risk social isolation .
Furthermore , since the drug is at such a premium , it will be used in the most efficient fashion possible which is , of course , intravenous injection ( intravenous use of alcohol under prohibition of alcohol in the USA has also been documented ) ( Stevenson 1994 ) .
Intravenous use of any drug carries its own dangers .
A large proportion of the morbidity experienced amongst heroin addicts is due to wound infection , septicaemia , and infective endocarditis , all due to asterile injection technique ( Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine , 1996 , p.184-5 ) .
Infection is another major cause of morbidity and mortality in intravenous drug users internationally ( UNDCP 1997 ) .
Heroin addicts tend to lead chaotic lifestyles and have low self - esteem , both of which , along with expediency , contribute to a tendency to share needles with other users .
Via this route they become infected with HIV , and hepatitis B and C .
10 % of UK AIDS cases in 1995 were related to the use of intravenous drugs , and it is suspected that the increase in HIV infection amongst non-intravenous drug using heterosexuals is being driven by contact with heterosexual intravenous drug users ( European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS , 1996 ) , and the World Health Organisation estimates that 40 % of recent AIDS cases internationally were caused by drug users sharing injecting equipment ( WHO 1994 ) .
It was the spread of HIV through intravenous drug use that led to the reconsideration of heroin addiction treatment in the late 1980 ’s , and was the birth of the new policy of â€˜harm reductionâ€™ .
The HIV seropositivity rate amongst intravenous drug users in Edinburgh , where needle - exchange and maintenance programs had been vigorously opposed , rose to over 50 % in the mid-1980 â€™s ( Robertson et al 1986 ) .
By comparison , in Glasgow , where such facilities were available , less than fifty miles away , the level of seropositivity was less than 5 % ( Follett et al 1986 ) .
[ edit note : this may be wrong , there might be other explanations , well i was only a medical student ]
A policy of harm reduction tackles public health issues directly by seeking to reduce the personal and social costs of drug use .
Abstinence is not regarded as a realistic short - term goal for most dependent users , and the principal ingredients of most programs are syringe exchanges , educational and advisory services , and treatment and maintenance services ( generally with methadone ) .
There is a hierarchy of achievable objectives , with non-users urged to abstain , and users advised to reduce doses , and to avoid the most potent drugs and riskier means of ingestion .
Those who insist on injecting are offered advice on safer technique , and those who persist in sharing needles are even taught how to clean their equipment ( Newcombe 1992 ) .
This policy has been vigorously opposed in some parts of the world , especially the USA , where drug related mortality is almost twice that of the UK ( UNDCP 1997 ) .
Despite this , it has become the guiding principle behind UK drugs policy , along with the maintenance prescription of methadone .
Methadone
Methadone is an opioid receptor agonist with a half life of approximately 24 hours , far longer than heroin .
Drugs with longer half - lives tend to produce less acute withdrawal effects , a phenomenon which is utilised in the choice of anxiolytic drugs in psychiatric practice ( British National Formulary , September 1999 ) .
Crucially , in comparison with heroin , methadone has a greatly reduced euphoric effect .
The hope for methadone , therefore , is that it can contain the opiate cravings , on a once daily oral dose , without providing so much of a â€˜highâ€™ .
The aim of methadone maintenance is to stabilise and then to â€˜cureâ€™ the opiate user .
This breaks down into such objectives as : improving the health of drug users , by providing clean drugs in measured doses under medical supervision ; reducing drug - related crime by providing users with free legal opiates , thus reducing their need to steal to fund illicit heroin ; improving the social situation of drug users ( family relationships , finances , employment , housing and so on ) ; persuading users to reduce their daily dose and ultimately take steps towards abstinence .
This is in many ways an updated version of Rolleston ’s rationale from 1926 .
However , the policy of prescribing methadone may be criticised from many different angles , and to the best of my knowledge these criticisms have never been comprehensively considered in one article .
Certainly there is no convenient meta-analysis of methadone programs .
I shall consider each criticism in detail , and later compare the use of methadone to the maintenance prescription of heroin , which still continues on a small scale in the UK , and has recently been re-assessed in Switzerland and Australia .
Firstly , it is important to recognise that methadone is not a pleasant drug to take , causing nausea and vomiting , weight gain , profuse sweating , dysphoria , and tooth decay .
This is no major selling point to a patient group clearly accustomed to making stringent aesthetic judgements about their drugs and this , combined with the absence of the â€˜buzzâ€™ of heroin , means that the take - up rate amongst addicts is far lower than it ever was for heroin .
Hartnoll et al ( 1980 ) found that only 29 % of those offered methadone in one DDU between 1972 and 1975 were still attending 12 months later .
The reality of take - up rates for methadone prescription programs amongst the general population of heroin addicts today is that only a small minority of addicts will attend methadone clinics , certainly less than 15 % , although specific statistics are hampered by the unknown quantity of the denominator , that is , the number of people in a population addicted to illicit drugs ( Dorn , Baker , Seddon 1994 ) .
Treatment for drug dependency , to be successful and especially to have an impact at a community level , must have high take - up and retention rates amongst problem drug users who , unlike adults with right iliac fossa pain , may not spontaneously present themselves to healthcare professionals .
In order to be successful , therefore , a drug dependency unit must offer both treatment and the drug at a â€˜priceâ€ ™ which the users are willing to pay : the prescriptions may be free , but the terms and conditions on which they are offered may act as a deterrent to some users , and the product offered ( counseling services , advice , and possibly substitute drugs ) must be appealing .
Health economists have couched the problem in their own terminology : â€ ˜for treatment to have a high take - up rate , it must sell … and be seen to sell … a good product at low costâ€™ ( Stevenson 1994 ) .
Retention in treatment , firstly , is an area where the philosophy guiding the work of a clinic may have as much of an impact as the nature of the drug they are offering .
In a controlled study in Australia ( Bell , Chan , Kuk 1995 ) , heroin addicts were assessed and randomised to two clinics , one oriented to long - term methadone maintenance , and the other oriented to time - limited treatment , aiming primarily at abstinence from all drugs , including methadone .
Both groups were urine - tested for heroin , and use of heroin outside the clinic was higher in the abstinence - oriented clinic .
An observational study in a different country showed that addicts were more likely to discharge themselves earlier from methadone clinics where the clinic staff scored highly on an â€ ˜Abstinence Orientation Scaleâ€™ , measuring their commitment to abstinence - oriented policies on heroin addiction ( Caplehorn , Irwig , Saunders 1996 ) .
Other studies have shown that external compulsion to attend clinics , for example by law courts , is also associated with poor retention .
Conversely , a high re-attendance rate has been demonstrated at ‘ user friendly ’ clinics where needle exchange and clean drugs are available , with no uninvited counseling ( Newcombe & Parker 1987 ) .
Experience has taught that regular and enduring contact with treatment services is a necessary precondition for successful treatment of addicts ( Hartnoll et al 1980 ; Gossop , Strang , Connell 1982 ) .
Finally , studies of drug users who present to rehabilitation programs have shown that they are often in a poorer state of health than other heroin addicts in the population ( of equally long - standing ) who have not chosen to present , and this is taken by some commentators to mean that addicts will only present as a last resort ( UNDCP 1997 ) .
Thus methadone programs are by no means a universally attractive option to the addict population , and addicts often use their drug of choice to supplement their prescription .
Use of heroin outside the confines of a drug rehabilitation program ( whilst ostensibly attending it ) is , of course , associated with all of the risks of everyday heroin addiction : increased risk of intravenous drug use leading to infection , increased acquisitive crime , poor family relations .
More importantly , the chaotic nature of the drug use means that the chances of abstinence after a period of regulated drug use are reduced .
Thus use of heroin outside the clinic may be considered one of the definitively poor outcome measures .
However , methadone is also a dangerous drug in its own right : astonishingly , use of methadone has a higher mortality even than the use of illicit heroin , although to what extent is uncertain .
For example , in 1992 , there were 101 deaths from methadone , and 40 from heroin ; similarly , from 1982 to 1991 there were 349 methadone deaths and 243 heroin deaths ( OPCS ) : this is despite the fact that there are far more users of heroin , at every strata of use , by a factor of at least 3:2 , than of methadone .
However , to quantify the mortality requires an accurate denominator ( the number of users for each drug ) and this , as we have already discussed , can only be achieved indirectly for a covert and underground activity such as drug abuse .
Estimates vary widely according to the denominator used , and authors are never so disingenuous as to claim pinpoint accuracy for their figures , but the most recent data to be analysed estimates the risk of methadone related mortality at around four times that of heroin ( Newcombe 1996 ) .
The dangers of methadone have long been recognised .
Ghodse et al ( 1985 ) analysed the patient records of notified addicts who died in the UK between 1967 and 1981 , and found that among patients using heroin , three quarters of deaths were directly drug related , and ‘ most deaths in which a drug was implicated were due to medically prescribed drugs ’ ( invariably methadone ) .
A retrospective cohort study followed up 128 addicts who first presented in London in 1969 , of whom 28 had died , and reported similar findings ( Oppenheimer 1994 ) .
Reasons for this high mortality have been ascribed to its long half life : a large number of deaths occur in the first few days of treatment , and this may be due to the chronic accumulation of the methadone in the bodies of addicts with reduced liver function ( Harding - Pink 1993 ) .
Other reasons proposed include black market consumption , which is harder to quantify , and the co-administration of heroin and methadone , for which there is less evidence , albeit that death certificates provide notoriously poor data ( Maudsley & Williams 1996 ) .
Clearly there is a paucity of mortality data in the literature on methadone prescription .
In 1994 , a review of the methodology of drug treatment evaluation found that only four out of seventeen UK studies had used mortality as an outcome measure .
To neglect this most ‘ ineffective ’ of outcomes , in studies of a drug which is prescribed to 17,000 British addicts , in whom it has a demonstrably higher mortality than the drug it is substituted for , seems extraordinary .
Finally , and perhaps most bizarrely , it is generally recognised that methadone is a more addictive drug than heroin , with a more arduous withdrawal process , and this fact is recognised both among the drug using subculture ( Stewart 1985 ) and in the scientific literature ( Gossop 1991 ) .
Heroin on Prescription
The current situation is that very little heroin is prescribed in the UK : it was estimated that 117 addicts were prescribed heroin in 1992 , while 17,000 were prescribed methadone ( Gossop 1995 ) .
Maintenance prescription of heroin , the ‘ British System ’ until the 1960 ’s , is the ultimate extension of harm reductionist philosophy .
There are many deductive arguments to support it , but little modern experimental data , and many criticisms that are laid against it .
I shall consider these extensively , before examining the few studies of contemporary heroin maintenance programs which have recently been published .
The philosophy behind the prescription of heroin owes a lot to the findings of the Rolleston Committee in 1926 , is similar to the thinking behind methadone prescription , and is essentially as follows : addiction itself is not something that is readily amenable to medical intervention , and as such opiates are prescribed to the addict for as long as they remain addicted , in order to keep them in a state of good health and leading as normal ( and crime - free ) a life as possible .
Addiction has been famously characterised by Vaillant ( 1991 ) as a chronic relapsing condition with a spontaneous remission rate of 5 per cent per annum regardless of external intervention .
This apparently flippent description is supported by empirical data on long term follow - up of addicts ( Stimson et al 1978 ) which show that no external agency expedites the ending of addiction , not even major life events ( Sobell 1990 ) .
With drug addiction , we are often choosing between problems , rather than solutions , and so heroin maintenance , which is only ever offered to patients who have failed with other modalities of treatment , could be considered the best of a bad lot .
“ with readily available prescribed opiates , there is no need to commit acquisitive crime to buy drugs , to sell drugs to others to finance one ’s own use , and to risk one ’s own ( and others ’ ) health , not to mention life , with adulterated drugs of unknown strength ” ( Marks 1991 ) .
It is also likely to promote attendance at the clinic for intervention when deemed appropriate , and an important side effect is the denial to criminals of a lucrative source of income .
There are of course a number of criticisms of heroin prescription .
The first is that it negates the deterrent effect of the criminal law .
However , heroin addicts already resist the deterrent effects of arrest , imprisonment , beatings by gangsters , social isolation , and injury or death through adulterants and disease .
It is hard to imagine any greater sanctions than these , and so for addicts of this nature the choice may not be between detoxification or prescribed heroin , but between heroin from the illicit market or heroin from a clinic .
The second criticism is the possibility that heroin prescription would increase drug use in the general population .
However , there is good evidence that untreated addicts must indulge in low level and aggressive marketing of heroin to provide themselves with a supply ; that is , they push the drug in order to obtain it , thus promoting increased general consumption ( Gilman and Pearson , 1991 ) .
It was partly the cessation of maintenance prescription in the 1960 ’s that led to the arrival of an aggressive black market ( Mott 1991 ) .
Furthermore , it seems likely that the improved contact with family , friends , and healthcare providers that comes with maintenance prescription improves the chances of a healthy productive lifestyle and ultimate abstention .
This criticism of increased general use is linked to the fear of leakage of prescribed heroin onto the black market .
This problem is best addressed by the careful prescription of an exact dose by specialist prescribers , and the evidence from the one remaining Rolleston clinic in the UK , or rather from the local drugs squad ( who undertook to examine all arrested addicts for evidence of drugs prescribed by the clinic ) , was that there was no leakage onto the black market ( Marks 1991 ) .
A final criticism of heroin prescription is that it is expensive , costing up to ten times more per year , per addict , than methadone .
Firstly it is important to recognise that the cost of any drug is not the sole factor in the running of a nationwide treatment and rehabilitation program .
Public expenditure on drug control was Â£ 500 million in 1995 , and of this Â£ 60 million was spent on treatment and rehabilitation , while Â£ 350 million was spent on police and customs enforcement , deterrents , and control ( which prevents less than 15 % of drugs from arriving on the black market ) ( HMSO 1995 , quoted : UNDCP 1997 ) .
If we calculate that there were 20,000 recipients of Â£ 500 of methadone annually , that is Â£ 10 million from the treatment budget , which would be Â£ 100 million if heroin was prescribed to a similar number .
It seems likely that take - up and retention rates in clinics would increase if heroin was prescribed .
Thus it would seem that this is perhaps the most viable of all our criticisms , and local health authorities have criticised heroin prescription on grounds of cost ( ISDD 1996 ) .
However , it has been claimed ( ISDD Bulletin 1996 ) that because only one company may distribute heroin for medicinal purposes in the UK ( Evans Medical ) , a virtual monopoly has been created , to the point where heroin is overpriced by a factor of thirty .
This monopoly position was addressed by the European Court of Justice in 1995 ( Pharmaceutical Journal News 1995 ) , who ruled that the government would have to open up the market to competition , but as yet there are no plans to change the situation .
We must now consider the studies which have sought to compare heroin and methadone .
Such data is extremely thin on the ground : there was one small randomised control trial in UCH from 1972 - 5 ; and one similar study in Switzerland in 1995 ; there is also poorly quantified data from the one Rolleston clinic in the UK which closed in 1995 , and one small case - control study from Northern Ireland .
Hartnoll et al ( 1980 ) studied 96 addicts randomised to oral methadone ( OM ) or heroin maintenance ( HM ) .
After twelve months , 74 % of the HM group were still attending , but only 29 % of the OM group had maintained contact with the clinic .
For both groups , illicit heroin use decreased , in the HM group from 74 to 21 mg / day , but in the OM group from 74 mg to 37 mg / day .
There was no difference between the two groups in employment status , but over the course of the year 32 % of the OM group had spent some time in prison , whereas 19 % of the HM group did so .
Perneger et al ( 1998 ) studied 51 patients randomised similarly to heroin or methadone for six months in Geneva in 1995 .
At follow up , there was a significant difference in use of street heroin , with 48 % of the OM group using street heroin on a daily basis , as opposed to 4 % of the HM group ( p=0.002 ) .
There was also a significant difference in the amount of money spent on drugs between the two groups , with the OM group spending approximately ten times the amount of the HM group ( p=0.039 ) .
Associated with this , the HM group were less likely to be charged with theft ( p=0.015 ) and less likely to be charged with drug dealing or possession ( p=0.067 and p=0.008 respectively ) ; overall , 57 % of the OM group were charged with any offence over the course of the six month trial , whereas 19 % of the HM group were charged ( p=0.0004 ) .
There was also a significant difference in mental health status , with 6 suicide attempts in the OM group , against 1 in the HM group ( p=0.022 ) .
Finally , health related quality of life was measured with the SF - 36 scale , which found a greater improvement for the HM group in mental health ( p=0.025 ) , and social functioning ( p=0.041 ) .
There was no differential improvement in employment status , housing situation , or somatic health between the two groups over six months .
McCusker and Davies ( 1996 ) found similar results at a clinic in Northern Ireland over six months .
The HM group manifested lower levels of psychopathology and showed greater retention in treatment , criminal activity was significantly more reduced , as was illicit heroin use , and although there were again no differences in physical health , the OM group was the only one to report the sharing of used injecting equipment .
Thus our three trials demonstrated many advantages to the prescription of heroin , and none to methadone .
Conclusions
Clearly there are stout grounds for scepticism concerning the validity of prescribing methadone in the treatment of heroin addiction .
It is also clear that there is a paucity of research in this field , a failure which must surely be redressed .
There are certain things of which we can be certain .
Heroin is the most attractive drug for heroin addicts , and however we might wish them to behave , they continue to use illicit sources of the drug even if a substitute is prescribed .
Methadone is undoubtedly a dangerous drug , and one that retards entry of addicts into the treatment programs offered : it is also a drug whose effects have not been comprehensively researched .
Heroin maintenance may well prove to be the best option we have .
Drug addiction is not a phenomenon that lends itself generously to empirical investigation .
Even the outcome indicators are a subject for debate , and a viable study of what many would see as the ultimate index of success , abstention , would require a trial lasting more than a decade .
However , quantifiable indices of health status , social functioning , criminal behaviour , total opiate consumption , needle - sharing and so on are all viable and uncontroversial outcome measures , and should be comprehensively investigated for methadone and heroin .
Furthermore , no indications have been found that prescribing heroin would inflict harm of a kind that might make such trials unacceptable .
Perneger et al ( 1998 ) have noted that although the Swiss trial was small , it was similar to the initial evaluations of methadone , such as the seminal paper by Dole and Nyswander ( 1965 ) , which led to its widespread use in the treatment of drug addiction .
It seems likely that a contributory factor was the medical professionâ€™s emotional and moral attitudes towards drug users .
However noble our intentions when we approach a clinical or social problem , we may often be confounded by extraneous factors and preconceptions , and fail in our objectivity .
We share an obligation to submit all medical interventions to rigorous , continuous and objective re-assessment .
Drug addiction affects 100,000 people in Britain directly , and many more indirectly ; it is responsible for an enormous drain on health care resources , a large proportion of acquisitive crime , and the fastest growing group of HIV infection .
That we should apparently neglect our obligations in such an important field is astonishing .

In addition to the proposal in Arizona that would forbid that state from participating in the REAL ID Act ’s requirements , it looks like Idaho is joining the bandwagon as well :
WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded Idaho for becoming the second state in the nation to reject participation in the Real ID Act .
That law , enacted in 2005 , lays the foundation for a national identity card .
“ Idaho and Maine are just the beginnings of the pending tidal wave of rebellion against Real ID , ” said Charlie Mitchell , Director of the ACLU State Legislative Department .
“ Across the nation , local lawmakers from both parties are rejecting the federal government ’s demand to undermine their constituents ’ privacy and civil liberties with a massive unfunded mandate .
Congress must revisit the Real ID
Act and fix this real mess . ”
On a vote of 19 to 14 , the State Senate today approved House Joint Memorial 3 .
The State House of Representatives had approved the bill unanimously on February 20 .
While the bill does not require the signature of Idaho Governor Butch Otter , he has also been a vocal critic of the Real ID Act .
The bill states in part that Idaho , “ shall enact no legislation nor authorize an appropriation to implement the provisions of the Real ID Act in Idaho , unless such appropriation is used exclusively for the purpose of undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the costs of implementing the Real ID Act or to mount a constitutional challenge to the act by the state Attorney General . ”
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Sunday evening called German Chancellor Angela Merkel and expressed his regret over the incident that took place between the Israel Defense Forces and the German navy in Lebanon last week .
He promised that Israel would do everything in order to prevent such incidents from recurring .
Olmert updated Merkel on developments in the region and said he would accept her invitation to visit her country in the coming weeks .
Earlier Sunday , Olmert apologizes to a German parliamentary delegation for the misunderstandings between the IDF and German naval forces off the Lebanon coast .
Olmert spoke during a 40 - minute meeting in Jerusalem with a senior parliamentary delegation from the party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Earlier Sunday , Germany said on its navy , which is patrolling the Lebanese coast as part of an international peacekeeping force , had been involved in a second incident involving Israeli fighter planes .
The Defense Ministry said it occurred on Thursday and involved a German navy helicopter and Israeli F - 16 fighters .
Previous Incident Peretz : Israel did n't fire at German ship / Efrat Weiss Defense Minister Amir Peretz denies report that two IAF jets fired shots towards German vessel off shores of Lebanon .
Peretz speaks with his German counterpart , guarantees him Israel will not attack country 's ships Full story
" We are aware of the episode , but it was not menacing , " The spokesman said , after the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported the Israeli planes had " dangerously badgered "
The helicopter .
The spokesman said the area was used by the Israeli air force for training , adding : " Perhaps other standards apply for them than for us . "
On Wednesday , Israel denied a German newspaper report that two of its air force planes had fired twice as they flew over a German navy ship patrolling the Lebanon coast .
But it did say jets had been scrambled when a helicopter took off from a German aircraft carrier without identifying itself .
Germany confirmed at the time that that an incident had occurred , but gave no details .
It subsequently received assurances from Defense Minister Amir Peretz that the air force would not carry out any hostile fire or maneuvers around German vessels .
German defense minister to visit Israel , Lebanon
Germany assumed command of a UN naval force off Lebanon this month , and has sent eight ships and 1,000 service personnel to join the international peace operation in the region .
The naval force is charged with preventing weapons smuggling and helping maintain a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese Hizbullah guerrillas .
Meanwhile , the German Defense Minister said Sunday that Germany 's Defense Minister Franz Joseph Jung will go to Israel and Lebanon this week , a trip that follows last week 's incident involving a German ship off the Lebanese coast and Israeli fighter jets .
German officials said the Israeli jets fired in the air over a German intelligence - gathering ship in international waters .
Israel denies that shots were fired and said the planes approached a helicopter after it took off Tuesday from a German ship without notifying Israeli forces .

Google Security Hole Allows Account Hijacking
It ’s your worst nightmare – someone reads parts of your Google emails , views your docs , modifies your spreadsheets , checks out your reading habits on the Google personalized homepage or Google Reader , and goes through your search history .
Yet , by making use of a new Google security hole , Tony Ruscoe was able to do all that with my Google account .
Tony ’s not a malicious hacker of course ( in fact , the first thing he did was inform Google Security ! ) , but he found a loophole in a new feature Google rolled out recently .
Using a proof of concept script targeting this loophole – which I can detail once it ’s fixed – , all Tony needed to do was make a user who ’s logged into their Google Account visit a page of his , which happened to be on a “ trustworthy ” google.com sub - domain .
I visited Tony ’s page , which sent my Google cookies to Tony , which in turn enabled him to :
Get into my Google Docs & Spreadsheets application and read and modify documents I saved there
Read subjects from my Gmail inbox , as well as the first few words of these emails , by adding a Gmail module to the Google Personalized Homepage
View my Google Accounts page
Enter my Google Reader
Read my private Google Notebook
View my complete Google search history ( for as long as I had the search history feature enabled in Google )
This is by far not the end of services
Tony was able to see in our brief tests .
What he specifically was not able to do was to read my full emails , check my Calendar events , or change my Google Account password ( which would ’ve given him full access to anything , basically ) .
Now , the vulnerability in question is a very special kind , and Tony , by “ claiming ” this loophole , also blocked it for other abusers .
This means that for the sake of this case , even though Google did n’t yet fix the hole , there is nothing to worry about ( except that someone might find more holes in the vicinity of this bug ) .
However , I am posting on this because it ’s a worthwhile reminder that no company ’s security is ever completely cracker - proof ; in very rare circumstances , whatever you saved in Google , or entered in Google , can escape your control and land in the wrong hands .
Or , as Tony phrased it on his proof of concept page , “ Think yourself lucky that I was n’t that evil ! ”
[ Thanks Tony ! ]

Or , rather , mostly we do n't .
While silver in ionic form or as a compound with certain salts has some antimicrobial properties , doctors used it in the past only because they had nothing better .
Sure , it turned the patient 's skin a cadaverous grey or blue — a permanent affliction known as argyria .
But they dismissed that as merely a cosmetic problem .
Only later did they learn that silver accumulates in organs of the body just like mercury , lead , arsenic or any other toxic heavy metal .
And while silver may not be quite as toxic as arsenic , many silver compounds are extremely poisonous .
Quite a few are also carcinogens .
None of which has stopped snake - oil merchants from continuing to hawk silver elixirs as “ super-antibiotics ” .
In fact , they have been positively encouraged by recent events .
Triclosan , a powerful antibacterial and antifungal disinfectant , is used nowadays in soap , toothpaste , mouthwash , deodorant and household cleaners .
A theory that it mimics the behaviour of antibiotics has fed fears that it may trigger greater drug - resistance among superbugs .
Although subsequently discounted , such concerns have prompted enough worried users to embrace quack medicines instead .
According to Wired , silver solutions have become one of the most widely marketed health scams on the internet .
Ingot we trust
Now the clamour for consumer products containing an even more worrisome form of silver has eventually prompted officialdom to act .
Last week America 's Environmental Protection Agency reversed its policy on the use of extremely small particles of silver for killing germs .
Henceforth manufacturers seeking to use “ nanosilver ” in consumer products will have to prove scientifically that it does n't cause harm to public health .
This is the first time that American authorities have moved to regulate the country 's burgeoning nanotechnology industry — the $ 3 billion - a - year business of developing , producing and finding uses for materials that have at least one dimension in the range 1-100 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) .
Down at these near - atomic sizes , materials exhibit unique properties that dramatically alter their physical , chemical or biological behaviour .
Some of the earliest applications of nanomaterials have been in products such as stain - resistant fabrics , self - cleaning windows and harder - wearing tennis balls , but more and more are turning up in cosmetics and skin lotions such as sun-blockers .
Over 350 products containing nanomaterials are now on the market , with silver as the most common ingredient by far .
Nanosilver is found in bandages , food - storage containers , shoe - liners and sportswear .
Samsung makes a washing machine that injects silver ions into the final rinse .
Kohler has a line of toilets with silver embedded in the porcelain .
What worries health researchers is that when particles get down to nanoscale dimensions , they are virtually all surface — with , in effect , no “ inside ” inside them .
Because reactions between solids take place on their surfaces rather than within their bulk , nanoparticles can be far more reactive and toxic than a similar mass made up of larger particles .
Also , the atomic - like dimensions of nanoparticles make it easier for them to slip through the skin or , if inhaled , move from the lungs to other organs in the body , including the liver and brain .
The problem is that no - one knows what the long - term effects could be , especially when dealing with a toxic heavy metal such as silver .
Some have wondered whether such nanoparticles will be the asbestos of the 21st century .
That 's probably scare - mongering a bit , given the advance in health and safety precautions over the past half - century .
But in America at least , the EPA has shown it 's not prepared to take that chance .
MIT Press now distributes the second edition of the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( SICP ) in HTML format .
Lytha Ayth converted the book to Texinfo format , so that the book can be viewed in Emacs .
S/he apparently redrew all the figures using ASCII text characters , which is rather perverse .
I 've made very minor modifications to a version of sicp .
texi that was circulating informally at MIT , and distribute my modified version ( and a compiled sicp .
info of it ) via this Web page .
See also the SICP video lectures by Abelson and Sussman .
The warning appears on coin-operated washing machines
The Michigan Lawsuit Abuse Watch says the tendency of Americans to sue companies has gone too far , encouraging absurd warning labels on products .
But others say warning labels can play a role in protecting the public .
An engine manufacturer which warned " Never use a lit match or open flame to check fuel level " won second prize .
Excessive litigation
Warnings not to dry wet mobile phones in microwave ovens and not to iron lottery tickets tied for third place .
Honourable mentions went to a phonebook which advised : " Please do not use this directory while operating a moving vehicle " .
The Michigan Lawsuit Abuse Watch ( M - Law ) is campaigning to cut down on what it considers the harmful effects of excessive litigation in the United States .
The winning labels were selected by listeners of a Detroit radio station from a list compiled by M - Law .
The group began the Wacky Warning Labels contest 10 years ago as part of its campaign to have " common sense warnings on products " , M - Law says on its website .
But a spokesperson from the washing machine maker whose label bagged top prize , said its warning is valid .
" A front loader ( washing machine ) is just at the right height - speaking now as a mother and not a corporate spokeswoman - for a four - year - old , " said Patti Andresen Shew of Alliance Laundry Systems .
She said other companies had been sued after small children had climbed into washing machines which had then been started .

If you have enjoyed using Torisugari 's favicon picker in Firefox 1.0 through 1.0.6 like I have ,
and find that it has not worked as well since migrating to DeerPark or Firefox Beta1
< a href = " https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&category=Bookmarks&numpg=50&id=325&page=comments&pageid=1 " target = " _blank " class= " postlink " >( prior version 0.2.6 is found here ) < /a > , then this version 0.3.0 may help resolve your issues .
Extension version 0.3.0 will only work with Firefox 1.5 BETA or later .
Please continue to use the author 's original extension for the Firefox 1.0.x releases
< a href = " http://www.extensionsmirror.nl/index.php?showtopic=617&hl=favicon " target = " _blank " class= " postlink " >( prior version 0.2.5 is found here ) </a >.
Usage :
To modify a bookmark entry or favorites toolbar entry , right - mouse - click on entry and
select Properties .
You will see an icon image , ERASE , and BROWSE buttons
added .
Selecting ERASE will set the entry back to the default icon and BROWSE will let
you navigate to assign an icon file for the entry .
When done , clicking OK will accept the changes
into your saved bookmarks and CANCEL will abort your session back to Firefox .
Background Info :
With faviconpicker 0.2.6
I have been unsuccessful in clicking on bookmark menu entries or favorite
bookmarks to modify the default icon ( either to erase or modify ) .
I pointed this out to the author back
in June and again recently when I began to examine / modify his faviconpicker .js code .
I have been
attempting to reach Torisugari by email , spreadfirefox , and mozillaZine for quite some time now with
no responses from him , so I took the liberty of generating this newer version and invite the author
to acknowledge or contribute when he so choses .
This extension is a collaboration between myself and Firefox contributor mook .
Mook's
understanding of the Firefox code base has been invaluable as the two of us diagnosed the code and
came up with this update .
In order to maintain the author 's original code design , this extension update contains some generic
un-elegant workarounds that we put in .
I have been using it now for some time with a variety of
extensions ( see my tag line for my extensions ) with no issues .
Besides repairing the icon
right - mouse properties usage , we put in some memory checks , cleaned up the source so it looks better
for printing / maintaining , made an EM icon , and bumped the version from 0.2.6 to 0.3.0 .
Going forward , mook nor I have the time to be able to take ownership for longterm extension support -
so we 'll be hoping it can become a true community effort should further enhancements be needed .
This
assumes of course the original author continues to be unavailable or that the author returns to take on
support for his extension as he sees fit .
I 'm not sure how to promote the extension into the various extension mirrors -
if someone could help get the word out to post this extension , that would be great .

Opowiadam.pl jest serwisem , w którym można tworzy ć opowiadania we współpracy z innymi użytkownikami serwisu .
To bardzo intrygujący pomysł .
Po stworzeniu konta i zalogowaniu dowiedziałem się , że serwis jest mocno przemyślany ( nie jakaśtam beta ; ) ) .
Genralnie bazuje na zasadzie , że nie ma nic za darmo - ważniejsze operacje w systemie należy opłacić punktami , które też zbiera się za aktywność pisarską ( można też dokupić SMSem ) .
Zbierając punkty możemy przechodzić na kolejne poziomy - wpływa to nie tylko na ego piszącego :) ) ale też na sposób naliczania punktów ( efekt śnieżnej kuli - im więcej piszemy tym szybciej zbieramy punkty ) .
Podsumowując - zabawa rewelacyjna .
Kilka słów od jednego z autorów pomysłu - Daniela Kaczmarka ( AKTUALIZACJA - drugim współtwórcą serwisu jest Andrzej Urbański ) :
Model jest tak przemyślany , że użytkownik nagradzany jest za to , że prowadzi opowiadanie - otrzymuje punkty za dopisy innych użytkowników do jego opowiadania - nagradzanie za zapał i za moderowanie opowiadania .
Na czym sie wzorowaliśmy ?
System puntkowy jest wzorowany na FantasyWorld.pl , moim pierwszym serwisie który prowadzę już 5 lat .
To już wtedy działało , ale teraz chcieliśmy stworzy ć osobny serwis dla każdego i naprawdę mocno zaawansowany .
Punkty sprawiają , że ludzie starają się a pomysł się podoba , bo to frajda myślec sobie np .
że mój bohater będzie żył jeszcze kilka chwil , po czym ktoś dopisując kolejną część , uśmierca bohatera i okazuje się że całość jest logiczna .
Jak się to ma do web 2.0 ?
Pokazowy przykład “ user contributed value ” i “ co-creation ” .
Można ten projekt porównać ( choć tylko w kwestii kategorii ) z opisywanym na TechCrunch unblokt - tyle , że tam kontekst w którym pracujemy jest o wiele węższy - widzimy tylko dwa zdania ( czasami nawet znacznie od siebie oddalone ) i musimy wstrzelić się z naszym pomysłem .
W opowiadam.pl jest dużo “ łatwiej ” - możemy napisać aż 1700 znaków i jeśli rozpoczniemy opowiadanie zyskujemy status moderatora ( dla tego opowiadania ) i przez to możemy kontrolować jego rozwój .
Na szczególn ą uwagę zasługuje fakt , że autorzy wyposażyli serwis w kilka miłych dodatków jak kanał RSS ze zmianami , możliwość chatu z zalogowanymi użytkownikami i system wysyłania wiadomości do innych użytkowników - to znacznie ułatwia pracę nad utworami .
Na razie nie sposób powiedzieć jaki ostatecznie będzie poziom dzieł powstających w serwisie - w tej chwili jest jeszcze relatywnie mało dopisów bo serwis niedawno wystartował .
Przeczytałem kilka opowiadań i myślę , że w takim collaborative writing jest jeden szkopuł - osoba dopisuj ąca swój kawałek często ma pokusę rozwijania bieżącego wątku co powoduje , że czasami sceny wydają się przydługie .
No ale możne to kwestia wyrobienia - podejrzewam , że niektórym twórcom łatwiej jest rozwijać wątek , innym wprowadzać zmiany - by ć może zatem przydałby się interfejs pozwalający dopisywać sceny również w środku a nie tylko na końcu ?
No , ale wtedy dochodzimy do wiki …
Przychodzi mi do głowy , że mogłoby by ć interesujące regularne zapraszanie do współpracy polskich profesjonalnych pisarzy - jak choćby z fantastyki Andrzej Sapkowski , Anna Brzezińska , Rafał Ziemkiewicz - ciekawe byłoby obserwować jak opowiadanie rozwija się pod okiem profesjonalisty w porównaniu do zupełnie amatorskiego podejścia .
Podsumowując - serwis dopracowany , przemyślany i ciekawy .
W erze blogowania , citizen journalism - doskonały do ćwiczenia pióra .
Polecam !
If you missed The Tonight Show last night , then you did n’t hear Al Gore ’s answer to Jay Leno ’s question about what it ’s like for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate to suddenly be a movie star .
( OK , An Inconvenient Truth ‘s celeb was obviously rehearsed .
But the lines were funny nevertheless . )
“ I ’m in this HUGE feud with Lindsay Lohan , ” Gore said straight - faced .
Leno asked , “ Can you tell us more about it ? ”
To which Al replied , managing just the right petulant tone , “ She knows what she did . ”
Then Leno asked Gore if he ’d ever do a nude scene if it was integral to the storyline and … I turned off the TV .

Get personalized bank recommendations in 3 easy steps .
Get started
Your favorite credit card has sat in the top pocket of your wallet for years .
You have memorized the interest rate , the credit limit and its perks .
Think you know everything about your favorite credit card ?
Not necessarily .
Even if you ’ve carried the card for years , it could have a couple of surprises in store .
Card issuers and the government continue to change card rules .
Interest rates and credit limits can grow or shrink with your circumstances — or those of the card issuer .
And then there are those uncommon details you may have missed .
But do n’t stay in the dark .
Like any card game , you stand a better chance of holding a winning hand if you know the rules .
Here are eight secrets you may not know about the plastic in your wallet .
Fact No. 1 : No cap on credit card interest
Even though you signed up for your credit card for its low interest rate , here ’s a scary , little - known fact :
Many card issuers can raise interest rates as high as they like .
The top 10 banks that issue credit cards are federally chartered banks and do n’t have to follow state laws limiting interest rates , says Chi Chi Wu , staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center .
“ So they are free to set the rates as high as they want , ” Wu says .
Your interest rate is only protected for the card ’s first year ( or first six months , if it ’s a teaser rate ) , under the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act , or CARD Act .
If you go 60 days late on a payment , that protection disappears .
A variable rate tied to an index can also increase if the index goes up .
But if you ’ve had the card for more than one year , the issuer can hike your rate even if you ’ve been a model customer , says John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education for SmartCredit.com .
Two caveats , courtesy of the CARD Act :
That hike applies only to new charges ( your current balance will be assessed the old rate ) .
And the issuer has to give you 45 - day advance notice .
Fact No. 2 : Say ‘ no ’ to higher interest
If your credit card issuer hikes your APR , you can say “ thanks , but no thanks , ” under the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act , or CARD Act .
It ’s possible the company will cut you a deal and let you keep the old interest rate ( get that in writing ) , says John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com .
But it ’s also just as likely the issuer will reduce your credit line , increase your minimum payment or simply close your credit card , he says .
But here ’s what the issuer ca n’t do : Demand that you pay off the entire bill on short notice .
If you refuse the new rate , you have at least five years to pay off your balance under the old rate , says Todd Mark , vice president of education at Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Dallas .
Your higher rate may not last forever , either .
If your issuer raised the rate after you paid your bill late or not at all for two months in a row , then your rate could come back down .
Under the CARD
Act , the issuer has to review your account after six months .
If you ’ve behaved yourself , the issuer should reset the APR to your pre-penalty rate .
Fact No. 3 : Credit card protections
You buy something online , and it never arrives .
What you ordered in the store is not what is delivered .
Or a charge pops up on your bill that ’s not yours .
Do n’t worry ; your credit card has your back .
Credit cards provide certain consumer rights that are a “ forgotten powerful protection , ” says Todd Mark , vice president of education for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Dallas .
For example , the maximum liability for unauthorized purchases on a stolen or lost credit card is $ 50 under federal law , though most issuers offer zero liability .
If the loss involves just your credit card number , then you have no liability under the law .
The Fair Credit Billing
Act allows consumers to seek a refund from their credit card issuers for an unsatisfactory purchase .
The charge must be at least $ 50 , and the purchase made within 100 miles of your home .
You also must have made an effort to resolve the matter with the seller first .
In addition to federal rights , some cards offer return protection , protection against lost or broken merchandise , or extended warranties .
Fact No. 4 : Card may be denied abroad
Some card terminals overseas only accept EMV credit cards , named for developers Europay , Mastercard and Visa .
These cards contain a microchip instead of a magnetic strip .
Magnetic - stripe cards are more common in the U.S .
“ Many people get overseas and find out they ca n’t use their credit card , ” says Todd Mark , vice president of education for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Dallas .
Automated kiosks for tickets and transportation are the likeliest sources of frustration for U.S. travelers with mag - stripe cards , says Gwenn Bezard , research director at Aite Group .
In some cases , they can use their mag - stripe cards when an attendant is manning the ticket booth , he says .
At least 19 issuers , such as Chase , Citi and U.S. Bank offer chip cards in the U.S. , says Randy Vanderhoof , executive director of the Smart Card Alliance .
They issue them mostly in smaller numbers to customers who travel internationally , he says .
If chip technology is the norm in the country you ’re visiting , request an EMV version of your card before you leave if the issuer offers them , Mark says .
Or , look into buying prepaid chip cards at your destination , says Bezard .
Chip card or not , let your issuer know about your travel plans abroad .
Otherwise , the issuer could temporarily suspend charging privileges due to fraud concerns .
Fact No. 5 : Fixed rates can fluctuate
Just because your credit card has a fixed rate today does n’t mean it always will .
Along with changing your interest rate , card issuers can change the way your rate is calculated , says John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com .
So , a card that carries a fixed rate could become a variable - rate card in the future , he says .
If the interest rate goes up because of the change , then the issuer must give 45 days ’ notice under the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act , or CARD Act , says Ulzheimer .
If the rate stays the same or decreases , it ’s unclear whether the issuer must tell you .
But if the issuer wants to slice your credit limit or close your card , it does n’t have to tell you until after the fact , he says .
On the upside , the issuer must send a copy of the credit score used to make the decision to lower your limit or close your account under new federal rules issued last year .
Also , if you ’re declined , the bureau which provided the information must give you a free copy of your credit report if you ask , says Ulzheimer .
“ At least you know why , ” he says .
“ Before , it was kind of a mystery and you really would n’t know . ”
Fact No. 6 : Card balances can be tricky
Some cards have no spending limit , but they may limit the amount you can carry from one month to the next , says Chi Chi Wu , staff attorney with the National Consumer Law Center .
If so , you ’re required to pay the amount that ’s greater than the “ revolving ” limit with your next payment , she says .
For example , charging $ 7,500 on a no- limit credit card may sound great in theory .
But if the maximum you ’re allowed to carry month - to - month is $ 5,000 , you ’re on the hook for $ 2,500 , she says .
Wu recommends doing the math before you charge .
So what if you never carry a balance ?
That might not be what your credit report is telling lenders , says John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com .
Often the balance recorded on your credit report is the one listed on your monthly statement , he says .
What your report may not show is whether you carry a balance or pay in full .
The trick to maintaining a zero balance on your credit report is to pay the bill in full before the statement date rather than the due date , he says .
The potential boost to your credit score ?
“ It ’s colossal , ” says Ulzheimer .
“ We ’re talking about the second most important category in ( calculating ) the FICO score . ”
Fact No. 7 : Branch bill pay is smart
Try kicking it old school and paying your credit card bill at the bank branch .
The biggest benefit ?
Your payment will be credited the same day , says John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com .
In a similar fashion , you can pay the bill for your retailer credit cards in the store itself .
Ulzheimer calls this one of the “ lesser known ” provisions of the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act , or CARD Act , because “ it ’s not as sexy as some of the other ones . ”
Showing up in person may be better than paying over the Internet because online payments are not immediate .
“ They ’re just more convenient , and they save you the cost of a stamp , ” says Ulzheimer .
Even if you pay on the card issuer ’s website , most payments wo n’t be applied for another two to three days , Ulzheimer says .
It could take longer , a week or more , if you use your own bank ’s website and your bank is n’t your credit card issuer .
It ’s also not mistake - proof , Ulzheimer notes .
“ Just because you made your payment online does n’t mean the payment was actually made , ” he says .
“ You ’d better double - check . ”
Fact No. 8 : Late payments have an impact
Your bill is late if your payment is received after the statement due date .
That means your credit card issuer could hit you with a late fee .
Your credit is blemished too , right ?
Nope .
Your issuer ca n’t report a late account to the credit bureaus until the bill is 30 days past the due date per the credit bureau reporting guidelines , says John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com .
And it ca n’t raise your rate unless you ’re 60 days or more past due , according to the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act , or CARD Act .
“ I think this is one of those great secrets that a lot of consumers do n’t know , ” says Ulzheimer .
“ Delinquency means you ’ve gone one full cycle late . ”
Also good for consumers : Issuers ca n’t set midday deadlines for payments under the CARD Act .
The new deadline is 5 p.m. on the bill ’s due date , says Todd Mark , vice president of education for Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Dallas .
Your issuer also must mail your bill to you 21 days before the payment date .
Plus , it has to be due on the same date every month , adds Ulzheimer .
“ They ca n’t keep moving it around , ” he says .
Tourists and young couples ambling through the historic centre of Krakow on a warm spring afternoon were stopped in their tracks by a sight reminiscent of the era of martial law .
As drinks flowed in the open - air cafes of Poland 's ancient royal capital , a phalanx of armed police in full riot gear inched its way slowly through the medieval city .
But unlike the 1980s when authorities crushed dissent , today 's black - clad police officers were protecting the right to free speech of hundreds of gay and lesbian marchers holding their annual parade in Krakow .
The precautions were wise : within 30 minutes stone - throwing far - right skinheads stormed the protesters from a side street .
" Faggots " , the skinheads screamed as they were beaten back by police charging with batons .
" Tolerance " , the gay and lesbian marchers shouted back , as the far right were joined by smartly dressed protesters from a deeply conservative Polish youth movement .
" Homosexuals are deviants , " said 19 - year - old Liliane Sobczak , a leader of the Mlodziez Wszechpolska group whose members travelled from across Poland to " protect the family " .
The scenes in Krakow provided a telling illustration of a new dividing line between parts of eastern Europe and the western half of the continent .
While gay people in western Europe are increasingly treated as equals in the eye of the law , those in much of the east face discrimination and intolerance .
Days after the violence in Krakow , egg - throwing skinheads and elderly Orthodox women disrupted a gay night at a Moscow nightclub .
Gay clubbers , who endured homophobic taunts as they were evacuated from La Guardia club under police escort , complain of persistent discrimination in the Russian capital .
Yuri Luzhkov , the populist mayor of Moscow , has become a focus of their anger after he pledged to ban the first gay rights march due to take place later this month " to protect the feelings of Muscovites " .
This experience is shared in other parts of eastern Europe , though not on the same scale .
Zsolt Semjen , the leader of Hungary 's Christian Democratic People 's party , declared in the recent election campaign : " We have had enough of the deviances . "
But Mr Semjen 's attempt to court conservative voters backfired as the right lost the election .
Latvia , another recent entrant to the EU , amended its constitution last year to ban gay marriages .
Gay rights groups are most concerned about the climate in Poland , particularly after the highly conservative League of Polish Families joined the coalition government last week .
The league , whose youth group took part in the anti-gay march in Krakow , is even more socially conservative than the president , Lech Kaczynski , who banned gay marches as mayor of Warsaw , or Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz , the prime minister .
Mr Marcinkiewicz summed up the thinking in the coalition 's main Law and Justice party when he told the Polish edition of Newsweek : " If [ a ] person tries to infect others with their homosexuality , the state must intervene in this violation of freedom . "
The assumption that gay people want to spread a diseased lifestyle encourages Catholic groups who have long targeted homosexuality .
Thousands of headteachers have received a 29 - page booklet from the fundamentalist Piotr Skarga Catholic association , named after a 16th - century Polish Jesuit , which issues instructions on how to ensure youngsters do not become gay .
Entitled Taboos about Homosexuality , the pamphlet uses graphic language to scare young people .
" Around 75 % of homosexuals admit they put their tongue into their partner 's anus which means they eat lots of faeces , " the booklet tells teachers .
" Homosexuals crawling in faeces and eating it suffer bad health . "
The booklet attempts to depict gay people as blood suckers .
In a section on oral sex , it says : " Sperm has bacteria which is transferred from blood .
So homosexuals almost drink blood . "
To round off its attack , the booklet declares that homosexuals die young and end up as killers after " research " found that murderers are invariably gay when their sexual orientation is determined .
Such homophobia is alarming gay and lesbian Poles .
" I like this country but this intolerance is very sad , " said Anna Zawadzka , 33 , who lost her job as a special needs teacher at a rural school outside Warsaw after appearing on television to discuss her life as a lesbian .
" A parent who saw me complained to the local priest .
He went to the headteacher and said that the school cannot employ a lesbian .
The school then refused to renew my contract even though they had recently written me a letter saying how good I was . "
A law was introduced by the previous Polish government banning discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , but Ms Zawadzka does not believe this would have made any difference .
She said she was not given a reason for her contract being terminated .
" Most of the intolerance is indirect , " she said .
Her view is shared by Krystian Legierski , who lost a two - year battle to run a gay nightclub in Warsaw in March when police closed down the premises .
The city authorities , who own the building , were careful not to object to the club on the grounds that it was used by gay people .
" The city , which was then led by Lech Kaczynski , just devised lots of administrative ways to close us down , " said Mr Legierski , 28 .
" First they tried to stop us selling alcohol .
Then they tried to claim we were not paying rent . "
A lengthy legal process ended when police officers marched into Le Madame club to enforce a court order by removing supporters .
Mr Legierski said the officers seemed to be embarrassed .
" The police said : ' We 're sorry but we have to do this , ' " Mr Legierski said in his new club , which is based in a building outside the city 's control .
In western Europe , same - sex couples can now register their partnerships in several countries including Britain .
Even Catholic
Spain has legalised gay marriage as part of a series of revolutionary changes by the Socialist government .
Christine Loudes of the European branch of the International Lesbian and Gay Association said there were divisions across Europe , though she believed it was simplistic to talk of a clear east - west split .
The Czech Republic has recently legalised same - sex partnerships , while a minister in Silvio Berlusconi 's outgoing Italian government described a recent gay rights parade as " really nauseating " .
" There is a division , " Ms Loudes said .
" But attitudes depend on whether a conservative or a progressive government is in power . "
With the hard right at the heart of the Polish government , traditionalists will enjoy the upper hand for some time .
Waving a red-and - white Polish flag at the Krakow march with fellow protesters from the Catholic Mlodziez Wszechpolska youth group , Krzysztof Bosak said : " Violence is bad but there is no way you can protest against this abnormality without violence . "

Maybe you wanted to have more control over the options in the Image >
Adjustments menu .
If that ’s the case then you need to learn about Adjustment Layers .
Luckily , that is what this tutorial is about .
We will go over what adjustment layers are and what they are used for .
We will also briefly cover the many available options for adjustment layers , and then finally end with some examples where we will use what we are about to go over .
For this tutorial I am going to assume that the readers already know some basics of Photoshop such as regular layers and the Image >
Adjustments menu .
What is an Adjustment Layer ?
We all know what a layer is ( atleast I assume everyone reading this does 🙂 ) .
We can think of them as transparencies lying on top of each other .
Imagine you take a transparency and you draw something on one and then place it on a stack .
Next you take another transparency and draw something on it and then place it on the same stack .
What is going to happen is that you will be able to see stuff from the first sheet as well as stuff drawn on the second sheet as long as they do n’t overlap .
That is what basic layers are .
Adjustment layers work in the same way in that you can see through them but they do n’t change anything actually below them .
So you can apply an adjustment ( such as hue / saturation changes ) on a transparency / layer and it will become an adjustment layer .
Next you take this adjustment layer and place it on our stack of layers .
Magically , when look through the adjustment layer everything seen through it seems to have that adjustment .
However , it does n’t actually change the layers below thus giving you a lot of control over what you do .
You can change the adjustments later if you do n’t like the effect as well .
Read on for detailed step by step tutorials
How to make and manage an Adjustment Layer
1 . First select the regular layer on which you want the adjustment layer to be placed .
2 . Next you can either click on the button in the Layers Palette that looks like a half black and half white circle .
3 . Next choose what ever adjustment you want to apply
4 . Then set up the appropriate settings for the adjustment you chose in step 3 .
5. Click OK
Great .
Now we have an adjustment layer .
Notice that if you hide this layer by clicking on the eye next to it in the layers window you will be able to see the layers below which are unchanged .
Next you can adjust the settings you just in step 4 above by double clicking on the left rectangle in the adjustment layer .
This will bring back the settings of your adjustment .
If you want to change the adjustment layer it self then click on the Adjustment Layer and then go to Layer > Change Layer Content and you can change the type of Adjustment Layer .
Alternately you could just delete the adjustment layer and then recreate one but the former method saves you a few steps . 🙂
Next if you choose BLACK as your foreground color and then paint on your adjustment layer your adjustment layer will go away in the areas you paint on .
If you choose WHITE as your foreground color then your adjustment layer comes back in the areas you paint on .
If you choose a shade of gray then you will get a semi- transparent adjustment layer .
The darker shade of gray you will choose the lighter the adjustment that you applied will appear .
The lighter shade of gray you will choose the more obvious the adjustment that you applied will appear .
You can not use any colors though .
It only works with Black , White and shades of gray in between .
Finally just like regular layers you can also adjust this by playing with the blending options both in the Layers Palette on top ( says Normal by default ) or by going to Layer > Layer Style > Blending Options .
The Adjustment Options
There are 12 Adjustment Options available to you when you create an adjustment layer .
I will go over them in more detail for beginners in later posts but I will give a general description now .
They are :
Solid Color
This slaps a solid color on your stack of layers just like the name suggests .
Gradient
This puts a gradient on your stack of layers Pattern
This allows you to choose a pattern and it applies it to your layer Levels
This allows you to adjust the tones in your image .
You can set the darkest tone and the lightest tone in your image and make the whole image change appear .
You can make a dull image appear bright using Levels Curves
You can use this to fix your highlights and shadows using this option Color Balance
Adjust the colors of highlights , midtones and shadows separately using this option .
Brightness / Contrast
This lightens or darkens your image and increases or decreases the contrast .
Hue / Saturation
This can be used to control the colors , the saturation and lightness or darkness of the image .
Selective Color
This allows you to add or remove percentage of a color present in your image .
If you want your reds redder and your blues less bluer then this is what you use .
Channel Mixer
This allows you to adjust the reds , blues or greens .
So you are adjusting each color channels itself Gradient Map
This adds gradients insides different colors of the image .
Unlike the gradient tool , that put a solid gradient over everything , this puts colors in each color of the image .
Invert
This changes all the colors to what is opposite to them in the color wheel .
Threshold
This changes stuff to black or white .
The slider allows you to choose what tones it will be changing .
Posterize
This reduces the number of colors used in the image .
Examples of using Adjustment Layers .
If only a certain part of your image is too saturated and the rest is alright and you want to desaturate only one area then using adjustment layers is a good idea .
You will not risk messing up your original layer so you can tweak it to your hearts content .
If we want to attract more attention towards the butterfly we may want to do it by desaturating everything else .
1. Open up the image in photoshop .
2. Next , click on the Adjustment Layer button in your layers palette and choose Hue / Saturation .
3. Change the Hue to - 35 .
This will decrease the saturation of the colors on the whole image .
4 . Grab the paint brush tool and change your color to BLACK and then paint over the butterfly .
The butterfly ’s color will return .
Here is a more detailed tutorial demonstrating adjustment layers .
If you want to fix the tone / brightness on only one part of your image and fix the colors on one part of your image then you can use levels and hue / saturation adjustment layers .
1. Open up your image .
I want to make the hills darker but I want to leave the sky the way it is .
2. Apply the Layers Adjustment Layer .
You will see the Layers dialog box show up .
I clicked on the Set Black Point button and clicked on the darkest area .
After a few more adjustments we have : 3 . Next choose the paint brush and change the foreground color to BLACK .
Then paint on the sky because we do n’t want the adjustment layer to affect it .
That gives us : 4 . Now I want to enhance the colors .
There is a hidden rainbow on the left and the hills could use better colors .
So create a new adjustment layer above the levels adjustment layers .
I increased the saturation until I got : 5 .
Since I do n’t want the saturation increase everywhere I changed the foreground color to BLACK and painted everywhere I did not have the saturation increase .
I let part of the mountains stay saturated and the rainbow saturated .
The final result is :
" Because it boasts more theater than it has theaters , Kansas City could use a couple of more Bess Wallersteins .
A producer , director and improviser , Wallerstein has revived the notion of " environmental " theater : shows performed in spaces that fit their settings . "

We think of Bobby Fischer , the paranoid anti-Semite raging at imagined enemies , or Paul Morphy , the 19th - century champion , found dead in his bath surrounded by women 's shoes .
We recall Wilhelm Steinitz , the Austrian who thought he was in electrical communication with God.
Even ' normal ' professionals , like our own Nigel Short and Jonathan Speelman , tend to betray curious eccentricities .
Short speaks English as though it were a foreign language and Speelman looks , in his clothes and grooming , like a mad professor plotting to blow up the world .
It should be said in his defence that Kasparov , though a genius at the game , has never particularly looked the part .
Whereas Anatoly Karpov , the man he beat to take the world title back in 1985 , possessed the cadaverous pallor and puny physique of someone who had spent his life in airless rooms lifting nothing heavier than a wooden chess piece , Kasparov by contrast was all simian movements and saturnine stares .
His opponents spoke of his physical presence as if he were an athlete or a boxer rather than what they were , chess nerds .
He trained for big matches with a fitness regime and careful diet .
Short referred to his ' weightlifter 's energy ' and that was before Kasparov crushed him in their 1993 World Championship match .
And while chess players tend by nature to be self - absorbed , distracted , reclusive , Kasparov was an extrovert with no interest in concealing his high opinion of himself .
As he put it in his 1987 autobiography , Child of Change , he was ' not one to hide my light under a bushel ' .
In the book he described his triumphs with an undisguised pride bordering on glee .
He quoted praise at length and gave short shrift to criticism .
Dubbed by his rivals the ' Beast of Baku ' , he later outlined his relationship with his fellow chess professionals .
' Most of the other players hate me because I beat them regularly , ' he explained .
' Most of them have a devastatingly bad record against me . '
Everything about Kasparov , including his impenetrably thick hair , seemed to speak of the indomitable .
He produced moves that teams of grandmasters would take days to unravel .
And for 20 years , give or take the occasional blip , he could not be beaten .
Then , earlier this year , having won the prestigious Linares tournament in Spain , he announced his retirement .
Not for him the obscurity or notoriety that his predecessors encountered after chess , not for him the struggle against dwindling powers and memory .
Instead , Kasparov informed the world that he was ready for a whole new challenge .
He was going into politics .
It was a decision that underwhelmed many Russian observers .
A column in the Moscow Times outlined some of the doubts about Kasparov 's political abilities .
' The country 's media , political analysts and even some of his fellow liberals see him more as a dilettante who does not understand the rules of the game and who has more than one failed political venture to his name , from the Democratic Party of Russia , to the Liberal - Conservative Union , and now to the risky Committee 2008 : Free Choice .
Critics and even friends of Kasparov have noted an inability to commit to any one project for a sustained period .
In short , everyone seems to be telling Kasparov : " Do n't dabble with the real world , go back to the safe confines of the 64 squares on the chessboard . " '
Kasparov once quoted his countryman , Vladimir Nabokov 's appraisal of the talents required to excel at his chosen game .
' Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterise all worthwhile art : originality , invention , conciseness , harmony , complexity - and splendid insincerity . '
It 's safe to say that in the art of politics you can do without all of those talents except , of course , the last .
And not even his fiercest critics would accuse Kasparov of insincerity , splendid or otherwise .
In an interview two years ago , he seemed to acknowledge that his need to voice unpalatable truths might be a weakness in the political arena .
' With strong views and very little flexibility , you do n't make a good politician , ' he said , before adding a tantalising rider .
' Except in some crucial moments . '
It just so happens that Kasparov believes that now is one such crucial moment .
' In Russia , ' he told me , ' there is no more politics in terms of campaigning , promoting your views , debating your points .
The regime has destroyed democratic institutions .
In such circumstances what you need is to raise your voice , stand firm and fight the regime .
I do n't think flexibility helps you very much .
It 's about fighting . '
Kasparov was probably the most aggressive player in modern chess .
Though nearly all chess players like to talk about ' destroying ' or ' crushing ' their opponent , very often the way they play can appear more like boring their opponent to a standstill .
Not Kasparov .
He relished a fight .
He moved his pieces as if they were weapons .
He once said that he learned about politics through chess , and if that 's the case then Kasparov 's current tactics make a kind of chess sense .
He has decided to target the King .
He wants to take out the president of Russia , Vladimir Putin .
But to succeed he will have to play the game of his life against an opponent loaded with almost every advantage .
When he was a small boy , he once recalled , he saw a chess game ' in which small pawns were victorious over what looked like a more powerful enemy .
This captivated me , and I have loved to attack ever since childhood . '
But for Kasparov to defeat the Putin regime would be more like the equivalent of a solitary white knight vanquishing a near full set of black pieces .
I met Kasparov back in June , in a small hotel discreetly tucked away between Knightsbridge and Chelsea .
He was wearing a light - green checked suit and a cravat that made it appear as if his wardrobe selection was the fruit of judicious reference to the works of PG Wodehouse .
He sat on the edge of his seat as he talked , just as he used to when playing chess .
There 's a physical impatience about the man that suggests he 's already three steps ahead of you and he may not care to wait .
I went out to put some coins in the parking meter just before he was about to be photographed and when I returned a couple of minutes later the photo session had been completed .
Kasparov has always appeared in a rush , which may explain why he used to look so precociously middle aged .
Born Garik Weinstein in Baku - what was then part of the Soviet Union but is now the independent state of Azerbaijan - Kasparov lost his father when he was seven .
' I had to rely on myself , ' he told me , though he also acknowledged the vital role of his mother .
' From an early age she decided to dedicate her life [ to me ] , which made a very strong bond which affected my life - for good or bad , that 's another story . '
There is a wealth of Freudian literature on the meaning of the Queen in chess , and many chess players , including Fischer ( whose mother was called Regina ) have had intense and often difficult relationships with their mothers .
Similarly , in keeping with the Oedipal theme ( the aim of chess is to kill the King ) , they have also , again like Fischer , often had absent fathers .
It has been written that Kasparov 's father , who was Jewish , perished in a car accident .
But along with the widely disseminated idea that Kasparov speaks 15 languages ( he speaks two ) this story lacks only the quality of truth .
' He died from leukaemia , ' Kasparov said .
' We never had any money to buy a car . '
At the age of 10 he was taken under the wing of Mikhail Botvinnik , the Soviet former world chess champion .
At 12 he was identified as a future world champion .
By the age of 22 , when he became world champion , Kasparov displayed the self - possession of a man of double those years .
Photographs from the time show him dressed in a jacket and tie , with the kind of facial hair that requires shaving on the hour , and they make him seem almost eligible for a midlife crisis .
Now , at 42 , his chronological age has at last caught up with his physical self .
He has been married twice and has two children , he has travelled the globe and lived under both communism and capitalism and whatever system it is that now operates in Russia .
But whatever world weariness he 's accumulated is more than offset by his natural energy if not , perhaps , what you would call ebullience .
On the desk to his side there sat two books .
One published by the Federation Internationale des Echecs ( Fide ) and the other titled Speak Like Churchill .
Chess and politics , his twin passions .
His great political hero is Winston Churchill .
' He came up with his ideas , he fought for them and his ideas were right , ' he says .
Kasparov may have some of Churchill 's resolve , but he certainly lacks his oratory skill , at least in English .
He talks politics in a dry analytical style that may , one hopes , have lost something in translation .
It 's only when he conveys a sense of moral outrage that his words achieve a heroic flourish .
Halfway through our conversation , which lasted for a couple of hours , he said : ' Recently I 've been contemplating my future steps and I realised my choice is very simple .
Either I leave my country or stay , and if I stay I have to fight .
To ignore what has been done by KGB rulers would be damaging my sense of honour .
Leaving my country would also be damaging because , why should I leave ?
Why me , why not Putin ? '
His dislike of Putin is genuine .
A dismissive sneer contorts his face each time he mentions his name .
' I think simply that the man does n't fit his position , ' is his opinion of the Russian president .
And when I ask what he thinks is Putin 's estimation of him , his response is withering .
' Frankly speaking , I do n't care .
I 've met too many KGB colonels in my life to pay attention to their opinions even if they turn out by accident to be presidents of my country . '
The fact remains , however , that Putin 's various moves against democracy and free speech have had little effect on his international reputation and even less on his domestic support .
He may have closed down or bought up the overwhelming majority of critical media .
He may have overseen a ruthless , in many ways disastrous , and arguably genocidal campaign in Chechnya .
He may do favourable business with the oligarchs who back his regime and hound those - like the recently imprisoned Mikhail Khodorkovsky - who protest against it .
But none of that overly concerns the mass of Russians for whom a strong authoritarian leader appears to remain a preferable path to the uncertainties of democracy and the free market .
A serious opposition movement has simply not taken shape , partly because of Putin 's grip on the media and partly because the high price of oil has buoyed a fragile economy .
And in any case Putin is bound by law to step down in 2008 .
Nevertheless , Kasparov is focusing on Putin because he believes that if he can expose him as a self - serving autocrat and bring him down , he can also strike a blow against the venal bureaucrats and billionaires who form a crony state .
' More and more Russians are realising that Putin is creating unique conditions for oligarchs to plunder the country and take money outside , providing they pay their dues to the regime .
[ Ramon ] Abramovich , ' he continues , citing the oil magnate and owner of Chelsea football club , 'is for Russians a symbol a corruption . '
So what , as another Russian once asked , is to be done ?
' Travel across the country , meet people , tell them what 's right , what 's wrong .
People like me are not allowed on Russian TV .
The only solution , the partial solution is to go round and talk to people .
In many regions there is still an open window of opportunity because local TV stations are still in private hands .
I had 14 appearances in Siberia in two days . '
Kasparov told me that he was shortly off to the North Caucasus , where the Beslan atrocity took place .
If he did not know before , then he was to see on that trip just what he was up against .
He was prevented by the authorities from attending various meetings .
He had eggs and ketchup thrown at him .
In three cities his plane was refused permission to land .
Hotels were mysteriously booked up or closed and venues were suddenly cancelled .
It was clearly a concerted effort to stop Kasparov from spreading his message .
I asked Maria Lipman , a political specialist at Moscow 's Carnegie Centre , how Kasparov is seen in Russia .
The fact that he was half - Armenian and half - Jewish would not play well with Russian nationalists , she said , ' but it 's really that he 's so radical in being a westerniser and so clearly wants Russia as part of the globalised world that is of limited appeal to most Russians . '
She was impressed by the way that Kasparov had taken to travelling across the country .
' He seems to be really enjoying it .
I do n't think other liberal politicians have the energy or cash .
They got disillusioned early on . '
All the same , she did not think that Kasparov 's standing as a chess hero did much for his image in Russia .
' Chess has lost its popularity from Soviet days , ' she explained .
' It 's not longer promoted at the highest levels .
And also even when he was world champion Kasparov was always seen as too anti-state , too cosmopolitan . '
This view of Kasparov as somehow an outsider goes right back to the days of his greatest triumph .
In 1984 he challenged Anatoly Karpov , the world champion who inherited the title when Bobby Fischer retreated into a religious cult and refused to play him .
Karpov was the darling of the Soviet establishment .
A dedicated communist ( he has since become a hard - core nationalist ) , he was treated like the official Soviet candidate .
Kasparov , too , was a communist , or at least a member of the Communist Party .
' Without making that step , ' he told me , ' I would n't have got the support that was absolutely crucial for me to survive in that environment . '
He later became an advocate of Mikhail Gorbachev , then an opponent , when he became frustrated at the slow pace of reform .
It was not until January 1990 , however , that he handed in his membership of the Communist Party .
Back in 1984 , Kasparov showed no such deliberation .
He tore into Karpov , launching a series of fearless attacks .
As a result he lost three of the first seven games .
Then two of the next 20 games .
He was 0 - 5 down .
Karpov had only to win one more game to retain his title .
But Kasparov made an amazing and gruelling comeback , drawing game after game , and then winning three .
After five months of play , Karpov was a nervous wreck and looked close to exhaustion .
His friend , Florencio Campomanes , the president of Fide , controversially decided to end the match just when Kasparov , for the first time in the event , looked to be the favourite to win .
Typically , Kasparov does not undersell his achievement .
' If you look at the odds of surviving in such a situation against Karpov , I do n't think there 's anything comparable in the history of any sport . '
When I asked him the daunting size of the political task he has now undertaken , he replied : ' After saving that match against Karpov I believe anything can be done . '
Despite his anger with Fide , Kasparov won the rematch and so began his 20 years of dominance .
It 's true that he lost his title in London in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik , but by then the chess World Championship had begun to resemble boxing , with competing governing bodies .
In any case , Kasparov now says the defeat did him a favour ' because I could reinvent myself playing new , highly sophisticated chess and that gave me five years on top ' .
When he retired he was still rated number one in the world .
Kasparov , who writes a column for the Wall Street Journal and is busy with a series of books , will survive without chess ( he restricts himself nowadays to anonymous games on the internet ) , but it 's much less clear how well chess will do without Kasparov .
There are no household names .
He was the one player with global appeal and the professional game is unlikely to emerge from his considerable shadow for some time .
Equally uncertain is how Kasparov will fare in politics .
He was renowned for his bold openings on the chessboard and so far , with his Russian roadshow , he has not disappointed .
But does he have a middle game , much less an endgame ?
His various attempts to form a liberal coalition have failed , his critics claim , because of his unwillingness to compromise and his need to control decisions .
And many observers expect his latest venture , the United Civil Front , which aims to combine all anti-Putin forces from left to right , to go the same way .
There is also the matter of financing .
Kasparov is a wealthy man but not so wealthy that he can maintain a political movement without proper backing .
' We 've got very little money , ' he conceded , ' but the good thing is that there are quite a few rich people who are now ready to finance us anonymously .
Funding us is a death warrant for any Russian businessman . '
So far , he has confined his stated ambitions to a negative - getting rid of the Putin regime .
What he has refused to do is confirm his own interest in becoming president .
I asked him about his long - term aim .
' Well , it might be that I find myself very useful , ' he said with an expression of unironic sincerity .
' It might be that I offer my vision to the country , whether it 's accepted or not .
I think Russia virtually has to be rewritten from scratch . '
As things stand , it seems implausible that Kasparov should ever land the job of doing the rewrite .
But it would be foolish to underestimate the boy from Baku .
After all , he used to come up with ploys and gambits and moves that no one else in the world could see .
And this particular game has only just started .
At first , the innovation sounds simple enough : Representative - elect Kirsten Gillibrand has decided to post details of her work calendar on the Internet at the end of each day so constituents can tell what she is actually doing for their money .
In fact , it is a quiet touch of revolution .
The level of transparency pledged by Ms. Gillibrand , Democrat of New York  down to naming lobbyists and fund - raisers among those she might meet with  is simply unheard of in Congress .
The secrecy that cloaks the dealings of lawmakers and deep - pocket special interests underpinned the corruption issue that Ms. Gillibrand invoked as voters turned Republicans from majority rule last month .
For all the worthy proposals for ethics reform being hashed out by the incoming Congress , a heavy dose of Internet transparency should not be overlooked in the effort to repair lawmakers ’ tattered credibility .
The technology is already there , along with the public ’s appetite for more disclosure about the byways of power in Congress .
The Web is increasingly wielded by both campaign donors and bloggers clicking and tapping as wannabe muckrakers .
Politicians would be wise to catch up .
Local citizens were enlisted to track pork - barrel abuses in the last campaign by a new watchdog organization , the Sunlight Foundation , which enlisted Ms. Gillibrand ’s disclosure pledge .
It aims to have voters use the Internet as an engine of political information .
Craswell was found sleeping with his head on the railway track
Film of incident
Kevin Craswell used the track as a pillow and had his feet inches from the live rail at Epsom , Surrey .
Trains were disrupted and police filmed the former company director , 48 , from a helicopter as he slept in March .
Neither the sound of the helicopter nor passing trains could wake Craswell , of Ashtead , Surrey , who admitted obstructing the railway by neglect .
Redhill magistrates heard a train went past Craswell 's head , but he did not wake up .
' No harm intended '
Craswell was taken to hospital after the incident on 3 March , and it was found he had consumed a potentially lethal amount of alcohol and was suffering from hypothermia .
He had faced up to six months in prison when he appeared in court .
But magistrate Ron Fewtrell said although he was aware of the potential risk to rail users , he did not believe Craswell intended to harm people .
I 've never seen anything like it
PC Keith Board
Craswell , now a recovering alcoholic who lives with his elderly parents , told the court he was ashamed of his conduct and deeply sorry .
Defending , Philip Longes , said Craswell had no memory of what happened .
The court heard staff had to switch off power and thousands of people on four routes were affected by delays .
Pc Keith Board , of British Transport Police , said : " I 've never seen anything like it in all my years of policing .
" It was truly remarkable that he was n't struck by a train or fatally electrocuted .
" The position he collapsed in meant his feet were only a short distance from the live rail . "
Call for barriers
He added : " In total , four railway lines were impacted , costing almost £ 8,000 in delays .
" Trains had to stop running and the power was turned off so that police and emergency crews could safely get to him . "
After the hearing , Craswell 's father , who declined to be named , said there should have been barriers to prevent his son from getting on to the railway line .
Pc Graham Cottington said it was not practical to fence off every stretch of railway , and added emergency services needed to have access to the tracks .
He said staff had been " astounded " at what happened , adding : " If he had touched that live rail , he would certainly have died . "
After months of fevered lobbying and bitter debate , the Chicago City Council passed a groundbreaking ordinance yesterday requiring “ big box ” stores , like Wal - Mart and Home Depot , to pay a minimum wage of $ 10 an hour by 2010 , along with at least $ 3 an hour worth of benefits .
The ordinance , imposing the requirement on stores that occupy more than 90,000 square feet and are part of companies grossing more than $ 1 billion annually , would be the first in the country to single out large retailers for wage rules .
A gallery packed with supporters of the bill broke into cheers as the measure passed , by a vote of 35 to 14 , after four hours of intense speeches and debate .
“ This is a great day for the working men and women of Chicago , ” said Alderman Joseph A. Moore , the measure ’s chief sponsor .
Mr. Moore said he had had inquiries about the ordinance from officials in several other cities .

I ’m never one to mince words , so I ’m getting straight to it : the geek bloggers are in decline and there is very little they can do about it .
But before the flames start let me explain further because I ’ve been tossing up the title of this post for about 24 hours , some of the other titles included : time for the geek bloggers to get a reality check , and 3G the new blogging generation .
All 3 titles sum it up .
Geek blogging is in decline .
If you do n’t believe me , take a look at the Feedster 500 or Technorati 100 today and compare it to the Technorati Top 100 over the last few years .
Take a look back in time to the top 10 in the Techorati Top 100 on November 26 , 2002 and you ’ll see the generation of founding geek bloggers dominating the list : Doc Searls , Dave Winer … fast forward a year and things have started to change .
Take a look at the list today …
The Three Generations
Blogging has essentially developed in waves or generations , each of which was notable for the backgrounds of the majority of people entering the blogosphere at each point .
1G : the geek generation ( 1998 - 2002 )
The 1st generation in the blogosphere was the geek generation .
The founding pioneers that staked their claims in cyberspace and coded and talked about tech , blogging and other geeky related stuff .
Notable amongst their brethren was Dave Winer , Robert Scoble , Doc Searls …. and a lot of the people attending “ Foocamp ” and “ Basecamp ” and other strange gatherings the weekend just gone .
I ’d dont agree with the BlogHer crowd on a lot but I will on this point : the geek bloggers tend to be insular and link to each other .
Take a look at how many times Dave Winer has mentioned and linked to Robert Scoble in the last week for example .
Where we do diverge however is that the BlogHer crowd think that the geek bloggers are the A - List , but they are n’t exclusively any more .
Sure , they ’re the older statesman on the blogosphere , but they no longer dominate the so - called A - List the way they once did .
2G : the extrovert generation ( 2002 - 2004 )
Labels are always hard to apply but I can think of no other tag for the second generation of bloggers , because in 2002 its was a damn site harder to set up a blog than it is now , and only those determined to join the blogosphere because they wanted their voices to be heard did .
2G bloggers are extroverts .
They may have marketing or management backgrounds ( like me ) , strong political backgrounds or beliefs ( 2002 - 2004 really saw the explosion of the political blogosphere in particular ) , journalism or artistic backgrounds … dig deep enough into the vast majority of people who got into blogging during this time and you ’re going to find some level of extroversion : a desire to speak out and be heard and a desire and need to be listened to ( or more correctly read by ) .
The champions of the 2G generation are difficult to pinpoint because unlike 1G there are sooooooo many more people influencing and leading at different levels .
Although some may have been blogging prior to this period , they do n’t represent the first generation because although some may occasionally display geek tendencies ( I ’m pointing at you Calacanis ! ) they write for a large audience .
In politics Kos and Michelle Malkin , Denton and Calacanis , and for that matter any number of Weblogs Inc ’s writers .
3G : the consumer bloggers ( 2005 + )
You know I chuckle when I see articles discussing whether blogging has gone mainstream or not because its as though the people writing such nonsense must be so insular as to not see a thing that ’s going on around them , because blogging has gone mainstream , and 3G bloggers are flooding into the blogosphere at the rate of millions per week .
This generation of bloggers is different to the past two generation of bloggers because the geek companionship of the 1st generation and the extroversion that drove the 2nd generation has been replaced by a sense of normality .
Most new bloggers blog because they can , because others are , and because to many people ( perhaps more so amongst younger people , and in particular amongst teens ) having a blog is now regarded as a normal behaviour , just like having an email address and mobile phone are normal as well .
For me the dawning of the consumer generation was MSN Spaces , because ( perhaps much to the delight , or even credit of Mike Torres ) Spaces works , and despite the initial limitations on launch I ’d noted at the time Microsoft once again displayed an amazing ability to get inside the head of the average person and deliver a product they would use .
The insularity problem
As I ’ve mentioned earlier 1G bloggers are insular , and its their own insularity that has lead to their current decline , and will continue to do so .
I suppose the whole issue of insularity struck me last week when I wrote in support of Microsoft ’s stance on RSS .
There was n’t a lot of user feedback but what was left was generally in support on my argument .
Perhaps of note outside of the Blog Herald fellow 2G blogger and search engine afficianado Nick W ( yes Nick I know you ’re going to hate the tag ) over at Threadwatch agreed .
So a Pom and an Aussie agreeing on something may be a rare occurrence some days , but there ’s truth in this , because Nick sees it from the same way as I see it , and that ’s without the geek glasses that are clouding the views of the 1G bloggers .
And the biggest set of geek glasses is currently resting on the heads of Robert Scoble and Dave Winer .
I suspect that Dave ’s understanding of the real world outside of his little car trips and regular meetups with other geeks means that he has long since lost touch with the reality of ordinary people , but I expected better from Scoble .
But unfortunately his masters apprentice is starting to show all the signs of being engulfed by the same blind , geek coloured view of the world that his former employer has .
He might have recently taken some time off , but since his return its gotten worse .
Geek dinners , camps … if you want to understand real people and real markets you ’ve got to meet a variety of people from different backgrounds and in different realities , where as Scoble is immersing himself seemingly within the same safety zone of geek culture from which he originally emerged and gained his fame years ago when the blogosphere was but young .
I could talk about this all day , but when I eventually get around to organising a Blogging Conference here in Australia next year I still want Scoble as a guest speaker , so I ’ll stop now , but you get my point .
Although not everyone is a huge fan of Steve Rubel ( I ’d note that I am , although I can sympathise with some of the gripes at Threadwatch over the using of marketing speak )
Steve ’s a great representative of the 2nd generation of bloggers having become less insular because as somebody in PR and marketing it ’s literally his job to understand the minds of other people , because he ’s literally paid to sell to them , and selling involves understanding your market .
Calacanis , despite his occasional geek indulgences , gets this to , because the majority of the Weblogs Inc. , network , particularly after the first dozen or so blogs , have been primarily aimed at a more universal audience .
Why is Engadget so popular ?
because it brings tech and gadgets to the masses and it does n’t aim directly at geeks only ( sure , geeks can and do like Engadget , but I ’d argue the format and language delivers a more diverse audience then say even Slashdot ) .
Can the geek bloggers be saved ?
Saving is probably not the right word , because there is always going to be a market place for the Dave Winer ’s of this world , its just that their audience will continue to shrink in relation to market share in comparison to other existing , and yet to be written blogs .
3G bloggers are n’t going to be interested in Winer driving a car and finding free internet access , nor Scoble playing with alpha technologies with other geeks whilst seemingly camped out in someone ’s office .
They are going to be reading Weblogs Inc. , sites and Gawker Media sites , and hopefully Weblog Empire sites as well .
They will be looking at more general , non geek culture blogs , like Shai Coggins amazing array of topics on the About Weblogs Network , topics that could n’t be further from geek culture if they tried .
They are going to read Jay Brewer ’s Blogpire Blogs , and Shiny Media ’s blogs , and they are going to read millions of other blogs as well , blogs that talk in the same language as they do and are n’t obsessed with geek culture , geek terminology and a insular geek viewpoint of the world .
End note :
Some people may think I ’m bagging geek culture , but I ’d like to note that I ’m not .
Geek culture never had a strong basis in popular culture here in Australia as it did in say the United States so perhaps I ’m considering this from a different perspective , but I suspect if I ’d grown up in the States I ’d probably be a geek as well , I read Slashdot , I put together computers and play with Linux Distro ’s for fun , and my wife keeps yelling at me because my home grown PVR wont play VCD ’s from within Media Portal ( and if none of this makes any sense then its point taken ) .
From a marketing perspective though I understand that what I write about , particularly here at the Blog Herald , has got to aim to be as universal as possible .
Sometimes I can tend to be a little insular , but I recognise it and I look to challenge this , the 100 blogs in 100 days is part of this process as well .
It ’s sensible advice .
If you want to sell to as many people as possible you need to be able to empathize with them , and empathy is best learnt through interaction and experience .
Nov. 18 , 2006  -- Heather Schopp is a chiropractor in California dealing every day with her clients ' physical pain .
But her own pain is financial :
At age 29 she is more than $ 170,000 in debt .
" I think about it every day , " Schopp says .
" I mean , I lay in bed , thinking in my head , ' Okay , how much money do I have ?
What will I have to do tomorrow ?
Do I have to buy anything ? ' "
Schopp is part of the exploding number of young people who are rapidly turning into " Generation Debt . "
These twenty - somethings are weighed down by hundreds of thousands of dollars of credit card bills and student loans .
Watch " World News " on Sunday for the first installment of a two - part series , " Young and In Debt . "
And USA Today will begin the first of six weekly installments of the series in Monday 's newspaper .
Two - thirds of college students now take out student loans and graduate with an average of $ 20,000 in debt , according to Project on Student Debt , a group that tracks student loans .
And the National Center for Education Statistics says a college education costs approximately 250 percent more than it did 30 years ago , leaving many recent graduates in the hole before they even pick up their diplomas .
On top of that , 76 percent of undergraduates carry credit cards with an average balance of more than $ 2,000 , according to Nellie Mae , a provider of student loans .
It often is a burden too great for people entering the work force with modest starting salaries that are n't keeping up with the rate of inflation .
Schopp works two jobs , six days a week , just to make ends meet and keep pace with her debt , but it is still not enough .
Experts say such early debt also delays traditional markers of adulthood like buying a house and getting married .
" How am I gonna look five years ahead , " Schopp says .
" It 's hard to look that far ahead because you can barely make it through the day . "
Many young people caught in the spiral of debt say they wish they had some kind of financial education early on to help them avoid getting into trouble later in life .
Tamara Draut , author of " Strapped : Why America 's 20 - and 30 - Somethings Can't Get Ahead , " says those who are heading to college need a reality check right now .
" I think three decades , four decades from now , we 're going to look back and remember this generation as either the generation that saved the American dream or the generation that lived through its demise . "
Heather Schopp 's dream was being a chiropractor -- a dream now tarnished by $ 170,000 of debt .
" It 's kind of sucked the joy out of my profession , " she says , " out of my career . "

January February apples 15.342 oranges 12.298 CSS and HTML Source Code
The box below shows example CSS and HTML source code .
The code will update dynamically as you press the buttons above .
You can select text in the box and then copy and paste the starter code .
Compatibility Notes
If you are using Internet Explorer 6 , you should be able to use this wizard with only minor limitations .
This page does not work with Opera 8 or IE 5 on Mac.
Internet Explorer 6 does not support the border - spacing CSS2 table property .
It also does not support any Netscape - specific CSS properties that are prefixed with - moz , and has limited support for the cursor property .
This means you will not see all the effects in this wizard unless you use a browser like Firefox .
Table Border Style Wizard
Welcome to the totally revamped HTML and CSS border style wizard !
Use this wizard to experiment with table border styles and generate style source code .
This wizard uses dynamic HTML to change the style of the table in - situ , without loading another page .
It is cross - browser compatible with Firefox , Netscape , Internet Explorer , and other modern browsers .
The style sheet code generated by this wizard shows the easy way to apply a style to a table .
In the HTML , you should only set the " class " attribute on the " table " tag .
You should not set the " class " attribute for every single cell , because that bloats the HTML code and wastes bandwidth .
Instead , you can use inheritance that says that every " td " or " th " that is a child of " table.sample " should have a certain style .
In a short amount of code , you have powerful control over the look of the table .
The above example does n't show it , but you can also efficiently alternate the row colors in an HTML table by using inheritance .
In your code , alternate the class tag of each " tr " tag between the two classes defining your row colors , such " r0 " and " r1 " .
Then , define the styles for " table.sample tr.r0 td " and " table.sample tr.r1 td " .
Note that you can not set the background color of a " tr.r0 " directly , because that is only a table structuring element .
You must set the background color of the " td " cell that is a child of the " tr.r0 " and " tr.r1 " rows .
The - moz - border - radius style tag will be rendered in browsers based on the Gecko Runtime Engine .
These include Mozilla , Netscape , and the best one , Firefox .
For those who are using old - fashioned Internet Explorer , you will not see the effect , which is to produce rounded corners .
There are large number of Netscape extensions like this one that allow you to create slick effects , and they are fully backward - compatible with older browsers like IE .
HTML Toggle Buttons
You might also have noticed the interesting toggle buttons that control the table style .
These buttons act like radio buttons , but are implemented in Javascript and CSS .
The standard form radio input buttons are poor for user - interfaces because the circle is just too small to click on .
Label tags can increase the clickable area ( see Javascript Function to Check or Uncheck all Checkboxes ) , but this also is not a good option .
If the labels are uncolored , then most users do not know that the text is clickable .
If the labels are colored , then having two clickable areas increases visual clutter , and the labels are still not obviously clickable .
The toggle buttons above behave like real radio buttons , like the ones on old - fashioned car radios .
If you depress one , the others in that group become raised .
Each button is implemented as a " span " tag .
Two styles are defined for the buttons , " depressed " and " raised " .
The " onclick " handler of each button calls a function called " toggleButton( elementObj , idRegex ) " .
This takes a reference to " span " object and a regular expression to match the group of buttons .
The function loops through all the " span " elements in the document , and for each of those whose ID matches the regular expression , the style class is set to " raised " .
Finally , the style class of the " span " that was clicked is set to " depressed " .
This is a lot of work to do something fairly simple .
Hopefully , one day W3C will define a style property like radio - style - type where we can specify some alternative looks to the radio buttons .
In the meantime , you can view source of this page and copy the Javascript functions .
Note that the " span " tags are generated from a PHP function called printButtons that takes an array of the buttons that I want to print .
This saves a lot of typing .
Get Firefox Now !
If you have n't already , you need to head over to the Mozilla Foundation and download the free Firefox web browser .
This is the best browser on the planet .
It is faster , less buggy , and more secure than Internet Explorer .
You 'll also be able to see the fancy effects ( rounded edges , hover effects ) in this web page that you are missing out on .
If you happen to visit a site that does n't work with Firefox but only with IE , then complain to the site operator that their site is not standards - compliant .
Most companies will listen !
For example , Vanguard recently revamped their site to remove most pop-ups and increase compatibility with non-IE browsers .
Remember , Microsoft does n’t make the IE browser free for your benefit .
They want to lock you in so that you are forced into buying their related products .
Support standards , support the community , and support Firefox by downloading and using it today .
Another great browser you can use for free is Opera .

Where I Lived , and What I Lived ...
Mr Rove ( right ) is President Bush 's chief political strategist
A federal prosecutor is investigating whether any officials broke the law by revealing the name of a covert agent .
A Time magazine reporter said top presidential aide Karl Rove had been the first to hint at the identity .
Correspondents say Mr Bush 's mention of crimes is a shift from his pledge to fire anyone involved in the leak .
CIA agent Valerie Plame is married to former US diplomat Joseph Wilson , who accused the Bush administration of distorting intelligence on Iraq .
PLAME AFFAIR TIMELINE
Feb 2002 : Joseph Wilson looks into reports that Iraq tried to buy uranium in Niger 6 July 2003 : Mr Wilson goes public about investigation 14 July 2003 : Columnist Robert Novak writes the trip was inspired by Ms Plame - Matthew Cooper reports that he had similar information 30 September : Justice department launches probe 24 June 2004 : President Bush testifies in case 15 July : Cooper and Judith Miller ordered to testify about sources 10 August : Miller and Cooper sentenced for contempt of court 28 June 2005 : Supreme Court refuses to hear appeal 6 July : Miller jailed after appeals fail , Cooper agrees to testify
Profile : Karl Rove
Mr Rove has denied being behind the leaking of her identity to the media .
At the weekend , Time journalist Matthew Cooper wrote that Mr Rove did not disclose Ms Plame 's name , but did say that the wife of a government critic worked for the CIA .
Mr Cooper also wrote in Time that he discussed Mr Wilson and his wife with Lewis Libby , a senior aide to Vice - President Dick Cheney .
Mr Bush told reporters he did not know all the facts and urged them to wait until the inquiry was complete before " you jump to conclusions " .
" I would like this to end as quickly as possible so we know the facts , and if someone committed a crime they will no longer work in my administration , " he said at a news conference .
The BBC's Oliver Conway in Washington says Mr Bush 's statement appears to leave him some room for manoeuvre .
The evidence made public so far does not conclusively show a crime has been committed , he says .
The Democratic Party accused Mr Bush of lowering the " ethics bar " .
Smear allegations
Newspaper columnist Robert Novak first publicly revealed that Ms Plame was a covert CIA agent in July 2003 , citing two administration officials .
That was shortly after her husband wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times in which he accused Mr Bush 's administration of twisting intelligence on Iraq .
Mr Wilson says he travelled to Niger to investigate a claim that Iraq had tried to buy nuclear material there , but found no evidence to prove it .
President Bush later used the Niger claim as part of the justification for the 2003 invasion .
Novak wrote that an official had told him the trip was inspired by Ms Plame .
Mr Wilson alleges that his wife 's name was deliberately leaked in a bid to undermine him .
“ It ’s not that we ‘ could be ’ the weaker sex — we are the weaker sex , ” said Dr. Robert Tan , a geriatrics specialist in Houston who is on the advisory board of the Men ’s Health Network .
“ Even when men and women have the same disease , we often find that men are more likely to die .
Hip fractures stand out , for instance : women seem more likely to recover , while men are more likely to die afterward . ”
Behavior plays a role in some of the extra deaths and illnesses among men : they tend to be more aggressive than women and to take more risks .
Men smoke at higher rates than women , drink more alcohol and are less likely to wear seat belts or use sunscreen .
Men also suffer more accidental deaths and serious injuries and are more likely to die of injuries and car accidents .
They are three times as likely to be victims of murder , four times as likely to commit suicide and , as teenagers , 11 times as likely to drown .
Some experts think that depression contributes to these reckless and self - destructive behaviors , but that just as heart disease was initially defined by men ’s experiences and therefore ignored or missed in women , depression may have been framed by women ’s experiences and therefore may be missed and go untreated in men .
In any case , as a result , even though more baby boys are born , among people in their mid-30s , women outnumber men .
Among people age 100 , women outnumber men by 8 to one .
Among the questions research might explore , Dr. Legato said , are : “ Why are there more miscarriages of boy fetuses ?
What is it about the sexing of the fetus that makes a male more vulnerable ?
What makes a boy less mature in terms of lung function after he ’s born ?
And what is this propensity for risk - taking ? ”
One theory is that males are vulnerable because of their chromosomal makeup : where women have two X chromosomes , men have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome .
“ It is said that even before implantation in the wall of the uterus , the newly fertilized XX entity has a leg up , ” Dr. Legato said , “ because it can use that extra X to combat mutations in the chromosome that might be lethal or detrimental .
And that might be a reason why females have a more sturdy constitution . ”
Scientists and advocates who are concerned about men’s health are encouraging men themselves to take the first steps by accepting responsibility for their health status , seeking preventive care and making changes in habits , if necessary .
New drugs for erectile dysfunction have helped bring men into doctors ’ offices in recent years , experts say , but that is not enough .
Of the five species of North Americanbumble bees , two are facing steep population declines and one may be extinct .
These bigger , gentler cousins of the imported honey - bee play a crucial role in pollinating flowering plants and their disappearance could prove disastrous to ecosystems .
It could also provoke an economic disaster :
New research shows that bumble bees and other insects provide $ 57 billion in pollination services as well as other free labor in the U.S. alone .
" Most insects tirelessly perform functions that improve our environment and lives in ways that scientists are only beginning to understand , " explains entomologist John Losey of Cornell University .
" Do n't let the insects ' small stature fool you , these minute marvels provide valuable services . "
Losey and his colleague Mace Vaughan of the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation undertook the task of estimating the monetary value of insect activity in the U.S. Confining themselves to four activities that could be rigorously calculated -- processing cattle dung , controlling pests , pollinating plants and serving as food for wildlife -- the scientists derived conservative figures for the value of these services .
For example , without insects as a food source , North American fisheries would collapse because most freshwater species subsist on flies and other insects .
This means that the nearly $ 28 - billion fishing industry relies on insects at its base .
Dung beetles , too , contribute to the economy : without them , bovine dung festers on rangeland , increasing the number of pests and reducing the available forage for the cattle .
By deriving such economic estimates , the researchers hope to raise interest in insect conservation .
They argue that preserving such ecosystem services should be an essential component of general land management .
" Our biological infrastructure is vulnerable to degradation , " Losey notes .
" If we do not take care of it , it will break down and could seriously impact the economy . "
Indeed , Vaughan observes that in the case of crop pollination , " the cracks in the infrastructure are already showing . "
A paper detailing these estimates appears in the April issue of BioScience .
In a post last week I talked about the Anti Team .
It was sarcastic , snarky , negative , and generally kinda fun to write .
I did n't want to leave it like that though , so I want to talk about my ideal software development team .
If you read both posts you 'll probably notice that the bad extreme is largely drawn from traditional waterfall shops and my ideal is borderline XP propaganda .
There 's a simple cause for that : I 've simply had far more positive experiences working in Agile teams and that 's the atmosphere and culture that I think gives me the best chance for success .
Anyway , here 's my attempt at being positive and describing the qualities and structure of my ideal team .
See the Whole
The first ideal is that the team is all working toward a common goal — making the customer happy by shipping working software .
One of the powerful ideas from Lean Development is the " Fallacy of Local Optimization . "
Instead of making decisions to optimize the individual workflows of requirements , coding , and testing in isolation , look at the larger goal of shipping software and work towards that goal instead .
Let 's do a deeper dive into the various workflows and see how a local optimization of each could hurt a project overall :
If the business analysts define their job solely as creating requirements specification documents , they will certainly act to get the requirements sewn up and signed off as quickly as possible .
I would prefer that the analyst role be defined as determining and communicating the requirements to the rest of the team .
That 's a subtle shift in goal , but it might cause the analysts to drastically change the manner and mechanisms for interacting with developers , testers , and customers .
Coding is the bottleneck in throughput right ?
Not exactly .
Code can not be shipped until it is tested and deployable .
As anybody who reads my blog regularly knows , I 'm a big believer is comprehensive test automation .
That kind of test automation can only happen through very close collaboration with the testers .
I think that testability is a first class design consideration because it directly impacts the throughput of the entire team .
By the same token , testers cannot work if they can't get the latest version of the code onto their desktops .
Ease and reliability of installation is a major contributor to project success , but it only happens with the developers making it so .
Making testable code and easily deployable code might burn more developer hours , but it will get the code out faster .
Testing is n't about finding defects , it 's about removing the defects from the code .
A tester that works hand in hand with developers to explain reproduction steps and expected results does more good than a tester who simply files defect reports in whatever awful bug tracking tool you use .
I 've worked for over ten years ( how did that happen ? ) on team oriented projects .
One of the first , and most important , lessons I had drilled into me was that it was important to understand the other disciplines on the project .
We spend a lot of time interacting with people that do different jobs than us , and our software does n't make it out the door without contributions from these folks .
The more you understand about their jobs , the better you can interact with them and support their activities .
As a developer , I can contribute more to the project if I understand and accommodate the needs of my project manager , analysts , and testers .
Know the Why
I 'm going to adamantly stand by this statement : creating a good design and architecture is easier than socializing that same design throughout the team .
As I 've said before , the more specific your instructions are to another developer , the worse the results are going to be .
You 'll get far better results if the team as a whole understands the reasoning behind design decisions .
Case in point , I 'm doing a WinForms project and that almost automatically means splitting the screens into Passive View's and Supervising Controllers ( that 's a mouthful , thanks Martin ) .
Simply telling the other developers that were new to these patterns to avoid putting logic into the UserControl 's did n't take because it seemed arbitrary and senseless .
Take the team aside and explain the rationale for the design decision ( better testability , splitting behavior from display ) , and they will be far more able to follow the design because they can make qualitative judgements themselves as they work .
As a technical lead you know you 're doing well when everybody , right down to the junior most person , is contributing to your design with suggestions to improve the design .
Requirements handoff can be a major source of risk and churn .
Even assuming that the requirements are perfect upfront ( puh- leeze ) , the developers ' and testers ' understanding of those requirements may not be .
No matter how hard the analysts or customers try , the upfront requirements will not cover all possibilities and angles .
At some point the developers are going to have to exercise their own judgement about what the clients want .
Even better yet , developers should be thinking of ways to improve the user experience and contribute back .
That understanding and ability to act happens best as a result of understanding the rationale for requirements decisions .
Maybe all " Know the Why " is about is just keeping your eyeballs on the end goal instead of being buried by day to day minutiae .
Maximize Communication Bandwidth
I believe that the best way to See the Whole and Know the Why is to maximize the flow of communication within the team .
Check out this graphic from Alistair Cockburn 's seminal paper Characterizing people as non-linear , first - order components in software development :
The most effective form of communication is two ( or more ) people talking at the whiteboard .
The least effective form is documentation .
Why ?
Let 's think about what 's different in the two extremes .
When I 'm discussing a design problem with a colleague at the whiteboard we 're able to interact , ask each other questions , convey information through body language , and illustrate our ideas on the whiteboard at will .
Exchanging documentation is static and one way .
A great deal of contextual information is potentially lost as the document goes from the author to the people downstream .
There 's no room for interaction at all .
Given a choice , I want the entire team collocated in a single space .
Offices , cubicles , and generally isolation choke off communication and collaboration .
Collocation offers vastly more opportunities for the more effective forms of communication .
I 've never particularly found the extra noise of an open office space to be a problem , but maybe I 'm just used to it .
The key point is that I want to talk to all the members of my team .
Small and Self Contained
I want my team to be as close to self - sufficient as possible .
Call me paranoid , but I dread any dependency on any person that does not have a direct stake in my project 's success .
It takes a significant amount of overhead to coordinate a project when you have to depend on people outside your project that are getting tugged and pulled in many different directions .
You potentially lose a lot of the advantages of adaptive planning and iterative development if you have to coordinate with outside teams whose schedules are not flexible .
I 've always thought projects went smoother when I could make adjustments to our database or other infrastructure instead of having to wait for an external group to do it for us — usually after some sort of artificial paper process .
Last summer I got to see Bruce Tate give a very good talk about building good teams .
One of his key points that resonated with me was controlling the size of your team to an ideal of 4 - 6 developers .
A lot of the overhead of doing a software project is creating and nurturing a common understanding and a shared vision throughout the team .
You simply have less communication latency on a smaller team .
Now , to get there with a smaller team of developers , those developers must be able to perform what might have been multiple roles in a traditional project structure .
Personally , I think that makes for a much stronger team .
It definitely makes scheduling much more flexible as one iteration may be 80 % database work and the next iteration is all user interface enhancement .
Give me utility infielders over left handed middle relievers any day .
And another thing , it 's vastly better to have a small team of people who are dedicated ( 100 % allocated ) to the project than a dozen people who are working on 3 - 4 different projects simultaneously .
I can't imagine any thoughtful person arguing with me about that statement , but splitting people across projects seems to be fairly common ( in a past life , I was once the responsible architect for 7 projects , at least on paper ) .
Whatever organizational flexibility you think you might be buying by splitting people across projects is more than lost by inefficient context switching .
Put another way , when I have requirements questions , I want to go ask a business analyst that 's 5 - 10 yards away and completely immersed in the project .
Contrast that to the waterfall experience of tracking down the BA on the other side of the building that wrote up your requirements 3 months ago and has no recollection of why the requirement reads that way .
The Project Manager as Fullback
For you unenlightened folks who do n't follow American football , a fullback tries to blast through the holes ahead of the ballcarrier and pick off any would be tacklers so the halfback ( us developers of course ) can scoot through on his way to glory .
In an iterative process , you want the developers and testers to be like a machine that runs continuously at a steady hum .
At the start of every iteration a set of detailed requirements is ready to feed into the machine .
I want a project manager who deals with external forces and processes as they come up to avoid stopping the machine .
The best way to keep the machine running is to have Joel Spolsky 's Developer Abstraction Layer , and a major part of that is a Project Manager acting as an offensive line looking ahead of the development to proactively deal with any issue that could slow down the developer / tester machine .
I worked with a project manager years ago that did n't know squat about our process or Microsoft Project .
Quite frankly , the customer and I drove the project as a skunkworks project and she was more than a bit flustered by that .
She might have thrown up her hands trying to rein in a headstrong young technical lead charging ahead , but the one thing she did was get out in front and take care of all the external process stuff so everybody else could concentrate on making the system be good .
To this day , that project is by far and away the most satisfying and successful project I 've ever been a part of .
It 's only recently that I 've come to realize the contributions the project manager made — even though most other project manager 's at that company would have scoffed at the role she played .
Trust , Transparency , and Reflection
I owe my teammates a degree of honesty about the progress I 'm making and the roadblocks I 'm facing .
I need the same from the other developers .
If a project manager is going to be my lead blocker , I need to be very open and tell him or her the problems that we 're having or expecting .
If things are n't going well , or taking longer than expected , the PM needs to know sooner rather than later to start making contingency plans .
In turn , I need to be able to trust my PM to admit problems .
Needless to say , a blame culture is self - defeating .
The only way to get better as a team or organization is to openly face your problems and find better solutions .
If you 're afraid of reprisals from above , those problems are going to be swept under the carpet and fester .
Of course , eliminating a blame culture is n't enough .
As a team you must be willing and able to be reflective .
Pay attention to what works and do more of it .
Talk through what is n't working , and find and apply better ways .
If there 's one single thing I 've contributed to my current client 's practice , I hope it 's conducting retrospectives on a regular basis .
Own the Process
In the Anti Team , I blasted centralized process and methodology groups .
The best way for a development team to optimize is to be empowered to own their own practices .
The process should work for the team , not the other way around .
Since each project is different , I think every team should have some leeway to organize their own practices and do so responsibly .
I despise the interpretations of CMMI that require bureaucratic rigamarole before you can make any deviations from the proscribed process .
I worked on a nearly fullblown Extreme Programming project with an elite group of consultants that I think would have failed completely — except for a small change in the way we did iteration planning .
That was the first time I realized that process was a tool that could be consciously wielded instead of some sort of arbitrary set of nonsensical rules .
Work Together
Here is a quote from a post by Rocky Lhotka that I think is potentially short sighted ( emphasis mine ) :
Agile is just Waterfall in random order , and with a few different techniques and tools .
In the end it all comes down to gathering requirements , analyzing them , translating that into a design , doing some coding and some testing and away you go .
You can rearrange the pieces on the board , but they are the same pieces .
Forget for now any comparison between the polar extremes of Agile versus Waterfall development , it most certainly does matter when and what order these activities occur .
Think about the game you play in elementary school where you line up and you try to relay a message down the line by whispering in the next person 's ear .
Inevitably the original message is distorted by the time it gets to the last person in the line .
That 's a perfect analogy for sequential development .
What I would advocate is simply hearing the message at exactly the same time .
I think there 's an efficiency gain by simply blurring the traditional waterfall phases .
Do all of the workflows for the active features / stories at nearly the same time to maximize the collaboration between all of the disciplines on the project .
A huge , but common , source of project churn is the testers coming to a different interpretation of a requirement than the developers .
Divergent interpretation always leads to trouble .
By simply having testers and developers start a feature at roughly the same time , and shortly after the analysts for that matter , you can come away with a shared understanding upfront .
Even better yet , if you can get the testers just a bit ahead of coding , the developers can code to unambiguous acceptance tests and know when their code meets the requirements .
Human beings do n't have perfect recall .
It 's easier for me to fix bugs in code I wrote this week as opposed to code I wrote 2 months ago , and it 's definitely going to be easier for an analyst to talk over the details of a user story that is fresh in their memory .
Eric Evans introduced us to the idea of a Ubiquitous Language for all team members .
Roughly defined , the team can communicate quicker with greater ease and less misunderstanding if the entire team is using a common vocabulary to describe the concepts in the system domain .
The lack of a shared ubiquitous language hampers a team when the analysts and developers struggle to understand one another because they 're using different terms for the same concepts ( or the same terms for different concepts ) .
Unsurprisingly , I think the best way to found a ubiquitous language is close collaboration between analysts and the rest of team starting very early on and continuing to the end of the project .
Back to " Know the Why . "
The best way to understand the requirements or proposed design is to participate in their formulation .
It 's extremely valuable to have the developers and testers involved during requirements and analysis .
The developers can be much more effective if they were there for the early design discussions .
Specifications are just too " loss-ey " to act as a medium for communication .
Constant Conversation
Thinking and learning on a project never stops , even if it 's only directed at getting better for the next project or release .
Good teams challenge their approach every single day and keep up a constant dialogue .
That constant dialogue drives improvement and the shared understanding of the project .
And they lived happily ever after …
It 's late , and I 've got to get in early to kick off a 90 minute build before the rest of the team comes in .
Good night all you princes of software development , you kings of code slinging .
I 'd completely ( and blessedly ) forgotten about this one .
Here 's another great example of an Anti Team .
Darauf folgt die erste Ebene der aktiven Prävention .
Hier sollen die Mitarbeiter angewiesen sein gegenseitig die Leistung und Handlung des anderen im Blick zu behalten .
Zwar geht es hier natürlich nicht um die Einführung einer echten , einschränkenden Überwachungskultur .
Aber zumindest geht es um eine Form des regeltreuen Umgangs miteinander und mit der Firma .
Regeltreue ist schließlich nur ein Zeichen gegenseitigen Respekts .
Das heißt , dass die Prozesse ordnungsgemäß durchzuführen sind , das Risiko im gesunden Rahmen gehalten werden soll und stichprobenartige Prüfungen von Arbeitsroutinen und Mitarbeitern durchzuführen sind .
Blocks and Helpers , a Lovely Combination
Monday , January 22 , 2007
Blocks rock and I could n't agree more .
The functional programming aspect of ruby has started to interest me more and more .
Blocks are used all over the place , with respond_to , collect , returning and ActionView : : Helpers :: FormHelper#form_for .
Sometimes , a design requires a little extra markup , perhaps something to get that rounded corner to work or what - have you .
Now let 's say this piece of code requires certain classes , a certain kind of structure , including a tile , and has to be used in many places , something like a sidebar piece .
Instead of copying and pasting this structure over and over , you can use a helper to make you life easier , and if you combine it with a block , it will just feel even more painless .
The Setup
< div class = " sidebar " > < div class = " bottom " > < h3 > Title </ h3 > < div class = " body " > < p > Some Content </ p > </ div > </ div > </ div >
There are two elements which must change ; the title and the contents of the body .
The title should simply be just some text that goes in between the h3 tag .
The contents of the body could be anything , in this case , it is the paragraph tag and everything inside .
Creating a Helper without a Block
Since we have these two varying things , we could create a helper method to encapsulate our structure .
The first parameter of the helper will be the title while the second parameter will be the contents of the body .
def sidebar ( title , body ) content_tag ( ' div ' , content_tag ( ' div ' , content_tag ( ' h3 ' , title ) + content_tag ( ' div ' , body , : class => ' body ' ) , : class => ' bottom ' ) , : class => ' sidebar ' )
end
That looks pretty easy .
Now let 's look at the interface for this helper
< %= sidebar (' Hello World ' , '< p >
It is one of these " Hello World " things again . </p>') %>
Not too shabby , but what if we wanted to do an unordered list ?
< %= sidebar ( ' Hello World ' , ' < ul > ' + '< li> Item </li >' + '< li> Item </li >' + '< li> Item </li >' + '</ul >' ) %>
This feels pretty clunky and ERB is completely ignored .
Instead of this procedural way of thinking , why not see what a block can do for us ?
Creating a Helper with a Block
For this to work , we will still need the first parameter to be the title , but the body will be passed in as a block to be processed from within our helper .
The block we create will be ERB code , this will feel more natural to the person who has to implement the code .
The magic to get this done comes from the concat method of ActionView : : Helpers : : TextHelper module .
def sidebar ( title , & block ) raise ArgumentError , " Missing block " unless block_given ?
start = <<- END < div class=" sidebar " > < div class= " bottom " > < h3 > #{title} </h3 > < div class= " body " > END concat ( start , block .binding ) block.call end = <<-END </div > </div> </div> END concat ( end , block.binding )
end
This may look slightly odd , but I assure you , the interface makes up for it .
< % sidebar (' Hello World ') do %> < p >
And now back to the way I was doing things before </ p > < ul > < li >
Item </ li > < li >
Item </ li > < li >
Item </ li > </ ul > < % end %>
The Benefits
Debate rages on use of cervical cancer vaccine /
While almost 100 % effective , some contend use condones teen sex
2005-10-31 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
A new vaccine that protects against cervical cancer has set up a clash between health advocates who want to use the shots aggressively to prevent thousands of malignancies and social conservatives who say immunizing teen - agers could encourage sexual activity .
Although the vaccine will not become available until next year at the earliest , activists on both sides have begun maneuvering to influence how widely the immunizations will be employed .
Groups working to reduce the toll of the cancer are eagerly awaiting the vaccine and want it to become part of the standard roster of shots that children , especially girls , receive just before puberty .
Because the vaccine protects against a sexually transmitted virus , many conservatives oppose making it mandatory , citing fears that it could send a subtle message condoning sexual activity before marriage .
Several leading groups that promote abstinence are meeting this week to formulate official policies on the vaccine .
Officials from the companies developing the shots -- Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline -- have been meeting with advocacy groups to try to assuage their concerns .
The jockeying reflects the growing influence social conservatives , who had long felt overlooked by Washington , have gained on a broad spectrum of policy issues under the Bush administration .
In this case , a former member of the conservative group Focus on the Family serves on the federal panel that is playing a pivotal role in deciding how the vaccine is used .
" What the Bush administration has done has taken this coterie of people and put them into very influential positions in Washington , " said James Morone Jr. , a professor of political science at Brown University .
" And it 's having an effect in debates like this . "
The vaccine protects women against strains of a ubiquitous germ called the human papilloma virus .
Although many strains of the virus are innocuous , some can cause cancerous lesions on the cervix ( the outer end of the uterus ) , making them the primary cause of this cancer in the United States .
Cervical cancer strikes more than 10,000 U.S. women each year , killing more than 3,700 .
The vaccine appears to be virtually 100 percent effective against two of the most common cancer - causing HPV strains .
Merck , whose vaccine is further along , plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year for approval to sell the shots .
Exactly how the vaccine is used will be largely determined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , a panel of experts assembled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta .
The panel issues widely followed guidelines , including recommendations for childhood vaccines that become the basis for vaccination requirements set by public schools .
Officials of both companies noted that research indicates the best age to vaccinate would be just before puberty to make sure children are protected before they become sexually active .
The vaccine would probably be targeted primarily at girls but could also be used on boys to limit the spread of the virus .
" I would like to see it that if you do n't have your HPV vaccine , you can't start high school , " said Juan Carlos Felix of the University of Southern California , who leads the National Cervical Cancer Coalition 's medical advisory panel .
At the ACIP meeting last week , panel members heard presentations about the pros and cons of vaccinating girls at various ages .
A survey of 294 pediatricians presented at the meeting found that more than half were worried that parents of female patients might refuse the vaccine , and 11 percent of the doctors said they thought vaccinating against a sexually transmitted disease " may encourage risky sexual behavior in my adolescent patients . "
Conservative groups say they welcome the vaccine as an important public health tool but oppose making it mandatory .
" Some people have raised the issue of whether this vaccine may be sending an overall message to teen - agers that , ' We expect you to be sexually active , ' " said Reginald Finger , a doctor trained in public health who served as a medical analyst for Focus on the Family before being appointed to the ACIP in 2003 .
" There are people who sense that it could cause people to feel like sexual behaviors are safer if they are vaccinated and may lead to more sexual behavior because they feel safe , " said Finger , emphasizing he does not endorse that position and is withholding judgment until the issue comes before the vaccine policy panel for a formal recommendation .
Conservative medical groups have been fielding calls from concerned parents and organizations , officials said .
" I 've talked to some who have said , ' This is going to sabotage our abstinence message , ' " said Gene Rudd , associate executive director of the Christian Medical and Dental Associations .
But Rudd said most people change their minds once they learn more , adding he would probably want his children immunized .
Rudd , however , draws the line at making the vaccine mandatory .
" Parents should have the choice .
There are those who would say , ' We can provide a better , healthier alternative than the vaccine , and that is to teach abstinence , ' " Rudd said .
The council plans to meet Wednesday to discuss the issue .
On the same day , the Medical Institute for Sexual Health in Austin , Texas , which advises conservative groups on sexuality and health issues , is convening a one - day meeting to develop a position statement .
Alan Kaye , executive director of the National Cervical Cancer Coalition , likened the vaccine to wearing a seat belt .
" Just because you wear a seat belt does n't mean you 're seeking out an accident , " Kaye said .
Many art historians and anthropologists believe Paleolithic cave wall art was done by accomplished shaman - artists , but mixed in with the finer paintings are graffiti - like scenes of sex and hunting .
An analysis of thousands of paintings from the late Pleistocene epoch suggests the graffiti artists back then were likely the same as today — teenage males .
Most cave art from 10,000 to 35,000 years ago was done by hand , quite literally .
Artists would chew up a bit of red ocher , place their hand against a wall , and spit over their hand .
" It was like kids taking a pencil and drawing an outline around their hand , " said Dale Guthrie , a paleobiologist from the University of Alaska Fairbanks .
Men and women have different hand proportions — men have thicker thumbs and palms — so by analyzing the dimensions of the hands in European cave art , and comparing them to 1,000 photocopies of modern hands of men and women of different ages , Guthrie determined just who painted what .
Men and women and boys and girls of all ages left their marks but , statistically , teenage males dominated , contrary to popular belief .
Most of the paintings are of large game , such as bison , horse , ibex , and red deer .
Cave bears and lions , which would have inspired fear , were also depicted .
Many of the hunting scenes , although sloppily done compared to the fine , finished work of an adult artist back then , are full of graphic detail .
" Lots of the wild animals in the caves have spears in them and blood coming out of their mouths and everything that a hunter would be familiar with , " Guthrie told LiveScience .
" These were the Ferraris and football games of their time .
They painted what was on their minds . "
And as with modern teenagers , the ancients had more on their minds than just cars and sports .
" In the graffiti , there is a lot of below - the - belt - art , " Guthrie said .
" The people in the art are predominantly women , and not a single one has any clothes on . "
But these were n't just any women , they were Pleistocene Pamela Andersons adorned with ludicrously huge breasts and hips .
The walls were also decorated with graphic depictions of genitalia .
" These were not the type of paintings that make it into the coffee table art books , " Guthrie said .
While female artists accounted for less than 20 percent of the cave art , they were being creative in other ways , researchers say .
" What we find in the fossil record does n't always represent what was going on , " Guthrie said .
" Prior to the pottery age , women in all societies are working in things that do n't preserve very well , such as skins and braiding fiber . "
Guthrie presents his findings and more than 3,000 images in his new book , " The Nature of Paleolithic Art " ( University of Chicago Press , 2006 ) .

May 2002 : Polyglot Programming
What does it take to support several programming languages within one environment ?
. NET , which has taken language interoperability to new heights , shows that it 's possible  but only with the right design , the right infrastructure , and appropriate effort from both compiler writers and programmers .
In this article , I 'd like to go deeper than what I 've seen published on the topic , to elucidate what it takes to provide true language openness .
The experience that my colleagues have accumulated over the last three years of working to port Eiffel on .NET , as well as the countless discussions we 've had with other .NET language implementers , informs this discussion .
Who Needs More Than One Language ?
Let 's start with the impolite question :
Should one really care about multilanguage support ?
When this feature was announced at .
NET 's July 2000 debut , Microsoft 's competitors sneered that it was n't anything anyone needed .
I 've heard multilanguage development dismissed , or at least questioned , on the argument that most projects simply choose one language and stay with it .
But that argument does n't really address the issue .
For one thing , it sounds too much like asserting , from personal observation , that people in Singapore do n't like skiing .
Lack of opportunity does n't imply lack of desire or need .
Before .NET , the effort required to interface modules from multiple languages was enough to make many people stick to just one ; but , with an easy way to combine languages seamlessly and effortlessly , they may as early experience with .NET suggests start to appreciate their newfound freedom to mix and match languages .
Even more significant is the matter of libraries .
Whether your project uses one language or more , it can take advantage of reusable libraries , whose components may have originated in different source languages .
Here , interoperability means that you can use whatever components best suit your needs , regardless of creed or language of origin .
This ability to mix languages offers great promise for the future of programming languages , as the practical advance of new language designs has been hindered by the library issue :
Though you may have conceived the best language in the world , implemented an optimal compiler and provided brilliant tools , you still might not get the users you deserve because you can't match the wealth of reusable components that other languages are able to provide , merely because they 've been around longer .
Building bridges to these languages helps , but it 's an endless effort if you have to do it separately for each one .
In recent years , this library compatibility issue may have been the major impediment to the spread of new language ideas , regardless of their intrinsic value .
Language interoperability can overturn this obstacle .
Under .NET , as long as your language implementation satisfies the basic interoperability rules of the environment ( as explained in the following examples ) , you can take advantage of components written in any other language whose implementers have adhered to the same rules .
That still means some work for compiler writers , but it 's work they must do once for their language not once for each language with which they want to interface .
The language openness of .NET is a welcome relief after the years of incessant Java attempts at language hegemony .
For far too long , the Sun camp has preached the One Language doctrine .
The field of programming language design has a long , rich history , and there is no credible argument that the alpha and omega of programming , closing off any future evolution , was uttered in Silicon Valley in 1995 .
Microsoft 's .NET breaks this lock .
Everyone will benefit , even the Java community : Now that there 's competition again , new constructs are surprise !
again being considered for Java ; one hears noises , for example , about Sun finally introducing genericity sometime in the current millennium .
Such are the virtues of openness and competition .
The more than 20 languages ported or in the process of being ported to .NET range from Cobol and Fortran to Smalltalk , Oberon , Eiffel , Java , Perl , Scheme and Python .
How does this all work ?
Do languages have to sacrifice anything ?
Should we believe those who say that it's all smoke and mirrors , and that deep down , all languages get reduced to a common denominator , whether we call it C# , Visual Basic .NET , managed C++ ( or Java ) ?
These are some of the questions I 'll examine in this three - part article .
Language Operability at Work
Multilanguage communication techniques are nothing new .
For some time , Eiffel has included an " external " mechanism for calling out to C and other languages , and a call - in mechanism known as Cecil ( which is similar to the Java Native Methods Interface ) .
But all this only addresses calls .
NET goes much further :
A routine written in a language L1 may call another routine written in a different language L2 .
A module in L1 may declare a variable whose type is a class declared in L2 , and then call the corresponding L2 routines on that variable .
If both languages are object oriented , a class in L1 can inherit from a class in L2 .
Exceptions triggered by a routine written in L1 and not handled on the L1 side will be passed to the caller , which if written in L2  will process it using L2's own exception - handling mechanism .
During a debugging session , you may move freely and seamlessly across modules written in L1 and L2 .
I do n't know about you , but I 've never seen anything coming even close to this level of interoperability .
Affirmative Action
Let 's examine how .
NET 's language interoperation works .
Here 's the beginning of an ASP.
NET page ( from an example at dotnet.eiffel.com ) .
The associated system is written mainly in Eiffel , but you would n't guess this from the page text ; as stated by the ASP .
NET PAGE LANGUAGE directive , the program code on the page itself , introduced by < SCRIPT RUNAT = " SERVER " > , is in C# :
< %@ Assembly Name= " conference " %> <%@ Import Namespace= " Conference_registration " %> <%@ Page Language= " C# " %> < HTML > < HEAD > < TITLE >TOOLS CONFERENCE </ TITLE > < SCRIPT RUNAT=" SERVER " > /* Start of C# code */ Registrar conference_registrar ; bool registered ; String error_message ; void Page_Init ( Object Source , EventArgs E ) { conference_registrar = new Registrar( ) ; registrar.start ( ) ; ... More C# code ... } ... More HTML ...
The first C# line is the declaration of a C# variable called conference_registrar , of type REGISTRAR .
On the subsequent lines , we create an instance of that class through a new expression , and assign it to conference_registrar ; and we call the procedure start on the resulting object .
Presumably , REGISTRAR is just some C# class in this system .
Presume not .
Class REGISTRAR is an Eiffel class .
The only C# code in this example application is on the ASP.
NET page , and consists of only a few more lines than shown above ; its task is merely to read the text entered into the various fields of the page by a Web site visitor and to pass it on , through the conference_registrar object , to the rest of the system the part written in Eiffel that does the actual processing .
Nothing in the above example ( or the rest of the ASP. NET page ) mentions Eiffel .
REGISTRAR is not declared as an Eiffel class , or a class in any specific language :
It 's simply used as a class .
The expression new REGISTRAR ( ) that creates an instance of the class might look to the unsuspecting C# programmer like a C# creation , but in fact it calls the default creation procedure ( constructor ) of the Eiffel class .
Not that this makes any difference at the level of the Common Language Runtime :
At execution time , we do n't have C# objects , Eiffel objects or Visual Basic objects ; we have .NET citizens with no distinction of race , religion or language origin .
In the previous code sample , if we do n't tell the runtime that REGISTRAR is an Eiffel class , how is it going to find that class ?
Simple : namespaces .
Here 's the beginning of the Eiffel class text of REGISTRAR :
indexing description : " [ Registration services for a conference ; include adding new registrants and new registrations . ] " dotnet_name : " Conference_registration.REGISTRAR
" class REGISTRAR inherit WEB_SERVICE create start feature - Initialization start is -
Set empty error message .
do set_last_operation_successful ( True ) set_last_error_message ( " No Error " ) set_last_registrant_identifier ( - 1 ) end ...
Other features ...
The line preceded by dotnet_name says : " To the rest of the .NET world , this class shall be part of the namespace Conference_registration , where it shall be known under the name REGISTRAR . "
This enables the Eiffel compiler to make the result available in the proper place for the benefit of client .NET assemblies , whether they originated in the same language or in another one .
Now reconsider the beginning of the ASP.
NET page shown earlier :
< %@ Assembly Name= " conference " %> <%@ Import Namespace= " Conference_registration " %> <%@ Page Language= " C# " %> < HTML > < HEAD > < TITLE >TOOLS CONFERENCE </ TITLE > < SCRIPT RUNAT=" SERVER " > ...
The rest as before ...
The second line says to import the namespace Conference_registration , and that does the trick .
A namespace is an association between class names , a way of saying " The class name A denotes that code over there , and the class name B denotes this other code here . "
In that association , the class name REGISTRAR will denote the Eiffel class above , since we took care of registering it under that name in the dotnet_name entry of its indexing clause .
The basic technique will always be the same :
When you compile one or more classes written in language L1 , you specify the namespaces into which they will be compiled and the final names that they must retain in that language .
When you write a system in a language L2  the same as L1 , or another one you specify one or more namespaces to " import " ; they will define how to understand any class name to which your system may refer .
The details may vary depending on the languages involved .
On the producer side , L1 , you may retain the original class names or , as in the preceding Eiffel example , explicitly specify an external class name .
On the consumer side , you may have mechanisms to adapt the names of external classes and their features to the conventions of L2 .
Some flexibility is essential here , since what 's acceptable
as an identifier in one language may not be in another : Visual Basic , for example , accepts a hyphen in a feature name , as in my - feature , but most other languages do n't , so you 'll need some convention to accept the feature under a different name .
What 's important is that you can have access to all the classes and features from any other .NET language .
Combining Different Language Models
How does the interoperability work in practice ?
The first key idea is to map all software to the .NET Object Model .
Once compiled , classes do n't reveal their language of origin .
Combining Different Language Models
How does interoperability work in practice ?
The first key idea is to map all software to the .NET Object Model .
Once compiled , classes do n't reveal their language of origin .
Starting from a source language , the compiler will map your programs into a common target , as shown in " Combining Different Language Models . "
This by itself is n't big news , since we could use the same figure to explain how compilers map various languages to the common model of , say , the Intel architecture .
What is new is that the object model , as we 've seen in detail , retains high - level structures such as classes and inheritance that have direct equivalents in source programs written in modern programming languages , especially object - oriented ones .
This is what allows modules from different languages to communicate at the proper level of abstraction , by exchanging objects all of which , as .NET objects , are guaranteed to have well - understood , language - independent properties .
Object Model Discrepancies
Of course , the languages involved have their own models , which may differ significantly from the .NET object model .
That 's to be expected :
Otherwise , they would n't really be different languages , just a different syntax and minor variations on a single language theme .
To a certain extent , this characterization could be applied to C# and Visual Basic .NET ; one may claim that these two are , deep down , just one language , now that VB has become an OO language .
But it 's definitely incorrect if we consider the entire set of .NET language players .
The case of non-OO languages is the most obvious : Right from the initial announcements , .NET has included languages like APL and Fortran , which no one would accuse of being object oriented .
Even if we restrict our attention to object - oriented languages , we 'll find discrepancies .
Each has its own object model ; while the key notions class , object , inheritance , polymorphism , dynamic binding are common , individual languages depart from the .NET model in some significant respects :
Eiffel and C++ allow multiple inheritance ; the .NET object model ( as well as Java , C# and Visual Basic . NET ) permits a class to inherit from only one class , although it may inherit from several interfaces .
Eiffel and C++ each support a form of genericity ( type parameterization ) :
You can declare an Eiffel class as LIST [ G ] to describe lists of objects of an arbitrary type G without saying what G is ; then you can use the class to define types LIST [ INTEGER ] , LIST [ EMPLOYEE ] , or even LIST [ LIST [ INTEGER ] ] .
C++'s templates pursue a similar goal .
This notion is unknown to the .NET object model , although planned as a future addition ; currently , you have to write a LIST class that will manipulate values of the most general type , Object , and then cast them back and forth to the types you really want .
to describe lists of objects of an arbitrary type without saying what is ; then you can use the class to define types , , or even .

This notion is unknown to the .NET object model , although planned as a future addition ; currently , you have to write a class that will manipulate values of the most general type , , and then cast them back and forth to the types you really want .
The .NET object model permits in - class overloading : Within a class , a single feature name may denote two or more features .
Several languages disallow this possibility as incompatible with the aims of quality object - oriented development .
These object model discrepancies raise a serious potential problem :
How do we fit different source languages into a common mold ?
There are two basic approaches :
Either change the source language to fit the model , or let programmers use the language as before , and provide a mapping through the compiler .
No absolute criterion exists : Both approaches are found in current .NET language implementations .
C++ and Eiffel for .NET provide contrasting examples .
The Radical Solution
C++ typifies the Procrustean solution : Make the language fit the model .
To be more precise , on .NET , the name " C++ " denotes not one language , but two : Unmanaged and Managed C++.
Classes from both languages can coexist in an application :
Any class marked __gc is managed ; any other is unmanaged .
The unmanaged language is traditional C++ , far from the object model of .NET ; unmanaged classes will compile into ordinary target code ( such as Intel machine code ) , but not to the object model .
As a result , they do n't benefit from the Common Language Runtime and lack the seamless interoperability with other languages .
Only managed classes are full .NET players .
But if you then look at the specifications for managed classes , you 'll realize that you 're not in Kansas any more ( assuming , for the sake of discussion , that Kansas uses plain C++ ) .
On the " no " side , there 's no multiple inheritance except from ( you guessed it ) completely abstract classes , no support for templates , no C - style type casts .
On the " yes " side , you 'll find new .NET mechanisms such as delegates ( objects representing functions ) and properties ( fields with associated methods ) .
If this sounds familiar , that 's because it is : Managed C++ is very close to C# , in spite of what the default Microsoft descriptions would have you believe .
Predictably , the restrictions also rule out any cross-inheritance between managed and unmanaged classes .
The signal to C++ developers is hard to miss :
The .NET designers do n't think too highly of the C++ object model and expect you to move to the modern world as they see it .
The role of Unmanaged C++ is simply to smooth the transition by allowing C++ developers to move an application to the managed side one class at a time .
An existing C++ application will compile straight away as unmanaged .
Then you 'll try declaring specific classes as managed .
The compiler will reject those that violate the rules of the managed world , for example , by using improper casts ; the error messages will tell you what you must correct to turn these classes into proper citizens of the managed world .
For C++ , this is indeed a defensible policy , as the language 's object model defined to a large extent by the constraint of backward compatibility with C , a language more than three decades old is obsolete by today 's standards .
Respecting Other Object Models
Only time will tell how successful the .NET strategy will be at convincing C++ programmers to move over to the managed world .
But even if they wholeheartedly comply , it wo n't mean that other languages should follow the same approach .
This is particularly true of object - oriented languages that have their own views of what OO should be , with perhaps better arguments than C ++.
If you 've chosen a language precisely because it supports such expressive mechanisms as multiple inheritance , Design by Contract and genericity , do you have to renounce them and step down to the lowest common denominator once you decide to use .
NET ?
Fortunately , the answer is no , at least not if " you " here means the programmer .
The scheme described in " Combining Different Language Models " does n't require that all languages adhere to the .NET object model ; rather that they map to that model .
That mapping can be made the responsibility of compilers rather than programmers , enabling programming languages to retain their normal semantics , and establishing a correspondence between the specific semantics of each language and the common rules of the common object model .
Tune in next issue and discover how this all works out .
If we take a look at the Haskell (. ) operator :
(. ) :: ( a -> b ) -> ( e -> a ) -> e -> b
and take a moment to reflect on the type of fmap
fmap :: Functor f => ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b
and the unnamed Reader monad from Control .
Monad .
Reader
instance Functor ( (->) r)
we see that fmap applied to the Reader functor rederives (. ) .
fmap_reader :: ( a -> b ) -> ( e -> a ) -> e -> b
So if we were willing to forgo ease of learning , and to bake in the Reader monad as a primitive , we could quite concisely redefine (. ) to give it a more general signature :
module Dot where
import Control .
Monad .
Reader
import Prelude hiding ( (. ) )
infixr 0 .
(. ) :: Functor f => ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b
(. ) = fmap
In this context , existing code continues to type check .
For instance ,
( ( +2 ) . ( * 3 ) ) 5 ==> 17
And the .
above doubles as filling the role of the * map operator mentioned in Richard Bird 's 1990 Calculus of Functions paper generalized to any Functor .
( ( +2 ) . ( * 3 ) ) . [ 1..10 ] == > [ 5,8 , ..32 ]
( ( +2 ) . ( * 3 ) ) . Just 5 ==> Just 17
( ( +2 ) . ( * 3 ) ) .
Nothing == > Nothing
I was able to test this with the just about every example golfed back and forth on the #haskell channel in the last 6 months .
I 'm not advocating this as a practice for Haskell as it is somewhat terrifying to think of how to teach to new programmers , but I found the exercise to be enlightening .
The Octosphericon and the Cretan Maze
Posted May 2006 .
The Cretan Maze is an archetypical design -- it dates back some 5000 years ...

The octosphericon
The octosphericon is a generalization of C. J. Robert 's sphericon ( see also " The differential geometry of the sphericon " and " Cone with a twist " ) : the surface of the body obtained by rotating a square about one of its diagonals , slicing the resulting solid along a plane through the axis of rotation , rotating one of the halves 90o with respect to the other and reattaching the two .
Construction of the sphericon : a double cone is sliced , half gets rotated , and the halves are rejoined .
The ( prime ) octosphericon is constructed in the same way , but with an octagon instead of a square , and with a relative rotation of 45o instead of 90 .
The octosphericon .
A relative rotation of minus 45o between the two half spun-octagons would give a mirror - image surface .
A relative rotation through 90o would give a different surface .
The Cretan maze
The Cretan maze is an archetypical design -- it dates back some 5000 years .
On the island of Crete , it came to symbolize the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur was kept .
The city of Knossos , where King Minos had his palace , used this design on coins between roughly 500 and 200 BC .
The Cretan maze can be drawn as a game : start with the " nucleus " on the left , join the lower central end to the one immediately on its right , and continue joining the next free end on the left ( the dots count as ends ) to the next free end on the right , always going around the bottom .
The level sequence of the Cretan maze
The Cretan maze is organized on 8 concentric levels .
The path from the outside to the center traverses these levels in an order which is characteristic of the maze .
If we number the levels 1 to 8 , and represent the outside by 0 , then following the path through the maze produces a sequence of numbers , starting with 0 and ending with 8 : this is the level sequence of the maze .
The path from the outside to the center meets the numbers 0 3 2 1 4 7 6 5 8 in that order .
This is the level sequence of the Cretan maze .
The Cretan maze is just one of a family of mazes which share three properties :
A single path runs from the outside to the center .
The maze is organized on concentric levels ; the path traverses each level exactly once .
The path changes direction each time it changes level .
Here , for example , are two others of the 42 eight - level mazes of this type :
Cretan - type mazes with level sequence 0 5 6 7 4 1 2 3 8 and 0 7 2 5 4 3 6 1 8 .
Level sequences of Cretan - type mazes
For a permutation of the integers 0 through 8 to be the level sequence of a Cretan - type maze it must satisfy
It starts with 0 and ends with 8 .
Odds and evens alternate .
The number - line segments corresponding to an even integer and its ( odd ) successor in the permutation must obey the " no-overlap " law : if two of these segments intersect , one must be contained inside the other .
Similarly the number - line segments corresponding to an odd integer and its ( even ) successor must also obey the " no-overlap " law .
For example , in the maze 0 5 6 7 4 1 2 3 8 , the first set of number - line segments is [ 0,5 ] , [ 6,7 ] , [ 4,1 ] , [ 2,3 ] ; note that [ 2,3 ] is inside [ 4,1 ] which is inside [ 0,5 ] , while [ 6,7 ] is disjoint from all of them .
Cretan - type mazes and chord diagrams
An n-chord diagram consists of 2n points on the perimeter of a circle , and n non-intersecting chords joining them .
The " no overlap " condition for a level sequence of length 2n can be interpreted in terms of chord diagrams if we identify 0 and 2n .
Then the n [ odd , even ] segments form an n-chord diagram , and the n [ even , odd ] segments form another .
The two chord diagrams corresponding to the Cretan maze 0 3 2 1 4 7 6 5 8 . Two chord diagrams give a Cretan - type maze if and only if they link to give a path visiting every vertex .
Chord diagrams on the octosphericon , the link to the Cretan maze
Each half of a spun octagon gives a chord diagram ( in fact , in several different ways ) .
Suppose we number the sides of the octagon from 0 to 7 .
Then rotating about the axis through the intersection of sides 1 and 2 creates a surface , each half of which contains a band linking sides 0 & 3 , 2 & 1 , 4 & 7 , 6 & 5 .
If the half - surface is turned 45o leaving the octagon fixed , its bands now join sides 1 & 4 , 3 & 2 , 5 & 0 , 7 & 6 .
When the two halves are joined to form the octosphericon , the surface forms one continuous band joining 0 3 2 1 4 7 6 5 8 in that order : the level sequence of the Cretan maze .
Rotating the octagon about the axis AA ' produces bands in each half of the spun octagon .
If the sides of the octagon are numbered 0 ... 7 as shown , the bands on the half - octosphericon join 0 to 3 , 2 to 1 , 4 to 7 and 6 to 5 .
The other half - octopshericon is rotated through 45o relative to the first .
Its bands now join 1 to 4 , 3 to 2 , 5 to 0 and 7 to 6 .
Make your own Cretan - maze octosphericon
An octosphericon may be constructed by joining two copies of this template .
The photographs show how to attach tabs ( for a paper model ) and how to number the sides of the inscribed octagon .
Good Luck !
The two halves , with numbers and tabs , for a paper model of the Octosphericon .
Note that the tab placements are slightly different .
I chose two different colors of construction paper to make the assembly more intelligible .

Brazil is thought to have the greatest biodiversity on Earth
The government says it believes this is the result of new protection policies .
But environmental groups warn it is too soon to be sure there has been a long - term reversal in the destruction of the world 's largest rainforest .
Environment Minister Marina da Silva said some 9,000 sq km ( 3,475 sq miles ) of forest was felled in the last year .
This compares with more than 18,000 sq km ( 6,950 sq miles ) in 2003 to 2004 .
Ms Silva said she believed this fall was the result of not only greater government control but also because of more emphasis on sustainable development projects .
Illegal logging crackdown
However , environmental groups , while welcoming the fall , are still treating the announcement with caution .
The figures , they say , are still estimates from satellite images which , because of cloud cover , have a 20 % margin of error .
They say a fall in soy prices may also have had an impact , with farmers no longer clearing land .
Finally , they point out that most of the fall in deforestation occurred over a two - month period in June and July this year , when the army and police mounted unusually large operations against illegal logging .
Greenpeace said it was too soon to talk about a long - term slowing of the destruction of the forest , warning that illegal loggers may just be biding their time .
The only firm conclusion , the group said , was that when the government decides to mount major operations against illegal loggers , this does have a positive short - term effect .
Economics is the " study of the allocation of scarce resources which have competing uses " ( Lionel Robbins ) .
Like every society , the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 must allocate their resources so as to make themselves as well off as possible .
Most of the time , being " better off " means surviving another day , and this requires careful planning on both the part of the community and the individual .
Locke , Sawyer , and Jack represent the three primary models of Economics represented on the Island ; Tribalism , Capitalism , and Socialism , respectively .
The survivors initially have to decide as a community what to produce , how much to produce and who will produce it .
A number of solutions to this problem exist :
The socialist approach allocates resources through consensus and planning .
approach allocates resources through consensus and planning .
The capitalist approach relies upon a market to allocate resources based on supply and demand .
approach relies upon a market to allocate resources based on supply and demand .
The tribal approach holds that in small communities economic decisions can be made at a personal level .
That such a community is not of sufficient scale to require or manage a formal system of exchange or enforcement of laws .
Thus the tribal approach relies on small - scale exchanges and community resources .

“ " Live together , die alone . " ”
Jack represents the socialist approach to resource allocation .
Jack is a mostly benevolent person who attempts to solve the problems of the Island imposed by scarcity , even to the point of personal exhaustion .
Jack 's surname , " Shephard , " reinforces this interpretation - he exists to care for and organize the survivors .
On the day of the crash , Jack was essentially elected as an unofficial leader , because of his quick - thinking skills as a physician and the lack of any other suitable candidates putting themselves forward .
Jack 's approach to managing survival most closely resembles that of socialism , because he believes that he alone possesses the ability to allocate the Island 's limited resources ( food , water , weapons , medicine ) to their best uses .
His goal is to improve the welfare of the community rather than himself , such as when he instigated the move from the beach camp to the caves at the end of " White Rabbit " .
By centrally deciding which resources should be used , and by whom , Jack is advocating a socialized solution to the problems of the Island .
" .
By centrally deciding which resources should be used , and by whom , Jack is advocating a socialized solution to the problems of the Island .
When someone complains about Jack 's choices , usually after the fact , his typical justification is that people do not have the right to complain about his leadership when they appear to expect him to serve in that capacity .
Leadership is not the only advantage of centralized ordering of society 's resources .
A necessary condition for decentralized resource allocation to be efficient is the existence of competitive marketplace conditions ( i.e. , many suppliers and many buyers ) , complete information , and most importantly , well - defined property rights .
But on the island , property is undefined , since anyone can take something from anyone else .
Also missing is a developed form of currency .
This makes exchanges highly inefficient since they rely mainly on barter , which has its problems .
Thus , in light of the limitations imposed by their situation , an argument can be made that Jack 's form of leadership and resource allocation provides adequate solutions to the problems of a decentralized order .
The Water Problem
Resources whose consumption is vital but which are accessible by anyone are vulnerable to over - harvesting and exploitation .
This is popularly referred to as tragedy of the commons [ 1 ] , a term coined by ecologist Garrett Hardin .
This problem , from the capitalist point of view , is a result of poorly defined property rights , which is a problem on the island [ 2 ] .
Since no one can be excluded from using the resource , no one has an incentive to conserve the resource .
For goods such as water or food , this means that each person has an incentive to consume slightly more of it today , leaving less for tomorrow .
If they did not do this , there is a good chance that someone else would instead - the penalty incurred for conservation .
A classic example of this problem is exemplified by the near extinction of the North American bison , which was severely over - harvested and nearly went extinct .
The introduction of the European horse , gunpowder and steel tools lowered the marginal cost of hunting American bison so that by 1840 , Native American and European hunters had almost completely annihilated the breed [ 3 ] .
The dodo bird is also believed to have been a victim of tragedy of the commons .
Scarce resources are also subject to hoarding , when people take possession of a larger amount of water than they individually can consume .
Since no one owns the water bottles that the Losties use to store water , the theory predict that islanders drink too much water .
Specifically , individuals drink water up to the point where the marginal benefit of the last sip equals the marginal cost .
But because of the absence of property rights , the marginal cost of drinking water is too low .
This is because the private costs of drinking have diverged from the social costs , and individual members of this Island economy have allocated too much of their water to current consumption , and too little for future consumption .
The solution proposed by Jack is barring access and rationing the resource .
Without rationing , self - interested behavior would have certainly led to over - consumption or hoarding of water .
And a shortage or unequal distribution of water would have inevitably lead to social breakdown and ultimately violence .
Sawyer maintains the largest stock of scavenged goods in the camp .
“ " Every man for himself . " ”
Sawyer is seen as representing capitalism .
In this context , Capitalism is defined as an economic and social system in which the means of production are predominantly privately owned and operated for profit , and in which investments , distribution , income , production and pricing of goods and services are determined through the operation of a market economy .
Homesteading
Property rights play an important role in both market economies and LOST .
Some philosophers , such as John Locke , have argued that ownership is created " where one mixes labor with capital " [ 4 ] .
Property rights on the Island , however is a very questionable concept because the idea depends on concepts such as " homesteading , " " salvaging " or the " right of capture , " which are not necessarily capitalist .
While individuals could be said to have a right to their own property from the plane , the concept that they could acquire property rights over airline property and the property of other passengers ( living and dead ) simply by taking possession is unique to this environment .
Few economists or philosophers have ever outlined or promoted a system in which looting is considered a normal part of economic activity .
Sawyer is the only person who appears to continually acquire property .
He searches through wreckage and hoards anything he finds that might have even the faintest marginal value , either now or at some point in the future ; this is how Sawyer winds up having many desirable possessions by the end of season 1 .
His subversion in " The Long Con " , which leads to his possession of the guns for a large part of season 2 , is an extension of Sawyer 's philosophy in the first season ; however , it is unclear how an act of fraud transfers legitimate right of property ( the guns ) to him .
" , which leads to his possession of the guns for a large part of season 2 , is an extension of Sawyer 's philosophy in the first season ; however , it is unclear how an act of fraud transfers legitimate right of property ( the guns ) to him .
Despite the fact that some possessions belong to survivors on the Island , his actions are more or less tacitly accepted by the survivors .
But it must be noted that some of this acceptance is because of Sawyer 's threats of violence if others object .
Without this acceptance , Sawyer cannot accumulate goods .
There is an understanding that while his monopoly over the salvaged goods is unfair , Sawyer is the owner of the goods by virtue of his ability to protect what he considers 'his property . '
Bargaining Power
Strides have been made in understanding how imbalances in " power " can affect exchange .
Game theoretic models , such as the Nash Bargaining Model , reveal the importance of threats in allocating resources .
The fewer options a person has outside of the business relationship , the smaller the slice of the pie they will get in equilibrium .
Sawyer arguably possesses considerable bargaining power by virtue of his extensive wealth of salvaged goods , and is therefore able to strike deals with parties that enable him to extract most of the gain from the exchange .
He is limited only by the degree to which he can tolerate their collective dissatisfaction .
A recurring theme in the narrative is how Jack and others can get Sawyer to relinquish goods that will benefit some other member of the community .
For instance , in " Confidence Man " , Shannon succumbs to an asthma attack and needs medicine ( almost certainly a Salbutamol - based steroid , such as Ventolin ) which Jack , amongst others , believes to be in the possession of Sawyer .
As far as Jack is concerned , Sawyer should surrender it for the good of the group .
Sawyer feigns possession and will only give Jack the inhaler if he receives a kiss from Kate in exchange .
That is , he wants to trade .
This exchange does not end well for Sawyer ( see Jack 's approach ) .
There are similar scenes in the second season as well :
Sun requires a pregnancy test .
Hurley requests antipsychotic drugs ( it is worth noting that he requests the Klonopin after Jack has already obtained the medical supplies from Sawyer -- in a poker game that Hurley witnessed ) .
Jack has already obtained the medical supplies from Sawyer -- in a poker game that Hurley witnessed ) .
And of course Jack wants ( and obtains ) the entire medical supplies from flight 815 .
It should be noted that Sawyer 's capitalism is mitigated by very occasional displays of compassion .
These displays become more frequent as time on the island progresses :
He gives up his alcohol supply when Boone is injured without argument or bargaining .
When Kate tells him that Aaron is sick , he immediately offers up his stash of medicine , as well as implicitly offering to accompany Kate and Claire on their mission . ( " Maternity Leave " )
When Libby is dying he brings Kate to his hidden stash even though it means revealing where he 's hidden the guns .
When Claire has a headache and asks if anyone has aspirin , he immediately goes to get her some . ( " One of Us " )
Exchange on the Island
Related to Sawyer 's bargaining is the problem of exchange .
For markets to function efficiently , transaction costs should be low or non-existent .
On the Island , this is not the case , creating many problems when two or more people attempt to exchange .
According to the Coase theorem , private parties can reach an optimal allocation through private bargaining regardless of how property rights are originally distributed if transaction costs are zero .
Exchange should occur , even if all property is given to one person , such as is the case on the Island .
That this happens so rarely on the Island suggests that transaction costs are too high to orchestrate such improvements .
Why might transactions be so costly for survivors ?
One source of the problem might be the absence of money on the Island .
Money has the advantage of storing and measuring the value of goods , as well as its usefulness as a medium of exchange .
Without it , Barter is the only mechanism by which trading can occur , but most individuals on the Island have little with which to barter .
Bartering is known to be an inefficient system as compared to money exchange .
Thus , in order to get something from Sawyer , individuals must enter into a series of trades with other survivors in order to finally acquire a good or service suitable for trade with Sawyer .
In order for barter to occur , the following conditions must be met :
Sawyer possesses something that another person values
That other person possesses something that Sawyer values
Each values the other good more than what each currently possesses .
If these conditions are met , then exchanges can and will occur , but it is worth noting that a coincidence must exist .
For example , it is by coincidence that Michael values Sawyer 's equipment more than the empty space on his raft , and vice versa .
Since a double coincidence of wants are rare by definition , many mutually beneficial exchanges cannot take place in a barter economy .
Ironically , it may be the absence of a developed medium of exchange that is the source of constant antagonism towards Sawyer , who instead values services that rarely can be acquired via barter when double coincidence of wants is not met .
For instance , no one can acquire Kate 's kiss from Kate to give to Sawyer ; only Kate can give Sawyer that kiss .
Thus , if that is mainly what Sawyer wants , then few exchanges could ultimately take place , and antagonism toward Sawyer might result in equilibrium .
LOST reveals important strengths and weaknesses of both economic systems .
Jack has shown that doing what is best for the community may require abuse or suffering on the part of the individual .
( Examples being his self - contradictory return to the Swan in " Man of Science , Man of Faith " , or his approval of Sawyer 's torture at the hands of Sayid in " Confidence Man " ) .
Sawyer has shown that unrestrained self - interest can lead to a breakdown in order ( violence ) and extremely inefficient allocation of resources .
Sawyer 's system of " capitalism " and " markets " on the Island is based on the questionable idea that he has a right to all property on the Island that he can physically capture .
Rather than creating a market based on what he owned or what he created , Sawyer has created a market based on his capture of the property of others .
Capitalism creates problems if exchanges cannot be made because of high transaction costs and / or monopoly power structures
Sawyer 's property mostly consists of a scarce amount of disposable goods .
Unlike a conventional capitalist economy , Sawyer 's economy creates nothing .
As discussed , barter is a considerable constraint to trading , which keeps many trapped in relative poverty .
Sawyer 's monopoly position means that fewer exchanges will take place than would if the playing field among islanders were more level .
Also , the lack of a developed medium of exchange means barter is the principal form of making exchanges , and Sawyer has proven to sometimes be a demanding monopolist because of his love for Kate .
Criticism of the Socialism - Capitalism Dichotomy
Some have argued that neither Jack nor Sawyer fully represents socialist or capitalist economic ideas , and that the Island 's economy cannot be classified as either .
Sawyer as Capitalism
On the Island , Sawyer fiercely guards his right to hold the belongings he acquired from the fuselage wreckage .
Although Sawyer shares his strong belief in his own property rights with capitalist theorists , he acquired his property through means that would be criminal in a traditional capitalist society .
Sawyer not only claimed property from the dead , but he also stole property from other survivors .
His view toward property rights could thus more justly be compared to a monarchist view where one individual 's property rights are considered to be more important than another's .
Jack as Socialism
On the Island , Jack argues for a more equal distribution of resources , an argument that bears superficial resemblance to the theory of socialism .
On closer inspection , however , differences emerge between the two views .
Socialist theory holds that the state is to be the agent of collective redistribution .
On the Island , no state system exists .
Socialism also holds that all resources are owned by the state , and again no state exists .
Jack 's view -- particularly as expressed in his " Live Together , Die Alone , Part 1 " speech -- may thus be closer to a tribal , collective , survivalist economy than to socialism .
Tribal Economics ( Locke
“ " If you 'd like to join us , it 's a free island ...
I 'm not Jack .
The more , the merrier . " ”
Locke represents the third , and most prevalent form of economics on the Island ; Tribal Economics .
The central thesis of this critique is that the Island population is too small to allow for the formation of the rule of law or a state , both of which are essential to capitalist and socialist economics .
Without the rule of law and a state to enforce it , property rights are meaningless .
Socialism requires a state to act as the agent of resource distribution .
The only economic system available to the survivors of Flight 815 is thus a return to the tribal , hunter / gatherer subsistence system that has dominated human economic patterns for most of history .
Under this system , resources are shared collectively and are seen not as the property of either individuals or the collective , but rather as gifts won from nature 's bounty .
This system contains many elements of what is known in economics as the gift economy .
Sawyer 's refusal to participate in the gift economy of the Island may have more to do with his psychological inability to trust ( and thus be reciprocated ) than with his robust faith in a capitalist system .
Because the Island 's economy is the most efficient under the circumstances , Jack 's acceptance of the gift economy may be the result of pragmatism rather than commitment to a socialist and / or egalitarian ideal .
Inherited Wealth
In Season Two , the majority of the Losties ' wealth was not created though either socialist , capitalist , or tribalist means , but inherited from the builders of the Swan .
The economic advantages of electric power , running water , night lighting and multiple guns were not created by the Losties but inherited from those who came before them .
Consequently , it could be argued that the Losties value the inherited goods much differently than they assess the value of everything else on the Island .
In Season Four , the entire group was divided into two factions because of the presence of the Freighters on the Island .
Jack , believing that the Freighters were there to rescue the Losties , became the leader of his group .
Locke , confident that the opposite was true , led his group to the abandoned barracks , once occupied by the Others .
His group inherited a new supply of food & water , not to mention several furnished homes and electric power .
Later seasons
As the show transitioned away from " slice of life " storytelling , the economic factor decreased in importance .
Characters spent time with the Others , returned to the mainland and joined the DHARMA Initiative , where no resource shortages existed .
Even those in the beach camp , though cut off from the Swan supplies and the caves ' water , ceased to experience shortages .
Characters continued , however , to discuss money .
Google to buy YouTube for $ 1.65 billion
Search engine leader looks to bulk up in the burgeoning online video market .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Google , the Internet 's leading search engine , announced Monday that it is buying popular online video site YouTube for $ 1.65 billion in stock .
YouTube , which was founded in February 2005 , has quickly become the most well - known of several online video sites .
More than 100 million videos , many of which are short videos created by the site 's users , are downloaded a day on the site .
According to Internet research firm Hitwise , YouTube has about a 46 percent share of the online video market .
For Google ( Charts ) , the purchase of YouTube gives the company the ability to tap into the potentially lucrative online video and social networking markets .
Some analysts have criticized Google for relying too much on advertising tied to keyword searches .
The combination of Google and YouTube could further strengthen Google 's dominance in online advertising , giving it an edge over rivals such as Yahoo ! ( Charts ) , Microsoft's ( Charts ) MSN and News Corp ( Charts ) . , which owns the social networking site MySpace .
Some analysts said Monday that Yahoo , Microsoft and News Corp. also had probably expressed interest in buying YouTube .
Bill Tancer , general manger of global research of Hitwise , said after the deal was announced that MySpace would now probably need to promote its own video service more aggressively on its site in order to compete with a combined Google - YouTube .
And Martin Pyykkonen , an analyst with Global Crown Capital , said that Google 's purchase of YouTube could be viewed as a preemptive strike against Yahoo , which has been rumored to be in talks to purchase social networking site Facebook .
In a statement , Google said YouTube will operate as an independent unit of Google once the deal closes and will retain the YouTube brand name .
The companies added that no YouTube workers will lose their jobs as a result of the acquisition and that Google will maintain its own online video business .
Clayton Moran , an analyst with Stanford Group , said after the deal was announced that Google was paying a rich price for YouTube since it has yet to generate a sizable amount of sales .
But he said Google needed to do something to become more competitive with MySpace , which currently ranks in second place in online video market share .
" My sense is that Google is paying a full price considering that YouTube is still unproven in regards to its revenue potential .
But considering the success of MySpace it was clearly worthwhile for Google to take this step , " Moran said .
In addition to giving Google a stronger foothold in the burgeoning social networking market , YouTube could also help Google extend its highly successful text - based search platform into video , which could wind up being even more profitable .
Pyykkonen said that for this reason , Google may be able to justify paying such a high price for YouTube .
" Google has talked a lot about video and video search without really having anything particularly going on there .
I would think that a lot of advertisers would be willing to pay a premium for a video search ad opposed to paid search text , " he said .
First step ?
During a conference call , Google chief executive officer Eric Schmidt said the YouTube deal would be one of " many investments " that Google planned to make in online video .
He added that the combination of Google and YouTube would make Google more desirable to advertisers .
" This is just the beginning of an Internet video revolution , " he said .
There is some debate about whether or not YouTube or other user - generated video sites will be able to attract the interest of top advertisers .
But Tancer said that big corporations may be forced to start spending on ads tied to such clips .
" I do n't know if advertisers will have the choice going forward .
They 'll have to start taking risks .
People more and more are going to use brands in user generated content , " Tancer said .
He mentioned the popularity of the so - called Diet Coke - Mentos Experiment video , a clip that featured two men creating elaborate gushers of Diet Coke by dropping Mentos candies into bottles of the soft drink .
Mentos eventually wound up becoming the exclusive sponsor of the video on Revver , a privately held online video site that sells ads tied to user - generated videos .
Reports of a Google - YouTube deal first began to circulate on Friday .
Shares of Google rose about 2 percent on the Nasdaq Monday after posting a similar gain on Friday .
The stock edged slightly higher in after hours trading .
Before the deal was announced , some analysts expressed concerns about the litigation risks involved with YouTube since some videos posted on the site infringe on copyrighted material owned by major traditional media firms .
To that end , YouTube truly became a part of the pop culture lexicon earlier this year after people started posting pirated versions of " Lazy Sunday , " a skit on NBC 's sketch comedy show " Saturday Night Live " on the site .
NBC eventually forced YouTube to take down links to this clip .
But Chad Hurley , co-founder and CEO of YouTube , said the Google deal will allow YouTube to focus even more on copyright protection since Google has more financial and technological resources to dedicate to the issue .
However , more and more media companies have recently begun to partner with YouTube .
In fact , NBC announced a partnership with YouTube earlier this summer to promote shows from its new fall schedule on the site .
And on Monday , YouTube announced separate agreements with broadcast firm CBS ( Charts ) and music companies Sony BMG Entertainment and Universal Music Group to show video from these companies libraries .
CBS and Sony BMG will share advertising revenue with YouTube .
Terms of the Universal deal were not disclosed .
Google also announced an online video deal with Sony BMG Monday as well as one with Warner Music Group .
Quigo : The next Google ?

Is Facebook worth a billion bucks ?
Analysts quoted in this story do not own shares of Google and their firms have no investment banking ties to the company .
Last month , researchers found the 43rd Mersenne Prime : 230,402,457 - 1 .
It ’s 9,152,052 decimal digits long .
This is a great use of massively parallel computing :
The 700 campus computers are part of an international grid called PrimeNet , consisting of 70,000 networked computers in virtually every time zone of the world .
PrimeNet organizes the parallel number crunching to create a virtual supercomputer running 24×7 at 18 trillion calculations per second , or ‘ teraflops . ’
This greatly accelerates the search .
This prime , found in just 10 months , would have taken 4,500 years on a single PC .
Five years ago , Oxford University zoologists showed that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii alters the brain chemistry of rats so that they are more likely to seek out cats .
Infection thus makes a rat more likely to be killed and the parasite more likely to end up in a cat — the only host in which it can complete the reproductive step of its life cycle .
The parasite also lives in the brain cells of thousands of species , including about 60 million supposedly symptom - free Americans .
Studies over the past few years have suggested that toxoplasmosis infections in humans , too , may cause behavioral changes — from subtle shifts to outright schizophrenia .
Two studies this year add even weirder twists .
U.S. Geological Survey biologist Kevin Lafferty has linked high rates of toxoplasmosis infection in 39 countries with elevated incidences of neuroticism , suggesting the mind - altering organism may be affecting the cultures of nations .
Stranger still , parasitologist Jaroslav Flegr of Charles University in Prague thinks T. gondii could also be skewing our sex ratios .
When he looked at the clinical records of more than 1,800 babies born from 1996 to 2004 , he noted a distinct trend :
The normal sex ratio is 104 boys born for every 100 girls , but in women with high levels of antibodies against the parasite , the ratio was 260 boys for every 100 girls .
Exactly how the parasite might be tipping the odds in favor of males is n't understood , but Flegr points out that it is known to suppress the immune system of its hosts , and because the maternal immune system sometimes attacks male fetuses in very early pregnancy , the parasite 's ability to inhibit the immune response might protect future boys as well as itself .
" Our present study was rejected by eight journals , usually without any formal review , " says Flegr , who had the same problem publishing an earlier one showing that infection more than doubles the odds of a person having a traffic accident .
" People do n't like the possibility that their behavior and life are manipulated by a parasite , " he says .

Wilhelm about to scream in The Charge at Feather River
In the 1951 movie Distant Drums starring Gary Cooper , a small band of soldiers were crossing a swamp in pursuit of Seminole Indians .
While wading through the Everglades one unnamed soldier was attacked and dragged underwater by an alligator .
His last sound as he died was a startled scream .
In The Charge at Feather River two years later , a soldier named Private Wilhelm screamed in what sounded like alligator - assaulted agony when he was struck by an arrow .
In fact , his cry of pained surprise was practically identical to unnamed soldier ’s .
Both men would soon be forgotten as a bit parts in B - movies , seen by relatively few moviegoers .
But the holler they bellowed went on to be heard by millions ⁠— if not billions⁠— of people worldwide .
The Wilhelm Scream [ Your browser does not support embedded audio ]
Most movie studios will add sound effects for a film during post - production , and of course it ’s not unusual for them to recycle sound effects from their archives .
In the case of Distant Drums , six short screams were recorded in a studio and creatively titled “ man getting bit by an alligator , and he screams ” .
The fifth take was used for the alligator attack , and the others came in handy to give voice to some Indians shot during a raid .
Following the movie ’s release , the distinctive scream was placed in the Warner Brothers sound effects library and used regularly in that studio ’s films .
Among many others , it was heard in Them ! in 1954 , Swiss Family Robinson in 1960 , PT - 109 in 1963 , and The Green Berets in 1968 .
Star Wars Stormtrooper does the Wilhelm scream
Eventually a sound effect aficionado named Ben Burtt noticed the same scream wailing from the speakers of movie after movie .
When he made the swashbuckler parody The Scarlet Blade in 1974 , he decided he wanted to use the scream , so he lifted it from another film ’s soundtrack .
A few years later , he was hired to handle the sound effects for Star Wars , and during his audio hunting adventures he heard a familiar cry emanate from the Warner Brothers archive : the original Distant Drums scream .
Delighted , Burtt began to regularly insert the dramatic outcry into the projects he worked on , including Star Wars .
He dubbed it the “ Wilhelm scream ” in honor of the first named character to use it , and from there it found its way into cinema legend .
The scream soon became a kind of inside joke for Hollywood sound editors who started watching for places to insert it .
Below are just a few of its appearances :
Star Wars ( 1977 )
A stormtrooper is shot by Luke and falls down a shaft in the Death Star .
The Empire Strikes Back ( 1980 )
1 ) A rebel soldier screams when his gun explodes during the Hoth battle .
2 ) Chewie knocks a stormtrooper off the platform of the carbon - freezing chamber .
Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 )
1 ) A Nazi soldier is thrown from the back of a truck into a windshield .
2 ) A soldier falls from the left side of the truck , ripping the canvas as he falls .
Spaceballs ( 1987 )
Barf uses a section of tubing to reflect four laser bolts back at guards .
The fourth one screams .
Batman Returns ( 1992 )
Batman punches a clown and moves him out of his way .
Toy Story ( 1995 )
Buzz Lightyear is thrown out the bedroom window .
Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were - Rabbit ( 2005 )
The were - rabbit has a rampage near the end of the film , and picks up Lady Tottington Superman Returns ( 2006 )
When the train set in Luthor ’s basement is destroyed Damn Interesting : The Wilhelm Scream ( 2007 )
As the author realizes that the article deadline was tomorrow
Since it was first blurted out upon the world , the scream has been featured in over two hundred movies , TV programs , commercials , video games , and theme park attractions , and it has been heard by countless people .
Notable filmmakers have also specifically requested the Wilhelm scream for their movies after learning of its history , including directors Quentin Tarantino , Robert Rodriguez , and Peter Jackson .
Sheb Wooley
The person who is the actual voice of the Wilhelm Scream remains a mystery , but many believe it to be the voice of Sheb Wooley .
Wooley is most famous for his Purple People Eater , a song which was a number - one hit for six weeks in 1958 .
He dabbled in acting , and he had a small part in Distant Drums ; in fact , he was one of only a few actors who were called back after filming for some vocal work on the movie .
He died in 2003 , but his wife Linda believes it was his scream .
She is fond of saying that Sheb was very talented at performing screams , laughs , and “ dying vocals ” for the movies .
If true , given the use of his scream in such an enormous number of films , it could be said that this obscure actor is one of history ’s most prolific talents .
We ’ve been pretty hard on Zune here , noting several issues before it has even launched ..
Nevertheless , I had still toyed with buying one , just to review it .
It only seemed fair to maybe give it a try .
I mean , after surviving the Prism DuroSport 6000 , how bad could it be ?
But forget all of that , because I read something last night that ensures that I will never ever buy one .
Microsoft is giving a percentage of the money from sales of Zune to Universal Music .
Ah yes , the latest representation of an an incredibly anti-consumer trend : the Sin Tax on a consumer device .
Do n’t believe me ?
Check out this quote from Universal Music Group Chairman and CEO Doug Morris :
“ The only factor was that we feel that there ’s a great deal of music that ’s ( stored ) on these devices that was never legitimately obtained , and we wanted to get some sort of compensation for what we thought we ’re losing , ” Morris said .
“ I want our artists to be paid for the music that makes these devices popular . ”
These days , when a record company cries about “ The Artists ! ” it just reminds me of those right - wing censorship groups like Focus on the Family who always scream “ The Children !
What About The Children !?! ”
It ’s the dishonest use of an above reproach third - party in order to advance their own cause .
Let ’s ignore the decades of artificially high LP and CD prices , and let ’s forget the fact that the percentage that the artists are supposedly going to get paid will be miniscule at best , and look at the unbelieveably arrogant logic behind this statement .
Basically , what Mr. Morris is saying is this :
Every single person who buys a portable media player is a thief and a pirate .
All music comes from Universal .
Therefore , you should pay extra for any device you use to store music , you fracking thief .
It ’s a Sin Tax , pure and simple .
Since Microsoft has no doubt baked this fee into the list price of the Zune , you the consumer are paying more for the Zune because you might — MIGHT ! — use it for a purpose that Universal feels is piracy .
Which might even include ripping and storing music that you ’d previously purchased from them .
Over and over again .
Like that Complete U2 that I downloaded from iTunes and immediately burned to disc and ripped into mp3z .
What ’s next ?
TiVo paying NBC because I might fast - forward through the commercials on The Office ?
Sirus paying the record companies because some little kid might record something from one of their portable players ?
Oh wait , that one already happened .
Because some people think that kids recording songs off of the radio is piracy , and needs to be guarded against at all costs .
As a consumer , I ’m going to think twice about purchasing any product where I ’m paying extra for it just because some content provider thinks I might use it in a way that will deprive them of a revenue stream .
In the case of Zune , the only way that it is fair for the consumer is if all Zune users get free Universal Music forever from the Microsoft music store .
Otherwise , it ’s essentially extortion .
Apparently Microsoft caved to the extortion because otherwise they would have been missing Universal content when Zune launched , but it ’s a bad precedent .
Boo to Microsoft for bowing down to the extortion instead of fighting it .
Shame on Universal Music for hating on us consumers — who have been buying your overpriced products for our entire lives — so much once again .
I may never have bought a Zune anyway , but this is the tipping point , now I know for absolutely sure why I will never buy one .
Period .
Summary of Findings
As the congressional midterm campaign begins in earnest , the mood of the electorate is sharply drawn .
Voters are disappointed with Congress and disapproving of President Bush .
Anti-incumbent sentiment , while a bit lower than a few months ago , is far more extensive than in the previous two midterms and remains close to 1994 levels .
Moreover , there are indications that voters are viewing the election through the prism of national issues and concerns .
Many more voters see their vote as being against the president than at a comparable point in 1994 , and a solid majority says party control of Congress will be a factor in their voting decision .
Voters are expressing strong and consistent anti-Republican attitudes .
The GOP lags well behind the Democratic Party on nearly all major issues , including the economy , Iraq , education , health care , the environment and the budget deficit .
And the Republicans have lost ground in recent years even on such traditional strengths as terrorism and improving the nation ’s morality .
As in six previous surveys over the past 12 months , voters by a wide margin say they favor the Democratic congressional candidate in their district ( 50% - 39 % ) .
When the sample is narrowed to likely voters , approximately half of registered voters , the Democratic lead is undiminished .
That Democrats poll as well among likely voters as among all voters may reflect the fact that Democrats , in contrast to recent campaigns , are more enthusiastic about voting than are Republicans .
Voter preferences in the midterm elections have remained very consistent over the past year .
Since September 2005 , the Democrats ’ advantage in the congressional test ballot has fluctuated only modestly , between nine and 12 points .
Democratic gains this year are coming from a range of different groups , including several – like affluent Americans and college graduates – that typically lean Republican .
In addition , Democratic support among women is much greater than in the previous midterm four years ago .
And men , who are now about evenly divided in their voter preferences , backed the Republican candidate by a wide margin in 2002 .
The GOP also is suffering some internal defections , as more moderate and liberal Republican voters say they will support a Democratic candidate than did so in 2002 .
( For a detailed comparison of voting preferences in 2002 and this year , see page 17 . )
The electorate ’s discontent with Washington , which surged to record levels in June , is only modestly diminished heading into the fall campaign .
Nearly four - in - ten voters ( 38 % ) say this Congress has accomplished less than its predecessors ; this mirrors the negative assessment of congressional accomplishments in October 1994 .
As many as 36 % say they see their ballot this fall as a vote against the president .
Far more voters express this sentiment in the current election cycle than in any midterm campaign dating to 1982 .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Sept. 6-10 among 1,507 adults ( 1,191 registered voters ) finds that recent developments related to terrorism – including Bush ’s series of speeches on the subject – have raised the profile of the issue with the public .
Currently , 14 % cite terrorism as the most important problem facing the country , the highest percentage in three years .
However , many more people ( 25 % ) volunteer that the war in Iraq is the most pressing problem confronting the nation .
And there is no evidence that the renewed focus on terrorism has improved Bush ’s standing ; his job approval rating stands at 37 % , unchanged from August .
However , the Republicans continue to retain an advantage in one important dimension .
By a wide margin ( 43% -30 % ) , the GOP is perceived as having stronger political leaders than the Democratic Party .
Notably , independents by roughly two - to - one ( 42% - 22 % ) feel that the Republican Party has stronger political leaders .
The survey finds that the politics of terrorism are less one - sided than in the past .
The Republican Party ’s advantage over the Democratic Party in dealing with the terrorist threat at home – which was as large as 30 points in January 2002 – has declined to nine points in the current survey .
In addition , the public is becoming increasingly skeptical that the U.S. is prevailing in the war on terrorism .
Currently , about as many people say the U.S. is losing the war on terrorism as say it is winning ( 41 % vs. 39 % ) .
That represents a significant shift from the presidential campaign of two years ago , when pluralities consistently said the U.S. was winning in the struggle against terrorism .
Public opinion on the Iraq war continues to be stable .
The public is evenly divided over whether the U.S. should bring its troops home as soon as possible or maintain troops in Iraq until the country is stabilized ( 47 % - 47 % ) .
However , there has been a significant increase in the percentage viewing the violence in Iraq as a civil war , rather than an anti-U.S. insurgency .
Currently , half of Americans describe the violence in Iraq as mostly a civil war between competing factions ; 37 % say it is mostly an insurgency aimed at the U.S. and its allies .
In March , opinion on this issue was almost evenly divided , and last December 58 % of Americans said they viewed the violence as mostly an insurgency directed against the U.S. and its allies .
While the public is split along partisan lines about almost everything to do with the war , there also are divisions over whether it is appropriate to criticize the war ’s handling .
Overall , 36 % of Americans feel such criticisms “ help America ’s enemies ” ; 15 % say they “ help protect America ” ; and 42 % think that criticisms of the war ’s handling neither help America ’s enemies nor help protect the country .
Conservative Republicans are the only political group in which a majority ( 59 % ) says that criticisms of the war ’s handling help America ’s enemies .
National Problems : Iraq , Terrorism Gain
The percent of Americans who cite terrorism as the most important problem facing the nation has spiked to 14 % , up from just 5 % in May and the highest in over two years .
This shift in attention to the issue of terrorism reflects an overwhelming refocusing of Republican attention on the issue .
In May , immigration and gas prices topped the list of Republican concerns , with only 8 % citing terrorism as the biggest national issue .
Today , fully 23 % of Republicans point to terrorism as the nation ’s greatest problem , and the focus on immigration and gas prices has faded .
At the same time , the public also places a higher priority on the war in Iraq than it has in nearly a year .
Asked to describe the nation ’s most important problem , 25 % of Americans cite the situation in Iraq , up from 18 % in May .
This increase is driven primarily by Democrats – 36 % of whom cite Iraq as the nation ’s biggest problem , up 14 points since May .
By comparison , the percent of Republicans and independents who cite Iraq as the biggest problem has not increased significantly .
As the election season reaches full steam , more than twice as many Americans cite foreign or security concerns than economic problems ( 47 % vs. 23 % ) .
This balance is similar across party lines , though Republicans and Democrats are citing markedly different issues in their individual answers .
Anti-Incumbent Sentiment Highest Since ’94
The Democrats have held on to their considerable lead in the generic test ballot , as voter unhappiness with Congress remains very high in historical terms .
The proportion of Americans who say Congress has accomplished less than usual this year peaked at 45 % in June and stands at 38 % today .
Even so , that matches dissatisfaction with congressional accomplishments in October 1994 , and far exceeds levels of dissatisfaction during the 1998 and 2002 midterm campaigns .
Similarly , anti-incumbent sentiment remains higher than at any time since 1994 , though down slightly from the early summer .
Roughly half of voters ( 49 % ) say that most members should not be reelected , compared with 57 % in June , and the share saying their own member does not deserve reelection has slipped from 32 % to 27 % over the same period .
Problems in the GOP Base
One factor working for Democrats is the relatively weak partisan commitment among a segment of the GOP base .
Moderate and liberal Republicans , who make up about 30 % of Republicans overall , are supporting their party ’s candidate at far lower rates than voters in other political groups .
About three - quarters of moderate and liberal Republicans ( 77 % ) say they would vote for the GOP candidate in their district .
By comparison , 94 % of conservative Republicans , and an equally large number of all Democrats , say they intend to vote for their party ’s candidate this fall .
There are other indications that moderate and liberal Republicans are thinking in less partisan terms this year .
Just 37 % say that the issue of which party controls Congress next year will be a factor in their vote .
Solid majorities in the other partisan groups – including 78 % of liberal Democrats – say party control is a factor .
Even 44 % of independents , who shun partisan labels , say the composition of the next Congress matters to them .
In addition , moderate and liberal Republicans appear little affected by a key campaign message from the Republican leadership this year – that a Democratic majority in Congress will weaken America ’s efforts to combat terrorism .
Just 37 % of moderate and liberal Republicans are very concerned about a weakening of the anti-terrorism effort under Democrats , compared with 61 % of conservative Republicans .
Among Democrats , there are narrower ideological divisions about the potential consequences of a continued GOP majority .
Fully 60 % of conservative and moderate Democrats , along with 73 % of liberal Democrats , believe that if Republicans keep control of Congress this fall they will get the U.S. involved in too many military operations overseas .
Democrats Favored on Most Issues
The public favors the Republican Party on only one of 17 issues tested – terrorism .
By 41%- 32 % , more Americans say the Republicans can better deal with the terrorist threat at home .
On each of the other issues , Democrats hold either a substantial or slight lead .
Even on such traditional GOP strengths as reducing crime and improving morality , at least as many Americans trust the Democratic Party to do a better job as trust the Republican Party .
The Republican lead on terrorism has narrowed over the past six months .
As recently as February , Republicans had a 46 % to 30 % edge on this issue – about the same margin that the GOP enjoyed in the summer of 2004 and on the eve of the 2002 midterms .
In 2002 the Republican Party also held a sizable advantage as the party better able to make wise decisions about what to do in Iraq .
But by 2004 , this advantage disappeared , and today the Democratic Party has a seven - point advantage in handling Iraq ( 40 % vs. 33 % ) .
The survey updates views on the parties across a wide range of issues , and in most cases confidence in the Republican Party has fallen slightly over the past six months .
But the Republican Party continues to hold a substantial lead in terms of having the “ stronger ” political leaders – 43 % say the GOP has stronger leaders , compared to 30 % who see the Democratic Party ’s leaders as stronger .
This is a narrower margin than in April , when Republicans held a 53 % to 26 % edge in this area , but still stands out as one of the few Republican advantages going into the election season .
What People are Talking About
Gasoline and energy prices are far and away the most talked about issues among Americans today .
Three - quarters say that it is a subject that comes up “ frequently ” in conversations with family and friends , and it is a topic of discussion among people of all walks of life and political persuasions .
The economy , the war in Iraq , education , and health care are also frequent topics of conversation for most Americans .
Far fewer have regular conversations about government corruption , Social Security or the environment , and just 14 % say the topic of gay marriage comes up frequently .
There are stark differences in the topics of conversation between people who intend to vote Democratic and those who intend to vote Republican .
Aside from gas and energy concerns , terrorism and morality are the most talked about issues among Republican voters ; 57 % say the former comes up frequently and 56 % the latter , compared with just 44 % and 38 % of those who say they intend to vote Democratic .
In contrast , Democratic voters are talking about the war in Iraq and the economy more than their Republican counterparts .
The war comes up frequently in the conversations of 63 % of Democratic and 55 % of Republican voters , while the economy comes up among 62 % of Democratic voters and 49 % of Republican voters .
The job situation , too , is discussed by more Democratic ( 51 % ) than Republican ( 34 % ) voters .
There also are substantial differences within the party coalitions with respect to what is being discussed .
Among liberals who plan to vote for the Democrats , the war in Iraq is the biggest conversation point – 78 % talk about it frequently , compared with 5
7 % of moderate and conservatives voting Democratic .
For their part , moderates and conservatives who intend to vote Democratic are far more likely than liberals to talk about the job situation ( 59 % vs. 36 % ) .
Among those who plan to vote Republican , there are distinctly different levels of interest in moral issues and health care depending on a person ’s ideological position .
Fully 62 % of conservative Republican voters say they frequently talk about moral issues with friends and family , more than any other issue except gas prices .
But fewer than half of moderates and liberals who intend to vote Republican in the fall frequently discuss moral issues .
By contrast , 63 % of moderate and liberal Republican voters say that health care comes up frequently in their conversations with friends and family , compared with just 48 % of conservatives who plan to vote Republican .
Iraq Views Mostly Steady
Public optimism about the situation in Iraq has increased slightly since last month , with a small majority of the public ( 52 % ) expressing the belief that the U.S. will succeed in establishing a stable democratic government there .
Similarly , the number of Americans who say the war is going at least “ fairly well ” rose six percentage points from last month , to 47 % .
But optimism was still not as high as in June , following the death of insurgent leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
Perceptions about the situation remain highly divided along partisan lines : most Republicans continue to believe that the U.S. will probably or definitely succeed ( 76 % say this ) , and most also think the war is going at least “ fairly well ” ( 72 % ) .
A small majority of Democrats believe that the U.S will probably or definitely fail in Iraq ( 53 % ) , and a much larger majority believes the war is not going well ( 67 % ) .
Independents are much closer to Democrats in these perceptions than they are to Republicans ; among independents , 48 % say we are likely to fail in Iraq , and 52 % think the war is not going well .
With terrorism , the 9/11 anniversary and other stories drawing extensive press coverage , public interest in news from Iraq has fallen somewhat over the past month .
A third of Americans say they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely , down from 41 % in August and the lowest level of interest since the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina about a year ago .
Nonetheless , an increasing number of Americans – especially Democrats – view the war in Iraq as the most important problem facing the nation .
What to Do Now ?
Public attitudes about what should be done in Iraq remain evenly divided and highly polarized along partisan lines .
The public splits evenly on the general question of whether to withdraw troops as soon as possible or the keep troops in Iraq until the situation is stable ( 47 % each ) , and is nearly evenly divided on whether the U.S. should set a timetable for when troops will be withdrawn from Iraq ( 47 % in favor of a timetable , 45 % against ) .
As has been true since late in 2003 , most Republicans favor maintaining U.S. troops in Iraq until the situation is stabilized , while most Democrats support bringing the troops home as soon as possible .
But the ideological divisions within the Republican Party remain somewhat larger than those in the Democratic Party .
Nearly eight - in - ten conservative Republicans ( 79 % ) say the U.S. should keep troops in Iraq , but considerably fewer moderate and liberal Republicans agree ( 60 % ) .
Among liberal Democrats , 68 % favor a troop withdrawal and nearly as many conservative and moderate Democrats take this position as well ( 64 % ) .
Independents are much closer to Democrats than to Republicans on both the question of what to do with the troops and whether to set a timetable for withdrawal .
Reflecting public sentiment over the war , voters are divided over whether differing approaches to Iraq would make them more likely to support or oppose a congressional candidate .
Of three possible options tested , support for setting a timetable for the removal of U.S. forces has the greatest potential upside ; 31 % of voters say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported this position , while 23 % say they would be more likely to vote against such a candidate .
Advocating a timetable for withdrawal is deeply divisive across partisan lines , however .
Democratic voters say such a position would make them more likely to support a candidate by a 43 % to 9 % margin , but Republicans express the opposite view , with 43 % more likely to vote against a “ pro-timetable ” candidate and just 16 % more likely to vote for someone taking such a position .
However , among independent voters , advocating a timetable for troop withdrawal is the only position of three tested that attracts more votes ( 35 % ) than it drives away ( 20 % ) .
Candidates who favor keeping U.S. troops in Iraq for as long as it takes to stabilize the situation face a mixed response from voters .
About a third of voters ( 32 % ) say this position would attract their vote , while 28 % say this would make them more likely to oppose such a candidate .
Again , partisanship is a powerful factor ; most Republican voters ( 57 % ) say this position draws them toward a candidate , and 41 % of Democrats say it would make them more likely to oppose such a candidate .
Independents are divided : 26 % would be more likely to vote for and 32 % to vote against a candidate who backed staying in Iraq for as long as it takes .
The idea of an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq is the least appealing option of the three tested .
Just 25 % of voters say they would be more likely to support a candidate who favors an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces , while 37 % say they would be more likely to vote against a candidate who advocated this policy .
The idea has broad appeal only among Democratic voters , and even here attracts the votes of only 40 % – slightly fewer than say they would back a candidate who favored a timetable for withdrawal .
Fifteen percent of Democrats say they would be more likely to oppose a candidate who backed an immediate withdrawal , as would 34 % of independents and 63 % of Republican voters .
Views of War Criticism
In addition to the debate between Republicans and Democrats about the war , there has also been a “ debate about the debate . ”
Speaking on NBC’s “ Meet the Press ” Sept. 10 , Vice President Dick Cheney said that debate about the war raises doubts among America ’s allies , and that suggestions that the U.S. withdraw “ validates the strategy of the terrorists . ”
The poll finds that more people think criticism of the handling of the war in Iraq helps America ’s enemies ( 36 % ) than believe it helps protect America ( 15 % ) ; but a 42 % plurality sees criticism as neither helping the country ’s enemies nor protecting the U.S .
More than half of Republicans ( 52 % ) believe that criticism of the handling of the war helps America ’s enemies , while just 24 % of Democrats agree .
Independents fall midway between Democrats and Republicans ( 37 % ) .
But even among Republicans there is a divide along Republican lines – 59 % of conservative Republicans see criticism of the war as a form of aid to America ’s enemies compared with just 39 % of moderate and liberal Republicans .
Older Americans are more apt than younger people to believe that war critics are helping America ’s enemies ; 44 % of those ages 65 and older feel this way , compared with just 29 % among those under age 30 .
Insurgency or Civil War ?
A growing number of people perceive the Iraqi conflict as more of a civil war than an insurgency directed against the U.S. and its allies .
In the current poll , 50 % say it is mostly a civil war between competing factions , while 37 % say it is mostly an insurgency .
The belief that the situation is largely a civil war has increased by eight percentage points since March , when the public was more divided on the question ( 42 % civil war , 45 % insurgency ) .
Unlike most attitudes and beliefs about the situation in Iraq , there are only modest partisan divides on this question ; Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to think the conflict is mostly a civil war .
Opinions about what the U.S. should now do in Iraq are unrelated to perceptions of whether the conflict is mostly a civil war or mostly an insurgency .
Iraq and the War on Terrorism
There is no public consensus about the Iraq war ’s impact on the effort to fight international terrorism .
President Bush has repeatedly argued that Iraq is a central front in the war on terrorism , while the president ’s critics say that Iraq has been a distraction from the larger struggle .
In the current poll , 45 % of the public says that the war in Iraq has hurt the war on terrorism , while 41 % say it has helped .
The public has been mostly divided on this question since the middle of 2004 , amid rising violence and the revelations about prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison .
Democratic and Republican opinions on this question are mirror images of one another : 69 % of Republicans say the effort in Iraq has helped the war on terrorism , while just 21 % say it has hurt ; among Democrats , 66 % say it has hurt and 22 % say it ’s helped .
More independents say it has hurt ( 50 % ) than helped ( 36 % ) .
War on Terror
As far as public views of the overall struggle against terrorism , just 39 % of Americans say that the United States is winning the war on terror , down from 52 % in September 2004 .
While the belief that the U.S. is prevailing in the struggle against terrorism has decreased among most major demographic and political groups , the decline has been especially sharp among moderate and liberal Republicans .
Just 50 % of moderate and liberal Republicans say the U.S. prevailing in this effort , down from 78 % two years ago .
Conservative Republicans , by
contrast , continue to overwhelmingly believe the U.S. is winning the war on terrorism ( 84 % then , 78 % today . )
In September 2004 , roughly half of independents ( 48 % ) said the U.S. was winning the war on terrorism ; currently , only about a third ( 34 % ) expresses this view .
Democrats also are far less likely to say that the U.S. is winning the war on terror .
Two years ago , conservative and moderate Democrats were split on this issue , with nearly as many saying the U.S. was winning as losing ( 36 % vs. 42 % ) .
Today , conservative and moderate Democrats , by greater than two - to - one , think the U.S. is losing ( 57 % - 24 % ) .
And the percentage of liberal Democrats who think the U.S. is winning the war on terror also has declined markedly over the past two years ( from 31 % to 12 % ) .
Warrantless Wiretaps Still Favored
A majority of Americans ( 54 % ) continue to say it is generally right for the government to monitor the telephone and email communications of Americans suspected of having ties with terrorists without first obtaining court permission .
Opinion on this issue has been stable since February , when an identical majority felt the government ’s warrantless surveillance of suspected terrorists was generally acceptable .
Roughly twice as many whites as African Americans take a positive view of the government eavesdropping on suspected terrorists ’ communications without court permission ( 58 % vs. 28 % ) .
More people under age 30 than older Americans express reservations about the program .
Republicans overwhelmingly believe it is appropriate for the government to use such means to access calls and emails from Americans suspected of having ties with terrorists .
A narrow majority of independents ( 52 % ) agree , while Democrats are somewhat divided .
By about two - to - one ( 66 % - 32 % ) , liberal Democrats feel it is generally wrong for the government to monitor the communications of suspected terrorists without court permission .
Conservative and moderate Democrats are more evenly divided ( 44 % generally right , 51 % generally wrong ) .
Civil Liberties
Half of Americans feel it is not necessary for the average person to sacrifice some civil liberties in the effort to curb terrorism in the U.S. , while 43 % think it is necessary .
Opinion about this issue has fluctuated since the 9/11 attacks .
In the months after the attacks , majorities felt it was necessary for average citizens to give up some liberties to combat terrorism .
But by July 2004 , the number expressing that opinion had fallen to 38 % .
Over the last two years , there has been an uptick in the percentage saying it is necessary for citizens to forego some liberties in the struggle against terrorism .
This view has increased modestly among most major demographic and political groups .
There continue to be significant partisan differences in whether it is necessary for average Americans to sacrifice some liberties in the war on terror ; a solid majority of Republicans ( 56 % ) say such sacrifices are necessary , compared with 41 % of independents and 36 % of Democrats .
Iran Negotiations Favored
An increasing number of Americans say they are hearing a lot about the dispute over Iran ’s nuclear program ; 41 % say that now , compared with 32 % in February .
The public ’s preference continues to be for the United Nations – not the United States – to take the lead in dealing with Iran ’s nuclear program .
Fully 70 % favor the U.N. taking a lead role , which is comparable to the number expressing that opinion in May ( 72 % ) and February ( 78 % ) .
Americans also remain more concerned that we will wait too long to take action in dealing with Iran ’s nuclear program , rather than acting too quickly .
A narrow majority ( 51 % ) says the greater concern is that we will wait too long before dealing with this issue , which is largely unchanged from earlier this year .
Notably , the public is amenable to the idea of direct negotiations with Iran over the issue of its nuclear program .
A 54 % majority favors such negotiations , while 32 % are opposed .
Among those who say they have heard a lot about Iran ’s nuclear program , an even larger majority ( 64 % ) favors direct negotiations with Tehran .
Republicans are a bit more supportive of direct talks with Iran than are Democrats .
Six - in - ten Republicans say they favor the U.S. negotiating directly with Iran over the issue of its nuclear program ; somewhat fewer Democrats agree ( 51 % ) .
September News Interest
The situation in Iraq once again was the month ’s most closely followed story , though significantly fewer Americans say they followed news from Iraq very closely than did so in August ( 33 % in September vs. 41 % in August ) .
This month , nearly as many people reported following news about the death of “ Crocodile Hunter ” Steve Irwin very closely as said they were tracking news about Iraq very closely .
Nearly three - in - ten Americans ( 27 % ) say they paid very close attention to reports on the upcoming fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks .
( This survey was in the field through Sept. 10 , before the actual commemoration of the anniversary ) .
News about Iran ’s nuclear program continues to draw fairly modest public interest ; 23 % paid very close attention to news on this issue , little change from earlier this year .
Just 18 % of Americans say they very closely followed President Bush ’s announcement that 14 terrorist suspects , previously held in secret , will be tried in military tribunals .
Political news also is not finding much of an audience ; 16 % say they are paying very close attention to news about candidates and election campaigns in their state and district .
However , this is on par with campaign news interest at a comparable point in past midterm elections .
In September 2002 , for instance , 17 % said they were following state and district campaign news very closely , and the figure was only slightly higher in September 1994 ( 19 % ) .

One thing I always hate to do is to find the best Antivirus program that will protect my computer .
The two best paid versions that I have always heard about are Kaspersky and NOD32 .
For free software , I always look towards Avast or AVG .
Of course , that is what I knew before but it looks like there may be some new people climbing the ladder .
Virus.gr tested quite a few different software companies to see how they would stack up against each other .
How did the 147,000 + virus test pan out ?
Here are the results ( the ones in bold are the ones I expected to do good ) :
1. Kaspersky version 6.0.0.303 – 99.62 %
2. Active Virus Shield by AOL version 6.0.0.299 – 99.62 %
3. F- Secure 2006 version 6.12.90 – 96.86 %
4. BitDefender Professional version 9 – 96.63 %
5. CyberScrub version 1.0 – 95.98 %
6. eScan version 8.0.671.1 – 95.82 %
7. BitDefender freeware version 8.0.202 – 95.57 %
8. BullGuard version 6.1 – 95.57 %
9. AntiVir Premium version 7.01.01.02 – 95.45 %
10 . Nod32 version 2.51.30 – 95.14 %
11 . AntiVir Classic version 7.01.01.02 – 94.26 %
12 . ViruScape 2006 version 1.02.0935.0137 – 93.87 %
13 . McAfee version 10.0.27 – 93.03 %
14 . McAfee Enterprise version 8.0.0 – 91.76 %
15 . F - Prot version 6.0.4.3 beta – 87.88 %
16 . Avast Professional version 4.7.871 – 87.46 %
17 . Avast freeware version 4.7.871 – 87.46 %
18 . Dr. Web version 4.33.2 – 86.03 %
19 . Norman version 5.90.23 – 85.65 %
20 . F - Prot version 3.16 f – 85.14 %
21 . ArcaVir 2006 – 83.44 %
22 . Norton Professional 2006 – 83.18 %
23 . AVG Professional version 7.1.405 – 82.82 %
24 . AVG freeware version 7.1.405 – 82.82 %
25 . Panda 2007 version 2.00.01 – 82.23 %
26 . Virus Chaser version 5.0a – 81.47 %
27 . PC - Cillin 2006 version 14.10.1051 – 80.90 %
28 . VBA32 version 3.11.0 – 79.12 %
29 . ViRobot Expert version 4.0 – 76.22 %
30 . UNA version 1.83 – 75.44 %
There ’s the list and as you can see there are several towards the top that really shocked me .
The one I am most happy about is the Active Virus Shield by AOL because it is offered to the public for free .
Sure it branded as AOL but underneath it is all Kaspersky and this goes to show it .
I expected NOD32 , Avast , and AVG to perform a little better than they did but NOD32 and AVG definitely fought back at the heuristic testing .
Heuristic testing is extremely important because that is what gives an Antivirus the ability to catch a virus even it is not in the database .
Here are the top 10 from that list :
1. Nod32 2.51.30 – 41503
2. Vba32 3.11.0 – 32911
3. VirIT 6.1.9 – 16469
4. AVG 7.1.405 Professional – 13624
5. AVG 7.1.405 freeware – 13624
6. Rising AV 18.41.30 – 12214
7. McAfee 10.0.27 – 10708
8. Ikarus 5.19 – 7191
9. F - Prot 6.0.4.3 beta – 6247
10 . Ukrainian National Antivirus 1.83 – 5506
One thing is for sure and that is Norton needs some work for as much as it costs .
So many people rely on Symantec ’s software because that is what comes installed on most computers but it obviously wo n’t provide the protection that is needed .
I fix computers for people all of the time and when I find that their Antivirus subscriptions have expired I normally install Avast .
After seeing these tests it definitely makes me ponder using Active Virus Shield by AOL because of the high ranking .
Avast does have the Web Shield which stops malicious attacks through your Web browser and I really like that feature .
I wonder what is more important , the overall ability to find a virus or being able to block Web attacks ?

How often have you rebooted your TV set in the past year ?
Probably a lot less than you have rebooted your computer .
Of course there are many “ reasons ” for this , but increasingly , nontechnical users do n’t want to hear them .
They just want their computer to work perfectly all the time and never crash .
MINIX 3 is a project to develop an operating system as reliable as a TV set , for embedded systems and mission critical applications , but also for future $ 50 single - chip laptops and general desktop use .
The focus is being small , simple , and reliable .
Note :
This is the last entry for the Alternative OS Contest .
History
MINIX 3 has a bright future but somewhat checkered past .
The first version , MINIX 1 , was released in 1987 and was the first UNIX clone with all the source code available .
It developed rapidly and soon had its own USENET newsgroup ( comp.os.minix ) , with 40,000 subscribers within 3 months , a large number at a time when the Internet was only available to university researchers and students .
One of the early MINIX adopters was a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds ,
who went out and bought a PC just to run MINIX , studied it very carefully , and then decided to write his own operating system , inspired by MINIX .
Although Linus knew MINIX very well , he did n’t steal any code from it , as some people
have alleged .
Linus system grew into the modern Linux system .
MINIX ’ author , Andrew Tanenbaum and Torvalds have had some fairly public discussions on operating system design , originally in 1992
and most recently in 2006 .
Rebirth
Although MINIX was ( and still is ) widely used used for teaching
operating systems courses at universities , it got a new impetus in 2005
when Tanenbaum assembled a new team of people to completely redo it as
a highly reliable system .
MINIX 3 has some history with MINIX 1 and MINIX 2
( released in 1997 as a POSIX - conformant OS ) , but it is really a new system
( analogous to the relationship between Windows XP and Windows 3.1 ) .
Various studies have shown that software broadly contains something like
6 -16 bugs per 1000 lines of code and that device drivers have 3 - 7 times as
many bugs as the rest of the operating system .
When combined with the
fact that 70 % of a typical operating system consists of device drivers ,
it is clear that device drivers are a big source of trouble .
For Windows XP ,
85 % of the crashes are do to bugs in device drivers .
Obviously ,
to make OSes reliable , something has to be done to deal
with buggy device drivers .
Building a reliable system despite the inevitable
bugs in device drivers was the original driving force behind MINIX 3 .
Design
The approach that MINIX 3 uses to achieve high reliability is fault
isolation .
In particular , unlike traditional OSes , where all
the code is linked into a single huge binary running in kernel mode , in
MINIX 3 , only a tiny bit of code runs in kernel mode–about 4000 lines in all .
This code handles interrupts , process scheduling , and interprocess
communication .
The rest of the operating system runs as a collection of
user - mode processes , each one encapsulated by the MMU hardware and none of
them running as superuser .
One of these processes , dubbed the
reincarnation server , keeps tabs on all the others and when one of
them begins acting sick or crashes , it automatically replaces it by a fresh
version .
Since many bugs are transient , triggered by unusual timing , in most
cases , restarting the faulty component solves the problem and allows the
system to repair itself without a reboot and without the user even noticing it .
This property is called self healing , and traditional systems do not have it .
The structure of MINIX 3 is shown in Fig. 1 .
It is constructed as a series of
layers .
At the bottom , running in kernel mode , is a microkernel , consisting
of about 3000 lines of C and 800 lines of assembler .
Above that comes a layer
of device drivers , with each driver in a separate user - mode process to ease
in replacing it should it fail .
Then come the servers , which form the core
of the operating system .
These include the reincarnation server mentioned
above , the file server , the process manager , and others , including the
X server , the data store , and various others .
Finally , on top of that come
the user processes .
Although internally , MINIX 3 is completely different
from other UNIX systems , it supports the standard POSIX interface to
applications , so normal UNIX software can be ported fairly easily .
Fig .
1 . The MINIX 3 architecture
The components communicate by passing fixed - length messages .
For example ,
a user process requests file I/O send sending a message to the file server ,
which then checks its cache and if the needed block is not present , sends a
message to the disk driver process to go get the block .
While sending a
message adds a little bit of overhead ( about 500 nsec on a 3 - GHz Pentium 4 ) ,
the system is still quite responsive .
For example , a complete system build ,
which requires over 120 compilations , takes well under 10 sec .
User View
From the user ’s point of view , MINIX 3 looks like UNIX , except less bloated .
It comes with the X Window System and over 400 standard UNIX programs , including :
Shells : ash , bash , pdksh , rsh
Editors : emacs , nvi , vim , elvis , elle , mined , sed , ed , ex
Language tools : cc , gcc , g++ , bison , flex , perl , python , yacc
Programming tools : cdiff , make , patch , tar , touch
Networking : ssh , telnet , ftp , lynx , mail , rlogin , wget , pine
File utilities : cat , cp , bzip2 , compress , mv , dd , uue , GNU utilities
Text utilities : grep , head , paste , prep , sort , spell , tail
Administration : adduser , cron , fdisk , mknod , mount , cvs , rcs
Games : dungeon , nethack
Currently the user interface is just X , but someday a GUI may be added if a suitable lightweight GUI can be
found .
Here are some
screen shots .
Availability
MINIX 3 is open source software , under the
BSD license .
It has its own Website
from which the a bootable CD - ROM image containing all the sources and binaries
can be downloaded .
To install it , just boot the CD - ROM , login as root , and
type : setup .
Installation takes about 10 minutes .
After installation ,
a large number of packages can be installed from the CD - ROM or the Website by
just typing : packman to select the choices .
Currently MINIX 3 runs on x86
hardware , but ports to the PowerPC and Xscale are underway .
It also runs fine on
virtual machines such as VMware and
Xen .
Since MINIX 3 went public in late 2005 , the Website has had over 300,000 unique visitors and the CD - ROM image has been downloaded some 75,000 times .
Currently , the site is getting over 1000 visitors a day .
There is an active Google USENET newsgroup , comp.os.minix , where people ask and answer questions , post
new software , and discuss MINIX 3 .
MINIX 3 is a community effort and your help is most welcome .
Go get the system , try it out , and join the future .
SEC Suspends Trading Of 35 Companies Touted In Spam Email Campaigns
Investor Protection Agency Unveils " Operation Spamalot "
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007 - 34
Washington , D.C. , March 8 , 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission this morning suspended trading in the securities of 35 companies that have been the subject of recent and repeated spam email campaigns ( see examples ) .
The trading suspensions - the most ever aimed at spammed companies - were ordered because of questions regarding the adequacy and accuracy of information about the companies .
The trading suspensions are part of a stepped - up SEC effort - code named " Operation Spamalot " - to protect investors from potentially fraudulent spam email hyping small company stocks with phrases like , " Ready to Explode , " " Ride the Bull , " and " Fast Money . "
It 's estimated that 100 million of these spam messages are sent every week , triggering dramatic spikes in share price and trading volume before the spamming stops and investors lose their money .
" When spam clogs our mailboxes , it 's annoying .
When it rips off investors , it 's illegal and destructive , " said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox .
" Today 's trading suspensions , and actions that will follow , should send a clear message to spammers : the SEC will hold you accountable . "
Linda Chatman Thomsen , Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division , said , " Many of these companies are no doubt familiar to anyone who reads their email , because each has been the subject of a spam email campaign .
While the Commission cautions investors not to make investment decisions based on anonymous emails they receive , we are also committed to tracking down those who prey on investors with false or misleading information . "
Mark K. Schonfeld , Director of the Commission 's Northeast Regional Office , said , " By halting trading in these stocks we are seeking to protect investors from further harm .
But this is only the first step .
Our investigation of the perpetrators - the people behind this misconduct - is continuing . "
The securities of each of the 35 companies have been quoted on the Pink Sheets quotations service .
Recent trading clearly demonstrates how spam campaigns can affect stock prices and trading volume .
For example :
On Friday , Dec. 15 , 2006 , shares in Apparel Manufacturing Associates , Inc. ( APPM ) closed at $.06 , with a trading volume of 3,500 shares .
After a weekend spam campaign distributed emails proclaiming , " Huge news expected out on APPM , get in before the wire , We 're taking it all the way to $ 1.00 , " trading volume on Monday , Dec. 18 , 2006 , hit 484,568 shares with the price spiking to over 19 cents a share .
Two days later the price climbed to $ .45 .
By Dec. 27 , 2006 , the price was back down to $.10 on trading volume of 65,350 shares .
On Dec. 19 , 2006 , trading in Goldmark Industries , Inc. ( GDKI ) , closed at $ .17 on trading volume of 126,286 shares .
On Dec. 20 , 2006 , the spam campaign started , with e-mail proclaiming " GDKI IS MAKING EVERYONE BANK ! , " and setting a 5 - day price target of $ 2 .
By Dec. 28 , 2006 , spam emails boasted of the price spike that had already been achieved -- " $.28 ( Up 152 % in 2 days ! ! ! ) " -- and promised a 5 - day price target of $ 1 .
That same day , GDKI closed at $ .35 on a volume of more than 5 million shares .
By January 9 , 2007 , the closing share price was back down to $ .15 .
A spam campaign in Healtheuniverse , Inc. ( HLUN ) stock began on Sept. 4 , 2006 , with emails incorporating a Healtheuniverse press release proclaiming that HLUN was " focused on being the first to commercialize stem cell applications in the $ 15 billion worldwide plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery market . "
On Sept. 7 , 2006 , HLUN closed at $ .12 per share on trading volume of 3,000 shares .
The spam campaign accelerated , and HLUN shares spiked to $ .22 per share on Sept. 11 , 2006 , with over 2.2 million shares trading hands .
By Sept. 22 , 2006 , the closing price had dropped back down to $ .11 .
The trading suspensions will last for ten business days .
The trading suspensions commenced today at 9:30 a.m. , EDT , and terminate at 11:59 p.m. , EDT , on March 21 , 2007 .
The 35 companies whose trading was suspended today are : Advanced Powerline Technologies Inc. ( APWL ) , America Asia Petroleum Corp . ( AAPM ) , Amerossi Int'l Group , Inc. ( AMSN ) , Apparel Manufacturing Associates , Inc. ( APPM ) , Asgard Holdings Inc. ( AGHG ) , Biogenerics Ltd. ( BIGN ) , China Gold Corp . ( CGDC ) , CTR Investments & Consulting , Inc. ( CIVX ) , DC Brands International , Inc. ( DCBI ) , Equal Trading , Inc. ( EQTD ) , Equitable Mining Corp. ( EQBM ) , Espion International , Inc. ( EPLJ ) , Goldmark Industries , Inc. ( GDKI ) , GroFeed Inc. ( GFDI ) , Healtheuniverse , Inc. ( HLUN ) , Interlink Global Corp . ( ILKG ) , Investigative Services Agencies , Inc. ( IVAY ) , iPackets International , Inc. ( IPKL ) , Koko Petroleum Inc. ( KKPT ) , Leatt Corporation ( LEAT ) , LOM Logistics , Inc. ( LOMJ ) , Modern Energy Corp . ( MODR ) , National Healthcare Logistics , Inc. ( NHLG ) , Presidents Financial Corp . ( PZFC ) , Red Truck Entertainment Inc. ( RTRK ) , Relay Capital Corp. ( RLYC ) , Rodedawg International Industries , Inc. ( RWGI ) , Rouchon Industries , Inc. ( RCHN ) , Software Effective Solutions Corp . ( SFWJ ) , Solucorp Industries Ltd. ( SLUP ) , Sports - stuff.com Inc. ( SSUF ) , UBA Technology , Inc. ( UBTG ) , Wataire Industries Inc. ( WTAF ) , WayPoint Biomedical Holdings , Inc. ( WYPH ) , and Wineco Productions Inc. ( WNCP ) .
The 35 suspensions concern companies that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 .
Not listed on any exchange , or on the OTC Bulletin Board , the companies ' securities have been quoted on the Pink Sheets quotation service on an unsolicited basis , meaning that the brokers posting quotations for the purchase and sale of the securities are not required to conduct due diligence regarding the issuers .
The Commission cautions broker - dealers , shareholders , and prospective purchasers that they should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently available information and any information subsequently issued by the companies .
Further , broker - dealers should be alert to the fact that , pursuant to Rule 15c2 - 11 under the Exchange Act , at the termination of the trading suspensions , no quotation may be entered unless and until they have strictly complied with all of the provisions of the rule .
If any broker - dealer enters any quotation that is in violation of the rule , the Commission will consider the need for prompt enforcement action .
The Commission 's Office of Investor Education and Assistance has information for investors and members of the general public on topics directly related to this action .
See http://www.sec.gov/investor/35tradingsuspensions.htm.
Any broker - dealer , investor , or other person with information relating to this matter is invited to email the Securities and Exchange Commission at 35suspensions@sec.gov .
The Commission appreciates the assistance and cooperation of the National Association of Securities Dealers , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , the British Columbia Securities Commission , and the Ontario Securities Commission .

Democrats think preexisting conditions will once again carry them to electoral victory .
Despite their own liabilities and callousness on the issue , they ’re probably right .
In 2018 , Democrats accused Republicans of wanting to deny health care to the sick .
Exhibit A , they said , was the GOP ’s attempt to repeal ObamaCare ’s popular preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions .
The accusation worked .
Democrats flipped a net 41 House seats to take control of the chamber .
Conventional wisdom considers the outcome to be proof that ObamaCare is ( finally ) popular with voters .
In 2020 , Democrats are deploying the same strategy .
A meritless yet somewhat successful Republican‐​led legal challenge to ObamaCare now sits before the Supreme Court .
Oral arguments will occur mere days after the election and mere days after the GOP replaces the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a jurist who is unlikely to approach ObamaCare with the same reverence Ginsburg did : 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett .
This confluence of events again enables Democrats to accuse Republicans of wanting to deny care to the sick by eliminating ObamaCare ’s popular preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions .
There are several problems with this line of attack , however .
Congressional Republicans did n’t try to repeal ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions .
I wish they had .
But even the Congressional Budget Office acknowledged the “ repeal ” bill House Republicans introduced in 2017 would not have repealed those provisions :
Insurers would still be required to provide coverage to any applicant , would not be able to vary premiums to reflect enrollees ’ health status or to limit coverage of preexisting medical conditions , and would be limited in how premiums could vary by age .
Nor would the Senate bill have done so .
Senate Republicans could have repealed those provisions with just 51 votes , but they never even tried .
The closest thing they came to repealing them was Sen .
Ted Cruz ’s ( R - TX ) “ freedom option , ” which would have made those provisions optional .
But Senate Republican leaders gutted that proposal , ensuring their bill would preserve those provisions .
In fairness , the GOP‐​led lawsuit now before the Supreme Court does try to eliminate those provisions .
Yet while their strategy is accurate this time around , Democrats never seem to mention …
ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions deny care to the sick .
ObamaCare ’s architects know what most ObamaCare supporters do n’t : the preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions create incentives for insurers to deny care to the sick .
We know the architects knew this knew because they included other provisions in the law — most notably , the risk ‐ ​adjustment program — that exist solely to counteract the perverse incentives that the preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions create .
Anecdotal evidence and empirical studies show those other provisions are not working .
ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions are making coverage worse for patients with multiple sclerosis and other expensive conditions .
They are denying care , for example , to seven‐ ​year‐ ​old leukemia patient Colette Briggs .
( Watch this Cato Institute forum on Colette ’s case . )
A coalition of 150 patient groups complains this dynamic “ completely undermines the goal of the ACA . ”
Well , at least ObamaCare does n’t deny coverage to the sick , right ?
Except …
ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions deny coverage to the sick .
Something else ObamaCare ’s architects know but that most ObamaCare supporters do n’t : the law ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions deny coverage to patients with preexisting conditions — like Jeanne Balvin — by prohibiting them from purchasing coverage for 10 months out of the year .
ObamaCare generally prohibits purchasing coverage outside a brief “ open ” enrollment window at the end of each year .
That prohibition exists specifically to deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions .
When ObamaCare supporters claim that letting consumers choose their health plan leads to benefit limits and denials of coverage for preexisting conditions , they never mention that ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions deny coverage for preexisting conditions for 10 months out of the year — which is an effective benefit limit of $ 0 .
Well , those provisions may have drawbacks .
But voters like them , right ?
About that …
ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions are not popular .
Nor have they ever been .
Those provisions are popular only in a fantasy world where they have no costs .
When voters learn that ObamaCare ’s preexisting ‐ ​conditions provisions are reducing the quality of coverage available for the sick , they oppose those provisions 51 percent to 44 percent .
Among Democrats , support drops by 30 percent .
There ’s also evidence that ObamaCare ’s general prohibition on purchasing and switching health plans throughout the year is unpopular .
The Foundation for Government Accountability found 83 percent of Exchange enrollees — including 78 percent of Democrats — want to restore that freedom .
“ Yes , but , ” Democrats might say , “ We are trying to preserve the coverage people have .
Republicans are trying to take coverage away from the sick ! ” Maybe .
But they ’re not the only ones …
Democrats are literally stripping sick people of their health coverage and leaving them with no insurance .
Democrats ( and their allies in the insurance industry ) are so obsessed with blocking consumers from accessing the protections available through “ short‐​term ” health insurance that they are literally stripping coverage from patients after they get sick and leaving them with no coverage for up to 12 months .
Congress exempts short‐​term plans from ObamaCare ’s regulations , which enables them to offer broader networks and premiums that are often 70 percent less than ObamaCare plans ; to cover as much or as little of ObamaCare ’s standard benefits package as consumers want ; and to protect patients from expensive medical bills during ObamaCare ’s closed ‐​enrollment period .
Short‐​term plans also reduce the number of uninsured .
Democrats are so obsessed with denying consumers ’ right to choose their health plans that in 2016 the Obama administration arbitrarily limited short‐​term plans to just three months in duration .
State insurance regulators had warned the move would strip sick patients of their coverage and leave them with zero protection .
They were right : the Obama rule stripped 61 ‐ ​year ‐ ​old Arizona resident Jeanne Balvin of her health insurance after she developed diverticulitis , leaving her with no insurance and $ 97,000 in unpaid medical charges .
The Trump administration rescinded the Obama rule .
It decreed that short‐​term plans may last up to 36 months and that insurers can offer renewal guarantees that provide even greater protection .
After hearing Democrats ’ best criticisms , voters still support this approach 59 percent to 35 percent .
Yet Democrats ( and their allies in the insurance industry ) are continuing their campaign to throw sick patients out of their health insurance .
Insurers that sell ObamaCare plans have filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the Trump rule .
The insurers even admitted to federal courts that they want to throw sick patients out of their coverage to improve their own bottom lines .
Democrats have embraced this lawsuit .
Federal courts have uniformly rejected the insurers ’ pleas ( so far ) .
House and Senate Democrats are seeking to throw sick patients out of their short‐​term plans via legislation .
Democrats have successfully enacted legislation to throw sick patients out of their short‐​term plans in 19 states and the District of Columbia .
In five states , Democrats have completely denied consumers the protections that short‐​term plans offer against ObamaCare ’s “ closed enrollment ” period by banning these products outright .
The moral of the story is : neither party is worth emulating here .
On preexisting conditions , President Trump has hardly been a paragon of honesty .
Or consistency .
Or clarity .
Or empathy .
But we can say two things in Republicans ’ favor .
First , the Trump administration has helped to reduce the problem of preexisting conditions by allowing short‐​term plans to provide affordable , secure , renewable term health insurance .
Second , getting rid of ObamaCare would not throw a single person out of their health coverage because if someone ’s coverage depends on a government regulation or subsidy , then it is n’t really theirs in the first place .
So far as I can tell , Democrats are the only ones throwing people out of health insurance that the consumer chose and purchased and likes .
Democrats enjoy cancelling other people ’s health insurance coverage so much , it ’s creepy .
They did it when they passed ObamaCare .
They ’re doing it again now with short‐​term plans .
They ’re really quite callous and cavalier about it .
Sanctimonious , even .
And yet , even though all available polling shows Republicans have a more powerful counterattack , the Democrats ’ strategy of attacking Republicans on preexisting conditions is likely to work in 2020 just as it did in 2018 .
In all likelihood , Democrats will convince voters to punish Republicans for fantasizing about doing what Democrats actually do .
It will work because Republicans have their own brand of callousness : they just ca n’t bring themselves to care about health care .
Death of a President will be shown on More4 on Monday
Death of a President , which shows Mr Bush being shot dead , secured a US distribution deal last month .
A third major chain said it was unsure whether to show the mock documentary , which is due to open on 27 October .
The film , which has raised protests from conservatives in the US , will be shown on UK TV channel More4 on Monday .
Support
Regal Entertainment Group , which has more than 6,300 screens in 40 US states , said it would not show the film because of its subject matter .
Spokesman Dick Westerling said : " We do not feel it is appropriate to portray the future assassination of a president , therefore we do not intend to programme this film at any of our theatres . "
Mr Westerling said Regal had received " numerous phone calls and e-mails " supporting the company .
Even if the film became a hit in other venues , Regal would stand by its decision , he added .
Cinemark USA , which operates about 2,500 screens in 34 states , told trade newspaper The Hollywood Reporter it would not screen the film .
A spokeswoman for AMC Entertainment , which runs 5,600 screens , told Reuters news agency her company had yet to make a decision .
Archive footage
Richard Abramowitz , consultant for US distributor Newmarket Films , said the film had been booked to be screened in more than 100 venues .
Death of a President , funded by Channel 4 , shows Mr Bush being targeted by a sniper during an anti-war rally in Chicago in 2007 .
He is confronted by a demonstration when he arrives in the city to deliver a speech to business leaders and is shot as he leaves the venue .
Director Gabriel Range , who also co-wrote the film , uses archive footage of Mr Bush to create the scenes that lead up to the president being shot .
Digital effects are used to superimpose his head onto an actor for the assassination scene .
The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September .

Starbucks logo changes again .
You are probably here because you looked closely at the Starbucks logo and were a little confused about what is depicted on it .
Is it a mermaid ?
What are those things that she is holding up with her hands ?
Was n’t the logo different before ?
What ’s the history of it ?
I asked those questions myself and did a little bit of digging .
My research started with a book that I had , called A Dictionary of Symbols by J.E. Cirlot .
In it there was a chapter about Sirens .
Basically , from what I gathered from different sources , including that book , there is a lot of confusion between the different mythological half - women .
Typically they are called Sirens – both the half - bird / half - woman and the half - fish / half - woman varieties .
The fish type are usually called Mermaids .
Both types according to the ancient Greeks were in the business of seducing mariners with songs and promises of sex and then killing them , but Hans Christian Andersen and Disney mostly made everybody forget that .
The whole sex - symbol status of mermaids hinges on the question which part is “ woman ” – upper or lower .
“ The other type of mermaid ” that hapless Fry was referring to would have problems attracting suitors , of course .
And how do you do it with the normal type ?
Wise mythologists came up with the answer , of course .
And the answer is a two - tailed mermaid sometimes called a Melusine .
The book had an old engraving of a two - tailed mermaid .
It reminded me of the Starbucks Siren , but back then I did not realize that the original Starbucks logo had a slightly altered version of that engraving in the original brown cigar band - shaped logo .
Notice that the graphic designer removed the belly button , the unattractive shading around the bulging tummy of the 15th century siren and merged the tail - legs to remove the suggestion of naughty bits .
The logo Siren also smiles a little while its 15th century doppelganger is looking rather grim .
Other than that it ’s clear that this is exactly the image that he or she was using .
According to uspto.gov “ [ Starbucks ] mark consists of the wording “ Starbucks Coffee ” in a circular seal with two stars , and the design of a siren ( a two - tailed mermaid ) wearing a crown ” .
Here ’s the “ cigar band ” logo from which I took the image above .
The original hippie Starbucks owners did not sell espresso drinks , but mostly sold coffee beans , tea and spices .
Today Starbucks sells liquor and ice cream , but no spices if you do n’t count the cinnamon gum and the stuff on the condiment table .
The next , more familiar green iteration of the logo has a more attractive stylized siren .
The chest is hidden , but the belly button is still there .
Here is the current logo .
They cropped the siren image so that only a hint of the tails is visible .
I asked hourly partners at Starbucks and friends , and none of them could figure out what those things to the side of Siren ’s head were .
Lately I ’ve stopped seeing pictures of the Siren on Starbucks mugs – they seem to favor just the word “ Starbucks ” .
I also started seeing the new type of the siren as part of store decoration and on coffee packaging .
She only has one tail .
I guess the family - unfriendly image of a fish - woman spreading her tails is on its way out .
[ update ]
Here ’s a picture of the new siren :
The brown Siren logo can still be found on merchandize sold at the original Pike Place Market Starbucks in Seattle .
The logo is altered though – instead of a “ cigar band ” design it uses just a circle logo .
Cigar band logo mugs and coffee jars can still be found on eBay for upwards of $ 50 per mug and $ 200 per coffee jar .
I am still looking for anything bearing an “ Il Giornale ” ( a company founded byHoward Schultz that later ended up buying out Starbucks with the help of none other than Bill Gates Sr. ) logo .
[ Update ]
Dear Boing Boing readers – you might enjoy other sections of this blog such as Gastronomic Adventures and 100 Views of the Empire State Building .
[ Update ]
I was alerted to another article that explores the Siren ’s symbolism .
I have n’t used it in my research , but it is very thorough .
[ Update ]
The whole logo history is described pretty well in Pour Your Heart into It : How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time .
The book is full of other Starbucks trivia : if I remember correctly , it states that Howard Schultz is a close friend of Yanni .
[ Update ]
I received some information from Doug Fast , the designer behind the green logo .
He also graciously sent me some rare examples of the logo , for which I am extremely thankful .
“ I am the guy who designed the green SBUX logo .
The original brown SBUX logo was designed in 1971 by my employer before I started working for him in January 1974 .
( I still work there as a designer )
The design company was then called Heckler / Bowker , here in Seattle .
Bowker ( the company copy writer ) was one of the three original founders of SBUX and left Heckler / Bowker in 1984 to take on SBUX full time .
( there were 5 - 6 stores at that time )
The other two founders were ; Jerry Baldwin and Zev Siegal .
Heckler / Bowker came up with the Starbucks name and Heckler came up with the first ( brown ) logo .
The other name strongly suggested was Pequod , but lost out to Starbucks .
The original SBUX store was NOT in the Public Market or in the Arcade as people think .
It was at the corner of Western Avenue & Virginia , just north , across the street from the Public Market at the foot of the steep hill going up to 1st Avenue , and opened it ’s doors in March 1971 .
I have a photo of it and also a drawing of it that was on an SBUX Christmas card from 1977 .
The first retail Starbucks coffee drink concept store was originally called Il Giornale , and located on 4th Avenue in downtown Seattle .
There was only one of these stores ever .
I designed the logo for that in 1985 - 86 , plus the coffee bag packaging , and still have the stationary , bags , and cup designs in my sample file .
Howard Schultz was still an employee of SBUX at that time , not the owner , as I ’ve seen said in previous blog info .
here .
The reason only ONE Il Giornale store ever existed was because of the purchase of SBUX by Howard and his investers , and because the SBUX name and logo had so much capital already , they changed Il Giornale back to SBUX and wanted a more reproducable SBUX design , to go national .
I did the green “ full siren ” logo with a stronger , simpler , read for reproduction .
The SBUX type was HAND DRAWN and based on the typeface , Franklin Gothic ( this was pre-computer , folks ) and had to be drawn so it bent well , around the circle .
We submitted the logo to Howard , one with a red color and one in a green color .
He picked the green color option .
In 1992 we had to blow up the siren to eliminate the spread , so called suggestive tails , so that ’s the version you see today .
I still have most of the original concept work for the creation of this logo in one of my big sketchbooks .
To me at the time , it was just another logo job to do .
Who would have thought I ’d be sick of seeing it all over the place .
It is n’t one of my best logos . ”
Original stores from the old coffee bag :
The original “ cigar band ” logo :
Il Giornale logo :
Green “ bellybutton ” logo
One of the newer coffee bags that reimagines the siren :
New “ cigar band ” logo with covered up nipples and cleaner lines :
New plastic stirrer / plug in the shape of the siren :
Old logo at one of the first ( from what I hear it ’s not the “ original ” location ) stores at the Pike Market in Seattle
Did reading this article inspire you to write a poem about Starbucks ?
You can use Rhymebuster , the algorithmic rap generator .
Turns out a lot of things rhyme with Starbucks ( other than sucks ) .
Do n’t believe BusinessWeek ’s bubble - math Jason 288 comments Latest by me
This week ’s BusinessWeek cover story features a beaming Kevin Rose from Digg .
Across his chest it says “ How this kid made $ 60 million in 18 months . ”
Wow , now that sounds like a great success story .
Too bad it ’s a blatant lie .
BusinessWeek knows it .
They prove it themselves in the article :
So far , Digg is breaking even on an estimated $ 3 million annually in revenues .
Nonetheless , people in the know say Digg is easily worth $ 200 million .
$ 3 million in revenues and they ’re breaking even .
That means no meaningful profits .
That ’s the first hint no one has made $ 60,000,000 .
Their gross revenues are n’t even anywhere close to that number .
And let ’s leave out the “ people in the know say it ’s easily worth ” fantasy numbers .
And certainly do n’t use those numbers to do the math that makes the cover ( we ’ll get to that in a minute ) .
It ’s one of those things where we know we could put crazy ads all over the site and clutter it up , but we do n’t want to do that , ” says Rose .
“ We have a clear path toward becoming a profitable company . ”
A clear path toward becoming a profitable company .
How does a path that you have n’t traveled yet get you $ 60,000,000 ?
The biggest investment they ’ve had was $ 2.5 million .
You ca n’t cash out $ 60,000,000 from $ 2,500,000 .
That could be a jackpot for Rose , who owns 30 % to 40 % of the company ( he wo n’t specify ) — a massive stake for a founder in a world in which investors routinely demand up to 20 % with every outlay .
But it ’s still only paper wealth , which he and many others have learned can evaporate .
“ I was here in 2000 , ” he recalls in an instant message .
Wait a second .
This $ 60,000,000 - on - the - cover figure came from multiplying the fictitious “ people in the know ” number of $ 200,000,000 by an estimated 30 % ownership ?
30 % of $ 200,000,000 is $ 60,000,000 .
Is that the math that made the number that made the cover ?
SLIPPERY .
And then Rose and BusinessWeek acknowledge it ’s “ only paper wealth ” and “ this could be a jackpot ” which means it ’s not real anyway .
So BusinessWeek is using fuzzy math to put a fuzzy number on the cover that is n’t real anyway ?
All together now : BULLSHIT !
Something my dad always tells me : “ No one ever went broke taking a profit . ”
Last time around plenty of people went broke by not taking a profit .
Paper wealth is not money .
Try bringing your brokerage statement to McDonald ’s and see if will buy you a burger .
And then there ’s this :
“ The barriers to entry are now so low that all it takes is a laptop and a $ 50 - a - month Internet hookup to make a kid the next mogul ”
So why are you writing about an 18 - month old company that took $ 2.5 million to be “ finally be flush with enough cash to pay salaries , rent an office , and keep employees in standard startup snacks like Twizzlers and Vitamin Water . ”
If BusinessWeek wants to say it only takes $ 50 and an internet connection to be the next mogul they may want to cite a valid example .
It ’s certainly possible , but Digg is n’t that example .
Now , this is n’t a dig at Digg or Kevin , it ’s a dig at shoddy journalism .
There are a lot of great things to say about Digg so pick something that ’s not true ?
Why lie in big yellow type on the cover ?
UPDATE : Scott Rosenberg , writer and editor and co-founder of Salon weighs in .
It ’s great to see someone in Scott ’s position calling BusinessWeek on this .
UPDATE …THIS JUST IN :
How 9rules founders made billions in 12 months .
AFTER a decade of painstaking research , federal and university scientists have reconstructed the 1918 influenza virus that killed 50 million people worldwide .
Like the flu viruses now raising alarm bells in Asia , the 1918 virus was a bird flu that jumped directly to humans , the scientists reported .
To shed light on how the virus evolved , the United States Department of Health and Human Services published the full genome of the 1918 influenza virus on the Internet in the GenBank database .
This is extremely foolish .
The genome is essentially the design of a weapon of mass destruction .
No responsible scientist would advocate publishing precise designs for an atomic bomb , and in two ways revealing the sequence for the flu virus is even more dangerous .
First , it would be easier to create and release this highly destructive virus from the genetic data than it would be to build and detonate an atomic bomb given only its design , as you do n't need rare raw materials like plutonium or enriched uranium .
Synthesizing the virus from scratch would be difficult , but far from impossible .
An easier approach would be to modify a conventional flu virus with the eight unique and now published genes of the 1918 killer virus .
Second , release of the virus would be far worse than an atomic bomb .
Analyses have shown that the detonation of an atomic bomb in an American city could kill as many as one million people .
Release of a highly communicable and deadly biological virus could kill tens of millions , with some estimates in the hundreds of millions .
Health Of Brazilian Rainforest Depends On Dust From One Valley In Africa
An eo image of dust travelling east from Africa .
A total of some 50 million tons of dust make their way from Africa to the Amazon region every year , a much higher figure than the previous estimates of 13 million tons .
The new estimate matches the calculations on the quantity of dust needed to supply the vital minerals for the continued existence of the Amazon rainforest .
by Staff Writers
Washington DC ( SPX ) Jan 04 , 2007
More than half of the dust needed for fertilizing the Brazilian rainforest is supplied by a valley in northern Chad , according to an international research team headed by Dr. Ilan Koren of the Institute 's Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department .
In a study published recently in Environmental Research Letters , the scientists have explained how the Bodele valley 's unique features might be responsible for making it such a major dust provider .
It has been known for more than a decade that the existence of the Amazon rainforest depends on a supply of minerals washed off by rain from the soil in the Sahara and blown across the Atlantic by dust .
By combining various types of satellite data , Dr. Koren and colleagues from Israel , the United Kingdom , the United States , and Brazil have now for the first time managed to obtain quantitative information about the weight of this dust .
Analyses of dust quantities were performed near the Bodele valley itself , on the shore of the Atlantic and at an additional spot above the ocean .
The data revealed that some 56 percent of the dust reaching the Amazon forest originates in the Bodele valley .
They also showed that a total of some 50 million tons of dust make their way from Africa to the Amazon region every year , a much higher figure than the previous estimates of 13 million tons .
The new estimate matches the calculations on the quantity of dust needed to supply the vital minerals for the continued existence of the Amazon rainforest .
The researchers suggest that the Bodele valley is such an important source of dust due to its shape and geographic features : it is flanked on both sides by enormous basalt mountain ridges , which create a cone - shaped crater with a narrow opening in the northeast .
Winds that " drain " into the valley focus on this funnel - like opening similarly to the way light is focused by an optical lens , creating a large wind tunnel of sorts .
As a result , gusts of surface wind that are accelerated and focused in the tunnel lift the dust from the ground and blow it toward the ocean , allowing the Bodele valley to export the vast amount of dust that makes a life - sustaining contribution to the Amazon rainforest .
Dr. Ilan Koren 's research is supported by the Samuel M. Soref and Helene K. Soref Foundation ; and the Sussman Family Center for the Study of Environmental Sciences .

River beds and dams have dried up
Rainfall in many eastern and southern regions has been at near record lows .
On top of that , the weather has been exceptionally warm .
The parched conditions have sparked an emotional debate about global warming .
Conservationists insist the " big dry " is almost certainly the result of climate change and warn that Australia is on the brink of environmental disaster .
Other experts believe such hysteria is wildly misplaced and that the country should n't panic .
' A war - like scenario '
The drought in Australia has lasted for more than five years .
The worry for some is that this could be the start of a protracted period of low rainfall that could go on for decades .
" The really scary thing is last time we had a drought of this intensity that lasted about five years - it lasted for about 50 years , " cautioned Professor Andy Pitman from Macquarie University in Sydney .
I can imagine Australia being a desert in a few decades ' time
Cate Faehrmann
" The politicians truly believe this is a five - year or six - year drought that will break sometime in 2007 or 2008 .
But it might not break until 2050 and we are n't thinking in those terms at this stage , " Professor Pitman told the BBC .
Global warming , the drought and the future of dwindling water supplies will undoubtedly dominate talk at barbeques and dinner parties this festive season in Australia .
" We 're in a state of emergency , " said Cate Faehrmann from the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales .
" We need to treat this as a war - like scenario .
The people are really worried that we are going to run out of water . "
She added : " I can imagine Australia being a desert in a few decades ' time in some of these agricultural areas .
The soil is blowing away , the rivers are drying up .
" I think there will be plots of land abandoned and perhaps whole agricultural practices abandoned . "
Massive losses
The drought has affected farmers worse than anyone else .
Jock Lawrie , president of the New South Wales Farmers ' Association , paints a dismal picture .
" There are people out in some parts of our state that have gone to work for four or five years and have n't even earned an income .
" With the winter crop failing to the extent it did , there have been some massive losses .
It is really hard on the emotions of people , there 's no doubt about that . "
Farmers have been hard hit by lack of rain and soaring temperatures
Australia has some of the world 's most erratic rainfall - patterns .
This vast continent has experienced very dry periods before : the " Federation Drought " of the late 1800s was a disaster for many communities .
However , some climate experts believe this drought will also pass and Australians should n't be too alarmed .
Veteran meteorologist Bill Kinimonth insists the gradual warming of the earth is part of a natural cycle : " The climate follows patterns which we can read back from our instrument records for about 150 years , and from a lot of the proxy records they go back thousands of years .
" The ice cores show the fluctuations of the climate over 100,000 - year cycles . "
He told the BBC News website : " We 're presently in what we might call the optimum period , where the Earth is warmer than it has been for the last 20,000 years , and I think we should be making the most of it .
" The alternative is not very good - a cold , dry Australia . "
The Australian Prime Minister John Howard , who refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol insisting it would damage the economy , now believes , however , that serious environmental trouble is brewing .
Professor Andy Pitman says the drought has forced politicians to look at the bigger picture .
" The Australian government has absolutely jumped on greenhouse bandwagon in the last three or four months , " he said .
" Although it wo n't sign Kyoto , it 's now saying it wants to lead the drive for greenhouse gas emissions globally in a very aggressive leadership way .
" That 's largely due to the drought and the Stern report . "
Most of us assume that all this additional diagnosis can only be beneficial .
And some of it is .
But at the extreme , the logic of early detection is absurd .
If more than half of us are sick , what does it mean to be normal ?
Many more of us harbor “ pre-disease ” than will ever get disease , and all of us are “ at risk . ”
The medicalization of everyday life is no less problematic .
Exactly what are we doing to our children when 40 percent of summer campers are on one or more chronic prescription medications ?
No one should take the process of making people into patients lightly .
There are real drawbacks .
Simply labeling people as diseased can make them feel anxious and vulnerable — a particular concern in children .
But the real problem with the epidemic of diagnoses is that it leads to an epidemic of treatments .
Not all treatments have important benefits , but almost all can have harms .
Sometimes the harms are known , but often the harms of new therapies take years to emerge — after many have been exposed .
For the severely ill , these harms generally pale relative to the potential benefits .
But for those experiencing mild symptoms , the harms become much more relevant .
And for the many labeled as having predisease or as being “ at risk ” but destined to remain healthy , treatment can only cause harm .
The epidemic of diagnoses has many causes .
More diagnoses mean more money for drug manufacturers , hospitals , physicians and disease advocacy groups .
Researchers , and even the disease - based organization of the National Institutes of Health , secure their stature ( and financing ) by promoting the detection of “ their ” disease .
Medico - legal concerns also drive the epidemic .
While failing to make a diagnosis can result in lawsuits , there are no corresponding penalties for overdiagnosis .
Thus , the path of least resistance for clinicians is to diagnose liberally — even when we wonder if doing so really helps our patients .
As more of us are being told we are sick , fewer of us are being told we are well .
People need to think hard about the benefits and risks of increased diagnosis : the fundamental question they face is whether or not to become a patient .
And doctors need to remember the value of reassuring people that they are not sick .
Perhaps someone should start monitoring a new health metric : the proportion of the population not requiring medical care .
And the National Institutes of Health could propose a new goal for medical researchers : reduce the need for medical services , not increase it .
This is what public outrage looks like .
These are the first 120,000 petitions collected against Disney / ABC at Democrats.org , and more are coming .
Understand that -- one hundred twenty thousand petitions collected so far asking Disney to pull the plug on their now widely criticized , lie - riddled $ 40 million piece of 9/11 conservative fan fiction .

It 's time for Disney to pull the plug .
It 's time for George Mitchell , who serves as Disney 's Chairman , to insist that they pull the work for retooling or burning -- or that he will resign in protest .
It 's time for ABC head Bob Iger to step up to the plate and recognize that putting up 9/11 neoconservative porn is not simply a one - week outrage : 9/11 is still a fresh wound , in our country , Disney / ABC fictionalizing it for profit and partisanship is not OK , and the public will remember this .
The discovery takes the number killed across Central America by Tropical Storm Stan to at least 230 .
Several days of heavy rain have finally begun to clear , but hillsides are still treacherous and rivers perilously high .
Guatemala has recorded about 120 dead , with fatalities also reported in El Salvador , Nicaragua , Mexico , Costa Rica and Honduras .
Guatemala 's civil protection agency said 40 bodies were recovered from a town on the edge of Santiago Atitlan .
The ground is saturated and we could have more tragedies
Salvadoran Red Cross spokesman
Are you affected by Stan ?
A spokesman would not comment on local media reports that hundreds of people might still be missing in the town , popular with Western visitors to the Mayan highlands .
" There are still a lot of people to be found , some 150 to 200 , " said Pedro Mendoza , a local taking part in rescue efforts .
" The landslide was Wednesday but because the roads are blocked , no one can get through to help us . "
City flooded
Guatemalan President Oscar Berger took to the clearing skies in a helicopter to see the devastation .
Tropical Storm Stan wreaks havoc across Central America .

With two other villages wiped out and flood waters up to two metres ( 6.5 ft ) high in Quetzaltenango , Guatemala 's second - most important city , he has asked Congress to declare a state of emergency .
In El Salvador , officials said nearly 54,000 people had been evacuated to 370 shelters throughout the country , despite difficulties in passing many of the country 's roads .
" The rain stopped , rays of sun have begun to warm the country , but the danger continues , " warned Salvadoran Red Cross spokesman Carlos Lopez Mendoza .
" The ground is saturated and we could have more tragedies . "
Mexico was also struck by the weather system , which has killed at least 10 people and caused at least 30 rivers to burst their banks .
The country is sending aid to El Salvador after a personal plea by Salvadoran President Tony Saca .
Mexican officials said the air force was preparing to deliver 200 metric tons of food and 30 metric tons of emergency supplies .
Stan briefly reached category one hurricane strength , slamming into Mexico on Tuesday with winds of 130 km /h ( 80 m ph ) , before fading quickly .
The damage has been done by the heavy rains that fell solidly over parts of the region for days , swelling rivers into torrents that have swept away houses , roads and trees .
Illegal drugs can be " harmless " and should no longer be " demonised " , a wide - ranging two - year study concluded today .
The report said Britain 's drug laws were " not fit for purpose " and should be torn up in favour of a system which recognised that drinking and smoking could cause more harm .
The RSA Commission on Illegal Drugs , set up in January 2005 , also called for the main focus of drugs education to be shifted from secondary to primary schools and recommended the introduction of so - called " shooting galleries " - rooms where users can inject drugs .
The report , compiled by a panel of academics , politicians , drugs workers , journalists and a senior police officer , also called for the Home Office to be stripped of its lead role in drugs policy .
It recommended the Misuse of Drugs Act be scrapped in favour of a wider - ranging Misuse of Substances Act , and the current ABC classification system be abandoned in favour of an " index of harms " .
Current laws , the panel claimed , were been " driven by moral panic " with large amounts of money wasted on " futile " efforts to stop supply rather than going after the criminal networks behind the drugs on British streets .
At the heart of the report was a call for an end to what the panel called the " criminal justice bias " of current policy in favour of an approach that would treat addiction as a health and social problem rather than simply a cause of crime .
The report , which aimed to influence a government review of drug strategy next year , also called for jail sentences to be given for only the most serious drugs - related crimes and for addicts to be given jobs and housing as part of treatment .
It also recommended wider access to treatment such as prescription heroin .
Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith , who is chair of the Conservative Social Justice Policy Group , described the report as " worryingly complacent " and accused the members of the commission of failing to do their homework .
" I find it most disappointing that the RSA report appears to endorse the failed harm reduction strategy of recent years and to ignore extensive evidence that residential rehab can lead to full recovery from drug addiction .
He said the RSA had not surveyed the views of drug addicts or looked at treatment programmes in such countries as Sweden and Holland , " where levels of drug abuse are much lower than the UK " .
But commission chairman Prof Anthony King of Essex University and : " Current policy is broke and needs to be fixed . "
The report , which is likely to spark fierce controversy , said : " The use of illegal drugs is by no means always harmful any more than alcohol use is always harmful .
It called for the concept of drugs to be extended to take in alcohol and tobacco .
" The evidence suggests that a majority of people who use drugs are able to use them without harming themselves or others .
They are able , in that sense , to ' manage ' their drug use ...
The harmless use of illegal drugs is thus possible , indeed common , " it said .
Describing the drugs trade as a business , the report said illegal drugs had been " demonised " by politicians and the media .
It said a lot of money was wasted trying to achieve the " impossible " goals of completely stopping the importation of illegal drugs , as well as the production , distribution and sale of illegal drugs within the UK .
Describing the Misuse of Drugs
Act as unwieldy and inflexible , the report says : " It sends people to prison who should not be there .
" It forces people into treatment who do not need it ( while , in effect , denying treatment to people who do need it ) . "
While the report does not call for decriminalisation , it questions the idea of total prohibition .
" Drugs policy should , like our policy on alcohol and tobacco , seek to regulate use and prevent harm rather than to prohibit use altogether , " the report concludes .

Single - handed wireless Xbox 360 controller Advertisement
By the way , if you 're wondering why the story pages of my site still look this this , and the main homepage is completely different , it 's because I redid the homepage back in September to save bandwidth when I had the Xbox 360 laptop story .
It did n't work anyway , so now I 've got a discombobulated site that I 've yet to fix .
Now that I 've cleared THAT up ...
Alright , yes , my new Xbox 360 controller .
Well I 've actually had requests like this before but it was n't until the most recent one that I actually did it .
( BTW keeping in good email contact with me helps ensure I consider you custom projects )
So I thought " This time I 'm gonna build the thing ! " and not put it off any more , like I have been with putting handles on my custom laptops .
( The next one does n't have one either , but the one after that will - I swear ! )
As with everything I build , this was designed in multiple 2D views using Abode Illustrator .
My trusty dial caliper comes in pretty handy as well .
I 've actually always wanted to build some helpful devices for people with disabilities , I know that sounds completely different than the stuff I usually do ( you know , like Xbox laptops and ghost documentaries ) but I see it as an interesting challenge .
Here was my chance !
First I bought and gutted an Xbox 360 wireless controller .
I shall take this opportunity to say that after the debacle of the bowling - ball sized Xbox 1 controller the new 360 model is possibly one of the best controllers ever .
WTG Microsoft !
FTW !
Strangely enough , the controller used security torx screws with a shaft in the middle .
( Security screws are the kind that are supposed to be hard to remove , like the ones in the public bathrooms that prevent you from taking apart the door while you take a dump )
This is odd because the screws on the 360 itself are normal .
So , as I did in a recent Engadget How - To , I simply Dremelled ( if that is n't a word it should be ) a slot in the middle of a cheap torx bit so it could fit over the shaft and remove the screw .
You can also break off the little shafts pretty easily with a thin flat - head screwdriver .
Front of the controller .
This is an older photo , for the final version I actually put in tact switches under the D - pad since they seem to work better than the original contacts after all this hacking .
Next I had to rearrange everything inside the controller .
This actually took me quite a while , I think I went with 3 revisions on the design .
Eventually I settled on manually reattaching all the buttons to the controller 's circuit board and then designing around that .
And yet MORE tact switches .
I sure love the things ...
I managed to get both rumble controllers on this thing because I did n't want to accidentally build a Sixaxis .
The right analog shoulder button has been moved down and flipped for use with the pinky finger .
The X Y B A triggers , along with right bumper , have been rewired with tact switches to the middle for actuation by the middle and ring fingers .
The left analog trigger and left bumper have not been moved .
It will take some getting used to but everything is within reach .
Pulling the right trigger with the pinky is n't that hard , though who knows after a marathon of Oblivion rat - killing what could happen .
The Ring of Light has n't been moved and still turns on the controller like always .
Here 's a better view of the front .
I cut the battery holder out of the original controller shell and wired it to the front of the unit .
Almost everything is put together with what I now like to call " thermal prototyping gel " - the compound formerly known as hot glue .
It looks kind of scattershot but I actually spent a lot of time getting this all to work .
I like to run movies and commentaries off my laptop when I do this stuff and in fact I recall getting through most of Battlestar Galactica season 1 during all this .
( In case you 're wondering , the movies I listened to the most during my ORIGINAL Atari 2600 hacking back in 2000 were The Good , The Bad and The Ugly and Star Trek 4 .
There , that 'll help you on Jeopardy )
One of the biggest challenges , at least in the brainstorming " how I am going to do this ? " phase was how to do the right analog stick .
Then I realized I could just put it on the bottom of the controller and reverse its wiring .
You do n't actually tilt the controller on the axis of the stick because that would be awkward .
( Believe me , I tried )
Instead you actually just move the whole thing in the direction you want for the right stick , and the analog stick then rotates against your leg .
This is why you have to reverse the wiring , because the use of the stick itself has been reversed .
Here 's the back of the unit , with the new buttons placed on .
I did n't really have room to use the original Xbox buttons so I just made some new ones .
They 're labeled so it should be OK .
Unfortunately some of the trigger mechanics are exposed , so be sure not to get any Doritos in there .
I am getting sick of white colored electronics , but figured wood grain might look a bit odd for this .
Maybe next time .
As with all my designs it 's all curves and I 've got no brakes !
There you have it - the story of how I literally cobbled this thing together .
Stay tuned to Benheck.com for even weirder controller mods , new projects and swell podcasts !
Feel free to email me about this project if you 'd like to help me pursue things along these lines .
I would like to see what sort of support there would be for something like this .

Bei einem Einbruch auf einen Server bietet das traditionelle Unix - Rechtemodell nicht genügend Möglichkeiten , um den Schaden zu begrenzen .
Neben dem von Red Hat bervorzugten SELinux und AppArmor von Novell existieren weitere Ansätze .
Das traditionelle Unix - Rechtemodell reicht nicht aus , will man die Systemintegrität eines Linux - Servers auch im Falle von Sicherheitslücken in Anwendungen aufrecht erhalten : Standardmäßig erben Prozesse alle Rechte des Benutzers und Benutzer haben absolute Kontrolle über alle von ihnen erzeugten Objekte .
Die Entscheidung , mit welchen Rechten ein Prozess auf ein Objekt ( Datei , Verzeichnis , Socket , TCP - Port und so weiter ) zugreifen darf , trifft der Kernel aufgrund der Identität des Benutzers , dem der Prozess gehört ( Subjekt ) .
So erbt etwa ein per Buffer Overflow im Mail - Server eingeschleuster Shell - Code dessen Zugriffsrechte , im ungünstigsten Fall Root - Rechte .
Die Linux - Anbieter Red Hat und Novell haben diese Schwäche erkannt und Sicherheitserweiterungen in ihre Distributionen integriert , um im Falle eines Einbruchs dem Angreifer die Übernahme des kompletten Servers so schwer wie möglich zu machen .
Red Hat setzt dabei auf SELinux , Novell auf AppArmor .
Weitere in der Linux - Welt etablierte Ansätze sind grsecurity , Systrace und LIDS .
Sie alle legen ein Mandatory - Access - Control - Modell ( MAC ) zugrunde , in dem vom Benutzer unabhängige Regeln sehr feinkörnig festlegen , was ein Prozess darf .
Mit den Linux Security Modules LSM enthält der Linux - Kernel ein Framework , über das Sicherheitserweiterungen in die Entscheidungsprozesse des Kernels eingreifen können .
Dabei dürfen lediglich vom Kernel erlaubte Operationen verboten , nicht jedoch verbotene Aktionen zugelassen werden : Ein LSM - Modul kann die Sicherheitseinstellungen nur restriktiver machen .
Die als LSM - Module ausgelegten Sicherheitserweiterungen SELinux und AppArmor haben den Vorteil , dass sie im Gegensatz zu den Kernel - Patches grsecurity , Systrace und LIDS nicht an jede neue Kernelversion angepasst werden müssen .
SELinux
SELinux , entwickelt von dem amerikanischen Geheimdienst National Security Agency ( NSA ) , ist via LSM - Framework in den Kernel 2.6 integriert .
Red Hat hat SELinux in Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) 4 integriert .
Die Software ergänzt die traditionellen Unix - Rechte um drei weitere Schutzmechanismen .
Der wichtigste , Type Enforcement ( TE , zu deutsch etwa Typzwang ) , legt fest , ob ein Prozess ( Subjekt ) auf ein Objekt zugreifen darf .
Dazu werden Subjekte und Objekte über ein zusätzliches Attribut ( bei Subjekten Domäne , bei Objekten Typ genannt ) Klassen zugeordnet .
Ein Subjekt darf nur dann auf ein Objekt zugreifen , wenn eine Regel den Zugriff seiner Domäne auf den Typ des Objekts gestattet .
Alles , was nicht ausdrücklich erlaubt ist , ist verboten .
Die Allmacht von root bricht das Rollenkonzept .
Benutzer befinden sich immer in einer ( von mehreren möglichen ) Rollen , wobei die Rolle festlegt , auf welche Domänen und Typen ein Benutzer zugreifen darf .
Der Superuser beispielsweise darf nur in der Sysadmin - Rolle Systemverwaltungsaufgaben wahrnehmen , der Zugriff etwa auf die Home - Verzeichnisse anderer Benutzer bleibt ihm dennoch verwehrt .
In seiner Standard - Rolle -- der eines unprivilegierten Users -- verhindert die rollenbasierte Zugriffskontrolle ( Role - based Access Control , kurz RBAC ) , dass er Änderungen am System vornimmt .
Das dritte Schutzprinzip in SELinux nennt sich Multi -Level Security ( MLS ) .
Es befindet sich noch im Experimentierstadium .
MLS definiert unterschiedliche Sicherheitsstufen und kommt ursprünglich aus dem militärischen Einsatz .
Objekten werden Geheimhaltungsstufen wie vertraulich , streng vertraulich oder geheim zugewiesen , während Subjekte Freigaben für Geheimhaltungsstufen erhalten .
Kritik an SELinux zielt vor allem auf die Komplexität des Systems ab .
Bislang fehlt ein komfortables Frontend , um die umfangreichen Regelwerke zu verwalten .
RHEL und Fedora Core enthalten zwei vorbereitete Regelwerke .
In der strict policy läuft jedes Programm in einer eigenen Domäne .
In Fedora Core 4 existieren dazu rund 1300 Domänen und 40.000 Regeln .
Zudem gibt es eine Vielzahl von Rollen mit unterschiedlichen Berechtigungen .
Die targeted policy mit rund 800 Domänen und 15.000 Regeln beschränkt sich weitgehend auf Type Enforcement und schützt etwa 70 Programme , vor allem exponierte Netzwerkserver .
The RIAA 's determined push to punish all Americans , young and old , dead and alive , has managed to build up a tidy sum of payments ( although nothing even starting to cover the cost of the operation ) , mainly because their targets have been too scared to challenge their claims in court .
Until now .
The music industry has slipped up and issued a threat against someone who knows his way round the court system - and John Doe Number 8 is fighting back .
Number 8 has challenged the terms of the actions against him in ways which , if succesful in court , could bring the process of legal action grinding to a halt .
He claims - amongst other factors - that his ISP should never have given up his identity to the music industry body , as they failed to provide any evidence that it had a case against him ; that the MediaSentry investigation which turned up his name in the first place was flawed ; that the RIAA had n't provided any solid evidence of copyright infringement in its communications with him , and , crucially , that the RIAA 's habit of bundling together large numbers of cases was itself unlawful , as there was no connection between the various John Does .
This last one is perhaps key - the RIAA has been behaving like it 's bringing a class action in reverse .
But while there is sense in , say , 200 people who have been hurt by one corporation banding together to bring an action , there 's no logical or ( apparently ) legal basis for a single corportation to bundle up 200 different arguments into one .
If he 's successful in all his claims , the RIAA have got a serious problem if they really wish to continue with using the courts to punitively punish random file sharers .
Having to file each case separately will slow down an already crawling and expensive process ; being asked to prepare a case demonstrating the copyright infringements to a higher standard of proof before the ISPs can give up details of RIAA targets would further frustrate the process .
A sensible organisation would probably call a halt to this actions if that happened ; but then a sensible organisation would n't have started out suing its customers in the first place .
This fossil specimen is the earliest largely complete example of an early modern human skull known from Europe .
Credit : Erik Trinkaus
Humans continued to evolve significantly long after they were established in Europe , and interbred with Neandertals as they settled across the continent , according to new research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) USA .
Professor Joao Zilhao of the University of Bristol , Professor Erik Trinkaus of Washington University and colleagues in Europe compared the features of an early modern human cranium found in the Peºtera cu Oase ( the Cave with Bones ) in southwestern Romania with other human samples from the period ( the Late Pleistocene ) .
Differences between the skulls suggest complex population dynamics as modern humans dispersed into Europe .
The different fragments of the reconstructed cranium – named Oase 2 – were found in a Late Pleistocene bone bed principally containing the remains of cave bears .
They were recovered during a systematic excavation project directed by Professor Trinkaus and Professor Zilhao between 2003 and 2005 .
Radiocarbon dating of the specimen produced only a minimum age ( more than 35,000 years ) , but similarity in morphological traits with the Oase 1 human mandible – found in 2002 on the surface of the cave , adjacent to the excavation area , and dated to about 40,500 years ago – lead the team to conclude that the two fossils were the same age .
These are the earliest modern human remains so far found in Europe and represent our best evidence of what the modern humans who first dispersed into Europe looked like .
By comparing it with other skulls , Professor Zilhao and colleagues found that Oase 2 had the same proportions as modern human crania and shared a number of modern human and / or non-Neandertal features .
However , there were some important differences : apparently independent features that are , at best , unusual for a modern human .
These included frontal flattening , a fairly large juxtamastoid eminence and exceptionally large upper molars with unusual size progression which are found principally among the Neandertals .
Professor Zilhao said : " Such differences raise important questions about the evolutionary history of modern humans .
They could be the result of evolutionary reversal or reflect incomplete palaeontological sampling of Middle Paleolithic human diversity .
" They could also reflect admixture with Neandertal populations as modern humans spread through western Eurasia .
This mixture would have resulted in both archaic traits retained from the Neandertals and unique combinations of traits resulting from the blending of previously divergent gene pools .
" The ultimate resolution of these issues must await considerations of larger samples of European early modern humans and chronologically intervening specimens .
But this fossil is a major addition to the growing body of fossil , genetic and archaeological evidence indicating significant levels of biological and cultural interaction between modern humans and the anatomically archaic populations ( including the Neandertals ) they met along the way as they spread from Africa into Eurasia . "
It is apparent that the Oase 2 cranium indicates there was significant modern human morphological evolution since the early Upper Paleolithic , the researchers conclude .
Oase 2 is ' modern ' in its abundance of derived modern human features , but it remains ' nonmodern ' in its complex constellation of archaic and modern features .

" I 've just been bragging to all my friends that you mentioned me on Axe In My Head " [ 2001 Jul 17 ]
There is a slight mistake in your French translation of " Oh my god !
There 's an axe in my head . " .
French typography requires a space ( an unbreakable space : ALT 0160 ) before the exclamation mark .
I also wonder why the first word � Oh� was not translated ...
By the way , I noticed that many translations have a final exclamation mark , that does not appear in the original English text .
I hope that I 'm helping you in saving lives .

G1 Also , I noticed the german translation - [ orig Oh mein Gott !

or for urgency : Mensch !

G5 John Cheseldine ringed in this likely enough candidate :
Noticed you had a Klingon translation on your site , so I thought you might appreciate this ;
It 's very rough translation into the Goa' Uld language used by the bad - guys ( and slaves ) in the Stargate movie and SG - 1 series ...
This is loosely based on dialogue taken from the film , and the concept of the language on Abydos being a corruption of ancient Egyptian ... it 's not 100 % accurate but it 's extremely close ! [ 2001 Oct 26 ]

G6 Notes on Greek from Miriam Kotsonis [ 2001 Feb 16 ] :
' Since I do n't want anyone to be lax , when dealing with an axe ,
here are some suggestions regarding the Greek translations .
The modern Greek you showed had two problems :
" Greek , Modern : hristo mou ! eho ena maheri sto kefali mou ! "
The word for God , or in this case Christ , needs to be in the vocative case , Hriste .
Also , the word for axe is " tsekouri " and not maheri , which means knife .
So the correct version would be : Hriste mou !
Eho ena tsekouri sto kefali mou !
For Ancient Greek , I do n't know all of it ( maybe some of the people I 've blind - copied this to will be able to help ) , but you definitely want Thee ( pronounced Thayay ) mou , not O Theos mou .
With best wishes for your continued success in the list ,
Miriam Kotsonis '
This additional note , from Paul Exarhos [ 6 Mar 2001 ] :
' Hi Guys !
I received an email with many different translations for " Oh My God there is an exe in my head ! " [ sic - ed ]
I am just writing to you to let you know that the Modern Greek Translation is not correct .
What you have written there translates to .... "
My Jesus there is a knife in my head . "
It should read , " The 'Mou , eho ena tsakouri sto kefali mou "
I hope this is of some help to you !

G7 Our thanks go out to Virginia M. Geraty , Gullah scholar and advocate , who sent this translation in .
" Contrary to the belief still held by some , Gullah is not poor , or broken English .
It is not a dialect of any other language , neither is it Black English .
Gullah possesses every element necessary for it to qualify as a language in its own right .
It has its own grammar , phonological systems , idiomatic expressions , and an extensive vocabulary .
Since this language was never intended to be written , there are no hard and fast rules governing its orthography . " [ 2001 Apr 29 ]

Any guesses what happens to you when you get something wrong on this page ? :
[ 2001 May 11 ]
Great work !
I love the axe - in - my - head page :)
Ok ..
Here 's another one ..
You may need to do some research , but it 's a fairly common language .
Primarily in western Africa it 's used as a common language between many tribes .
The BBC even airs in Nigeria in this language .
It 's called ' Hausa ' .
I can't believe I remember this stuff .
Enjoy :)
Kai !
Ina da bambaro ciken kaina !
It actually translates to ' Kai ! ( an expression of shock ) I have an axe ( something like an axe ) in my head . '
The first ' Kai ' is actually an expression , the second ' kaina ' is actually ' kai ' ( head ) and the suffix ' na ' is ' my '. ' ciken ' is pronounced almost exactly like english ' chicken ' .
H2 Originally posted as " Eloi ! Yesh 'li ca-sheel ba-rosh sheh - li ! " , we 've had some input as to correcting the phrase :
From Barry Barancik [ 2001 Feb 13 ] : " Hi . Although the hebrew translation is basically correct , the common modern Hebrew word for a hand - axe is garzen , not ca-sheel .
regards , Barry "
And this from OFER - ZI ( ���� ��݉��� ) [ 2001 Mar 06 ] : ' while readind the " Oh my god !
There 's an axe in my head " page , I noticed a mistake in the Hebrew translation .
Being an Isreali and as such , a native Hebrew speaker , id like to correct it to : " Allelay , yesh li garzen ba- rosh " ( alternative translation would be : " Allelay , yesh li garzen barrosh sheli " , but the last word is not necessary )
" oh my god " ( " allelay " ) may also be writen " Oh Ellohim " ( " oh god " , as is often said ) or " Oh Ellohim shelli " ( " oh my god " , a less common figure of speach ) '
Dikla [ 2004 Apr 24 ] and Gilia [ 2004 May 27 ] seem emphatic that there are just too many words in the Hebrew .
Gilia : " It is saying ' Me ' twice . "
So we changed it some .
H3 Another minor tweak from someone outside the Indo - European crowd :
On the site there is the line in " Hungarian : Jaj Istenem , de fejsze van a fejemben ! " .
Literally it means " Oh my God , but there is an axe in my head ! "
de means but
Correctly :
" Jaj Istenem , egy fejsze van a fejemben ! "
egy is the article we use for the english a or an ( which means literally one but we use it like this )
Best regards ,
Mária [ 2004 Apr 18 ]
H4 As a fellow Waterloo Engineer , I got a real kick out of reading the stuff on your site .
However , since Lord of the Rings and Star Trek both have some submissions , I thought it'd be only fair to add a Star Wars one as well .
I had a hard time figuring out how to translate axe , but I think it still works :
Tcheesa watichika bo !
Ava pi killee krusp da ma green !
This translates to : " Alas exalted one !
There is [ a ] kill stick in my head ! "
" killee krusp " could also be substituted with the more vague " punyoo " which just means " weapon "

I4 From the email of F. W. , with our most profound thanks [ 2001 Feb 15 ] :
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I note that you have incorrectly translated the above into Irish ( and therefore quite possibly your Celtic and Gaelic versions need to be revised ) .
The correct version is in fact :
" Ó mo Dhia !
Tá tua i mo cheann ! "
and not " Mo Dhia !
Ta tua sa mo cheann ! "
I have underlined the change from " sa " to " i " .
In Irish , " sa " and " i " are the two words used to describe the English preposition " in " .
" i " is used , inter alia , to denote the genitive case in respect of bodily parts , such as " in my face " ( i m'aghaidh ) , " in my head " ( i mo cheann ) , etc .
Hence the error in your translation .
I hope this information is of some use to you .
Kind regards ,
F. W .

I5 " The new language I have for you is Old Irish :
A mo de !
Tathum tuag im chenn - sa .
Oh my god !
There - is - to - me [ an ] axe in - my head .
There should be accent marks ( long vowels ) on the e in de , the a in tathum , and the u in tuag .
The line would be pronounced roughly :
A moe they !
Tothuv tuagh im xen-sa
The x is the German ch in Bach and the gh is the voiced version of that .
I included the pronunciation only because Old Irish is often not pronounced like it is written .
I hope you can use these .

K2 Additions and corrections from one " Jasmine " [ 2001 Mar 06 ] :
Some more translations :
Kyrgyz ( from Kyrgyzstan near China and Uzbekistan .
It comes from the same family as Turkish does )
Oh Kuday !
Bashimda balta bar !
Also , an alternate version of the Russian translation .
The one you have on the web page was made by an American , I 'm assuming .
They are trying to duplicate " there is " in Russian .
The form " to be " is very rarely used .
A more accurate " Russian " way of saying the phrase would be : Oh God !
Axe in my head !
with the " to be " part being understood .
Oy Gospodi !
Topor u moye golovye !
Enjoy ,
Jasmine
M1 Filip [ 2004 Apr 22 ] seems to have the most accurate Macedonian , and he passed along a clean GIF .
But there are at least two current dialects of Macedonian , and these have been derived from still more ancient ones .
Can anyone please sort it all out ?
" O , Gospodi !
Imam sekira vo glavata , "

Apparently we are still experiencing some argument over just how to convince your Norwegian friends a great hatchet of war is sticking out of your cranium .
This is not the language group to let down about such an issue .
Here 's some of the mail we 've gotten through the Spring of 2001 :
The last translation posted was " Hærregud , eg he ein øks i hovudet ! "
[ 2001 Apr 29 ]
Hi , I am a 16 year old boy from Norway ( who cares . . )
Your translation of oh my god !
There 's an axe in my head from english to norwegian is a little bit odd .
The way you have it is as it would have been in earlier norwegian ( nynorsk )
In earlier norwegian it should have been :
" Herregud !
Eg har ein øks i hovudet "
or
" Å Gud !
Eg har ein øks i hovudet "
But most norwegians or write in a newer version of Norwegian ( bokmål )
And in that case the translation would have been :
" Herregud !
Jeg har en øks i hodet "
or
" Å Gud !
Jeg har en øks i hodet "
The last two ways of writing it is the most used ones , but the first two is also correct .
I suggest you change the translation you already have with one of the ones I have listed .
Greetings from
Tony Hansse
[ 2001 May 16 ]
The Norwegian version " Hærregud , eg he ein øks i hovudet ! " is not really correct .
If one is using Bokmål ( the majority dialect ) " Herre Gud , jeg har fått en øks i hodet " would be correct .
In Nynorsk ( the minority dialect ) this would be " Herre Gud , eg har fått ei øks i hovudet mitt " would be the way to express it .
The viking sagas tell a us lot about axe fighting and a line that is most suitable for your page is :
" Han treiv ei øks i hovudet på han så skallen kløvdes heilt ned til skuldrane .
Det blei hans bane ! "
- From Eigil Skallagrimssons kongssagaer .
In english this would read " An axe was thrust into his head so his skull was split in two right down to his shoulders .
This killed him " .
The last part of the sentnce may seem unnecessary information for us today but the vikings were a tough fighting race and a mere head wound caused by an axe was commonplace .

Just a little pedantic note : there are actually two Norwegian written languages .
Directly translated , one is commonly referred to as ' book tongue ' and the other ' new Norwegian ' .
Both are taught in school .
The ' book tongue ' version of Norwegian language is basically Danish with a twist , whilst ' new Norwegian ' is a nationalistic attempt at combining the various attributes of different Norwegian dialects into one whole .
Being an attempt at incorporating all dialects , and seeing as there are so many ( and consequently conflicting ) ones , ' new Norwegian ' is quite flexible .
As long as one spells words consistently , one may somewhat adjust the spelling according to one 's own dialect .
Thus , ' aks ' may in some instances be an alternative spelling of ' øks ' , but this is probably limited to isolated backwater burghs no one has ever heard of .
Here are correct Norwegian translations of " Oh my god !
There 's an axe in my head " :
Norwegian ' Book tongue ' : " Herregud !
Jeg har en øks i hodet . "
' New Norwegian ' : " Herregud !
Eg har ein øks i hovudet . "
The version on your site ( " Hærregud , eg he ein øks i hovudet ! " ) , I 'm sorry to say , is completely off the mark .
Firstly , ' hærregud ' is a misspelling of ' herregud ' in any version of written Norwegian .
( It 's akin to writing ' oh my gad ' instead of ' oh my god ' . )
Secondly , ' he ' is used in some spoken dialects , but is not an acceptable official spelling of ' har ' .
Although ' new Norwegian ' is flexible , there are still certain rules to abide .
So , the suggested ' new Norwegian ' of " Hærregud , eg he ein øks i hovudet ! " is plain wrong .
This is not merely my opinion .
It is so .
Please do not just mention this in the footnote , but correct the main text . .
Regards ,

Good day to you .
I 'm a Norwegian , and I see to my disgust that your Norwegian translation is wrong .
The one you have no your page , is ' written the way people talk ' , and in a dialect .
It is not correct Norwegian .
The wrong sentence :
Hærregud , - Written the way people talk .
There is no such word as Hærre , and the words Herre Gud should be in two words !
eg he ein - north Norwegian dialect !
øks i - correct
hovudet ! - Dialect agai
The correct sentence ( and I got the best grades at school ! ) is :
Herre Gud , jeg har en øks i hodet !

[ Ed. : We 've now posted a couple of each from Bokmål and Nynorsk .
If a fresh round of dispute arises , this can only be solved in one way .
Everyone in Norway will have to get out their axes , approach those with opposing dialects , and ... you get the idea .
Ah , for the good old days . ]
Q1 The Quest of Axe has begun in Middle - Earth ... the Tolkien scholars are sharpening their baruk in preparation to mince Peter Jackson 's interpretation of Middle - Earth to a nicety .
Or , if the need arises , to leave an axe in his head .
Our thanks to scribe Aaron Griffith for his weapons - take on the subject 
" The Quenya translation could be better , I think :
A Iluvatarinya !
En na pelecco carinyesse .
Literally : O Earth - father - mine .
There is [ an ] ax head - mine - in .
There should be accent marks ( indicating long vowels ) over the u in Iluvatar , the a in na , and the a in carinyesse .
Iluvatar is more commonly the name the elves use when addressing God .
Also , the elves can say ' in my head ' all in one word and probably would , rather than as mi nya car , which is printed currently . " [ 2001 Sep 21 ]
But our original entry for Quenya was just as thoughtful :
" Hello .
My name is Ian .
I was looking for something cool to do , when all of a sudden , I found your page .
It 's awesome .
My new hobby is to memorize a new way of saying it every day , and say it to someone .
" I was slightly dissapointed however , when I found a Klingon way of saying it , and not an Elvish one .
JRR Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings series , and there is a movie coming out in mid-December of one of the books .
So , I think that you should put in the Elvish language because it is well developed and spoken by many fanatics across the country .
I took the liberty of looking up how to say the phrase , in hopes that you would put it on your page .
Please think it over .
Thank you .
O Erunya !
En ná i pelecco mi nya cár .
Oh my God !
There is an axe in my head .
" Sorry about not making a contraction of " there is " , but I could not find a way in Elf .

Thanks ,
Ian , though Ilythiiri is arguably an elvish language we 've already posted .
Also , we are well aware of Prof .
Tolkien 's contributions , and have been seeking translations in his languages for some time .
In fact , he devised more than one elven language , and developed many variants .
Your translation appears to be in Quenya ...
We invite all Ardan scholars out there to keep commenting .

Dear Site Curator :
Great site !!
One note , however : the Russian - language version of the phrase " Oh my God , there 's an axe in my head " on your website , while a workable literal translation , is not the way a Russian would actually say this .
May I suggest instead : " Bozhe moy , u meenya tapor v golove ! "

I was just reading through your translations and I came upon the Spanish translation and it says " una hacha " .
This is incorrect ; it should be " un hacha " .
ALthough it looks that it should be " una " it takes the masculine form because of hte stressed " h " sound to the word .

This submission from Kari Kakkinen [ 2001 Mar 09 ] answers all your questions :
( Original submissions : " Ah , Herregud !
Jag har en yxa i huvudet ! " )
I do n't know who gave you the swedish version but to me it's not the the rigth way of saying it , the first part that is .
When you in swedish use the .... Ah ........ it can be in a situation where you are disappointed with yourself .... Ah , jag missade ( I missed ) ....or..... it can be in a situation when you are admireing something ..... Aaaah , den är vacker ( it 's beautiful ) notice the longer Ah , wich in that situation means that you probably really think the " object " is really beautiful .
So ...... how is the correct way then ?

Another submission in Yiddish we recieved from JeffreyW100 , but , a little unsure he was :
[ 2001 Jun 06 ]
" It would be a good idea to add Yiddish as a language .

" Actually , it might be : Oy mayn got , doort is an ( ax ) in mayn kop ! ! "
HERE , on an island that might be called Camelot , the winds of democracy have blown in like the waft from a landfill .
This 3 - mile - long stretch of granite crags , flowered meadows , neat cottages and well -
behaved Guernsey cows 80 miles off Britain ’s coast in the English Channel is the last feudal outpost in Europe .
Algernon Swinburne , the 19th century poet , called it a “ small , sweet world of wave - encompassed wonder . ”
Sark has remained pretty much the same for 442 years , since Queen Elizabeth I declared it a noble fiefdom .
Transport is by bicycle , horse - and -
Advertisement
carriage or Wellington boots .
When absolutely necessary , one may resort to one of the island ’s few tractors .
But the neighbors , never frugal with opinions , tend to look up from their gardens and make case - by - case assessments of what constitutes necessity .
Landownership is divided among 40 “ tenants . ”
They are the descendants or successors of the 40 men with muskets recruited by the original seigneur , the ruling lord commissioned to defend the isle against pirates and buccaneers .
Government administration is by fiat , with the island administrator , judge , constable and clerk appointed by the current seigneur , a 79 - year - old former aeronautical engineer whose family has governed Sark since 1852 .
But that was all in place long before the 21st century arrived on the gut - churning , twice - a- day ferry from Guernsey ; before it was decreed that , in a modern Europe whose members are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights , it ’s just not on to have feudal lords , and not on to have seats in the island ’s parliament bequeathed across generations to eldest sons , and not on to refuse to adopt divorce laws because you do n’t like them .
Sark , like the rest of the islands that squat in the English Channel , is technically not part of Britain , or anywhere else .
As a dependency of the sovereign of England on and off since the days of William the Conqueror , Sark adopts its own tax residency , landownership and environmental standards .
Advertisement
But as a dependency , it looks to Britain for its defense and international diplomacy , and to the nearby island of Guernsey for criminal laws .
( The bigger island centuries ago was granted Sark as part of its bailiwick , or court bailiff ’s jurisdiction . )
That means that when Britain agreed to respect human rights , so , by extension , did Sark .
Until now , no one has been particularly inclined to get rid of the feudal governing system that placed political power in the hands of the seigneur and a parliament made up of his 40 vassals and , more recently , 12 elected deputies .
But as outsiders looking for a slice of the island ’s tranquillity and rural grace have begun to buy up the 40 land allotments , some of the newcomers have demanded at least a nod to the conventions of the 21st century , much as has happened on Guernsey and the nearby island of Jersey .
For some , the idea of having to apply to the seigneur for permission to sell land -- and pay him
one - thirteenth of the sales price -- is too charmingly medieval for comfort .
Advertisement
BRITISH authorities , responsible for administering European human rights standards , have given Sark a choice : Either create an elected parliament of a form chosen by the majority of the island ’s 600 or so residents , or give up some sovereignty .
“ They said the legislature was n’t human - rights - compliant ....
About 10 years ago , the seigneurs in Guernsey had to give up giving permission [ to sell land ] and collecting money , and I realized from that date that the same thing was going to happen in Sark , that it was all inevitable , ” said Michael Beaumont , the seigneur , who has tended to rule Sark the only way this island of eccentrics could be ruled : by dry wit , gentle prodding and quiet diplomacy .
A referendum last fall was supposed to usher in an elected parliament .
But the last few weeks it has become clear that Sark ’s 40 landlords , who would for the first time have to stand for election , are n’t giving in without a fight .
In January , the parliament , known as Chief Pleas , voted to suspend the referendum and study further whether Sark truly wants to go down the democratic road .
Advertisement
“ We are now up to our seventh year in discussing a new constitution , ” said Beaumont , who has made it clear he is prepared to forgo his inherited privilege and defer to progress .
“ But when you ’ve got a house with a vast majority all made up of [ landowners ] , they ’re not going to give up their seats , at least not willingly .
They ’re going to fight to the last drop of blood , as far as I can see . ”
As early as the 13th century , Sark was a haven for monks and pirates , the treacherous underwater rocks along its coasts serving as weapons against unsuspecting ships .
That ended in 1565 , when Queen Elizabeth I granted the island as a fief to Helier de Carteret on the condition he ensure the island ’s safety by retaining 40 armed men .
Beaumont became seigneur in 1974 on the death of his grandmother , Sibyl Hathaway , dame of Sark , who held the island ’s population together during Nazi occupation ( imperiously requiring the German officers to sign in as visitors at the elegant manor house ) .
Over the years , the island had on its own cast away some of the trappings of feudalism .
Advertisement
Beaumont no longer collects an annual tithe on residents ’ wealth ; annual payment of a live chicken to the seigneur also is no longer mandatory ; and taxes are a fraction of what they are in Britain , though Beaumont continues to take his treizieme , one - thirteenth of the sales price , whenever one of the original 40 tenements is sold .
None can be subdivided or conveyed without his concurrence , and all must be sold to a loyal subject of the queen .
THE seigneur ’s consent is no longer required for marriage ( and no one can remember when he had the right to review the bride on her wedding night ) .
Divorce is still not written into Sark ’s code , but the island has agreed to accept those granted elsewhere .
The law decreeing that tenements must be handed down to the eldest son was changed in 1999 to allow daughters to inherit as well .
Still , by tradition and law , Beaumont is the only Sark resident permitted to keep pigeons or an unspayed bitch .
And residents with a complaint can still fall on one knee and invoke the Clameur de Haro , a Norman custom under which a person can obtain immediate cessation of any action he considers to be an infringement of his rights .
“ It usually involves boundary disputes .
Say someone is knocking your trees down , ” explained Jeremy Bateman , the deputy seneschal , or island administrator .
Advertisement
“ You can fall on your knees and invoke the Clameur de Haro .
You say : ‘ Haro , haro haro !
A mon aide , mon prince , on me fait tort ! ’
[ Help me , my prince , someone does me wrong ! ]
And when that ’s done , everything stops .
All work must be stopped until there ’s a hearing of the court .
“ It is used occasionally , ” Bateman said .
“ I think the last time it was three years ago .
A wall was being built on a boundary , and it was invoked .
It ’s quite effective . ”
Sark ’s residents -- natives whose families have inhabited the island for generations , mainland Brits looking for a quieter life , and wealthy , often - secretive refugees appreciative of the island ’s generous tax laws -- for the most part rent their homes on short - and long - term leases granted by the tenants .
By law , newcomers can live only in homes built before 1976 , a regulation intended to allow the construction of new homes for the children of islanders but hold the new arrivals largely at bay .
Residents survive mainly on the revenue from the thousands of tourists who descend on the island each summer once the terrifying winter gales subside .
Advertisement
With next to no civil service , Sark is governed by volunteers .
The seigneur ’s chief gardener is also the head of the constitutional review committee .
Some people fish during the week and drive a carriage on weekends .
Members of Chief Pleas oversee the schools , the sewage system , trash pickup , harbors , fishing , agriculture and health care .
“ You ’ll see somebody that ’s working behind the counter in the food shops , and when you pop into the pub that evening they ’ll be behind the bar .
That ’s how people support each other and make a living , ” said Geoff Benfield , a former automotive engineer from the mainland who opened a combination bed - and - breakfast and rocking horse carving studio on Sark .
The constable is one of the few who gets a salary .
He earned it in 1991 , when an unemployed French nuclear physicist , dressed in military fatigues and armed with an automatic rifle and 250 rounds of ammunition , launched a one - man invasion .
“ He put these notices up , they were all in French , of course , saying he was going to take over the island , ” Beaumont recalled .
Advertisement
“ Everyone took it as a joke , of course , until the next day somebody saw him walking around with a rifle .
Fortunately , the constable just had a lot of plain common sense .
He walked up to the chap and said , ‘ That ’s an interesting rifle you ’ve got there . ’
And he asked , ‘ How does it work ? ’
“ So the chap started to show him , and the rest of the fire brigade pounced on him . ”
MANY residents probably would have been content to leave Sark as it was for another 400 years .
That was n’t going to happen after billionaire twin brothers Sir David Barclay and Sir Frederick Barclay bought the island of Brecqhou next door in 1993 .
The island falls under Sark ’s jurisdiction .
The reclusive Barclays , owners of the Telegraph media empire and the Ritz Hotel , proceeded to build an enormous castle , complete with medieval - style turrets .
Advertisement
Their distaste for Sark ’s feudal system apparently began when they were informed that Beaumont was due his treizieme on the purchase of the island -- a sum of $ 254,000 .
The Barclay brothers were n’t successful in challenging Sark ’s jurisdiction over Brecqhou , but they did succeed in forcing scrutiny of the island ’s compliance with the human rights convention .
In pushing the island to democratize , officials in London have warned that failure to modernize on Sark ’s own terms could result in Sark losing some of its independence and being governed more directly by the larger island of Guernsey , an option no one here seems to want .
Moreover , many residents have become impatient with the domination of the landowners in decision making .
Advertisement
“ The situation we have at the moment is we have about 40 people -- perhaps 27 or 28 of them turn up for meetings -- who have a seat in government simply because they own land , ” said Jan Guy , a former head teacher at the island ’s school who has lived here 19 years .
“ Now , in some cases , their family has owned that land for many years , and several generations .
But in many cases , that land has been bought quite recently .
So if you came over and you bought a nice tenement , the next meeting of government , you ’d be there , governing for the people of Sark .
I ask you , do you think that ’s right ? ”
But other long - term residents fear that easing the feudal landowners out of the government will be the beginning of the end .
“ We must remember , it ’s worked wonderfully for 450 years .
Unfortunately , it ’s a lot of the outsiders who come to the island because they love it , and lo and behold they want to change things once they get here , ” said Elizabeth Perree , whose family , descendants of original tenants on the island , operates an inn and small farm .
Advertisement
“ It still has the lovely simplicity of horses and carriages trundling along the roads .
Cattle grazing and having lovely butter and cream straight from the farms -- all these little things are what make Sark what it is , ” she said .
“ It ’ll be a tragedy if it starts to get built up and become like anywhere else in the world , ” Perree said .
“ People say , ‘ progress , ’ we should do this , we should do that .
Someone at the moment is suggesting that we should have more building because that would give more work to people .
“ But in a funny way , I feel it ’s special because it has stayed as it was .
It ’s the last feudal state in the Western world , for goodness ’ sake . ”

While doing a bit of traveling recently , I printed out some directions curteousy of Yahoo !
Maps and placed them on the passanger seat .
I found that looking over while driving probably was n’t the safest option .
I then decided what my Saturn LS needs is someway to project the text of the paper on my windsheild .
Here is an extremely low tech way to avoid the dreaded reading while driving connundrum .
First :
When you print your online directions ( or anything you need while driving ) be sure you use the available “ Printer Freindly ” option .
This ensures big text and a big map .
Second :
When you get the print friendly version on your browser scroll to the part you need .
If you are using windows hit the print screen button , if you ’re using a Mac , buy a new computer , or use Apple + Shift +4 .
Third : Paste the text ( as an image ) into your favorite image editor .
Forth : Flip the image vertically .
Different programs do this differently .
In MS Paint hit Ctrl+R and then select “ Flip vertically ” .
Fifth : Print .
Sixth :
When you get in your car place the paper on your dashboard .

Three years ago , in deciding to adhere to an Additional Protocol to their Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency in advance of its ratification , the Iranians voluntarily “ declared ” certain activities many months before they were obligated to do so under their existing Safeguards Agreement .
And , on 27 April , 2006 , the Iranians informed the IAEA that it was “ fully prepared ” to continue voluntarily adhering to the Additional Protocol in advance of its ratification “ provided ” Irans IAEA “ dossier ” remained “ within the framework ” of the IAEA .
The IAEA Board ignored the Iranian warning , and directed IAEAs Director - General , Mohamed ElBaradei , to report the entire Iranian dossier [ .pdf ] to the UN Security Council , with the expectation that the Council would “ determine ” under Article 39 of the UN Charter that Irans Safeguarded programs somehow constituted “ a threat to peace in the region . ”
Of course , the Security Council has thus far declined to make such a ridiculous determination .
But , as threatened , the Iranians promptly reduced their cooperation with the IAEA to levels not much greater than required by their existing Safeguards Agreement .
It is to that Agreement and nothing more that the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons requires Iran to adhere and looks to the IAEA to verify compliance !
If you carefully read ElBaradeis quarterly reports to the IAEA Board , you can determine for yourself that for at least the past three years the IAEA has verified total compliance by Iran with that Safeguards Agreement .
Nevertheless , Bonkers Bolton managed to strong - arm the Security Council into passing Resolution 1696 which , inter alia , “ demanded ” that  in order to satisfy certain IAEA Board members  Iran “ suspend ” all enrichment - related activities .
Well , ElBaradei has just made his next quarterly report [ .pdf ] to the IAEA Board and to the Security Council .
ElBaradei once again confirmed that Iran remained in total compliance with its original NPT - required Safeguards Agreement .
And that Iran continues to provide cooperation on certain matters beyond that required .
But , ElBaradei reported that Iran has not re-suspended uranium - enrichment activities as improperly “ demanded ” by the Security Council on behalf of the IAEA Board of Governors , nor was Iran continuing to act in accordance with the un-ratified Additional Protocol .
Now , so long as those activities Iran has refused to re-suspend remain subject to IAEA Safeguards  which they will , so long as Iran doesnt withdraw from the NPT  those activities can never constitute a threat to the peace .
So , why , for the past three years , have Bolton and his Gang of Three ( the Brits , French and Germans ) been threatening to do unto Iran what the Israelis have just done unto Lebanon , unless Iran suspends  indefinitely  its pursuit of a uranium - enrichment capability ?
And even more puzzling , why have the Iranians stubbornly refused to cease pursuit of a hopelessly obsolescent Pakistani - castoff uranium - enrichment capability , risking thereby a pre-emptive attack by the United States , perhaps involving nukes ?
Maybe its because , as Irans UN representative  Javad Zarif  told the Council in the aftermath of their passage of Resolution 1696 :
“ This is not the first time that Irans endeavors to stand on its own feet and make technological advances have faced the stiff resistance and concerted pressure of some powers permanently represented in the Security Council .
“ More recently , Saddam Hussein ’s aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran on 22 September 1980 , and his swift advancement to occupy 30000 sq. kilometers of Iranian territory , did not trouble the same permanent members of the Security Council enough to consider it a threat against international peace and security , or even to make the routine call for a cease - fire and withdrawal .
“ Nor did they find it necessary to even adopt a resolution for seven long days after the aggression , hoping that their generally - held utter miscalculation that Saddam could put an end to the Islamic Republic within a week would be realized .
“ Even then , and for the following two long years , they did not deem [ it ] fit to call for a withdrawal of the invading forces .
“ Iran ’s peaceful nuclear program poses no threat to international peace and security , and therefore dealing with this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility .
“ Far from reflecting  as advertised  the concerns of the international community , the approach of the sponsors flouts the stated position of the overwhelming majority of the international community , clearly reflected in the most recent statements by Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the OIC ( Organization of the Islamic Conference ) , and partly reflected in the June 2006 IAEA Board Chairmans Conclusion .
“ The Non-Aligned Movement , comprising an overwhelming majority of this Organization , in the recent statement of its Ministers in Putrajaya stressed that there should be no undue pressure or interference in the Agency ’s activities , especially its verification process , which would jeopardize the efficiency and credibility of the Agency , and nothing should be interpreted in a way as inhibiting or restricting this right of States to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes  and reaffirmed that States ’ choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear technology and its fuel cycle policies must be respected . 
So there you have it .
This is where Iran has chosen to make its stand .
Defending the NPT , the IAEA - NPT nuke proliferation prevention regime , the IAEA Board of Governors , the UN Security Council and the UN Charter , itself , against assaults by Bonkers Bolton and his Gang of Three .
On the basis of the initial reaction of the Italians , Russians , Chinese and even the Brits to ElBaradeis latest report , the Iranians have made a good choice .

Russian films like Zhmurki have captured the world of the hitmen
You would use the Russian verb zakazat ' to order a pizza or a plane ticket but when you " order someone " , in the popular parlance , it means you want them killed by one of these hired hitmen .
If Russian media accounts are to be believed , his wages can range from a modest $ 100 to sums running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars , depending on the target .
When Ms Politkovskaya was shot at her home , there did not appear to be any attempt at robbery and the presumed weapon , a Makarov pistol , was left at the scene together with its used cartridges .
When Russian television broadcast CCTV footage from the apartment block entrance , it showed the chief suspect to be a thin man in a baseball cap , his face a blur .
If this was a contract killing , identifying the perpetrator - and those behind him - will be difficult .
Open season
One of my memories of Moscow in the winter of 1996 was passing a set of bullet - holes in a subway on my way to work .
SUSPECTED CONTRACT KILLINGS
October 2006 - campaigning Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya shot dead in Moscow Sept 2006 - first deputy chairman of Russia 's central bank Andrei Kozlov shot dead in Moscow Oct 2005 - former bank head Alexander Slesarev gunned down near Moscow July 2004 - US editor of Forbes ' Russian edition Paul Klebnikov shot dead in Moscow Oct 2002 - Magadan governor Valentin Tsvetkov killed in Moscow Nov 1998 - liberal MP Galina Starovoitova killed in St Petersburg March 1995 - leading journalist Vladislav Listyev shot dead in Moscow
Nobody seemed in a rush to fix the chipped tiles , just a short distance from a luxury hotel .
For those who knew , the holes marked the spot where US businessman Paul Tatum was machine - gunned to death .
The chief lesson from his unsolved death appeared to be that prominent foreigners could be targets too .
The death of much - loved TV anchorman Vlad Listyev the previous year had already established that fame was no protection from the hired guns .
A wave of contract killings washed through Russia in the 1990s , sweeping away new bankers and businessmen .
With the security apparatus in freefall and war raging in the Caucasus , the country seemed awash with guns .
Another memory for me is descending an empty escalator in a metro station beside Red Square one night and seeing one " wide boy " slapping another on his knees as he held a pistol to his head .
By the early years of this century - with Vladimir Putin in power - the wave seemed to be receding .
And then came the murder of another American , Forbes journalist Paul Klebnikov , in 2004 and , this September , deputy head of the Central Bank Andrei Kozlov .
Both were shot dead - Klebnikov outside his office , Kozlov in his car .
Nobody has ever been convicted of their murders despite hopes for a while that the Klebnikov case would be solved .
But while " unsolved " is a word you associate almost automatically with contract killings in Russia , occasionally a killer is caught .
1990s survivors
Alexander Solonik , aka Alexander The Great , aka superkiller , confessed to assassinating a string of Moscow underworld figures in the early 1990s without , it is said , revealing his paymasters .
The killer of Politkovskaya appears to have been caught on CCTV
He also cut a bloody swathe through the capital 's police force before his arrest in 1994 .
Solonik 's main " qualifications " for the work of a hired killer appear to have been a period of military service , an early spell in prison , good physical fitness and a reputed ability to shoot with both hands .
Escaping from Moscow 's famous Matrosskaya Tishina ( Sailor 's Rest ) prison in 1995 , he fled abroad only to be murdered along with his girl - friend in Greece a couple of years later .
Russian film director Alexei Balabanov 's 2005 black comedy Zhmurki ( Blind Man 's Buff ) , about hitmen , begins in a morgue where some fresh corpses are soon added to the display .
Sub - titled " For those who survived the ' 90s " , it struck a popular chord , capturing a grotesque world of casual killers , rapacious New Russians and cowed police .
There may be fewer raspberry - red blazers and long leather jackets in Moscow today , and the city now teems with hard - faced police , but it seems the phenomenon of the killer survived the '90s too .
What can Russia do to stem its tide of violent crime ?
Your comments :
Russia is not a proper democracy , and this lack of transparency and legitimacy affects the entire country .
It does n't surprise me that crime flourishes in such a state .
Andrew Lockley , UK
The news from Moscow is very said .
However , taken their crime rate into comparison with Western European standards , they still appear to be civilised .
Official statistics show that the Russian capital , as well as other places in Russia , are still a far cry from the level of killings we have here in Holland .
Dart , The Netherlands
Russia appears to be evolving like America did in the roaring twenties with the gangsters .
In a few years time , the winners of this power struggle will be the acceptable face of Russia that we will be doing business with .
Barry , UK
When the value of a human life can be measured in rubles , and your average " hit " costs $ 1000 , can you expect anything less ?
The naivety of some Western observers astounds me .
Ed , Moscow .
Russia 's current tide of violent crime is overt .
In the West things are more subtle , so it 's not obvious who the killers are .
Many journalists have been killed worldwide in rather dubious circumstances where the killers are not held to account , let alone charged .
Over time Russia 's power groups will adopt more subtle means as the political climate there changes to being more democratic .
Michael G Eaglemeare , The Netherlands
That is what happens when a country is persuaded to change its political system to the new religion of " market economy " .
Capitalism is the stuff of corruption and exploitation as the so called " west " knows to its cost .

The Goddard launch took place in Texas in November 2006
Spaceship launch
A video of the cone - shaped Goddard vehicle shows it climbing to about 85 m ( 285 ft ) before returning back to Earth .
The test launch took place in November 2006 in a remote part of Texas , but details have only now been released .
The images mark the first time Jeff Bezos has broken his silence on the work of his space company , Blue Origin .
Writing on the company 's website , Mr Bezos said : " We 're working , patiently and step - by - step , to lower the cost of spaceflight so that many people can afford to go ; and so that we humans can better continue exploring the Solar System . "
" Accomplishing this mission will take a long time , and we 're working on it methodically . "
Short trip
Mr Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000 with the intention of developing a vertical take - off and landing vehicle , called New Shepard , able to take passengers to the edge of space .
No timescale for commercial trips has been announced but documents released by the US Federal Aviation Administration suggest they could start as early as 2010 .
The latest videos show there is still a lot of development work to do before the company reaches that stage .
My only job at the launch was to open the champagne
Jeff Bezos
The footage shot on 13 November 2006 from a site about 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of El Paso in Texas shows the first craft to launch under the New Shepard programme .
Called Goddard , the retro-looking development vehicle is shown standing on four legs before blasting off in a cloud of smoke from thrusters on its base .
The vehicle continues to ascend for approximately 10 seconds , reaching a height of nearly 300 ft ( 90 m ) .
It then starts to descend before making a controlled landing back on its feet approximately 25 seconds after take - off .
The launch , described by Mr Bezos as " both useful and fun " , was watched by friends , family and a team of engineers .
" My only job at the launch was to open the champagne , " said Mr Bezos .
The website message does not say whether the vehicle contained any passengers or why there was a delay between the launch and release of the footage .
Commercial space
Mr Bezos now hopes to recruit a team of engineers to the New Shepard programme to develop the design and increase the altitude and duration of flights .
Companies like Bigelow Aerospace hope to construct space hotels
In particular , he is looking for " experienced propulsion engineers " and people with " experience on large , modern vehicles such as Delta IV or Atlas V " .
Blue Origin is one of several private companies vying to open up space to the public .
US - based Space Adventures has already taken four space tourists to the International Space Station , while in September 2006 , Sir Richard Branson unveiled a mock - up of a rocket powered vehicle that will carry six passengers and two pilots to an altitude of about 140 km ( 85 miles ) .
His Virgin Galactic design is based on SpaceShipOne , the craft designed by Scaled Composites that won the Ansari X - Prize in 2005 .
The first passengers could take off in 2009 .
Other entrepreneurs jostling for their place in space include hotel tycoon Robert Bigelow who launched Genesis 1 , an experimental inflatable spacecraft , in July 2006 .
Mr Bigelow hopes the water - melon shaped craft could form the basis of a future space hotel .
Correction
MY younger sister has just arrived in New Orleans for the summer after her freshman year at Yale .
She will be consuming daily snowballs , the local icy treat , to ward off the heat , volunteering to help clean up neighborhoods damaged by Hurricane Katrina and working part time , for pay , at both a literary festival and a local restaurant .
Meanwhile , most of her friends from college are headed for the new standard summer experience : the unpaid internship .
Instead of starting out in the mailroom for a pittance , this generation reports for business upstairs without pay .
A national survey by Vault , a career information Web site , found that 84 percent of college students in April planned to complete at least one internship before graduating .
Also according to Vault , about half of all internships are unpaid .
I was an unpaid intern at a newspaper from March 2002 , my senior year , until a few months after graduation .
I took it for granted , as most students do , that working without pay was the best possible preparation for success ; parents usually agree to subsidize their offspring 's internships on this basis .
But what if we 're wrong ?
What if the growth of unpaid internships is bad for the labor market and for individual careers ?
Let 's look at the risks to the lowly intern .
First there are opportunity costs .
Lost wages and living expenses are significant considerations for the two - thirds of students who need loans to get through college .
Since many internships are done for credit and some even cost money for the privilege of placement overseas or on Capitol Hill , those students who must borrow to pay tuition are going further into debt for internships .
So it is today with the new story in the US News and World Report this week .
Their story begins in Galva , Iowa where an ethanol operation has been in production for four years .
The farmer - owned co-operative purchases 8.6 million bushels of corn to produce some 23 million gallons of ethanol a year , and , as the story notes , has returned $ 13 million to the community owners .
( Their success is encouraging other local communities to also join the band wagon , although the Arthur plant is planned to be some 5 times larger ) .
But the article also carries some cautions :
Visiting the Renewable Energy Conference in St Louis last November , it was hard to find ( apart from the chief economist from the Department of Agriculture ) anyone with any doubts that ethanol would be the fuel of the future .
And until very recently , apart from some well argued posts here by Robert and other contributors , it would appear that proponents of ethanol had largely convinced the Powers that Be that this was the wave of the future .
However , even as the President paid homage to the promise of the fuel in his State of the Union , there has been a growing realism appearing in the writings of the Main Stream Media .
Ethanol undoubtedly plays a role in the quest for energy independence and the desire to curb global warming .
But some observers worry that ethanol development may take the place of more effective initiatives : forcing automakers to increase gas mileage , for instance , or mandating cuts in carbon dioxide emissions .
" Some members of Congress are looking for quick fixes , " says one economist who has studied the issue .
" It 's an easy bandwagon to jump on .
But there 's a lot of exaggeration about what ethanol is capable of doing . "
The article also picks up on some of those that have been investing in the business , folks such as Bill Gates , and the Carlyle Group , and these folks have not been shy in their political contributions .
This has , apparently not been lost on those who would lead us , with both Senators McCain and Clinton now being more favorably impressed .
( Interestingly ten years ago when her husband was providing the subsidy , opinions were a tad different .
However the article also picks out the start of a modern resistance movement from industry – the likely players such as Tyson Foods , who use the grain for their own food production , but also Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute .
It also found that coal - fired plants are now beginning to appear , with one , operated by Red Trail Energy and fueled by lignite , opening last month in North Dakota .
The article concludes with some doubting comments about the likely immediate prospects for E - 85 vehicles and a somewhat dim view of cellulosic ethanol .
Given that , in reading the Government ’s Roadmap for this , I noted that there was a need for “ hundreds of experiments ” and that parts of the technology were still “ primitive ” , they are certainly right on that .
As you may have noted , the article has some good new info in it , so go take a read .
Me , well I am reading something else but my colleagues do n’t think it appropriate , so you ’ll just have to guess .
( Grin )
And as we head into a new year of conferences , I note that there is one on Emerging Technologies at UCSB this weekend , with Paul Roberts and Amory Lovens on the schedule – could be interesting .
Hence , the farther back we look into the past , the less we are likely to find , and the more limited are the types of artifacts we can hope to discover .
For a few hundred years of history , we may discover glass and metal , crockery and bones , and ( particularly in arid regions ) , scraps of basketry and fabrics .
For a while longer , there are seeds and pollens , stones and bones .
But soon enough there are only enigmatic stone flakes and tools – not much from which to intuit how a people lived , what they knew , and how they understood themselves , their gods and the world around them .
Of course , archaeology permits us at best to see through a glass very darkly .
Not only are we limited by the vagaries of what has survived through fortuitous chance , but by the fact that few materials used in daily life are designed for long - term survival under harsh conditions .
As a result , not much has been consistently preserved from before the last millennia other than a limited number of works of art , personal adornment and handwritten books , records and plays .
For more , we must grub around in the ruins of palaces and hovels to see what has survived the unforgiving embrace of dirt , or search about in the more preserving , but much less accessible , chilly depths of the sea .
For more than 200 years , moderns have sought to divine the life stories of the ancients through the practice of archaeology .
Through such efforts , we can learn something about the quotidian existence of not only those prehistorians that left no written descriptions of their daily lives , but also of our more recent forebears , who rarely saw fit to tell us what they ate for breakfast or which penny dreadfuls and broadsheets they liked to read .
But surely we must know all we need to know about the post - Gutenberg era ?
Well , not really , as so little that may be of interest in the future seems to have much value in the moment to those that own it ( the contents of your garbage can as you read this , for example ) .
How great the gap can be between those two perceptions can be demonstrated by the archaeology projects that are ongoing at any point in time .
Those efforts include simple explorations of the contents of privies that stood in the backyards of colonial Boston , and far more ambitious efforts to investigate , and even raise , ships from the last century .
If such is the case , certainly there must be some better way to preserve the reality of modern existence , thereby avoiding the future need to use trowels and screens , laboratory analysis and intuition to recreate what has so recently been real ?
In fact , there is .
Consider this :
Given a sufficient amount of server space and the commitment to maintain it , a resource already exists that may not only sound the death knell of archaeology , but also the opportunity to enable a greater depth and sophistication of anthropology than has ever existed before .
So radical an innovation would this new anthropological methodology represent that it deserves its own name .
Call it Wikipediology .
Is the Wikipedia sufficiently comprehensive to replace the tangible record of the past as a subject of study ?
According to the Wikipedia 's description of itself as of 18:14 UST on October 29 , 2006 ( the entry was last updated at 15:18 UST the same day ) , this most dynamic of all on - line resources currently hosts more than 5 million articles ( over 1.4 million entries in the English - language version alone ) .
In all , there are 229 language editions , sixteen of which already have more than 50,000 articles each .
But , you may ask next , is the Wikipedia accurate enough ?
After all , there is an ongoing controversy over whether its accuracy is the equal of a traditional encyclopedia .
That question , I think , entirely misses the point .
Why ?
Because I believe that the real significance of the Wikipedia is not its status as a compendium of information , but rather its ability to provide a record of how we see ourselves , our heritage , our current events and our culture in real - time as those perceptions evolve .
And that significance clearly transcends the utility of the static , shelf - bound reference works traditionally described as encyclopedias .
I would encourage you to consider this definition of the Wikipedia , which captures the importance of the Wikipedia more concisely :
The Wikipedia is the most detailed , comprehensive , concise , culturally - sensitive record of how humanity understands itself at any precise moment in time
Viewed in this light , when the Wikipedia is " inaccurate " due to bias or limited understanding rather than simple error , it becomes more interesting because it is inaccurate .
Looked at from this perspective , the word " inaccurate " ceases to have any meaning , because the Wikipedia is being used to determine how we see the world , and not whether that view is " accurate " in any empirical sense .
In this light , the more accurate an entry is , the less useful and interesting it becomes .
And , of course , what those that contribute to a given entry have found to be worth including is most interesting of all .
But wait ( as they say ) – there 's more !
Since the Wikipedia exists in many non-identical , language - based independent editions , each of which is constantly changing , all of the editions taken together provide a real - time record of not only how our perception of ourselves morphs over time , but how that perception differs culturally around the world as well .
Let 's conduct a simple test to determine what the Wikipedia would tell a future Wikipediologist in a few moments , as compared to what a tradtional archaeologist could only guess after significantly greater labor .
We 'll use this brief account of the contents of Katherine Nanny 's late 17th century privy in what is now downtown Boston .
That account provides no end of interesting guesses about the life of Ms. Nanny , an evidently feisty personage who divorced her husband in 1671 , accusing him of ( among other bad acts ) " whoredomes , " and " abuses of the marriage bed . "
For example , do the scraps of fine material indicate that Katherine dumped her husband 's clothes down the chute rather than send them to her faithless husband when he requested them , after absconding with the pregnant servant girl ?
Or perhaps that she simply made the family 's clothes ?
That the Nanny 's were comfortably well off , or that Katherine was a seamstress for the well - to - do ?
Or what of this ?
Most intriguing of all were 250,000 seeds and pits from fruits , nuts , and spices , analyzed by Lawrence Kaplan and Marie Mansfield King of the University of Massachusetts , Boston .
Cherry and plum pits made up 95 percent of the total , far more than any normal household would consume .
Was Nanny making brandied cherries , or a steeped alcoholic drink called cherry bounce ?
" It looks like she was making preserves , " says state archaeologist Brona Simon .
" I think it was her business , a cottage industry . "
" There had to be something going on , " Bob Hasenstab agrees , speculating that granary weevils , pollen , spoiled flour , and cherry pits meant Nanny was baking cherry pies .
Intriguing though these guesses may be ( or not , depending on how you feel about granary weevils ) , merely guesses they must remain .
Note also that analyses such as these obscure the true purpose of archaeology to begin with , which is not to determine how Katherine Nanny in particular spent her time towards the end of the 1600s , but what life was like in general in Boston at that time .
And the contents of one privy , no matter how interesting , do not a cultural portrait of an entire people make .
Now let 's consult the Wikipedia to see how it would compare , using a Wikipedia definition of an archaeological artifact commonly found from the same period : the spoon .
Likely enough Nanny 's three - holer ( a commodius facility , to be sure ) must have yielded at least one spoon , which could have been interesting from its style , composition ( silver or pewter ) and maker 's mark , if any .
But beyond that – not much .
In contrast , consider the following extracts from the Wikipedia entry on this humble implement
Extract from " Uses " :
" Teaspoons are commonly employed by heroin addicts to " cook " the drug in by use of holding a flame underneath .
The resulting liquified heroin is then transferred to a syringe and injected .
As of the 1940s , a combination utensil of spoon and fork , the spork , has been in use .
Likewise , small , often flat , disposable wooden spoons are commonly given away with ice cream , cakes , and malts for use during their consumption .
The runcible spoon is a spork with a cutting edge like a knife .
Partial list from " Spoon Types , " with separate supporting entries in each case :
Try and pull that richness of cultural and factual detail out of a privy !
But there is also more in this single entry , weaving together idioms and everyday practices , and much more , encapsulating within a single Webpage a snapshot of early 21st century life that incorporates details otherwise doomed to disappear beyond the horizon of time sooner rather than later .
Such as the following sampling :
culinary chef haute cuisine high end
In theworld , a " spoon " is a restaurant owned and opened by a notablewho sets the restaurant 's overall tone and menu , but who largely leaves the day - to - day management to others while the chef operates one or more principal ( ) restaurants .
Spoons are less expensive , but offer many recipes from therestaurant .
Wooden spoon Cambridge University tripos is a phrase used to describe the " achievement " of a team or individual in finishing last in a contest , a wooden spoon being a common and almost valueless object , in stark contrast to the contest winners who will often receive a trophy made of silver or similar precious metal .
The term originates from , wherein professors used to dangle a wooden spoon humiliatingly before students who had failed their
The Tick Spoon !
Is the battle cry of the cartoon hero parody
Of course ,
There are also links to other significant resources , including the many quotes – both humorous and non - that can be found at Wikiquote , each focusing on the word " spoon . "
Does all of this add up to simple collection of disconnected trivia ?
Perhaps .
But in the anthropological sense , another name for a " simple collection of disconnected trivia " is " culture . "
In contrast to the contents of a privy or a shipwreck , each virtual artifact comes with its connotations intact , supplied through electronic links .
And in real time , too : our spoon entry was last edited only two days ago .
I personally believe that the Wikipedia is too important a cultural resource to risk losing .
As a result , I have a suggestion to make to one of the preeminent beneficiaries of the rise of the advent of the Web , I propose that Google partner with the Wikipedia to archive and maintain the entire Wikipedia at some regular interval - not less than annually – and make the copies available to the public indefinitely , perhaps creating and endowing a trust to fulfill that mission , and giving it a suitably grandiloquent name .
The " History of Humanity Project " might do nicely .
Enabling future Wikipediologists to compare how a given entry changes over time , and how entries on the same topic in different languages compare at the same time , could offer a depth of understanding and study undreamed of in the history of the world .
How about it Larry and Sergey ?
What do you think ?
Oh yes .
There remains , of course , one final question .
What of the romance of archaeology ?
If the Wikipedia is the ultimate crystal ball within which all may be seen , will technology have once again made our world a more comprehensible , but less pleasantly mysterious place in which to exist ?
After all , I think not .
One need only look once again to the Wikipedia entry on the humble spoon , and find reassurance in an external link to " The Spoon Project . "
The description of the link explains simply ( and , as it happens , comprehensively ) that The Spoon Project presents a " Gallery of people with spoons on their noses . "
Perhaps the significance of this creative endeavor will be instantly comprehensible to future Wikipediologists , who will immediately place it into its proper socio-economic and political context .
But I 'm betting not .

All this attention was not part of some grand plan .
In fact , Mr. Adrià says , in the beginning he had no plan ; like so many careers , his began unintentionally .
As a teenager , he said , he “ accidentally ” got a job washing dishes in a classic French restaurant in Barcelona , where the chef , a friend of his father , “ made me memorize Escoffier . ”
A year later , at 18 , he was bouncing from Ibiza to Barcelona to the countryside , “ working in kitchens ” — mostly as a line cook — “ but thinking about women . ”
In 1983 he arrived at El Bulli , then a French restaurant .
Soon thereafter , the head chef quit , taking almost the entire staff with him .
Mr. Adrià persuaded the manager to give him a shot at taking over .
Business had already turned bad , so there was little to lose .
And so Mr. Adrià — at 21 — began to create his own cuisine .
Not that he had any idea how this was going to happen , beyond an unyielding curiosity that made him question why food was cooked the way it was cooked .
One key was his recognition that in the creative world traditions are made to be broken .
Mr. Adrià ’s idea , as he describes it , was simply to “ do new things with old concepts . ”
So , seeing chicken curry as a concept and determining to do something that had n’t been done before , he developed a dish , now famous , in which the sauce is solid and the chicken liquid .
Over the years such attempts brought him increased attention , though more in Spain than elsewhere in Europe , and more there than in the States .
In fact , 10 years ago I was walking down a street with the food writer Colman Andrews , who has written extensively about Catalan cuisine , when he asked , “ Have you heard of this chef outside of Barcelona who ’s doing smoke mousse ? ” ( Mr. Adrià was passing wood smoke through a condensing coil to make real liquid smoke . )
I had not .
In 1997 Michelin gave El Bulli three stars , and in 1999 Mr. Robuchon made his proclamation .
One result was the kind of worldwide attention that descends upon stars , though Mr. Adrià , either modestly or disingenuously , refuses to acknowledge its impact .
MySpace Issues Cease & Desist To MySpace Domain Sites
The MySpace legal team has sent out Cease & Desist letters to the owners of domain names and web sites which use the MySpace name .
Sites such as MySpaceCity.com , MySpaceAdds.com , and MySpaceSupport.com have received such letters which are threatening legal action against those sites for use of the MySpace brand in the domain name .
This may be a case of big boy bullying and intimidation since most of these sites do a good job of differentiating themselves from Rupert Murdoch ’s MySpace – in line to be the Yahoo / MTV / Google / Blinkx of News Corp .
Ironically , such sites offer tools and downloads to a very loyal MySpace community including layouts , graphics and image hosting .
Here is a copy of the MySpace Cease & Desist letter as sent to MySpaceSupport.com :

As you may have guessed , the Cease & Desist letters from MySpace have upset owners of MySpace support and skins sites and have left some a bit confused as to their legal rights .
Ryan of MySpaceCity.com writes on SitePoint Forums :
“ I recieved a C&D aswell for MySpaceCity.com .
They pretty much told me to shut down the site and give them the domain name .
I will shut down the site and just direct the current traffic to a new domain .
I think is outrageous hense they are trying to claim damages while these sites promote MySpace so much everyday .
I am debating on either getting a lawyer and taking them to court , this will in return give me around 6 months more of my site running and collecting revenue , then just give them the domain , heh .
They have no right to take my domain name from me .
They have the right to get the site shut down , that ’s how I am looking at this . ”

The Cease & Desist orders also come on the heels of Murdoch ’s News Corp announcing some new bells & whistles to their MySpace adoptive child which they hope to be the center of their new Social Media web empire .
Mike Boland writes on Local Media Journal that Rupert Murdoch has announced the integration of downloadable video , VoIP and IM to MySpace , which News Corp. acquired for $ 580 million in July .
These moves are intended to drive use of the wildly popular social networking site and boost ad revenues ( its main revenue stream ) .
Free video , IM and voice are hoped to create more stickiness among MySpace users , in addition to increasing traffic and driving ad revenues .
The site has a total of 47 million users and is adding about a million per week .
Its average user age is 20 , a demographic projected to be heavy users of video , IM and voice .
Indeed , MySpace users already have a proven interest in music content and social networking , which these new offerings will each address in some way .
I really like this sentence in Mike ’s write up “ In fact , since News Corp. acquired MySpace , I ’ve been waiting to see what it will do to screw up the site . ”
Essentially meaning , when is News Corp going to try and sneak in some really bad advertising or co-registration plan which will p!ss off the loyal MySpace users and start a Mecca to some new service like Xanga ?
I wonder if the Cease & Desist and attempted shut downs of independently owned MySpace support and tool sites is a first step to doing so .
U.S. military bomb technicians will be getting some pre-deployment training in crime scene investigations from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , the bureau announced Tuesday .
Under an expanded program with the Defense Department , an ATF special agent certified explosives specialist will join the staff of the military 's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization Joint Center of Excellence at Ft. Irwin , Calif .
The agent will train military bomb techs in post - blast investigations and homemade explosives .
The program was launched last year in a memorandum of agreement between the two agencies .
Part of the special agent's job will be to instruct military investigators about ATF 's role in an interagency organization that investigates bombings in Iraq .
That organization , dubbed the Combined Explosives Exploitation Cell , or CEXC , analyzes IED debris found at blast sites and sends IED components back to the Justice Department 's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center in the United States for further analysis .
The program also calls for ATF to train six classes of military bomb technicians this year at its National Center for Explosives Training and Research at Ft. A.P. Hill , Va. , and elsewhere .
ATF is also developing a course on homemade explosives , which have plagued the American military operation in Iraq since the war began .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Senate Appropriations Committee the same day that IEDs are responsible for 70 percent of U.S. military deaths in Iraq .
Gates said no matter how many methods or technologies the U.S. military develops to thwart these attacks , the enemy always finds a way around them .
DOD is asking Congress for $ 2.4 billion to fund research into technologies to counter roadside bombs .
ATF has also trained Iraqi police officers in explosives disposal and investigation and provides data on IED incidents to DFuze , an international and multilingual database about bomb and arson incidents throughout the world .
Crime scene investigation has become an interesting and challenging new mission for the military as it attempts to reverse the escalating trend in violence in Baghdad .
I hinted at the military 's new CSI function in The Cutting Edge column of the March issue of DTI , which referred to the Defense Department 's Automated Biometric Identification System , or ABIS .
ABIS is a database of biometric data collected in the war on terrorism , and includes , for example , fingerprints from the remnants of improvised explosive devices in Iraq .
The item in The Cutting Edge was about how the U.S. Navy is testing handheld biometrics kits to screen sailors on commercial vessels against these fingerprint databases .
The kits were acquired through DOD 's Biometrics Task Force and are backpackable for easy use during at - sea interdictions .

Mrs Sirleaf says she want to bring motherly sensitivity to her job
The 67 - year - old grandmother said she hoped her win would " raise the participation of women not just in Liberia but also in Africa " .
" It 's a historical phenomenon , which is going to be an example to other African countries ...
I could scream my heart out , " Nigerian politician Sarah Jubril told the BBC's World Today programme .
So is Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf 's apparent victory the start of a trend ?
Ugandan academic Sylvia Tamale says African patriarchal societies like to see women firmly in their place .
She quotes a Ugandan man at a woman candidate 's parliamentary campaign rally in 1996 asking : " Have you ever heard a hen crow ? "
Yet , despite these traditional values , African women can crow success on a number of fronts .
Leading the world
For the past two years Rwanda has led the world in parliamentary representation for women .
Everything starts with the people and women are the ones that hold the key to bring change
Ope Ogundokun
Nigerian student
Read Ope 's perspective Viewpoints : Role of women
Its case is more unusual given the large number of people , educated and moneyed , who returned from the diaspora after the 1994 genocide - but it does reflect the trend in countries moving from post - colonial turmoil to multi-party democracy .
In rankings compiled by the Inter - Parliamentary Union , Mozambique , South Africa and Burundi have more than 30 % of parliamentary seats held by women , compared to an average of 19 % for their contemporaries in Europe .
New constitutions like those adopted in Burundi and Rwanda ensure ethnic and gender quotas , while political parties like South Africa 's ruling African National Congress have quotas for women candidates .
Grassroots
Affirmative action has it critics , but as Kulah Balo - a woman farmer in Sinje village in Liberia - illustrates things are changing even in remote areas .
Maathai was the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize
" Women are becoming more involved in making decisions in the village .
Before , when the men held public gatherings here , they told us women to stay behind .
If we went , they would n't let us say anything , " she told the BBC .
Mrs Balo says with more educated women in the public eye , ordinary Liberian women have been given a sense of empowerment .
" Before whatever the man said would go but now both husband and wife take decisions together . "
And it was fighting a cause for ordinary women that won Kenya environmentalist and politician Wangari Maathai international recognition .
Known for her tree - planting campaigns , last year she was awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize for promoting social , economic and cultural reforms .
Mrs Sirleaf and Mrs Maathai share - as well as iron determination - a feminine approach to politics .
Mrs Sirleaf says she wants " to bring motherly sensitivity and emotion to the presidency " as a way of healing the wounds of war .
Queen - makers
Feminine sensitivity , however , is not something that is immediately associated with Zimbabwe 's Vice - President Joyce Mujuru , whose nom de guerre during the 1970s liberation struggle was " Spill Blood " .
Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala was once vice - president of the World Bank
Analysts believe she was picked as President Robert Mugabe 's number two last year , not only because she is from his ethnic clan but because her husband , Solomon Mujuru , once led the army and can still guarantee their loyalty .
This is a slight role - reversal .
In the past , it was by pulling strings from behind the scenes that women managed to exercise power .
In Rwanda , former first lady Agathe Kanziga , married to the late President Juvenal Habyarimana , and her family kept a firm grip on the steering wheel until 1994 .
' Iron Ladies '
But despite concerns about Mrs Mujuru 's leadership qualities , she has earned respect for going back to school to finish her education as well as taking up a ministerial post after independence in 1980 .
We [ women ] are in the majority
Zambian presidential hopeful Edith Nawakwi
After Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf , a former World Bank economist , perhaps Africa 's most powerful woman is Nigeria 's feisty Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala .
A one time vice - president of the World Bank , she is waging war on corruption in Nigeria and has negotiated a debt relief deal worth $ 18bn ( £ 10 bn ) .
Mozambique 's Prime Minister Luisa Dias Diogo is another former World Bank employee , who shares the nickname " Iron Lady " with Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf .
In a strange coincidence , Mrs Johnson - Sirleaf will be Liberia 's second female head - of - state , after Ruth Perry who acted as a transitional leader for a short time in the late 1990s .
Competition
Another concern for African women campaigners is that women are often raised to see each other as competitors .
Luisa Dias Diogo is tipped to be Mozambique 's president one day
Without unity , Zambia 's National Women Lobby Group argues that women will have no hope of capturing the presidency next year .
This week the umbrella group announced it was backing the candidacy of the FDD 's Edith Nawakwi .
" This is the first time the women 's movement has clearly indicated to the country that it needs to take seriously the issue of having a female president , " Ms Nawakwi said - urging women to go and register to vote .
" We are in the majority . "
Despite the fact women are a majority in Africa , to gain a meaningful mandate they need the respect of their male constituents and colleagues .
Ingredients
Even high - ranking female politicians can sometimes be treated with little or no respect .
Three years ago , Uganda 's then Vice - President Specioza Kazibwe revealed that she had been forced to leave her husband after he had assaulted her .
The revelation caused a stir in Uganda , where wife - beating is not uncommon .
In Liberia , Mrs Sirleaf will need to win over the ex-combatants , who largely favoured the brawn of her opponent , the ex-footballer George Weah .
With so many obstacles , female politicians in Africa must often feel it is almost impossible to get to the top .
But Mozambique 's Prime Minister Diogo - tipped one day to be president - says she just treats it like a Mozambican woman who has to create a meal for a large family , often without ingredients .
While just about everybody -- left and right -- agrees that poverty is unacceptable ( although policy makers disagree as to whether a minimum wage hike would help or hurt the working poor ) , conservatives do not share liberals ' concern about income inequality .
According to the 2005 Maxwell Poll on Civic Engagement and Inequality , self - described liberals are more than twice as likely as conservatives to say income inequality in America is a " serious problem . "
And while 84 % of liberals think the government should do more to reduce inequality , only 25 % of conservatives agree .
This is empirical substantiation for the old cliché that conservatives just do n't care about the poor , right ?
Wrong .
In fact , the data do not tell us that conservatives are uncaring ; they actually tell us that conservatives are optimists .
Conservatives are relatively untroubled by inequality , and unsupportive of government income redistribution , because they believe the American economy provides private opportunities to succeed .
Liberals are far more pessimistic than conservatives about the possibility of a better future for Americans of modest means .
Consider the evidence .
While 92 % of conservatives believe that hard work and perseverance can help a person overcome disadvantage , only 65 % of liberals think so .
This difference of opinion , contrary to the convention , is not because conservatives earn more money .
In fact , lower - income conservatives are about twice as likely as upper - income liberals to say they think there 's " a lot " of upward mobility in America .
If a liberal and a conservative are exactly identical in income , education , sex , family situation , and race , the conservative will be 20 percentage points more likely than the liberal to say that hard work leads to success among the disadvantaged .
US researchers made the discovery by studying the behaviour of Asian elephants in front of a tall mirror .
One of the animals repeatedly touched a white cross painted on her forehead - a classic test used to assess mirror self - recognition in children and apes .
The study is reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We see highly complex behaviours such as self awareness and self - other distinction in intelligent animals with well - established social systems , " said Joshua Plotnik , from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center , Emory University , Atlanta , Georgia .
" The social complexity of the elephant , its well - known altruistic behaviour and , of course , its huge brain , made the elephant a logical candidate species for testing in front of a mirror . "
' X ' marks the spot
Many animals will respond to a mirror but very few show any evidence that they recognise themselves in the reflection .
Canines , for example , will react to the " other dog " and will even look behind the mirror to try to find it .
' Happy ' passed the ' X ' test
The Asian elephants in this study also displayed this type of behaviour when standing in front of a 2.5 m - by - 2.5 m mirror - they inspected the rear and brought food close to the mirror for consumption .
But one of the elephants , called " Happy " , went to the next level : she began repeatedly touching a painted " X " on her head with her trunk .
The mark could only be seen in the mirror , and the elephant ignored another mark made with colourless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling .
While only one elephant passed the mark - touching test , the researchers note that fewer than half of chimpanzees tested typically pass this test .
A clever club
" Elephants have been tested in front of mirrors before but previous studies used relatively small mirrors kept out of the elephants ' reach , " said Plotnik .
" This study is the first to test the animals in front of a huge mirror they could touch , rub against and try to look behind . "
Few animals show self - awareness
Co-researcher Frans de Waal said : " As a result of this study , the elephant now joins a cognitive elite among animals commensurate with its well - known complex social life and high level of intelligence .
" Although elephants are far more distantly related to us than the great apes , they seem to have evolved similar social and cognitive capacities , making complex social systems and intelligence part of this picture .
" These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex sociality and cooperation . "
The study , conducted with the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , used elephants housed at the Bronx Zoo in New York .
Why C++?
By Kyle Wilson
Saturday , July 15 , 2006
A number of different on - line forums ( most notably the SWEng - GameDev mailing list ) have seen recent discussion of whether C++ is a wise language choice for game development .
When people have to make that decision in the real world , the dominance of C++ has been overwhelming .
But if on - line discussion is any indication , there 's also a good deal of dissatisfaction with that choice .
The attacks on C++ come on two flanks .
From the low - level side comes the argument that the language supports too high a level of abstraction , and that we should go back to programming in straight C .
This argument holds that writing efficient code in C is easier than writing efficient code in C++ because the level of information hiding afforded by C++ hides inefficiencies from cursory perusal .
For example , in C , you can read the line a = b + c ; and know that a , b and c are primitive types and that the addition and the assignment will generate , at most , a few lines of assembly code .
In C++ , a , b and c could be objects of any size calling overloaded addition and assignment operators that might generate still more temporary objects , allocate memory , call sleep ( ) , reformat your hard drive , etc .
The only safe way to prevent such shenanigans is to disable compiler support for C++ language features entirely .
The other camp of C++ criticism compares it to higher - level languages and finds C++ wanting .
This camp holds that C++ suffers under the burden of backwards compatibility and slow ANSI / ISO standard evolution .
It lacks features found in more modern languages , such as aspects , closures , garbage collection , reflection , and native support for concurrency .
The paleolithic C++ physical structure --.h include files and .cpp implementation files -- results in achingly slow build times and forces programmers to write every function definition twice , once where it 's declared in the header and once where it 's defined .
We would be better off , according to this argument , writing our games in C# , Eiffel or Objective Caml .
Remarkably , the two sides do n't even disagree .
Instead , the sentiment is commonly expressed that straight C is the way to go for core engine code while less - performance - critical gameplay code should be written in a high - level scripting language ( for a cogent expression of this opinion , see this post by Robert Blum in the SWEng - GameDev thread ) .
C++ falls awkwardly in the middle , a jack of all trades and master of none .
Given all this discontent ...
Why C ++?
Why has it been so successful , and does the language deserve to see that success continue ?
First , I 'll get the meta - reason out of the way : Nothing succeeds like success .
The fact that C++ is the dominant language for game development gives it a lot of inertia .
If you want to hire experienced programmers , it 's much easier to recruit C++ gurus than it is to find OCaml talent .
If you 're going to develop for consoles , Microsoft and Sony provide C++ compilers , but for any other language you 're on your own .
And if you want to link with middleware , most modern game middleware packages -- including Gamebryo , Havok , FMOD , SpeedTree and the Unreal Engine - - are written in C ++.
Developing in another language , even C , is a lonely path .
The power of the C++ network effect is not to be underestimated .
For example , Naughty Dog used an in - house LISP variant called GOAL ( Game Oriented Assembly Lisp ) for the Jak and Daxter titles .
They had a significant investment in GOAL , for which they 'd written their own compiler , linker and debugger .
They supported dynamic reloading of code by a running game and reportedly generated tight , efficient assembly .
After their acquisition by Sony , however , Naughty Dog were forced to transition to C++ development .
" Sony wants us to be able to share code with other studios , and this works both ways - both other studios using our code and vice versa , " posted Naughty Dog lead programmer Scott Shumaker .
But rather than dwelling on the advantages that derive from its existing popularity , I 'd like to focus on the inherent strengths of C++ for game development .
In doing that , it 's important to understand how and why C++ evolved into the language it is today .
C++ grew out of C. C was a systems programming language that co-evolved with the Unix operating system and that gained popularity as Unix spread .
C was tight , close to the metal .
You can look at a C function and tell almost exactly what assembly will result from compilation .
C++ adds layers of abstraction .
C++ began as a set of extensions to C to add support for the object - oriented concepts found in Simula , classes and inheritance .
As creator Bjarne Stroustrup writes in his C++ FAQ , " Since 1987 or so , the focus of development the C++ language and its associated programming styles have been the use of templates , static polymorphism , generic programming , and multiparadigm programming . "
C++ continues to evolve to support new design paradigms .
The growth and evolution of C++ has been a mixed blessing .
On the one hand , C++ is truly a language for multi-paradigm development : the language supports generic , imperative and object - oriented programming .
Any C++ program , or part of a C++ program , can be written in the appropriate style to best model a particular problem domain .
On the other hand , C++ has been a victim of its own success .
As new core language and standard library features have been added to meet new needs , programming in C++ has become a powerful but complicated business .
It 's easy to hire people who call themselves C++ programmers , but engineers who understand both the low - level details of the C++ object model and the compile - time power of C++ template metaprogramming are hard to come by .
And C++ , in the hands of an programmer without a good grasp of the language , is a dangerous thing .
Despite this risk , I think that the answer is better education , not a wholesale rush back to programming in C .
Because in the right hands , C++ is a more powerful , safer , and -- yes , really - - more efficient language than C is .
More powerful ?
Every C game I 've seen has re-implemented virtual function tables with structs stuffed full of function pointers .
C++ has native support for object - oriented code .
The language 's native syntax allows expression that 's closer to a programmer 's intention .
C++ template metaprogramming is vastly more capable than macro coding with the C preprocessor .
And the C++ standard library offers a broad array of containers and algorithms .
You 're likely to be able to implement any given task with less code in C++ , from low - level bit shuffling to high - level state logic .
Safer ?
In C , if we write # define MAX ( A , B ) ( ( A ) > ( B ) ) ? ( A ) : ( B ) )
MAX ( x++ ,2 ) then x will be incremented twice after macro expansion .
The inlined templatized C++ std::max ( ) function is equally efficient and free of such unpleasant side - effects .
The lack of templates in C encourages passing structs through void pointers , as in the unfortunate standard library qsort ( ) function .
This predilection for void * undercuts the protections of the type - safety system and turns easily - caught compile - time errors into hard - to - find runtime errors .
In C , the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization idiom does n't exist .
Scoped locks and smart pointers can't be implemented , so leaks of memory and other resources become much more likely .
More efficient !
The C++ standard 's support of type - based alias analysis allows C++ compilers to elide load and store instructions that compliant C compilers cannot .
( A full discussion of type - based alias analysis is beyond the scope of this article , but see " Type - Based Alias Analysis " in Dr. Dobb 's Journal . )
Inlining allows C++ compilers to generate programs that make fewer function calls and therefore waste less time on function - call overhead .
In combination with templates , functors allow C++ to easily generate efficient inlined custom code at compile time .
This is why the C++ std::sort( ) will beat the perfomance of the C qsort ( ) function every time .
Finally , the C++ standard library containers , though much - criticized by developers , are likely to outperform equivalent code written by junior C coders .
( For that matter , STL containers have outperformed the custom code they replaced in every case where I 've seen data structures switched to use the STL . )
While I prefer C++ to C , I do agree that a C++ engine core works best in combination with gameplay code written in a language that supports a higher level of abstraction .
That 's not because C++ lacks programming constructs of more modern languages , though .
I confess that I have n't worked with aspects or closures enough to even know whether they give great productivity improvements .
I have done enough procedural programming to doubt that code written in a procedural language is going to be inherently more clean and elegant than code written in C ++.
And I 'm generally skeptical of the benefits of garbage collection .
Memory is one resource among many ( file handles , critical section locks , D3D resource reference counts , etc. ) , and a resource management paradigm that only covers memory is of limited use .
( If you think garbage collection " just works , " read this explanation of the complexities inherent in C# finalization . )
No , the compelling advantage that a more abstract language has over C++ is faster iteration time .
The efficiency and power of C++ make it the best language choice for core game engine technology , where runtime efficiency is important and iteration time is not .
For gameplay code , however , those requirements are reversed .
The ability to iterate quickly on gameplay and get immediate feedback on design changes is paramount .
But gameplay logic executes infrequently compared to physics or graphics routines , so highly - optimized native - code inner loops are less important .
For rapid iteration , you want a simple language that compiles quickly or does n't need to be compiled at all .
You want to be able to make changes and see their effect immediately in - game , without having to restart , or even reload a level .
You do not want the daunting features of C++ that make experienced programmers pause to think and make novice programmers write buggy code : pointers , a menagerie of different integer and floating - point types , multiple string representations and manual iteration over containers .
It 's because of these considerations that Lua has become almost as popular in the game industry as C ++-- at least among those game companies that elect to use an off - the - shelf scripting language .
Lua is lightweight , dynamically typed and interpreted .
It 's garbage collected , but as long as all your other resources are owned and managed by code and not script , garbage collection works just fine and saves you the headache of dealing with memory allocation .
So I hate to admit it , but I come down on the side of conventional wisdom .
Write your game engine in C ++.
Write your gameplay in Lua .
Those might not be the right answers for the next generation .
I can imagine a language with better support for concurrency stealing the application domain from C++ sometime in the next decade .
And C# / Mono is nipping at Lua 's heels as a game scripting language already .
But for now , I think the C++/ Lua combination is as good as it gets .

Research in monkeys suggests that a new drug can temporarily improve performance and reverse the effects of sleep deprivation on the brain , which would be a breakthrough in helping shift workers , health professionals , military personnel and others who must function at top performance in spite of sleep deficits .
“ In addition to improving performance under normal conditions , the drug restored performance that was impaired after sleep loss , ” said Samuel Deadwyler , Ph.D. , senior researcher , from Wake Forest University School of Medicine .
“ Brain imaging revealed that one basis for the drug ’s effects was to reverse changes in brain patterns induced by sleep deprivation . ”
The study ’s results are reported on - line today in the journal Public Library of Science - Biology .
The drug , currently known as CX717 , is designed to act on a type of receptor located throughout the brain that is involved in cell - to - cell communication .
It has been tested in sleep - deprived humans with positive results , according to the developer , Cortex Pharmaceuticals .
The Wake Forest research was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , as part of a larger effort to mitigate or eliminate the effect of sleep deprivation on military personnel , and by the National Institutes of Health .
In addition to Deadwyler , the research team included Linda J. Porrino , Ph.D. , James Daunais , Ph.D. , Robert Hampson , Ph.D. , from the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Wake Forest , and Gary Rogers from Cortex Pharmaceuticals .
The researchers first tested normal , alert monkeys on a matching task similar to a video game .
Each monkey was shown one clip art picture at one position on the screen , and after a delay of one to 30 seconds , picked the original out of a random display of two to six different images to get a juice reward .
The monkeys were then given varying doses of the drug and re-tested .
At the highest dose tested , the drug improved performance to near perfect for the easier trials and by about 15 percent overall .
Next , the monkeys were tested after they were sleep - deprived for 30 to 36 hours , which Deadwyler estimates is equivalent to humans going 72 hours without sleep .
When compared to when they were alert , the monkeys ’ overall performance was reduced under all test conditions , even on the easiest trials .
But , when the monkeys were again sleep - deprived and re-tested after being given CX717 , their performance was restored to normal levels .
The researchers used positron emission tomography ( PET ) to gain images of brain activity while the animals were performing the matching task .
These scans showed that the drug was able to reverse most of the changes in activity patterns that occurred with sleep deprivation – which may explain its success at increasing performance .
The PET images showed that when the monkeys were performing the task while sleep - deprived , activity in the frontal cortex , an area of the brain associated with higher mental processing , decreased and activity in the temporal lobe , associated with memory for recent events , increased .
The researchers suspect that this might be the brain ’s way of compensating for the effects of sleep deprivation .
After the drug was administered , the brain patterns in these regions returned to normal .
“ The effect was to reverse the patterns of activation to the same as when the animal performed the task under normal conditions , ” Deadwyler said .
“ The drug did n’t cause overall brain arousal , but increased the ability of certain affected areas to become active in a normal , non-sleep - deprived manner . ”
The drug , known as an ampakine , is designed to target AMPA receptors that are located throughout the brain .
These receptors are part of the cellular communication process that involves the neurotransmitter glutamate .
The drug prolongs the action of glutamate , allowing more effective communication .
Because the drug acts differently from caffeine and other stimulants , it does not seem to result in side effects such as hyperactivity , distorted thinking or extended wakefulness .
“ It ’s possible that ampakines could also be used to enhance other cognitive deficits , such as occur in Alzheimer ’s disease , after a stroke or other forms of dementia , ” Deadwyler said .

We all know that the company Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded a mere eight years ago is one of the new century 's most cunning enterprises .
If there were any lingering doubts , 2005 erased them .
Google 's sales jumped an estimated 50 percent to $ 6 billion , its profits tripled to a projected $ 1.6 billion , and Wall Street answered with an unprecedented vote of confidence : a $ 120 billion market cap , a share price soaring above $ 400 , and a price / earnings ratio close to 70 .
That 's a huge bet on future growth that seems unthinkable during the postbubble period .
But in Google ( Research ) 's case , the exuberance is rational .
That 's because Brin , Page , and CEO Eric Schmidt cornered online advertising :
They 've made it precision - targeted and dirt cheap .
U.S. companies still devote more ad dollars to the Yellow Pages than to the Internet ( which accounts for less than 5 percent of overall ad spending ) .
Yet Americans now spend more than 30 percent of their media - consuming time surfing the Web .
When the ad dollars catch up to the trend , a mountain of cash awaits , and Google is positioned like no one else to scoop it up .
Even if Google has to share that payday with rivals like Microsoft ( Research ) and Yahoo ( Research ) , the company has an edge , with storage space and sheer processing power -- an estimated 150,000 servers and counting -- that will enable it to do just about anything it wants with the Web .
And boy , does this company want .
It signed up about eight new hires per day in 2005 -- a lot of them from Microsoft , many among the smartest people on the planet at what they do .
Google is on track to spend more than $ 500 million on research and development in 2006 , and last year it launched more free products in beta than in any previous year .
Name any long - term technology bet you can think of -- genome - tailored drugs , artificial intelligence , the space elevator -- and chances are , there 's a team in the Googleplex working on an application .
Which raises the most widely debated question in business :
What kind of company will Google become in the coming decades ?
Will it succumb to hubris and flame out like so many of its predecessors ?
Or will it grow into an omnipresent , omnipotent force -- not just on Wall Street or the Web , but in society ?
We put the question to scientists , consultants , former Google employees , and tech visionaries like Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Wolfram .
They responded with well - argued , richly detailed , and sometimes scary visions of a Google future .
On the following pages , we 've compiled four very different scenarios for the company .
Each details an extreme , but plausible , outcome .
In three of them , Google attains monopolistic power , lording over the media , the Internet , and scientific development itself .
In the fourth , Google withers and dies .
That may seem unthinkable now , but nobody is immune to arrogant missteps .
Not even the smartest business minds of 2005 .

Next : Scenario 1 : Google is the media
Plus : Google is the Internet , Google is dead , Google is God
Hey you , get a first life , eh ?
First off , I am not a Second Life hater .
Let me say that again : I am not a Second Life hater .
I ’m on record as saying that there ’s something important going on inside the game .
That said , I ’ve been bemused by the amount of hype and attention the game … er …virtual world thingee has received over the past three months .
The media has been on SL like white on rice .
I ’ve only written about SL a couple of times on this site , but I ’ve probably received five enquiries from sundry Canadian news outlets asking if I played , or knew anybody who played , or knew anybody who was making a six figure income from playing , and so forth .
Clay Shirky has done some excellent ( though much - debated ) work evaluating the media ’s reportage on Second Life , and trying to apply some normalcy to the hype .
Second Life , Same Brand
More pointedly , I ’ve been dismayed by the number of companies opening offices in Second Life .
It ’s my impression that a lot of them are n’t wanted , and I ca n’t imagine how what they ’re doing is actually cost effective .
Okay , American Apparel made a big splash because they were first , or seemed to be first , but every company is n’t going to enjoy that media spotlight .
Let me quote Tim Bray , who had a SL event as part of a big Sun announcement :
The Second Life thing , well , I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know .
It was a lot of work to get going and it costs us real money , and then our pavilion can only hold 63 avatars , so the ROI seems questionable .
I think there ’s a lot of corporate hubris at work here , with company ’s companies wanting to appear hip or cutting edge .
Speaking of companies , I think the worst perpetrators are PR agencies and marketing companies ( and , hey , I run one of those ) .
If I ’m building a Brave New World , I do n’t want PR flaks in my utopia .
Here ’s an idea : if you ’re corporate , wait until somebody invites you into SL .
Wait until somebody says ( and this is hard to imagine ) , “ hey , would n’t it be great if we had a few PR agencies around , just in case there was a crisis that needed managing ? ”
Culling the Crowd with Lag
And , let ’s be honest , the game is n’t good enough yet .
It ’s too hard to play .
I watched a veteran computer user and occasional console gamer try to attend an event in SL .
It took her five minutes just to figure out how to sit down on a bench .
And that was with my pathetic help .
And then there ’s the lag I ’ve experienced when playing –it ’s so severe that it actually works as a population control technique , redistributing avatars because a certain zone gets too dense .
After all that , I do think something important ’s happening in the game .
I forget who I ’m quoting here , but whoever makes Second Life 2.0 – where , say , the gameplay is as intuitive as World of Warcraft–is going to have a license to print money .
And , in the future , if it ’s the right thing for a client ( or if I ca n’t convince them against it ) , I ’d consider running an event in SL .
I just wish we could cool off on the hype machine a bit .
Happily , Gartner thinks Second Life is on the edge of the trough of disillusionment .
Light - Hearted Fun
Hence the light - hearted fun that is GetaFirstLife.com .
I think I first heard the phrase yelled by someone inside World of Warcraft , and it stuck with me .
It ’s in the vein of iCryptex , except this time there are t- shirts .
Thanks very much to Heather , Rob , James and Todd for their excellent work as consulting humourists , and to Kris Krug for the pirate children .
I struggled with what should be the correct photo until I remembered this one , and it seemed like the perfect fit .
You can Digg this , if you ’re so inclined , and here ’s a gooofy Technorati tag : secondlife .
UPDATE : Prominent Second Lifer Wagner James
Au points me to a couple of posts on Clay Shirky and the hype .
An interesting axiom : “ The more someone pronounces Second Life over - hyped , the less first - hand experience they tend to have in the world . ”
On that topic , I ’ve tried the game at least twice –possibly three times –but I ’ve probably only put in 5 to 7 hours .
It just did n’t stick for me .
UPDATE # 2 : In case anyone is wondering , “ de hecho , fornica usando tus genitales ” is apparently an accurate translation of “ fornicate using your actual genitals ” .
I know because the site was linked to by a Diggesque site from Spain .
UPDATE # 3 : Got dugg , but the site did n’t fall over .
That ’s credit to Laughing Squid , my new hosting company , and the fact that it got dugg in the middle of the night .
UPDATE # 4 : Speaking of foreign language Diggs , check out the German yigg.de .
Mein lieben .
UPDATE # 5 : I just got what I can only describe as a proceed and permitted letter from Linden Labs in the comments .
UPDATE # 6 : A few people , on Digg and elsewhere , have wondered why a ) it ’s only one page and b ) why the only clickable links go to stuff that me me money .
This was my response on Digg :
It ’s true that I could have made a couple more pages .
But having done a few of these sites , you ’re better to get in and get out quickly –always leave them wanting more , as the saying goes .
It ’s a one - trick humour pony , and I ’m not sure that if I had five pages , that there ’d be five pages worth of funny .
As for the links to purchasing stuff , that ’s absolutely true .
I made icryptex.com last year , and it got a good chunk of traffic , but all I got for that was a bandwidth bill .
So , this time around I wanted to make a little money without having a ridiculously monetized ( and therefore compromised ) site .
UPDATE # 7 : I ’ve never had this many updates on a post .
UPDATE # 8 : Thanks to everybody for all the linkage and nice things you ’re saying .
The best bit is getting mentioned on the BBC ’s web site ( screenshot for posterity ) .
That rocks .
Thanks to Adiana for letting me know about that .
UPDATE #9 : Tom from GiveMeaning sends along this article about Second Life and Ponzi schemes .
UPDATE # 10 : Comments are closed on this post because spammers are bastards .

The Night Earth map shows the lights that are visible at night on the Earth 's surface .
The brightest areas of the Earth are the most urbanized , but not necessarily the most populated ( compare western Europe with China and India ) .
Cities tend to grow along coastlines and transportation networks .
The United States interstate highway system appears as a lattice connecting the brighter dots of city centers .
In Russia , the Trans - Siberian railroad is a thin line stretching from Moscow through the center of Asia to Vladivostok .
The Nile River , from the Aswan Dam to the Mediterranean Sea , is another bright thread through an otherwise dark region .
Some regions remain thinly populated and unlit .
Antarctica is entirely dark .
The interior jungles of Africa and South America are mostly dark .
Deserts in Africa , Arabia , Australia , Mongolia , and the United States are poorly lit as well ( except along the coast and rivers ) , along with the boreal forests of Canada and Russia , and the great mountains of the Himalaya .
Two versions of the images are available :
The main image of the Earth at night ( 2012 ) was captured by NASA using the Suomi National Polar - orbiting Partnership ( Suomi NPP ) satellite .
It took over nine days in April 2012 and thirteen days in October 2012 , during 312 orbits at 824 kilometers ( 512 miles ) to capture the whole Earth .
This satellite uses the “ day - night band ” of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite ( VIIRS ) , which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near - infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as gas flares , auroras , wildfires , city lights , and reflected moonlight .
The original image from 2000 was created by NASA using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program ( DMSP ) 's Operational Linescan System ( OLS ) , originally designed to view clouds by moonlight .
The daylight images provided by Google Maps ( maps and satellite views ) are also available for reference .
The Google Maps API was used for creating the original visualisation .
The 3D map was created using Cesium via OpenLayers and ol - cesium .
This uses imagery from OpenStreetMap , Thunderforest , Bing Maps , and Mapquest .
Geocoding is provided by Google and Nominatim via ol3 - geocoder .
As the maps provided by NASA were in a different projection as the one required by Google Maps , the GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library library was used for the conversion .
While the original image consisted of 87.970 images , the map from 2012 comprises 349.525 images , therefore adding a grand total of 437.495 images for this map .

The aim is to get healthy offspring free of inherited genetic disorders
BBC News explains how and why .
Why are the UK researchers doing it ?
The groundbreaking work aims to prevent mothers from passing certain genetic diseases on to their unborn babies .
The researchers are focusing on a group of conditions called mitochondrial myopathy , which include types of muscular dystrophy .
These cause muscle weakness and wasting , making it difficult to move normally - some may need to use a wheelchair .
At present no treatment for these exists , although things can be done to help with the symptoms .
Is there anything unique about these diseases ?
Yes .
Most genetic diseases result from faults in the DNA of the organ at the heart of the cell , the nucleus .
However , diseases of this type are caused by faulty genetic material contained in different cell structures called mitochondria .
Mitochondria are complex structures , which float in the cytoplasm outside of the nuclei of most cells .
They are responsible for energy production inside the cell - and can be compared to minute batteries .
It is thought that millions of years ago , they were thought to be free - living bacteria , but it is now known they can not exist outside of our cells .
But , because of their unusual heritage , they have their own DNA - which is inherited from the mother only .
It is only a tiny proportion of the total DNA of the cell - 37 genes compared with the 25,000 genes found in the nucleus .
But if these few genes are faulty , the consequences can be devastating .
What do scientists want to do ?
They plan to experiment on a fertilised egg from a woman who carries faulty mitochondrial DNA .
The egg , discarded from IVF treatment , will be at such an early stage of its development that it will still only be formed of one cell .
The scientists will remove tiny structures called pronuclei , which are destined to become the egg 's nucleus .
These will then be put into a fertilised egg from another women with only healthy mitochondrial DNA .
Although this second egg has been fertilised , the pronuclei DNA from the male and female that made this egg will be removed .
The result would be an embryo with pronuclei DNA from the parental egg and sperm but mitochondria - and mitochondrial DNA - from the donor egg .
This embryo would share the over - whelming majority of its DNA - and almost all its physical characteristics - with its parents .
But scientists believe it would also be free of the risk of mitochondrial disease as it would have different mitochondria from its mother .
Why is this controversial ?
Opponents believe it is wrong to experiment with material that has the potential to become a human life .
There are also doubts about the safety of the technique , with concerns about high rates of abnormalities .
The researchers say they have no intention of allowing the embryo to develop into a fully formed baby .
Was permission straightforward ?
No .
Current legislation covering reproductive technology makes no explicit provision for such ground - breaking science , which was not envisaged at the time the original law was drawn up .
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority initially rejected an application to push ahead with the research , ruling that it was not permitted by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 .
However , following an appeal it has now approved the application .

Islam Dar Ayyoub , the 14 year - old who incriminated Tamimi after being unlawfully interrogated , will take the stand tomorrow at the Ofer Military Court .
Tamimi has been incarcerated for seven months , in which only one witness testified .
The Military Prosecution will resume making its case against West Bank protest organizer from Nabi Saleh , Bassem Tamimi , at the Ofer Military Court tomorrow morning .
Fourteen year - old Islam Dar Ayyoub – one of two main witnesses against Tamimi – is scheduled to give evidence to the court tomorrow , despite a motion by the defense to delay it .
The defense has requested the postponement , as procedures by the boy ’s own defense team to rule his testimony inadmissible , have not yet concluded .
Islam Dar Ayyoub , also from Nabi Saleh , was taken from his bed at gunpoint on the night of January 23rd .
In his interrogation the morning after his arrest , Islam alleged that Bassem and Naji Tamimi organized groups of youth into “ brigades ” , charged with different responsibilities during the demonstrations : some were allegedly in charge of stone - throwing , others of blocking roads , etc .
During a trial - within - a - trial procedure in Islam ’s trial , motioning for his testimony to be ruled inadmissible , it was proven that his police interrogation was fundamentally flawed and violated the rights set forth in the Israeli Youth Law in the following ways :
Despite being a minor , he was questioned in the morning following his arrest , having been denied sleep .
He was denied legal counsel , although his lawyer appeared at the police station requesting to see him .
He was denied his right to have a parent present during his questioning .
He was not informed of his right to remain silent , and was even told by his interrogators that he is “ expected to tell the truth ” .
Only one of four interrogators present was a qualified youth interrogator .
The audio-visual recording of another central witness against Tamimi , 15 year - old Mo’atasem Tamimi , proves that he too was questioned in a similarly unlawful manner .
Tamimi has been behind lock and key for the past seven months , in which only one out of over twenty prosecution witnesses have testified before the court .
On September 25th , Major Michelle Dahan , who was commander of the military forces in the area and in charge of suppressing Nabi Saleh demonstrations , admitted to having dispersed demonstrations that were entirely peaceful , and alleged that Tamimi ordered youth to throw stones based on the fact that he saw him on rooftops during demonstrations .
Background
Bassem Tamimi is a veteran Palestinian grassroots activist from the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh , north of Ramallah .
He is married to Nariman Tamimi , with whom he fathers four children – Wa’ed ( 14 ) , Ahed ( 10 ) , Mohammed ( 8 ) and Salam ( 5 ) .
As a veteran activist , Tamimi has been arrested by the Israeli army 11 times to date , though he was never convicted of any offense .
Tamimi spent roughly three years in administrative detention , with no charges brought against him .
Furthermore , his attorney and he were denied access to “ secret evidence ” brought against him .
In 1993 , Tamimi was falsely arrested on suspicion of having murdered an Israeli settler in Beit El – an allegation of which he was cleared of entirely .
During his weeks - long interrogation , he was severely tortured by the Israeli Shin Bet in order to draw a coerced confession from him .
During his interrogation , and as a result of the torture he underwent , Tamimi collapsed and had to be evacuated to a hospital , where he laid unconscious for seven days .
As a result of the wounds caused by torture , Tamimi was partially paralyzed for several months after his release from the hospital .
At the opening of his trial on June 5th , Tamimi pleaded “ not guilty ” to all charges against him , but proudly owned up to organizing protest in the village .
In a defiant speech before the court he said , “ I organized these peaceful demonstrations to defend our land and our people . ”
Tamimi also challenged the legitimacy of the very system which trys him , saying that “ Despite claiming to be the only democracy in the Middle East you are trying me under military laws [… ] that are enacted by authorities which I have n’t elected and do not represent me . ”
( See here for Tamimi ’s full statement ) .
The indictment against Tamimi is based on questionable and coerced confessions of youth from the village .
He is charged with ’ incitement ’ , ‘ organizing and participating in unauthorized processions ’ , ’ solicitation to stone - throwing ’ , ‘ failure to attend legal summons ’ , and a scandalous charge of ‘ disruption of legal proceedings ’ , for allegedly giving youth advice on how to act during police interrogation in the event that they are arrested .
The transcript of Tamimi ’s police interrogation further demonstrates the police and Military Prosecution ’s political motivation and disregard for suspects ’ rights .
During his questioning , Tamimi was accused by his interrogator of “ consulting lawyers and foreigners to prepare for his interrogation ” , an act that is clearly protected under the right to seek legal counsel .
As one of the organizers of the Nabi Saleh protests and coordinator of the village ’s popular committee , Tamimi has been the target of harsh treatment by the Israeli army .
Since demonstrations began in the village , his house has been raided and ransacked numerous times , his wife was twice arrested and two of his sons were injured ;
Wa’ed , 14 , was hospitalized for five days when a rubber - coated bullet penetrated his leg and Mohammed , 8 , was injured by a tear - gas projectile that was shot directly at him and hit him in the shoulder .
Shortly after demonstrations in the village began , the Israeli Civil Administration served ten demolition orders to structures located in Area C , Tamimi ’s house was one of them , despite the fact that part of the house was built in 1965 and the rest in 2005 .
Legal background
On March 24th , 2011 , a massive contingent of Israeli Soldiers raided the Tamimi home at around noon , only minutes after he entered the house to prepare for a meeting with a European diplomat .
He was arrested and subsequently charged .
The main evidence in Tamimi ’s case is the testimony of 14 year - old Islam Dar Ayyoub , also from Nabi Saleh , who was taken from his bed at gunpoint on the night of January 23rd .
In his interrogation the morning after his arrest , Islam alleged that Bassem and Naji Tamimi organized groups of youth into “ brigades ” , charged with different responsibilities during the demonstrations : some were allegedly in charge of stone - throwing , others of blocking roads , etc .
During a trial - within - a - trial procedure in Islam ’s trial , motioning for his testimony to be ruled inadmissible , it was proven that his interrogation was fundamentally flawed and violated the rights set forth in the Israeli Youth Law in the following ways :
Despite being a minor , he was questioned in the morning following his arrest , having been denied sleep .
He was denied legal counsel , although his lawyer appeared at the police station requesting to see him .
He was denied his right to have a parent present during his questioning .
He was not informed of his right to remain silent , and was even told by his interrogators that he is “ expected to tell the truth ” .
Only one of four interrogators present was a qualified youth interrogator .
The audio-visual recording of another central witness against Tamimi , 15 year - old Mo’atasem Tamimi , proves that he too was questioned in a similarly unlawful manner .
Since the beginning of the village ’s struggle against settler takeover of their lands in December of 2009 , the army has conducted 80 protest related arrests .
As the entire village numbers just over 500 residents , the number constitutes approximately 10 % of its population .
Tamimi ’s arrest corresponds to the systematic arrest of civil protest leaders all around the West Bank , as in the case of the villages Bil’in and Ni’ilin .
Only recently the Military Court of Appeals has aggravated the sentence of Abdallah Abu Rahmah from the village of Bilin , sending him to 16 months imprisonment on charges of incitement and organizing illegal demonstrations .
Abu Rahmah was released on March 2011 .
The arrest and trial of Abu Rahmah has been widely condemned by the international community , most notably by Britain and EU foreign minister , Catherin Ashton .
Harsh criticism of the arrest has also been offered by leading human rights organizations in Israel and around the world , among them B’tselem , ACRI , as well as Human Rights Watch , which declared Abu Rahmah ’s trial unfair , and Amnesty International , which declared Abu Rahmah a prisoner of conscience .

Li Zhuang , Feng Zhou , and Doug Tygar have an interesting new paper showing that if you have an audio recording of somebody typing on an ordinary computer keyboard for fifteen minutes or so , you can figure out everything they typed .
The idea is that different keys tend to make slightly different sounds , and although you do n’t know in advance which keys make which sounds , you can use machine learning to figure that out , assuming that the person is mostly typing English text .
( Presumably it would work for other languages too . )
Asonov and Agrawal had a similar result previously , but they had to assume ( unrealistically ) that you started out with a recording of the person typing a known training text on the target keyboard .
The new method eliminates that requirement , and so appears to be viable in practice .
The algorithm works in three basic stages .
First , it isolates the sound of each individual keystroke .
Second , it takes all of the recorded keystrokes and puts them into about fifty categories , where the keystrokes within each category sound very similar .
Third , it uses fancy machine learning methods to recover the sequence of characters typed , under the assumption that the sequence has the statistical characteristics of English text .
The third stage is the hardest one .
You start out with the keystrokes put into categories , so that the sequence of keystrokes has been reduced a sequence of category - identifiers – something like this :
35 , 12 , 8 , 14 , 17 , 35 , 6 , 44 , …
( This means that the first keystroke is in category 35 , the second is in category 12 , and so on .
Remember that keystrokes in the same category sound alike . )
At this point you assume that each key on the keyboard usually ( but not always ) generates a particular category , but you do n’t know which key generates which category .
Sometimes two keys will tend to generate the same category , so that you ca n’t tell them apart except by context .
And some keystrokes generate a category that does n’t seem to match the character in the original text , because the key happened to sound different that time , or because the categorization algorithm is n’t perfect , or because the typist made a mistake and typed a garbbge charaacter .
The only advantage you have is that English text has persistent regularities .
For example , the two - letter sequence “ th ” is much more common that “ rq ” , and the word “ the ” is much more common than “ xprld ” .
This turns out to be enough for modern machine learning methods to do the job , despite the difficulties I described in the previous paragraph .
The recovered text gets about 95 % of the characters right , and about 90 % of the words .
It ’s quite readable .
[ Exercise for geeky readers : Assume that there is a one - to - one mapping between characters and categories , and that each character in the ( unknown ) input text is translated infallibly into the corresponding category .
Assume also that the input is typical English text .
Given the output category - sequence , how would you recover the input text ?
About how long would the input have to be to make this feasible ? ]
If the user typed a password , that can be recovered too .
Although passwords do n’t have the same statistical properties as ordinary text ( unless they ’re chosen badly ) , this does n’t pose a problem as long as the password - typing is accompanied by enough English - typing .
The algorithm does n’t always recover the exact password , but it can come up with a short list of possible passwords , and the real password is almost always on this list .
This is yet another reminder of how much computer security depends on controlling physical access to the computer .
We ’ve always known that anybody who can open up a computer and work on it with tools can control what it does .
Results like this new one show that getting close to a machine with sensors ( such as microphones , cameras , power monitors ) may compromise the machine ’s secrecy .
There are even some preliminary results showing that computers make slightly different noises depending on what computations they are doing , and that it might be possible to recover encryption keys if you have an audio recording of the computer doing decryption operations .
I think I ’ll go shut my office door now .
Top 10 Accidental Discoveries
1. Viagra
Men being treated for erectile dysfunction should salute the working stiffs of Merthyr Tydfil , the Welsh hamlet where , in 1992 trials , the gravity - defying side effects of a new angina drug first popped up .
Previously , the blue - collar town was known for producing a different kind of iron .
2. LSD
Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann took the world 's first acid hit in 1943 , when he touched a smidge of lysergic acid diethylamide , a chemical he had researched for inducing childbirth .
He later tried a bigger dose and made another discovery : the bad trip .
3. X-rays
Several 19th - century scientists toyed with the penetrating rays emitted when electrons strike a metal target .
But the x-ray was n't discovered until 1895 , when German egghead Wilhelm Röntgen tried sticking various objects in front of the radiation - and saw the bones of his hand projected on a wall .
4. Penicillin
Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming was researching the flu in 1928 when he noticed that a blue - green mold had infected one of his petri dishes - and killed the staphylococcus bacteria growing in it .
All hail sloppy lab work !
5. Artificial sweeteners
Speaking of botched lab jobs , three leading pseudo - sugars reached human lips only because scientists forgot to wash their hands .
Cyclamate ( 1937 ) and aspartame ( 1965 ) are byproducts of medical research , and saccharin ( 1879 ) appeared during a project on coal tar derivatives .
Yummy .
6. Microwave ovens
Microwave emitters ( or magnetrons ) powered Allied radar in WWII .
The leap from detecting Nazis to nuking nachos came in 1946 , after a magnetron melted a candy bar in Raytheon engineer Percy Spencer 's pocket .
7. Brandy
Medieval wine merchants used to boil the H 2 0 out of wine so their delicate cargo would keep better and take up less space at sea .
Before long , some intrepid soul - our money 's on a sailor - decided to bypass the reconstitution stage , and brandy was born .
Pass the Courvoisier !
8. Vulcanized rubber
Rubber rots badly and smells worse , unless it 's vulcanized .
Ancient Mesoamericans had their own version of the process , but Charles Goodyear rediscovered it in 1839 when he unintentionally ( well , at least according to most accounts ) dropped a rubber - sulfur compound onto a hot stove .
9. Silly Putty
In the early 1940s , General Electric scientist James Wright was working on artificial rubber for the war effort when he mixed boric acid and silicon oil .
V - J
Day did n't come any sooner , but comic strip image - stretching practically became a national pastime .
10 . Potato chips
Chef George Crum concocted the perfect sandwich complement in 1853 when - to spite a customer who complained that his fries were cut too thick - he sliced a potato paper - thin and fried it to a crisp .
Needless to say , the diner could n't eat just one .
Other key contributors to this discussion include Jeremy Leggett who brought the subjects together in his book : Half Gone : Oil , Gas , Hot Air and the Global Energy Crisis [ Amazon.co.uk ] and more recently Richard Heinberg who wrote an essay titled Bridging Peak Oil and Climate Change Activism [ EnergyBulletin.net ] .
Below the fold , my thoughts :
These “ two riders of the apocalypse ” as Jonathon Porritt , chair of the UK ’s Sustainable Development Commission , described them [ The Oil Drum ] last year are heading our way .
Porritt is one of a small group of people specifically talking and writing about the relationship between these two subjects , which at first glance can appear mutually exclusive .
Climate change scientists consider the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and forecast the climatic results .
Based on officially stated fossil fuel resources and global economic growth forecasts from national and international organisations , the emissions paint a dire picture .
Activists pick up the dire predictions and advocate proactive measures to curtail our emissions .
The " depletionists " , those subscribing to imminent peaks in the availability of oil and gas ( some predisposed to environmental issues and some with little concern , even perhaps doubting the arguments for anthropogenic climate change mechanisms ) instead point out that the officially stated fossil fuel resources are exaggerated and as a result the global economic growth forecasts and resulting emissions are also exaggerated .
Activists focus on the ramifications of shortage and advocate proactive measures to curtail our reliance on a resource soon to be troublesomely scarce .
I ’m squarely with the depletionists on this one .
The IPCC business as usual projections are as preposterous as the CERA ( Cambridge Energy Research Associates ) oil forecasts [ The Oil Drum ] .
The science is good but the assumed inputs are off .
Garbage in , garbage out .
The concept of global oil / gas peaks within a decade is incompatible with the anthropogenic emission driven ~ 900 ppm CO 2 , >+ 4 °C from 1990 by 2100 IPCC forecast .
For reference the A1F and A2 scenarios call for emissions from fossil fuels of 30.3 GtC / yr and 28.9 GtC / yr respectively compared with 1990 emissions of 6.0 GtC / yr .
Even the lowest A1T and B1 scenarios double 1990 emissions by 2050 before returning to a little below 1990 by the century ’s end .
Source : IPPC : Emissions Scenarios ( .pfd )
I ’m also deeply sceptical of any efforts to proactively reduce oil / gas consumption below that described by the depletion curve – it ’s just too useful .
To suggest we can choose a level of oil / gas consumption below the depletion curve is to say that the reductions imposed by , and the impacts of peak oil , are so trivial we would actually choose greater reduction i.e. lesser consumption ?
No way .
I am pessimistic about choosing a lower consumption and have no faith at all in choice / reform “ beating ” the depletion curve down .
The climate does n’t care how we emit what we emit but just what the emissions are .
It is hard to believe the oil / gas originated emissions will be anything other than solely determined by the depletion curve .
Absolutely it would be better if we chose to reduce consumption / emissions rather than be forced by shortage , the more action by choice / reform the better .
But I see that as a peak oil issue , trying to maximise energy services as resources deplete , not a climate change issue .
Climate change activism should be about total CO 2 emissions ( and sinks ) – I just do n’t see how activism targeted at oil / gas can impact the CO 2 emissions .
Peak oil activism should be about minimising the hardship created by reduced oil / gas availability .
So I ’m left in the position that all the oil and gas will be burnt as fast as possible .
We ca n’t do anything about that .
However , luckily , that alone wo n’t spell the climate disaster the activists warn us of .
That wo n’t spell climate disaster ?
No , well not according to the acclaimed climate scientist James Hansen of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Science .
He presented [ The Oil Drum ] this chart at a recent lecture , it shows the cumulative atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 attributed to difference sources :
Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations by source
What Hansen is saying is that the remaining oil and gas can be burnt whilst limiting atmospheric CO 2 to ~450 ppm and incremental temperature increase to only 1 °C , which really should be the limit unless we want to live on a very different planet .
The challenge is that the oil and gas combustion use most of the 450 ppm limit , the key therefore is CO 2 sequestration or abstinence from coal and unconventional fossil fuels .
Whilst Hansen does n’t think we are going to reach peak oil next week he does expect peak within 20 years in which case he said we can live with the oil / gas CO 2 contribution .
The only potential to cause climate disaster is from burning all the coal – this is very hypothetical though as whilst there is enough carbon contained in the coal reserves do we have the logistical ability and economic demand ( given peak oil / gas ) to exploit it ?
I ’m doubtful .
My doubt is n’t due to the magnitude of oil / gas physically used for coal mining – that ’s tiny .
It ’s more to do with demand .
I think peak oil / gas will destroy demand .
Think about the Chinese example of building a new coal power station every 5 days – the only reason they are doing that is to run the factories manufacturing stuff for the West and to fuel the increasing Chinese “ quality of life ” .
Both these sources of demand are directly funded by Western economic growth .
If you subscribe to peak oil / gas resulting in economic depression then energy demand ( including electricity and coal ) will fall .
Coal use is a function of global GDP , if peak oil / gas causes global GDP to fall then coal demand will fall too .
I do n’t think it ’s possible to maintain growth by replacing depleting oil / gas with coal to liquids and electrification .
That ’s the only scenario that would see increased coal burn in the face of peak oil .
So , to be intellectually honest I would like to see climate change activists ignore the emissions from oil / gas – ignore cheap flights , airport expansion and SUVs and instead focus primarily on coal burn .
That is electricity consumption and low / zero CO 2 generation of electricity .
This is an easy battle to fight as there is massive scope for reducing electricity consumption and massive potential for low / zero CO 2 electricity generation .
The climate change activist should also focus on land use ( deforestation etc. ) and be mindful of the depletionists ' points and theoretical threat of non-conventional fossil fuels .
The depletionists on the other hand should primarily focus on energy security , that is , minimising the loss of energy services as oil and gas availability decreases .
This involves reducing the oil / gas intensity of what we do and where the anti-SUV , pro-light rail , reduced “ economic reliance ” on flying etc arguments should be made .
Whilst supply side solutions based on non-conventional fossil fuels are likely to be considered , the depletionist should remain mindful of the CO 2 intensity of such solutions – in any event non-conventional fossil fuels are unlikely to prove viable or amount to anything significant .
There is perhaps a difference between being an intellectually honest activist and being an effective activist though !
As the general public and politicians now accept CO 2 as “ bad ” and as increasing aviation for example is recognised as being a significant source of increasing emissions , the depletionist campaigning for reduced economic reliance on flying could cite CO 2 emissions to add weight to their argument .
Effective as this may be I do n’t see it as totally intellectually honest .
Conclusion
2
My thesis is that all the oil and gas will be burnt as fast as possible , however imminent peaks in production constrain emissions within a Hubbert - style envelope .
Oil and gas consumption does n’t represent a degree of freedom for impacting emissions so time , energy and political capital should not be spent attempting to reduce oil and gas consumption in the name of reducing total COemissions .
Efforts are likely to be futile .
Instead , the degree of freedom we do have available to address emissions is coal – through reducing electricity demand and increasing low / zero CO 2 electricity generation .
This is where effort should be focused .
That is n’t to say reduced oil / gas reliance should n’t be pursued aggressively through efficiency and behavioural change , it should but not under the illusion that it will deliver reduced total CO 2 emissions .
Pursue reduced oil / gas reliance in the name of imminent peaks , to mitigate some of the negative impacts of imminent shortage .
PW Botha , who has died aged 90 , ruled South Africa under apartheid for 11 years until 1989 , and was gradually exposed during his long decline as one of the most evil men of the 20th century , committed to state terrorism , war and murder to thwart black majority rule .
The October 1998 report of the post - apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission , before which Botha refused to appear , earning a conviction for contempt , said he had been responsible for " gross violations of human rights " .
As prime minister from 1978 to 1984 , and then state president until 1989 , he was also chairman of the State Security Council , and made remarks " in its meetings and recommendations that were highly ambiguous and were interpreted as authorising the killing of people " .
According to the commission , he took no action against government agents who carried out atrocities , and supported covert operations " destabilising the governments of neighbouring countries " .
He also ordered police to blow up the Johannesburg offices of anti-apartheid groups .
The nickname " Great Crocodile " was hard - earned .
Pieter Willem Botha was born in Bethlehem in the Orange Free State , where his father , a " bitter - ender " who had fought the British to the last gasp of the Boer war , was a horse farmer .
His mother was interned in one of Lord Kitchener 's concentration camps and the young PW , as he was usually known , inherited the sour , bullying , anglophobic obduracy that became his trademark from his parents .
He joined the pro-Nazi " Ossewabrandwag " movement in 1939 , but , never over - burdened with moral courage , found it too risky and left after two years , avoiding internment .
A politician all his adult life , Botha was already active in the Afrikaner National Party ( NP ) .
He became MP for the Cape Province constituency of George when the NP won power in the white electoral landslide of 1948 .
It sustained Afrikaner political domination until ousted by Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress ( ANC ) in 1994 .
The qualities he showed in support of his ambition included ruthlessness , organisational efficiency , discipline and a liking for hard work ( he was still doing a 12 - hour day in his 70s ) .
This won the attention of the messiah of apartheid , Dr Hendrik Verwoerd , who made him a deputy minister in 1958 .
His first full departmental post was as minister for community development and coloured affairs from 1961 .
As such , he was paternalistically responsible for the coloured racial group , in apartheid terms those of ethnically mixed origin , concentrated mainly in Cape Province .
As an adoptive Cape politician , Botha always prided himself on his special feeling for the coloureds .
This did not prevent him from ordering the demolition , as a blight on the city , of Cape Town 's coloured quarter , District Six .
As District Six fell , so did Verwoerd , assassinated by an alleged madman in 1966 and succeeded by " iron man " John Vorster , who promoted Botha to minister of defence .
This cherished promotion precipitated a lifelong love of the military , including acts of war and covert operations at home and abroad .
Botha brought South Africa close to self - sufficiency in weaponry , circumventing the UN arms embargo where import substitution failed .
The state - owned arms corporation produced cannon that were regarded as the best of their kind .
Major warships , the latest aircraft and helicopters were beyond reach , but three small submarines were acquired from France , while Israel proved a surprisingly willing partner in such joint enterprises as missiles - and nuclear technology .
When the US secretly backed the increasingly blatant South African interventions in the Angolan civil war against the FPLA government backed by Cuban troops , Botha was able to acquire munitions and spares in cornucopian quantities .
When Vorster was kicked upstairs as non-executive state president in 1978 in the wake of the " Muldergate " corruption scandal , the NP felt the same need for a strong man as it had when Verwoerd died .
Who better to face the " total onslaught " by communists and blacks than the man who had built up the strongest military power in Africa - even if his power - base was the Cape NP rather than Verwoerd 's Transvaal ?
Botha soon stunned everyone by pronouncing apartheid dead .
" Adapt or die " became his watchword as he foreshadowed " reform " without precedent .
The world fondly imagined he would abolish discrimination as he became the first South African leader to visit Soweto , Johannesburg 's south - western township , and travelled abroad more than any of his NP predecessors .
However , the furthest he was prepared to go was to shift the great divide in South African politics from between white and non-white to between non-black and black .
But progress could not be stemmed altogether .
One of the most important changes under Botha 's leadership was the legalisation of black trade unions in 1979 , giving African industrial labour a real voice .
" Petty " apartheid ( anything but petty to its victims ) was radically cut back : the fatuous laws banning marriage and sex between different races were repealed , the notorious pass laws , the British legacy that controlled the movements of Africans , and the ban on black freehold ownership were also scrapped .
But residential and educational segregation and racial classification were retained .
In 1983 , under loudly trumpeted constitutional reform proposals , the coloured and Asian minorities were given their own separate chambers in parliament .
Black political rights , however , were to be enshrined in their tribal " homelands " as conceived by Verwoerd .
" Grand apartheid " was adapting , but only so as not to die .
The urban black population erupted , especially the young , as the reforms came into force in 1984 , when Botha elevated himself to executive president .
Only after tens of thousands had been arrested and 2,500 killed in confrontations with trigger - happy police under a permanent state of emergency was the lid forced back on the simmering townships .
The outside world lost patience as the domestic concessions backfired and the customarily apoplectic Botha took the view that the west was moving the goalposts on the urging of communistic liberals and black opinion .
He decided on one more try , in a televised speech heavily telegraphed as all but revolutionary , on August 15 1985 .
He announced in a live worldwide broadcast that he was " crossing the Rubicon " .
In fact , after a short attempt at walking on water , he returned to where he had started .
Even the assiduously sympathetic Mrs Thatcher now gave up on Botha , the rest of whose time in office was marked by inertia .
Nothing more could be expected from an authoritarian politician with a violent temper whom nobody dared to cross .
Even a secret meeting with Nelson Mandela , still the inspiration of the ANC after 25 years in jail , bore no fruit through Botha 's intransigence .
Urged on by astutely mobilised black American opinion , US banks and corporations began to divest themselves of holdings in South Africa .
This commercially motivated boycott was the undoing of apartheid : the rand 's value collapsed .
Botha was forced under US pressure to concede independence to Namibia amid military setbacks in Angola and growing economic problems .
The manifest intellectual bankruptcy of his last few years should not obscure the political cunning and manipulative successes of his heyday .
He was consistently underestimated by foreigners , who forgot that , as an Afrikaner , Botha was speaking a second , unloved language when he used his slow English as a blunt instrument , uttering such sentences as " Do n't push us too far , " in an accent thick with naked menace .
He carried a big stick but did not speak softly .
After a stroke in January 1989 , Botha threw away his power - base by quitting as NP leader while staying on as president , apparently seeking to rise above mere politics .
The Transvaaler FW de Klerk took over the NP , and , in a brutal power struggle , provoked Botha 's resignation in August .
In an extraordinary farewell address on television , a frail but seething Botha , his hands trembling , accused the cabinet of failing to inform him of de Klerk 's plan to visit Zambia , and of playing into the hands of the ANC , which had bases there .
De Klerk and ministers insisted that Botha had been kept informed , with the unmistakable implication that he was senile .
A year later the apartheid log - jam broke as de Klerk released Mandela under unrelenting international pressure .
The two men warily shared power until a free election gave the ANC a handsome majority , and apartheid officially came to an end in 1994 .
Botha at first chose obscurity , retiring to the well - named coastal resort of Wilderness on the coast 300 miles east of Cape Town .
But when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , led by Archbishop Tutu , summoned him to give evidence on abuse of power during his time in office , Botha refused point - blank .
He became an object of ridicule at the age of 81 , three months after his beloved wife , Elize , died in 1997 ( they had two sons and three daughters ) , when he became engaged to a 46 - year - old white traffic warden and double divorcee .
He later ditched his Afrikaner fiancée in favour of an Englishwoman aged 57 .
He continued to defy the subpoena and in January 1998 , was hauled up before a black magistrate on a charge of contempt of court .
Meanwhile , one witness after another told the commission of the involvement of Botha 's government in all manner of crimes against its opponents .
In June 1998 , the contempt case at last went ahead and a former police colonel , Eugene de Kock , a licensed killer under apartheid , attested how he had carried out bombings in Johannesburg and London on Botha 's orders .
Botha refused to give evidence .
Eventually he was fined 10,000 rand ( nearly £ 1,000 ) and sentenced to one year 's imprisonment , suspended for five years .
This meant that another refusal to appear or testify would mean jail ; but , as the commission issued its report in October 1998 , there seemed to be no point in pursuing the old man any further .
The revelations of the depths to which the apartheid regime had sunk under Botha continued , including government research in the early 1980s aimed at finding chemical and biological agents that worked only against blacks .
Although its two - year mandate expired before it could get to the bottom of this , the commmission got wind of the research in its final weeks .
It was already known to western drug companies and intelligence services - which kept silent , their only concern apparently being to stop the results being passed to the ANC when it took over government .
In a rare public statement during his 1998 court battle , an unreconstructed Botha showed his customary obduracy : " I stand with all those who executed lawful government commands in our struggle against the revolutionary communist onslaught against our country ...
I am not prepared to apologise for actions which I took to remove ( sic ) racial discrimination in this country [ or ] for lawful actions of my government in its struggle to curb the violent onslaught . "
The jibbering , trembling Great Crocodile , exposed at last as one of the worst tyrants of a bloodsoaked century , had clearly learned nothing and forgotten nothing .
South Africa 's post - apartheid constitution provides for a state funeral for former presidents .
Those familiar with Botha 's character and political record may view this as a bitter irony .
His second wife and five children survive him .

Alright , we 've been following the RIAA 's increasingly frequent affronts to privacy and free speech lately , and it's about time we stopped merely bitching and moaning and did something about it .
The RIAA has the power to shift public policy and to alter the direction of technology and the Internet for one reason and one reason alone : it 's totally loaded .
Without their millions of dollars to throw at lawyers , the RIAA is toothless .
They get their money from us , the consumers , and if we do n't like the way they 're behaving , we can let them know with our wallets .
Advertisement
With that in mind , Gizmodo is declaring the month of March Boycott the RIAA month .
We want to get the word out to as many people as humanly possible that we can all send a message by refusing to buy any album put out by an RIAA label .
Am I saying you should start pirating music ?
Not at all .
You can continue to support the artists you enjoy and respect in a number of ways .
Firstly , I encourage everyone to purchase music from unsigned bands and bands on independent record labels .
There are tons of great artists out there , many of which you 're probably already a fan of , that have nothing to do with the RIAA .
Buy their records at eMusic , an online store that sells independent tunes in beautiful , DRM - free MP3 format .
Advertisement
Secondly , you can still support RIAA - signed bands without buying their music .
Go see them live and buy their merchandise ; they get a hell of a lot more money from that then they do from album sales .
And hey , you could benefit from getting out more , could n't you ?
If you are unsure whether or not an album is put out by an RIAA label , the handy RIAA Radar will clear everything up for you .
They have both a search engine and a great bookmarklet , so be sure to get yourself hooked up .
Let me just reiterate that we are not saying you should stop buying music and start pirating everything .
We need to send a message with our wallets to the RIAA , and that message will only be stronger if we show support for musicians without your money making its way to the lawyer fund .
So come on , make next month one to remember .
Let 's stand together and let the RIAA know that yes , we are paying attention and no , we are n't going to put up with their unethical practices any longer .
Project Aardvark , if you ’ve been following along with the blog , is our summer interns ’ new product .
We ’ve got four interns here ( three in development , one in marketing ) putting together a complete product from beginning to end .
Now that they ’ve officially announced what it ’s all about and we ’re about to start the first beta , I can bring you up to date on the project , which is more or less halfway done .
The Idea
If you ’ve ever tried to help your technologically - challenged uncle fix his computer problems over the phone , you know what a pain in the butt it can be to try to walk him through the fix .
“ Click START ”
“ What ? ”
“ Start .
Click Start .
It ’s in the bottom left . ”
“ I have C – T – R – L in the bottom left . ”
“ The bottom left of your screen . ”
“ Oh. OK , I clicked it . ”
“ OK , now click RUN . ”
“ What ? ”
“ On the menu that came up .
Click RUN . ”
“ It ’s not there . ”
“ What do you mean it ’s not there ? ”
“ It ’s not there .
I do n’t have a RUN . ”
“ What do you see ?
Read me everything you see ”
“ Recycle Bin… My Computer … Anna Navratilova J P G … ”
“ No , on the menu . ”
“ What menu ? “
“ The menu that came up when you clicked start . ”
“ When I what ? ”
This is when you give up and realize that something that could take you 10 seconds to fix in person is about to become a two hour nightmare during which you ’ll alienate your family , lose sleep , tie up the phone line while your Auntie Marge is stuck on the turnpike with no gas and ca n’t get through to your uncle to come rescue her , and curse your lot in life .
Just because you ’re a programmer does n’t mean you have to be the help desk for a dozen friends , relatives , and the people in the apartment next door .
Does it ?
That ’s the general idea behind the new Fog Creek Copilot SM service .
In a nutshell , you go to copilot.com and get an invitation code .
You tell your uncle to go to copilot.com and type in that same invitation code .
You each get a little program to download and run .
When you run the program , your uncle ’s computer screen shows up in a window .
When you move your mouse , his mouse moves .
When you type something , it appears on his computer .
Etc .
And now you fix the problem and log off , and peace is restored and your aunt gets home safely and your uncle dances at your wedding instead of boycotting it and holding up unpleasant signs across from the hotel where said wedding is taking place .
But but but …
Yes , similar services already exist .
That never stopped me before .
I ’d like to point out that Fog Creek has been doubling in revenues every year mostly thanks to bug tracking software , and it ’s not like we invented bug tracking software .
There are a few things our product will do better than the competition , but mostly we just want the Fog Creek Copilot experience to be shockingly seamless .
It ’ll be totally secure , it ’ll be cheap , it ’ll be painless , it will work through firewalls on either side so you can help mom at home on her firewalled DSL from behind your NAT at work without a hiccup .
We even made it so that the little software program you download is totally self - contained , totally pre-configured , and deletes itself when you ’re done so you can feel more secure about the whole episode .
There ’s no commitment ; you do n’t have to sign up or create an account and remember a password ; you can even make your uncle pay since , after all , he ’s getting the benefit .
For the geeks in the audience , the service uses a highly customized and optimized version of VNC , but it also requires a customized “ reflector ” service that we ’re building which sits outside of any firewalls .
The idea is , since you ca n’t connect into mom ’s computer which is behind a firewall , she ’ll connect out to our server , you ’ll connect out to our server too , and the reflector will forward data back and forth between the two of you .
How ’d you get the idea ?
For the last few years we ’ve been supporting FogBugz customers using a similar scheme , although it ’s a bit of a pain to set up .
Our customers have to follow 7 steps to allow us to control their computers , and we ’ve found that walking people through these steps on the phone takes an average of 5 minutes .
With the Fog Creek Copilot service we ’ll just tell them to check their email and click on a link and hey presto !
we ’re fixing their computer .
So the original idea was to use this for tech support .
But when I told the idea to the interns , two out of four said , “ yeah , I could use something like that to help my mom . ”
That ’s when we realized there ’s a huge world out there of Informal Tech Support … lots of people trying to help Uncle Leo who ca n’t use products like VNC because of the firewall problem .
So we changed the focus of release 1 to be the casual and home user instead of tech support departments .
The Name
We had a list of important criteria for the name , but the most important one was that when someone read the name to someone else over the phone , it would be extremely likely that they would get it right .
This ruled out names that are weirdly spelled , names which could be easily confused over the phone ( for example “ m ” and “ n ” are almost impossible to distinguish ) , and names that have different possible spellings .
We went rather too far along the process of investigating the name “ Fixant ” ( complete with a very cool drawing of an ant holding an ethernet cable ) before I just got everyone together in a room for a half hour of brainstorming , when we finally hit upon the idea of “ Copilot . ”
I ca n’t even remember who thought of it .
The idea of brainstorming is just that you shout out ideas , which stimulate other people to have ideas , and you put them all up on a whiteboard .
Well , there are a couple of dozen products named Copilot , many with registered trademarks , so our trademark lawyer advised us to use Fog Creek Copilot which would eliminate any possibility of confusion with those other Copilot brand products .
The point of trademark laws is that what you ’re not allowed to do is create any confusion or potential confusion as to the origin of your product , and sticking “ Fog Creek ” in front guarantees that , but we have to be religious about always using the full name .
I did n’t really mind , having started my career working on products like Microsoft Excel , Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications for Microsoft Excel , etc. etc .
After a few weeks on the Microsoft Excel team if you ever saw the word “ Excel ” without a “ Microsoft ” in front of it , it looked nekkid .
We bought the domain name for more money than we spent developing the first version of FogBugz , oy gevalt , but it is a really good name — easy to spell , pronounce , and it even sort of suggests what the product does , which makes it more memorable .
The Conference
For some reason , a long long time ago , I had agreed to give the keynote speech for CFUNITED , a conference about ColdFusion .
“ I never used ColdFusion ! ” I protested .
“ Do n’t worry .
Nobody has .
The biggest sponsor of this conference is Microsoft , who have a huge presence trying to get the ColdFusion developers to switch to VB.NET , ” the organizers told me .
As luck would have it , the conference timing was perfect for the first feature - complete version of the interns ’ code .
It gave the team a deadline to work to .
At the conference itself , we set up a Fog Creek booth and the interns gave demos to several hundred attendees who wandered by .
This was the first trade show Fog Creek had ever attended .
The truth is , a trade show is not a very cost - effective way to reach potential customers .
Given the cost of travel , hotels , the booth , a thousand bucks for nice brochures , and everybody taking a week off of work , it ’s a really expensive way to get in front of prospects , especially since I can write an article on my website and get in front of 1000 times as many people .
But that ’s not really the point : the point is to have interactive experiences with your customers .
You can try out lots of different pitches and really listen to how people respond to them , which is something you ca n’t do in non-interactive marketing like web sites and magazine ads .
I learned this from Eric Sink , who wrote a great article on the topic , Going to a Trade Show .
We went down to Washington in two big SUVs with all four interns , one of the FogBugz developers , Brett , who gave demos of FogBugz , and me .
Our booth probably looked just a little bit too much like a science - fair exhibit , but , whatever , it was our first attempt .
Next time we ’ll know to make backdrop posters that stretch right out to the edge of the backdrop which looks a bit more professional , and I ’ll remember to bring a lucite brochure dispenser instead of arranging the trifold brochures artfully in the shape of an Aardvark .
But that ’s not really a big deal .
What was a big deal is that we got to talk to hundreds of potential customers , and , wow !
the response was just incredible .
At the very best , the response we got was , “ I need a thousand of these yesterday for my whole team . ”
Almost everyone was impressed by the product and knew that they wanted to use it .
A very small number of people were aware of other competitors and other solutions to the problem , but mostly people gave us very positive feedback .
More importantly , after spending two days pitching the product again and again to lots of different people we learned the most effective ways to present it .
We learned that the best way to present it was not to start with , “ You know VNC ? ”
This drew glassy stares .
The best way was to start with a typical remote support scenario .
“ Your mom calls you up .
She says her screen is half grey .
You have no idea what the heck she ’s talking about . ”
The Beta
We got back last Friday and immediately started working on the beta .
The goal of this summer internship is to be shipping to paying customers by the end of the summer , and I did n’t want our interns to go home after “ mostly ” finishing the code , leaving us permanent employees to debug until next February , so we ’re working on a really compressed schedule .
Over the next few weeks , we ’ve got to :
Deploy the site and service on our web farm
Launch a controlled , private beta so a few people can start trying the service and we can figure out if it works in the real world .
Yaron is taking beta applications now .
Launch a wider public beta
Do a round of usability tests in the lab .
The nice folks at TechSmith have a product for usability testing called Morae , and they ’ll be coming out to New York and helping us organize and run the usability tests .
Morae lets you set up a complete usability lab using nothing more than their software and a little webcam
Start serious QA .
So far we ’ve really been hitting the schedule so I ’m pretty confident .

Ms Nowak said she did not intend to harm Ms Shipman
Navy Capt Lisa Nowak , 43 , who flew to the international space station last July , was charged with attempted kidnapping , battery and other crimes .
She drove from Texas to Florida to confront Colleen Shipman , disguised in a wig and trench coat .
Police said Capt Nowak , who was denied bail , used pepper spray on Ms Shipman .
The man in the love triangle was said to be Navy Cmdr William Oefelein , who was a pilot on the Discovery 's mission to the space station in December .
E-mails
Police said Capt Nowak drove 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) from her home in Houston to Orlando International Airport , wearing a nappy to avoid a toilet break .
The arrest affidavit says Capt Nowak then followed Ms Shipman in an airport bus .
Ms Nowak and William Oefelein never flew on the same mission
Capt Nowak pursued Ms Shipman to her vehicle in the car park .
Ms Shipman locked herself in but rolled down the window when Capt Nowak began to cry , the affidavit says .
Ms Shipman was then attacked with the pepper spray , it says .
She drove to a car park booth and police were called .
An officer followed Capt Nowak and she was stopped allegedly carrying the wig , an air rifle , a steel mallet and a knife .
A search of her vehicle revealed pepper spray and e-mails between Ms Shipman and Cmdr Oefelein , police said .
In the affidavit , Ms Nowak describes her attachment to Cmdr Oefelein as " more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship " .
Capt Nowak told police she just wanted to scare her rival into talking about her relationship with Cmdr Oefelein .
Attempted kidnapping carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
Nasa biographies list Capt Nowak as married with three children and Cmdr Oefelein as single with two children .
The pair never flew together .
A Nasa spokesman said at present Capt Nowak 's status was " unchanged " .
Florida 's Orlando Sentinel newspaper said Ms Shipman was an engineer with the 45th Launch Support Squadron at a base close to the Kennedy Space Centre .

In our quest to replace all useless organic parts of our body with upgraded synthetics , we have come across a key ingredient : Oxycyte .
Oxycyte is a new artificial blood that can absorb 50 times the oxygen of normal blood .
Sure , synthetics still are n't good for organs in the long term , but we 'll be getting those pesky space holders removed soon enough .
We need more room for the laser canon .

Actually , Oxycyte is a derivative of non-hemoglobin synthetics that have been around for some time .
It 's currently being tested as a substitute for donated blood during emergency surgeries where brain injury from a lack of oxygen is common .
Better than Blood ? [ via randomgoodstuff ]
If Pluto is a planet , so should be Xena , Dr. Brown has argued .
The committee ’s original prime criterion was roundness , meaning that a planet had to be big enough so that gravity would overcome internal forces and squash it into a roughly spherical shape .
But a large contingent of astronomers , led by Julio Fernandez of the University of the Republic in Montevideo , Uruguay , has argued that a planet must also be massive enough to clear other objects out of its orbital zone .
Dr. Gingerich admitted , “ They are in control of things . ”
So the newest resolution includes the requirement for orbital dominance as a condition for full - fledged planethood , Dr. Gingerich said .
That knocks out Pluto , which crosses the orbit of Neptune , and Xena , which orbits among the icy wrecks of the Kuiper Belt , and Ceres , which is in the asteroid belt .
“ Vociferous objectors have said they could accept this , ” Dr. Gingerich said .
Reached in his office at Caltech , Dr. Brown , who as the discoverer of Xena has the most to lose by its and Pluto ’s demotion , said he thought he could live with the new proposal .
“ It essentially demotes Pluto to something other than a real planet , which is reasonable , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
Dr. Gingerich cautioned that there were many things still to be sorted out .
For example , the International Astronomical Union might consider creating a special name for Pluto and other dwarf - planets , like Xena and others yet to be discovered , that dwell out beyond Neptune .
If it did , he said that “ plutonians ” seemed like a likelier choice than the previous suggestion , “ plutons . ”
That term was protested by geologists , who pointed out that it was already used in earth science for nuggets of molten rock that have solidified and reached the surface .
But with two more days before the scheduled vote , there was no guarantee Pluto would not make a comeback and the definition of planethood be rewritten again .
“ Some people think that the astronomers will look stupid if we can’t agree on a definition or if we do n’t even know what a planet is , ’’ Dr. Pasachoff said .
“ But someone pointed out that this definition will hold for all time and that it is more important to get it right . ”

Kyoto Professor Taps into the Essence of Play
October 5 , 2001
At elementary schools , kindergartens , and preschools all across Japan , kids are losing themselves making hikaru dorodango , or balls of mud that shine .
Behind this boom is Professor Fumio Kayo of the Kyoto University of Education .
Kayo is a psychologist who researches children 's play , and he first came across these glistening dorodango at a nursery school in Kyoto two years ago .
He was impressed and devised a method of making dorodango that could be followed even by children .
Once Kayo teaches children how to make these mud balls , they become absorbed in forming a sphere , and they put all their energy into polishing the ball until it sparkles .
The dorodango soon becomes the child 's greatest treasure .
Kayo sees in this phenomenon the essence of children 's play , and he has written academic papers on the subject .
The mud balls could also offer fresh insights into how play aids children 's growth .
Professor Develops Method
Inside his office at the university , Kayo keeps a dorodango in a wooden box , wrapped in cloth .
The shiny ball of dried mud is eight centimeters ( about three inches ) in diameter and is amber colored with a touch of dark green .
Professor Kayo developed his own scale for measuring a dorodango's luster , and this one rates a " 4 . "
The shiniest dorodango rates a " 5 , " and Kayo keeps one of these at home .
Kayo first became interested in dorodango in May 1999 .
As part of his research in developmental pshychology , Kayo visited a Kyoto preschool once a week .
When Kayo made mud balls with the children , a teacher at the preschool told him , " I 'll show you a real dorodango , " and proceeded to produce a shiny one for Kayo .
Why would a lump of mud shine ?
Kayo became taken with this question and tried to outdo the preschool teacher .
But after trying many times , Kayo found that he just could not make a shiny mud ball .
Once , he thought he had succeeded , but after a few days the mud ball lost its luster .
Through 200 failed experiments and an analysis using an electron microscope , Kayo was finally able to devise a method of making dorodango that could be followed by anyone , including children .
About 70 people of all ages took part in this dorodango - making event .
( Association of Nippon Doro- dango Science ) Surprising Behavior
When Kayo taught his new method to children , they were hooked .
Kids would spend a long time kneading the mud and then polishing it until it shined .
The children soon became attached to their mud balls and treasured them even if the shape was bad or if they did not shine .
In the process of making dorodango , the children demonstrated behavior that was surprising from the perspective of developmental psychology .
A two - year - old child would walk behind Kayo , imitating his actions .
At three , children would come up beside him and snatch his dirt .
Four and five year olds pretended to ignore him out of pride , but afterwards they could be seen working with determined expressions on their faces .
Children could also be found sharing information about where to find the best dirt and sand for making dorodango or even sometimes keeping such information secret .
Dorodango were made famous all over Japan when public broadcaster NHK ( Japan Broadcasting Corp. ) took up the phenomenon in a program aired nationally in June 2001 .
In the field of developmental psychology up to now , play that developed children 's imagination and creativity , such as role playing and drawing , was deemed important .
But Professor Kayo is searching for whether developmental psychology has overlooked something very important : the experimentation children undertake in everyday activities like eating , getting dressed , and sleeping .
He feels that making shiny mud balls is a good way of searching for the essence of children 's play .
Kayo believes that the answers lie within the hearts of children , and he continues to visit the preschool once a week .

Pack some mud into your hand , and squeeze out the water while forming a sphere .
Add some dry dirt to the outside and continue to gently shape the mud into a sphere .
When the mass dries , pack it solid with your hands , and rub the surface until a smooth film begins to appear .
Rub your hands against the ground , patting and rubbing the fine , powdery dirt onto the sphere .
Continue this for two hours .
Seal the ball in a plastic bag for three or four hours .
Upon removing the sphere , repeat step 4 , and then once again seal the sphere in a plastic bag .
Remove the ball from the bag , and if it is no longer wet , polish it with a cloth until it shines .

Foreign PC makers will also be affected by the new rule
New regulations state Chinese computer makers must install legally licensed operating software on machines before they leave the factory .
The announcement followed trade talks between China and the United States in Washington on Tuesday .
In 2004 the rate of software piracy in China was 90 % , compared to 27 % in the UK and the world average of 35 % .
The new rule was jointly announced by China 's Ministry of Information Industry ( MII ) , the State Copyright Bureau and the Ministry of Commerce .
" Computers manufactured within the country 's borders should have pre-installed authorised operating software systems when they leave the factory , " the statement said .
Foreign PC makers will also be affected by the rule , which says retailers must install software on imported computers before they are sold .
Manufacturers and operating system providers are also required to report the number of computers sold and systems installed to the MII by February each year .
Those who breach the rules or provide false information would be investigated and have their names made public , the notice added .
Foreign pressure
American software firms said they wanted to see progress on the issue during the US - China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade meeting , which was held ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao 's trip to the US next week .
But Wang Ziqiang , a director at the State Copyright Bureau , said the order was not a result of foreign demand .
" This is not because of foreign pressure , " he said .
" This is about the country 's economic development . "
But he added it would be up to China 's manufacturers to decide on what software to use .
There is a strong push from Dell and Hewlett - Packard to move into the Chinese market , and more than 95 % of PCs in China have Windows installed .
Some computer manufacturers say they have already started to pre-install operating systems .
China 's top PC vendors have signed deals with Microsoft to buy US $ 700 m worth of Windows programs , the Shanghai Daily reported .
The MII added software retailers should provide " favourable prices and qualified service to PC makers " .
A senior U.S. diplomat has criticized his country ' srole inIraq as PresidentGeorge W. Bush said the United States is still expecting to win the war , but is changing its tactics .
" We tried to do our best but I think there is much room for criticism because , undoubtedly , there was arrogance and there was stupidity from the United States in Iraq , " Alberto Fernandez , an Arabic - speaking diplomat in the State Department 's bureau of Near Eastern affairs , saidon Al - Jazeera television on Saturday .
An administration official wondered whether the translation was accurate , the Associated Press reported .
The unidentified official said Fernandez was not repeating the administration position .
Earlier Saturday , Bush met with Pentagon generals to discuss the situation in Iraq , which is perceived to be getting worse — three marines andat least 18 civilians were killed Saturday — and has become an issue in the U.S. midterm elections , set for Nov. 7 .
Bush said the U.S. goal is victory in Iraq , but " what is changing are the tactics we use to achieve that goal . "
No details were available , but a U.S. general admitted recently that a campaign to end the violence in Baghdad by putting extra U.S. and Iraqi soldiers in the capital had failed .
U.S. open to talks
Fernandez also said that the solution in Iraq requires national reconciliation , and the U.S. is ready to talk with any group except al - Qaeda in Iraq .
That suggests that the the U.S. will talk with the Sunni and Shia factions that have reduced the country to a state akin to civil war .
He said thesectarian fighting , and the insurgency — which involves both al - Qaeda and the Baath Party , which ran Iraq under deposed dictator Saddam Hussein — was not just the fault of the U.S .
" We are witnessing failure in Iraq and that 's not the failure of the United States alone .
But it is a disaster for the region . "
Iraqi insurgents are marching openly in some cities , and a man claiming to speak for the outlawed Baath party said Saturday that the U.S. was seeking a " face - saving " way out of the country .
The deaths of three marines Saturday raised U.S. casualties to 78 so far in October , making it the worst month this year .
As the death toll mounts and Bush 's strategy appears to be in trouble , opposition Democrats have been increasing their attacks on the government 's handling of the war .
Diane Farrell , aDemocratic candidate for Congress inConnecticut , Saturday said Bush should fire Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , and the government should set up defined terms for the departure of U.S. soldiers .
" We need a new direction in Iraq , " she said in the Democrats ' weekly national radio address .
While U.S. deaths are a political issue in the United States , the daily toll of Iraqi civilians is an indicationof theproblems with the U.S. approach .
A bomb blast and a subsequent mortar attack killed at least 18 people and wounded 52 in an outdoor market in thecity of Mahmoudiyah near Baghdad on Saturday .
The House began debating the Iraq War today .
The anti-escalation resolution is under discussion now on the floor and will be for the rest of the week .
The Republicans in the House do n't want to talk about Iraq .
In fact , Think Progress posted a leaked letter from top Republicans advising their colleagues to avoid talking about Iraq :
The debate should not be about the surge or its details .
This debate should not even be about the Iraq war to date , mistakes that have been made , or whether we can , or cannot , win militarily .
Democrats , like Patrick Murphy who served in Iraq , do want to talk about Iraq and how to stop the escalation .
Murphy gave a powerful speech on the House floor today -- and with Murphy on the other side , it 's no wonder the GOP wants to avoid the debate :

ADHD is an allergy to boredom .
If we ADDers are interested in something , ADHD is generally not a problem .
For those of us who like the online world , it ’s rarely boring .
I have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( which I find is often more of a surplus usually ) .
I ’ve been coaching adults with ADHD since 2003 , have an ADHD resource website with over 180 pages of information , 400 + posts on my first blog and a second blog too , and started and lead an adult ADD Support Group .
So , I ’m fairly familiar with ADHD .
I ’ve been using Mac computers since 1985 , sold them for 7 years , spent tens of thousands of hours on the net .
So , I ’m fairly familiar with the high tech world .
I ’ve noticed there are many similarities between the two worlds .
I believe there are many people who work in the high tech industry who have ADHD , much more than the average of the population .
Approximately 5 % of the population has ADD and 90 % of adults with ADHD do n’t know they have it .
It seems to me ADHD and the technology industry is a natural fit .
The constant change of the high tech world can be stressful and troubling for some people but it ’s often stimulating and energizing for the ADDer .
A great source of Dopamine hits .
Although there are no specific statistics , several other ADD experts I ’ve talked to agree with my observation .
Many people only see the many problems associated with ADHD and buy into the media and societal ignorance and stigma on it , viewing it just as a weakness , and do n’t know about the strengths of ADHD .
Some need to be on their 20th job or 3rd spouse before they ’re willing to seek a diagnosis for ADHD .
So here are some advantages of having ADHD in the wired world to help people in the industry recognize and develop their ADHD related strengths as well as managing their ADHD challenges .
I also hope this might help those who may be afraid of getting diagnosed and treated ( medication , Adult ADHD coaching , therapy etc. ) for ADHD because of the negative stigma promoted by the people that condemn ADHD as a moral failure .
I.e. , “ there ’s no such thing as ADHD , turn off the TV , stop eating sugar , beat your kid more often , and twirl around 3 times and tap your heels and it will magically go away ” flat earthers .
ADHD is an inherited neurobiological condition .
Every medical and psychological association has stated this .
As more people realize the advantages of having ADHD , they will be more inclined to seek diagnosis and treatment .
Some people believe ADHD is related to IQ , the idea that all ADD ’ers are slow learners or below average IQ , wrong .
I have ADHD and I made the Dean ’s Honours list and many Ph.D. ’s have it .
MENSA has an ADD special interest group with 600 + members .
It comes down to a difference in brain wiring , and in some fields ( high tech , marketing , artists , the media , entrepreneurs ) the unique wiring of the ADD brain is a competitive advantage .
Top Ten ADHD Advantages in a High Tech Career .
1. The Ability to Hyperfocus .
Hours of full engagement and concentration in a task , IF you find it interesting .
You can get into the zone and be totally immersed in what you ’re doing while the outside world disappears .
When I went on the net for the first time in 1993 at an Internet cafe I got on the machine at 8 pm and around 4 am decided it was time to go home .
2. Rapid Fire Mind .
Your brain processes information at hyperspeed .
You can do things in 30 minutes on a computer that might take other people ’s hours .
The downside is , if you ’re stuck with an old machine and not enough RAM you ’ll be frustrated cause it ca n’t keep up with the speed of your brain .
3. Multitasking at Will .
Able to run 14 apps at a time and effortlessly switch between each without breaking a sweat .
Able to do several projects at a time with ease .
4. High Energy Level .
You ’re able to keep going on a project ( if it ’s interesting , ADDers are more into creative and entrepreneurial activities than clerical and repetitive ones ) .
14 - hour days ?
No problem .
Adrenaline is my fuel source : )
5. Highly Creative .
Able to think beyond the idea of a box .
This comes naturally for ADDers , while others pay thousands of dollars to try and learn this .
Since you take in more information than the average person , and you ’re easily distractible , you ’re more likely to view a problem from many different angles than vanilla people ( non ADDers ) , and therefore come up with more possible solutions to a problem .
Need an idea generator ?
Find an ADDer .
6. Quick Learner .
IF it ’s something you ’re interested in .
ADHD is mainly a condition of boredom ; you have no trouble paying attention to something if it ’s interesting .
Most people find it difficult to do boring or repetitive things but these can often totally shut an ADDer down .
Your rapid - fire brain + highly creative mind + the ability to hyperfocus equals fast absorption of new information quickly .
Dr. Ed Hallowell , who has ADHD and has written several Delivered from Distraction : Getting the Most out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder , said he stopped teaching Psychiatry at Harvard University because the non-ADDer ’s brains were just too slow and they took so long to get it .
He got tired of being continually frustrated waiting for them to catch up to the ADHD students .
7. Stimulus Seeking Brain .
A perfect match for the wired world , an understimulated brain and an overstimulated virtual environment .
Being an info junkie can be a good thing .
Well , not always : )
8. Constantly Scanning your Environment .
Allows you to notice more and find information and resource that others miss .
Also allows you to see possible problems before they arise , and opportunities that others may not see because they have tunnel vision vs. multiplex vision .
An ADDer invented the electronic ticket .
9. Great in a Crisis .
High energy intense situation ?
Lots of chaos and change ?
Sign me up ; I thrive on stimulation , change and chaos .
We can create order from chaos effortlessly .
We can also create chaos as well if needed .
10 . Risk Taker .
Impulsivity means you ’re more willing to take risks and have a bias for action , act now while the opportunity is hot instead of getting into analysis paralysis .
Many entrepreneurs have ADD i.e. Paul Orfalea who founded Kinko’s , JetBlue Founder and CEO David Neeleman who attributes his creativity to ADD .
Both are Billionaires .
Imagine how successful a high tech CEO would be if they did n’t take many risks .
These are just a start of the advantages of ADHD , for more go to the list of 151 positive characteristics of people with ADHD at my ADHD Resource website .
This is not to say there are no disadvantages or real problems associated with ADDers in a high tech career , there most certainly are , and if you do n’t learn to manage them ( see Top ten ways to manage Adult ADHD ) , they can a great deal of trouble and grief to various aspects of your business , social and personal life ( and those around you ) .
That ’s when you might consider working with an adult ADHD coach .
You do n’t want to wait until your on your 20th job or 3rd spouse before you start thinking , “ hey , maybe they ’re right , I do have some problems I need to deal with ” .
If you have or think you have ADHD and work in a high tech career , what are your ADHD competitive advantages ?
The poll also reveals that non-believers outnumber believers in Britain by almost two to one .
It paints a picture of a sceptical nation with massive doubts about the effect religion has on society : 82 % of those questioned say they see religion as a cause of division and tension between people .
Only 16 % disagree .
The findings are at odds with attempts by some religious leaders to define the country as one made up of many faith communities .
Most people have no personal faith , the poll shows , with only 33 % of those questioned describing themselves as " a religious person " .
A clear majority , 63 % , say that they are not religious - including more than half of those who describe themselves as Christian .
Older people and women are the most likely to believe in a god , with 37 % of women saying they are religious , compared with 29 % of men .
The findings come at the end of a year in which multiculturalism and the role of different faiths in society has been at the heart of a divisive political debate .
But a spokesman for the Church of England denied yesterday that mainstream religion was the source of tension .
He also insisted that the " impression of secularism in this country is overrated " .
" You also have to bear in mind how society has changed .
It is more difficult to go to church now than it was .
Communities are displaced , people work longer hours - it 's harder to fit it in .
It does n't alter the fact that the Church of England will get 1 million people in church every Sunday , which is larger than any other gathering in the country . "
The Right Rev Bishop Dunn , Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle , added : " The perception that faith is a cause of division can often be because faith is misused for other uses and other agendas . "
The poll suggests , however , that in modern Britain religious observance has become a habit reserved for special occasions .
Only 13 % of those questioned claimed to visit a place of worship at least once a week , with 43 % saying they never attended religious services .
Non-Christians are the most regular attenders - 29 % say they attend a religious service at least weekly .
Yet Christmas remains a religious festival for many people , with 54 % of Christians questioned saying they intended to go to a religious service over the holiday period .
Well - off people are more likely to plan to visit a church at Christmas : 64 % of those in the highest economic categories expect to attend , compared with 43 % of those in the bottom group .
Britain 's generally tolerant attitude to religion is underlined by the small proportion who say the country is best described as a Christian one .
Only 17 % think this .
The clear majority , 62 % , agree Britain is better described as " a religious country of many faiths " .
ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,006 adults aged 18 + by telephone between December 12 and 13 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules .
Pork cuts could come fresh from the lab
Developments in tissue engineering mean that cells taken from animals could be grown directly into meat in a laboratory , the researchers say .
Scientists believe the technology already exists to directly grow processed meat like a chicken nugget .
The technology could benefit both humans and the environment .
" With a single cell , you could theoretically produce the world 's annual meat supply .
And you could do it in a way that 's better for the environment and human health .
" In the long term , this is a very feasible idea , " said Jason Matheny of the University of Maryland , part of the team whose research has been published in the Tissue Engineering journal .
Growing the meat without the animal could reduce the need to keep millions of animals in cramped conditions and would lessen the damage caused by the meat production to the environment .
Laboratory - grown meat could also be healthier , proponents say .
Eating ' mush '
Tissue engineering techniques were first developed for medical use and small amounts of edible fish tissue have been grown in research conducted by Nasa .
Concerns have been raised about eating meat from cloned animals .
" If you did n't stretch them , it would be like eating mush , " said Mr Methany .
Whilst the technology to produce processed meat is here now , producing a steak or chicken breast is still quite a way off , the researchers say .
Questions
The new techniques could also provide a dilemma for vegetarians .
Some may feel able to eat meat that has been grown without an animal being harmed .
Others feel that question marks remain about the way the cells would be taken from animals .
" It wo n't appeal to someone who gave up meat because they think it 's morally wrong to eat flesh or someone who does n't want to eat anything unnatural , " Kerry Bennett of the UK Vegetarian Society told the Guardian newspaper .
How regulators might react is also unclear .
The US Food and Drug Administration has asked companies not to market any products that involve cloned animals until their safety has been evaluated .

It was just an hour or so before sunset as we entered the Lemair Channel , one of the most visited spots on the Antarctic Peninsula .
And it is this for good reason , as the scenery is some of the most spectacular on the continent that is viewable from the deck of a ship .
The location is just below 65 degrees south latitude .
On our sail south through the channel the temperatures were mild ( around freezing ) , and the sky and water preternatural in their depth and clarity .

Penguins are ubiquitous on both the sub-Antarctic islands as well as the rim of the continent itself .
The photographic challenge that I took on was to try and show them in both harmony and juxtaposition to their environment .
Though it appears harsh and foreboding to us , this land is home to the penguin .
In this photograph I have tried to show both the scale of the environment as well as the penguin ’s place within it .

There is an abandoned whaling station at Deception Island .
There was a volcanic eruption there in the 1969 that buried much of the facility in volcanic ash .
The piece of rusted metal photographed here is of unknown provenance , but it looks to me as nothing less than an alien artifact when seen in this otherwise pristine landscape .
An interesting side note to our few hours at Deception Island was that several of the expedition staff who had been to this spot some 50 times over the years said that this was one of only two or three sunny days that they had ever seen at this locale .

The clarity of the air and water in Antarctica just ache to be recorded in the highest resolution and greatest clarity possible .
Steve Johnson used his Betterlight scanning back , which results I am very eager to see .
But a few people shot with medium format digital and large format film , as well as the usual assortment of Nikon and Canon DSLRs .
This photograph was taken with my Cambo Wide DS , Schneider Digitar lens and a Phase One P25 back .
The image quality in a large print is simply astonishing .
What makes it all the more enjoyable was that is was shot hand - held from a moving Zodiac as we toured an ice filled bay at the foot of a glacier – inaugurating my field use of the world ’s most expensive point - and - shoot .

I have absolutely no recollection of taking this photograph .
Though the camera ’s EXIF data tells me the day and time ( 6:20 am ) , and I know that it was somewhere in the Gerlache Channel , and that I was likely standing on the Monkey Deck of the ship when I took it , I simply do not remember photographing these two very distinctive clouds and icebergs .
I must have thought them worthwhile at the time , because I took a total of 7 frames over a very short period .
But even after I had done my first pass though my images from Antarctica , I missed seeing this image as worthwhile .
It was only when doing my second review , prior to archiving the raw files , that it jumped out at me .
After making a fine print , I now find it to be one of the more compelling images from this trip .
Funny how the mind works .

For photographers seeking either other - worldly colour or abstract subject matter , nothing can match Antarctic icebergs .
Ranging in size from cars to cities ( even countries ) , the most fascinating are the smaller and therefore older ones – bergs that have been rolling around and around for months , being eroded by the warmer ocean waters .

It ’s very unusual to see another ship .
Sometimes days pass between sightings .
This one was an Argentine military re-supply ship that was conducting helicopter operations , resupplying an Argentine scientific base .
We had been watching them from the deck of our ship as they flew back and forth to the base in heavy cloud , mist and snow , when all of a sudden the weather lifted , producing this light – seemingly from a super - realist painting .

The entrance to Deception Island is surrounded with lava dust covered hillsides .
The receding snow creates remarkable abstract patterns .
We entered the caldera just after dawn ( I had asked the Captain to wait for the light ) and the clouds behind the hill were just starting to be tinged by the pink of the rising sun .

It ’s almost impossible to capture the feeling of isolation coupled with drama that the Antarctic produces .
The sea can be calm , or threatening , and the continent itself appears and disappears in cloud banks .
One can stand for hours on the deck of the ship , mesmerized by the intensity of the passing vistas .

Ones ship is n’t just a means of transportation .
It is a floating platform from which to encounter dream - like images .

This iceberg , the size of a small town , had eroded windows and arches .
The arch was big enough to have sailed our ship through .
The colours were so intense that I desaturated the image , only keeping the cyan of the arch and the yellow of the clouds .
Not accurate colour , but better to my eye at least in capturing the wonder of this behemoth .

With a very few exceptions ( see immediately above ) all of the Antarctic photographs appearing on this and other pages on this site are literal .
They have been cropped , and the usual contrast , brightness , and colour balance adjustments have been made .
But in no cases have I exaggerated the colours or tonal relationships beyond typical darkroom practice .
That ’s just the way that I do photography .
But images such as this make viewers comment that they must be manipulated .
No .
It ’s simply the wonder of Antarctic light .

The extremely long sunsets and sunrises found when shooting at high latitudes in summer means that opportunities like this last for long periods of time , rather than just seconds .
On this particular evening we stood for close to an hour , shooting the changing patterns of reflected colour in the ships ripples .
Is it any wonder than most trip members shot between 50 and 100 GB of images ?

Deception Bay reminded me a lot of Iceland .
There the glaciers are blended with volcanic ash , and remarkable photographs containing contrasts of light and shape are possible .
We sailed into the bay at dawn , and the warm early morning clouds and the cold blue hills dappled with melting snow were striking in their intensity .

I was captivated by the geometry of icebergs .
From little lumps of floating ice that rub against the ship ( growlers ) to tabular icebergs the size of cities , icebergs fascinate with their colours , textures and geometry .
This one , looming above us as we circled it in a Zodiac , tells a story of tilting , cracking and age , and become the subject for a study in shape and texture .

One of the pleasures of doing landscape photography from a ship is that the landscape comes to you , rather than vise - versa .
As we were sailing down the Lemaire Channel , with steep cliffs along our starboard flank , the crescent moon disappeared behind the mountain just before I could frame a shot .
I knew that eventually it would reappear on the other side as the ship moved down the channel , and when it did I was ready with a framing that captured the other - worldliness of the Antarctic landscape .

We had remarkable weather on our 12 days in Antarctica .
This was one of the few days with overcast , and even then it was n’t solid – producing enough " glow " to illuminate this glacier .

Penguins are the comedians of the Antarctic .
Though the zoologists and guides bridle at it , anthropomorphizing their behavior is almost impossible to resist .
And , as graceful as penguins are under water , their ability to walk upright is compromised on snowy slopes , and so the belly flop is a favoured means of decent .

I did far less black and white on this shoot than I had anticipated I would .
There is so much colour in the ice , snow and sky that reducing to monochrome seems less appropriate that it does in other winter climes .
But this shot asked to be rendered as a classic B &W print .
It literally glows with subtle tonalities .

There are very few signs of man on Antarctica .
After all , it is almost the size of North America , and typically only visited by a few thousand people at any one time .
But there is history , and this abandoned whaling station at Deception Bay is one remnant preserved though benign neglect as much as anything else .
The snow drifts and weathered wood provided a welcome change from our other photography on this trip .

Unfortunately many of the images from Antarctica are not well served though display on the web .
This is one that really needs to be seen in a large print for justice to it to be served .
The ice and clouds simply glow with shades of blue and textures that are hard to believe , yet which are an accurate reflection of the unique characteristics of Antarctic light .

Mike Arrington is once again repeating his prediction that music will one day be free and un -DRM'd .
Recently he 's been praising music sites like Magnatune ( a record label with DRM - free music and a choice of formats ) and AllofMP3.com , which charges $ 0.02 per MB for un -DRM 'd music .
But ultimately he thinks the business model needs to shift towards free downloads :
I think music will be free someday soon , and money will be made on special edition cds , dvds , concerts and merchandise .
And , labels could make a very small profit by allowing downloads with all the options of allofm p3 … sort of a quality guarantee over p2p .
Forget music for a second .
I 've always thought that all online media should be free and ad- supported .
There 's also the option to sell physical copies , merchandise ( thanks , Cafepress ) and services alongside the product .
This is a pretty extreme view , I know , but it seems to me that whenever you lock content away behind a pay barrier ( or even just a free signup form ) you simply encourage people to go elsewhere .
Why have a book printed with the opportunity to sell a few thousand copies when you could put it online and potentially reach millions of readers ?
Once the content is free , you can opt for an ad- supported model and sell print - on - demand copies through sites like Lulu .
And once it 's freely available , your content becomes an ad for you and your services , justifying your ludicrously expensive consulting fees .
Media is not scarce any more - attention is the scarce resource .
The danger is not that people will " steal " your content , it 's that they 'll never be exposed to it at all .
[ start rant ]
And on a side note : Mike Arrington , Om Malik , and Steve Rubel are complaining about sploggers stealing their content .
Fair enough - taking content wholesale without attribution is stealing .
But the fact is that for every splogger you catch , there will be many , many more who get away with it .
Here 's a crazy thought : you can't completely stop your content from being republished on the web , so how about finding ways to turn that to your advantage ?
Let 's take another look at Fred Wilson 's rules for the future of media :
1 - Microchunk it - Reduce the content to its simplest form .
Thanks Umair .
2 - Free it -
Put it out there without walls around it or strings on it .
Thanks Stewart .
3 - Syndicate it -
Let anyone take it and run with it .
Thanks Dave .
4 - Monetize it -
Put the monetization and tracking systems into the microchunk .
Thanks Feedburner .
The reason Mike and others lose out to the sploggers is that they 're not monetizing the microchunk ( ie their feeds ) .
There are obvious ways to do this ( through blatant ads or less intrusive affiliate links ) , but there are also more subtle ways .
If the splogger is n't giving attribution , why not put the attribution in there yourself ?
Why not make a point of linking back to related articles at every opportunity ?
That way you still get links back to your content whether or not attribution is given .
There are other ways to do this too , of course , like putting a " by Pete Cashmore " line somewhere in the feed itself .
Or how about mentioning your consulting services , your current project or your quest to find Ruby on Rails developers who'll work for revenue share ?
The point I 'm trying to make is that syndicated content can become an ad for you , your blog and your services .
You need to create a system in which you make more money from the splogger than they make from you .
What 's more , you need to do it in a way that wo n't alienate your readers - in other words , do n't overdo it .
Now I 'm not saying that splogs are n't evil in other ways - they clog up search results , create fake trackbacks and generally make it harder to navigate through the blogosphere .
Services like Technorati and PubSub will still need to figure out what is original and what is not .
And of course there are rumors that Google penalizes sites which contain duplicate content , but I can't find any evidence to support this ( do I get penalized when Bloglines reproduces my blog ? ) .
My point is that bloggers can't on the one hand whine about how the newspaper industry is trying to package its content and control its distribution while at the same time trying to restrict the distribution of their own writing .
Go with the flow , goddammit .
[ end rant ]
Now back to the music .
I do n't think the music industry is at the same point as the newspaper and publishing industries .
People are still prepared to pay for the convenience of a service like iTunes , and ad - supported models for music are very difficult to achieve - not only does music cost you more in bandwidth than text , but you 've got the added problem that it is n't easily indexed by the search engines .
For mainstream artists , I still feel that the best option is to stick with your record label .
But if you 're an unsigned band , you should give away your music in an un-DRM'd format and make your money on merchandise , print - on demand CDs ( Lulu again ) , special editions and — most of all — concerts and live gigs .
PS .
Sorry for all the bold text - I do n't know what came over me . :)
PPS .
It 's almost New Year !
Woot woot !
Update ( Jan 1st ) : I just found out that the splogger who took Mike Arrington 's content was not only failing to provide attribution , but also * intentionally removing * all the self - referential links back to TechCrunch .
That 's totally scummy and I respect Mike for going after him .
The idea of monetizing the microchunk ( or putting in your own attribution ) only works if the splogger is n't removing the attribution and ads .
I 'm trying hard to think of ways you could prevent the removal of these watermarks ( especially automated removal ) , but I can't think of any offhand .
Any thoughts ?
“ Two years ago we slowed it down to 38 miles an hour ; now we ’ve been able to park it then bring it back up to full speed . ”
Lene
Hau is n’t talking about a used motorbike , but about light  that ethereal , life - sustaining stuff that normally travels 93 million miles from the sun in about eight minutes .
Less than five years ago , the speed of light was considered one of the universe ’s great constants .
Albert Einstein theorized that light cannot travel faster than 186,282 miles per second .
No one has proved him wrong , but he never said that it could n’t go slower .
Hau , 41 , a professor of physics at Harvard , admits that the famous genius would “ probably be stunned ” at the results of her experiments .
Working at the Rowland Institute for Science , overlooking the Charles River and the gold dome of the state Capitol in Boston , she and her colleagues slowed light 20 million - fold in 1999 , to an incredible 38 miles an hour .
They did it by passing a beam of light through a small cloud of atoms cooled to temperatures a billion times colder than those in the spaces between stars .
The atom cloud was suspended magnetically in a chamber pumped down to a vacuum 100 trillion times lower than the pressure of air in the room where you are reading this .
• Video : Light and matter ( 2007 ) ( 1:52 )
• Video : Light stopper ( 2001 ) ( 2:52 )
• More multimedia
“ It ’s nifty to look into the chamber and see a clump of ultracold atoms floating there , ” Hau says .
“ In this odd state , light takes on a more human dimension ; you can almost touch it . ”
She and her team continued to tweak their system until they finally brought light to a complete stop .
The light dims as it slows down , so you think that it ’s being turned out .
Then
Hau shoots a yellow - orange laser beam into the cloud of atoms , and the light emerges at full speed and intensity .
Inspired by Hau ’s success at slowing light , researchers working on a wooded hill a few miles away at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) used a similar technique to stop , then restart , a light beam .
That team was headed by Ronald Walsworth and Mikhail Lukin , both associates of Harvard College .
Their success was independent of Hau ’s effort .
“ We did n’t have much contact , ” she notes , “ just a few e-mails . ”
Stopping cold
Besides stirring a research rush to explore exotic forms of matter , such experiments open the door to some practical applications .
These include vastly more powerful computers as well as the possibility of communications that are much more secure from hackers and people trying to steal your credit and bank card numbers .
“ We hope for wonderful things , ” says David Phillips , who worked on the CfA “ stop light ” project .
“ Our imagination has n’t figured out what the possibilities are yet . ”
Hau , a tall , slender scientist educated as a theoretical physicist in Denmark , had a hunch several years ago that intensely cold atoms would become a hot area in physics .
In the mid-1990s , she and her colleagues became excited about experiments aimed at crowding atoms so close together that unusual things happen .
The key is to cool them to within a billionth of a degree of minus 459.7 degrees F. Called “ absolute zero , ” this is the temperature at which atoms have the least possible energy , and they all but cease to move around .
Hau was one of several researchers who succeeded in creating this novel state of matter .
She corresponded with a colleague , Stepen Harris at Stanford University , and they came up with the idea that it might be possible to use a small ball of cold atoms to slow down light .
Hau and her group then figured out a way to make it work .
Using sodium atoms and two laser beams , they made a new kind of medium that entangles light and slows it down .
The laser beams glow yellow - orange like sodium streetlights , and the cigar - shaped cloud of atoms is about eight - thousandths of an inch long and about a third as wide .
Working with Chien Liu , a postdoctoral fellow at Rowland , and Harvard graduate students Zachary Dutton and Cyrus Behroozi , Hau kept tweaking the atoms until they completely stopped laser light .
This happens when a second laser beam directed at right angles to the cloud of atoms is cut off .
When that laser is switched on again , it abruptly frees the light from the trap and it goes on its way .
Hau explains that light entering the atomic entanglement transfers its energy to the atoms .
Light energy raises the atoms to higher energy levels in ways that depend on the frequency and intensity of the light .
The laser illuminating the cloud at right angles to the incoming beam acts like a parking brake , stopping the beam inside the cloud when it is shut off .
When it is turned on again , the brake is released , the atoms transfer their energy back to the light , and it leaves the end of the cloud at full speed and intensity .
Hau ’s team stopped light for one - thousandth of a second .
Atomically speaking , “ this is an amazingly long time , ” Hau notes .
“ But we think it can be stopped for much longer . ”
The CfA researchers used an easier method .
They shot laser beams through a dense cloud of rubidium and helium gas .
( Rubidium , in its solid or natural form , is a soft , silver - white metal . )
The light bounced from atom to atom , gradually slowing down until it stopped .
No supervacuum or ultra-cold was needed .
In fact , the chamber where the light stopped was at a temperature of 176 degrees F .
This convenience comes at a cost , however .
Only half of the incoming light was stored , then recovered , and the storage time was much shorter .
Think of both contraptions as sophisticated light switches that control not just light but information .
Incoming light can carry information expressed by changes or modulations of its frequency , amplitude , and phase .
When the light stops , that information is stored just like information is stored in the electronic memory of a computer .
To access the information , you turn on a control laser , and out it comes .
Shrinking computers
Computers operating by these so - called quantum effects are much more efficient that those available today , or even on the drawing board .
( “ Quantum ” refers to changes in the energy levels of the atoms . )
Today ’s machines represent information in bits , electronic combinations of zeros and ones .
Bits represented by quantum states of atoms could carry much , much more information .
Cubic inch for cubic inch , quantum computers could tackle problems that would stymie the most super of conventional computers .
For example , they could perform many calculations simultaneously .
Another thing they could do would be to encrypt information in complex codes impossible to crack without extremely expensive and time - consuming methods .
Financial and other information would be prodigiously safer with a quantum computer .
As marvelous as they are , however , both the Rowland and CfA systems take up more space and power than would be practical .
Hau ’s experiment requires a small room , CfA ’s needs a large tabletop .
CfA researchers need to solve this problem and to make sure all the light is stored  not just half .
That will take many years .
Hau has already started ordering and installing equipment with which she plans to construct a quantum light stopper no bigger than a fingernail .
She envisions ultracold and supervacuums being achieved with devices less than one - thousandth of an inch in size .
These would be built on chips no bigger than the Pentium IV that runs many of today ’s small laptop and palm - sized computers .
“ Would n’t that be nifty ! ” Hau says .
She and her colleagues describe their experiment in detail in today ’s issue of the journal Nature .
SOMETIMES PEOPLE in law enforcement will hear it whispered that I ’m a former cop who favors decriminalization of marijuana laws , and they ’ll approach me the way they might a traitor or snitch .
So let me set the record straight .
Yes , I was a cop for 34 years , the last six of which I spent as chief of Seattle ’s police department .
But no , I do n’t favor decriminalization .
I favor legalization , and not just of pot but of all drugs , including heroin , cocaine , meth , psychotropics , mushrooms and LSD .
Decriminalization , as my colleagues in the drug reform movement hasten to inform me , takes the crime out of using drugs but continues to classify possession and use as a public offense , punishable by fines .

I ’ve never understood why adults should n’t enjoy the same right to use verboten drugs as they have to suck on a Marlboro or knock back a scotch and water .
Prohibition of alcohol fell flat on its face .
The prohibition of other drugs rests on an equally wobbly foundation .
Not until we choose to frame responsible drug use -- not an oxymoron in my dictionary -- as a civil liberty will we be able to recognize the abuse of drugs , including alcohol , for what it is : a medical , not a criminal , matter .
As a cop , I bore witness to the multiple lunacies of the “ war on drugs . ”
Lasting far longer than any other of our national conflicts , the drug war has been prosecuted with equal vigor by Republican and Democratic administrations , with one president after another -- Nixon , Ford , Carter , Reagan , Bush , Clinton , Bush -- delivering sanctimonious sermons , squandering vast sums of taxpayer money and cheerleading law enforcers from the safety of the sidelines .
It ’s not a stretch to conclude that our draconian approach to drug use is the most injurious domestic policy since slavery .
Want to cut back on prison overcrowding and save a bundle on the construction of new facilities ?
Open the doors , let the nonviolent drug offenders go .
The huge increases in federal and state prison populations during the 1980s and ‘ 90s ( from 139 per 100,000 residents in 1980 to 482 per 100,000 in 2003 ) were mainly for drug convictions .
In 1980 , 580,900 Americans were arrested on drug charges .
By 2003 , that figure had ballooned to 1,678,200 .
We ’re making more arrests for drug offenses than for murder , manslaughter , forcible rape and aggravated assault combined .
Feel safer ?

I ’ve witnessed the devastating effects of open - air drug markets in residential neighborhoods : children recruited as runners , mules and lookouts ; drug dealers and innocent citizens shot dead in firefights between rival traffickers bent on protecting or expanding their markets ; dedicated narcotics officers tortured and killed in the line of duty ; prisons filled with nonviolent drug offenders ; and drug - related foreign policies that foster political instability , wreak health and environmental disasters , and make life even tougher for indigenous subsistence farmers in places such as Latin America and Afghanistan .
All because we like our drugs -- and ca n’t have them without breaking the law .
As an illicit commodity , drugs cost and generate extravagant sums of ( laundered , untaxed ) money , a powerful magnet for character - challenged police officers .
Although small in numbers of offenders , there is n’t a major police force -- the Los Angeles Police Department included -- that has escaped the problem : cops , sworn to uphold the law , seizing and converting drugs to their own use , planting dope on suspects , robbing and extorting pushers , taking up dealing themselves , intimidating or murdering witnesses .
In declaring a war on drugs , we ’ve declared war on our fellow citizens .
War requires “ hostiles ” -- enemies we can demonize , fear and loathe .
This unfortunate categorization of millions of our citizens justifies treating them as dope fiends , evil - doers , less than human .
That grants political license to ban the exchange or purchase of clean needles or to withhold methadone from heroin addicts motivated to kick the addiction .

President Bush has even said no to medical marijuana .
Why would he want to “ coddle ” the enemy ?
Even if the enemy is a suffering AIDS or cancer patient for whom marijuana promises palliative , if not therapeutic , powers .
As a nation , we ’re long overdue for a soul - searching , coldly analytical look at both the “ drug scene ” and the drug war .
Such candor would reveal the futility of our current policies , exposing the embarrassingly meager return on our massive enforcement investment ( about $ 69 billion a year , according to Jack Cole , founder and executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ) .
How would “ regulated legalization ” work ?
It would : 1 ) Permit private companies to compete for licenses to cultivate , harvest , manufacture , package and peddle drugs .
2 ) Create a new federal regulatory agency ( with no apologies to libertarians or paleo - conservatives ) .
Advertisement
3 ) Set and enforce standards of sanitation , potency and purity .
4 ) Ban advertising .
5 ) Impose ( with congressional approval ) taxes , fees and fines to be used for drug - abuse prevention and treatment and to cover the costs of administering the new regulatory agency .
6 ) Police the industry much as alcoholic beverage control agencies keep a watch on bars and liquor stores at the state level .
Such reforms would in no way excuse drug users who commit crimes : driving while impaired , providing drugs to minors , stealing an iPod or a Lexus , assaulting one ’s spouse , abusing one ’s child .
The message is simple .
Get loaded , commit a crime , do the time .
Advertisement
These reforms would yield major reductions in a host of predatory street crimes , a disproportionate number of which are committed by users who resort to stealing in order to support their habit or addiction .
Regulated legalization would soon dry up most stockpiles of currently illicit drugs -- substances of uneven , often questionable quality ( including “ bunk , ” i.e. , fakes such as oregano , gypsum , baking powder or even poisons passed off as the genuine article ) .
It would extract from today ’s drug dealing the obscene profits that attract the needy and the greedy and fuel armed violence .
And it would put most of those certifiably frightening crystal meth labs out of business once and for all .
Combined with treatment , education and other public health programs for drug abusers , regulated legalization would make your city or town an infinitely healthier place to live and raise a family .
It would make being a cop a much safer occupation , and it would lead to greater police accountability and improved morale and job satisfaction .
Advertisement
But would n’t regulated legalization lead to more users and , more to the point , drug abusers ?
Probably , though no one knows for sure -- our leaders are too timid even to broach the subject in polite circles , much less to experiment with new policy models .
My own prediction ?
We ’d see modest increases in use , negligible increases in abuse .
The demand for illicit drugs is as strong as the nation ’s thirst for bootleg booze during Prohibition .
It ’s a demand that simply will not dwindle or dry up .
Whether to find God , heighten sexual arousal , relieve physical pain , drown one ’s sorrows or simply feel good , people throughout the millenniums have turned to mood - and mind - altering substances .
They ’re not about to stop , no matter what their government says or does .
It ’s time to accept drug use as a right of adult Americans , treat drug abuse as a public health problem and end the madness of an unwinnable war .
Mathematicians have finally laid to rest the legendary mystery surrounding an elusive group of numerical expressions known as the " mock theta functions . "
Number theorists have struggled to understand the functions ever since the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan first alluded to them in a letter written on his deathbed , in 1920 .
Now , using mathematical techniques that emerged well after Ramanujan 's death , two number theorists at the University of Wisconsin - Madison have pieced together an explanatory framework that for the first time illustrates what mock theta functions are , and exactly how to derive them .
Their new theory is proving invaluable in the resolution of long - standing open questions in number theory .
In addition , the UW - Madison advance will for the first time enable researchers to apply mock theta functions to problems in a variety of fields , including physics , chemistry and several branches of mathematics .
The findings appear in a series of three papers , the third appearing today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" It 's extremely gratifying to be able to say we solved the ' final problem ' of Ramanujan , " says co-author Ken Ono , UW - Madison Manasse Professor of Letters and Science , who is widely noted for contributions to number theory .
" We simply got really lucky . "
Ono worked in collaboration with German mathematician Kathrin Bringmann , a postdoctoral researcher at UW - Madison .
" This is something I really did n't expect anybody to do , " says George Andrews , a leading number theorist at Pennsylvania State University who in 2000 called mock theta functions one of the most difficult math puzzles of the new millennium .
" It is an outstanding piece of work , a breathtakingly wonderful achievement . "
Working from Ramanujan 's letter , number theorists believed that mock theta functions are related to a well - understood class of mathematical expressions - the ' theta ' functions - that have been in use for centuries .
Theta functions constitute a certain sequence of numbers that has proved useful in various problems of mathematical analysis .
Mock theta functions similarly constitute an infinite series of numbers .
But what has been completely baffling is what it is about mock theta series that make them so rich and powerful .
Over the decades - much to the amazement of mathematicians everywhere - mock theta functions have cropped up amidst calculations in a number of fields , including mathematics , physics , chemistry , and even cancer research .
What made mock theta functions all the more inscrutable was the fact that the first few pages of Ramanujan 's letter were lost .
Those pages may have contained more clues , but in their absence , the letter merely presented 17 examples of the functions .
What 's missing is any definition of what the functions are , any hints on how to derive them , and any indication of why they are even important .
All those secrets died with Ramanujan just two months after he wrote the letter , when he succumbed to tuberculosis at the age of 32 .
" Imagine stringing together a thousand random words and then saying you 've come up with the most beautiful poetry , " says Ono .
" That 's essentially what Ramanujan did to us . "
Bringmann and Ono made sense of it all by finding a way to represent the power of mock theta functions through another relatively new family of mathematical expressions known as the Harmonic Maass Forms .
A Dutch mathematician named Sander Zwegers had already made that important connection in 2002 , but he had focused only on Ramanujan 's examples .
It was during a flight to New Hampshire that Ono realized the full depth and meaning of Zwegers ' work .
Skimming a journal to pass the time , Ono happened upon an old article by George Andrews on mock theta functions .
Suddenly , he noticed that some of the mathematics in the paper seemed to resonate with parts of the Harmonic Maass theory , which he and Bringmann just happened to be developing at the time , for other reasons .
The mathematicians found the connection held up beautifully .
" We knew we were onto something right away , " says Ono .
" It was an uncanny set of coincidences that lead us to this solution .
It was as if it all just fell into our lap and now we are serendipitously applying our theory to longstanding open problems . "

Looks like Mac won another battle over Windows .
After a three - month period in which he completely abandoned the PC and its Windows to try out Mac , longtime expert Scot Finnie made his choice : definitely Mac !
The saga began in November last year , after a prolonged period of tests in Vista 's beta cycle , when the expert could n't help but wonder weather people will find Vista the best choice for an operating system .
No answer came to mind , so he decided to take a bold step and completely stop using Windows for three whole months , choosing for both his work and home computer Apple 's Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro , with Mac OS X .
The three months came to an end and his mind is made up : no more Windows .
" The value and advantage of the Mac and OS X are difficult to miss " , says the Windows expert .
He said he came to realize what Mac users meant when saying " It just works " .
It means you spend less time on working on your computer and more on your work .
It 's important to mention that Scot Finnie has expressed earlier this year this thoughts on Vista , after thorough testing .
" Trouble with Vista " was his choice of words .
He says he does n't even hate it , as he did with ME .
He feels Vista brings nothing truly new and that none of its features could make one really want to get Vista , though he admits that much work was invested in bringing out the latest Windows OS .
What 's to be learned from Scot Finnie 's experience ?
Well , perhaps nothing new .
All computer users who experienced both Windows and Mac know : we use Windows because we have to , even though Mac is better .
Windows Vista will still be a success , many PC users will choose it over XP ( though XP is probably better ) .

Google on Thursday rolled out a new version of its Picasa Web Albums service , which enables users to upload their photos free of charge .
While the service previously focused on private use , the update brings new community features like those offered by Yahoo's Flickr .
A search function now enables users to search for and browse photos from any public photo album .
In addition , photos can be more easily linked within e-mails , IMs and Web sites .
Storage space has also been increased for users of the free service , who can now upload up to 1GB worth of photos .
Those needing more space can pay an annual fee for up to 250GB .
About
My name is Allysson Lucca - @all_lucca -
I'm a brazilian designer currently living in NYC , and first introduced The Miniature Earth in 2001 after I saw a powerpoint presentation with The State of the Villare Report , written by Donella Meadows , who passed away in February 2000 .
Nowadays DonellaMeadows.org , through Donella ’s Foundation , carries on her ideas and projects .
The idea of reducing the world ’s population to a community of only 100 people is very useful and important .
It makes us easily understand the differences in the world .
There are many types of reports that use the Earth ’s population reduced to 100 people , especially in the Internet .
Ideas like this should be more often shared , especially nowadays when the world seems to be in need of dialogue and understanding among different cultures , in a way that it has never been before .
Since 2001 this video has been seen by more than 7 million people around the globe and linked by more than 20.000 websites , I donated more than $ 5,000.00 to NGOs in Brazil since then , the money came from CDROMs and T - Shirt sales ( sold out ) .

CHR ( Constraint Handling Rules )
Haskell CHR
A concurrent committed - choice constraint logic programming language , implemented using GHC 's software transactional memory .
According to the site referenced by the above - mentioned link , " It also contains an implementation of WAM for Haskell , so Prolog - style terms with variables are now possible . "
CCHR : STM - based CHR implementation by Lam and Sulzmann According to the site referenced by the above - mentioned link , " CCHR is an experimental concurrent implementation of Constraint Handling Rules , designed to exploit concurrency and parallelism explicitly .
CCHR is implemented in Haskell , with software transactional memory to manage synchronization of multiple solver threads working on the same problem .
Constraint Handling Rules ( CHR ) is a concurrent committed choice constraint logic programming language to describe transformations ( rewritings ) among multi-sets of constraints ( atomic formulae ) .
CHR naturally support concurrent programming .
Conjunction of constraints can be regarded as interacting collections of multiple asynchronous agents or processes .
Their interaction is specified via transformation rules which can be applied simultaneously if the transformation rules do not interfere .
Hence , one would expect to run CHR faster by executing transformation rules in parallel on a multi-core machine architecture .
CCHR exactly allows such concurrency while solving CHR problems and exhibits significant speed up in most problems when executed on multi-core systems . "

You , dearreader , are one in a thousand .
The factthat you 're confronting this column on a web site devoted to space science andastronomy makes you roughly as rare as technetium .
Despite the fact thatastronomy is one of the two most popular science subjects in American schools ( the other is biology ) , it 's really not that popular .
Theoverwhelming majority of the citizenry has other interests , and looming largeamong them are the peccadilloes and personal intrigues of the rich and famous .
Consider the contrast : in the past week the Space Telescope Science Institutereleased a startlingly detailed photo of a distant cluster of galaxies , apicture that gives even the non-expert a good idea of the structure of these , the largest entities in the universe .
The photo of cluster Abell S0740 - animage that would have bedazed every previous generation of humans - probablydid n't even make it to the front section of your local newspaper .
However , what did garner front - page ink last week , not to mention huge dollops ofchatter on talk radio , was the unexpected death of Anna Nicole Smith , a formerPlayboy Playmate and reality TV star .
Moviedirector Frank Capra was n't disclosing a staggering new truth in noting that " what interests people is people . "
One dead - obvious reason is that those whoare thoroughly unresponsive to their fellow humanoids do n't get a lot of representationin the next generation .
We 're most interested in people , in the same way thatclick beetles are most interested in click beetles .
That 's evolution .
But why theseemingly preternatural fascination with famous personalities , be they powerfulfigures ( politicians , for example ) or mere celebrities , as was Ms Smith ?
That , too , seems to have a clear evolutionary benefit .
Unlike most of the beasts of theforest , we 're quite good at learning things .
Stories - made possible by speech - are efficient ways of conveying life lessons to the young without the troubleand danger of actually having to demonstrate .
Hearing stories about successfulpeople , as well as those who have fallen , could prompt us to imitate thebehaviors of the former and avoid those of the latter .
Heroes , in other words , have survival value .
Thepeculiar thing is that American heroes are n't often very good at science .
Indeed , in much popular culture , it 's only the villains who 're conversant withMaxwell or Einstein .
The " mad scientist " has become such a cultural icon thatthe Royal Society held a special lecture on the subject .
Some of the mad menof science ( and they are , overwhelmingly , men ) are just evil characters intenton destroying the world , taking over the world , or simply rearranging the worldaccording to their personal predilections .
Dr. No and Dr. Evil come to mind , as do Lex Luthor , Dr. Octopus , the overly Teutonic Dr. Strangelove , and the Green Goblin .
How didscientists become the enemy ?
I mean , really : who would you rather have helpyou take a calculus final ... or for that matter , cure the common cold or figureout the nature of dark energy : Spiderman or Green Goblin ?
Science is useful .
And if thescientists in popular media have n't slipped entirely to the dark side , they 'veat least gone bonkers .
They 've become obsessed with some narrow field ofresearch , and lost sight of the big picture .
When a prehistoric monster isshambling through a major metropolis , wreaking havoc and destruction , there 'salways some lab - coated PhD who 's interfering with the steely - eyed militarytypes , screaming " we have to save it for science ! "
And just to make sure thatthese howling academics wo n't become your role model , they 're usually portrayedas short , ugly bald guys with social grace and sex appeal on a par with Ben therodent .
Thisanti-science stuff seems to have arisen in the 19th century , when the pastorallifestyle of the English countryside was being threatened by the steam engine .
At the same time , Victor Frankenstein was endeavoring to replace sex andfamilies by creating a barely functional human simulacrum in the lab ( using notmuch more than Tesla coils and scrounged parts ) , and Dr. Faustus was outhawking his soul for some knowledge .
That 's allEuropean .
But when it comes to anti-science bias , Americans are hard to beat .
Our frontier heritage surely plays a role .
When facing off against brutalmountains , a harsh climate , aggressive animals , and an indigenous populationthat might not cotton to new arrivals , are you better off wielding Newton 's equations or a Bowie knife ?
American heroes are survivors , as television viewersknow .
Inaddition , and since the Second World War , the public 's perception of sciencehas been influenced by the destructive potential of some of its products .
These range from the evil wrought by Nazi scientists to the development ofscary atomic power .
Today , the threats posed by thinking machines or geneticengineering are the workaday staples of mad , bad science .
That 's just movingwith the times , but the public 's reaction is the same : this stuff could bedangerous , and besides I do n't understand it .
Ergo , I 'll bolster myself - esteem by putting you down because you do .
So it 's nosurprise that a discipline like astronomy - as popular as it is - doesn ' treally electrify most folks .
The combined circulation of Astronomy and Sky& Telescope is roughly 200,000 ( with readership about twice that ) .
Thecirculation of People magazine is 3,700,000 .
Themembership of the Astronomical League , a national organization of amateurastronomers , is 16,000 .
The National Mah Jongg League has 275,000 .
You are , very literally , one in a thousand .
But there 's little reason to grouse .
Thecult of personality , while mesmerizing , is n't going to guide Homo sapiens intoa better future .
You 're like the pioneer ants - the small percentage of antsthat dare to explore , and who are , ultimately , responsible for the colony ' slong - term survival .
Anna NicoleSmith may get the column inches now , but the future is yours .
Google Earth has been in the news for all the wrong reasons .
However , here 's something different .
Indian farmers of Pen taluka in the Raigad district of Maharashtra have used images obtained from Google Earth to claim higher compensation for their lands from the Government .
A few months ago the farmers were told to vacate as the state government was acquiring their lands for an SEZ ( Special Economic Zone ) .
The state authorities claimed parts of the land was submerged in salty creek water and was infertile and only a small portion of it was fertile .
This would mean a low compensation for the farmers .
To prove the authorities wrong , Mr Arun Shivkar , an activist of the SEZ Hatao Virodh Samiti used Google Earth to generate images of the crop lands .
The images clearly showed fertile crop areas , thus vindicating the claims of farmers for more compensation .
Smart use of technology , is n't it ?

I ca n’t help but laugh at the pathetic attempts the MPAA and RIAA use to stop piracy .
Some of the tips are so lame , they actually might push their users over the edge , and start pirating movies and music .
First they start by enticing their readers and inform them of all the good things about pirated movies .
You get the movies before they come out :
Movies that have yet to be released in theatres , or which are still out in theatres , generally are not be available in the DVD format .
If very recent titles are being sold on an auction or other online retail sites , they are most likely pirated .
Notice the obvious grammar error in their quote ?
Conclusive proof the MPAA is a gang of morons ?
I think so .
Pirated movies are cheaper than the ones we sell :
Even if you are hoping to get your favorite movie titles at a discount , new or used , the extremely low prices offered on some Web sites might indicate pirated product .
Pirated copies , unlike ours contain no DRM and are region free :
In addition , if anywhere on the package it reads that the disc is an “ All - Region , ” “ 0 - Region , ” or “ No Region ” product , it ’s highly likely that the DVD is pirated .
Is pirating your movies starting to sound better and better ?
Would you like to learn more ?
Excellent , the MPAA kindly gives you a list of applications you can use to download free movies .
As a courtesy they ’ve also said that these programs can be used to download that $ 600 Adobe product youâ€™ve always wanted , or that South Park episode you missed .
A peer - to - peer service is a network that enables computers to connect directly to each other in order to distribute and copy files .
Software programs utilize these networks to search for and trade every kind of file .
Examples of P2P services include eDonkey , KazaA , Limewire and DirectConnect .
Careful kids , because as we all know downloading music is FAR more damaging and worse than stealing a used pair of shoes .
It is no different from stealing another person ’s shoes or stereo , except sometimes it can be a lot more damaging .
I ’m convinced , are you ?
Montana moves to reject Real ID Act Several state legislatures are considering measures opposing a federal law aimed at fighting terrorism by making driver 's licenses harder to get .
The Montana House of Representatives expects to vote today on a bill that would make Montana the first state to ignore the Real ID law , which requires states to demand a minimum standard of proof of residency from people seeking driver 's licenses .
The bill passed a Montana House committee 17 - 0 last week and needs Senate approval .
The Maine State Legislature last week became the first to approve a resolution urging Congress to overturn the law before it takes effect in May 2008 .
Only four of 186 Maine lawmakers voted no .
" You 're going to see a lot more states getting on board , " said Montana state Rep. Brady Wiseman , a Democrat who wrote the bill .
Other states with bills : Hawaii , Georgia , Massachusetts , New Mexico , Oklahoma , Vermont and Washington .
State Rep. Jim Guest of Missouri , a Republican leading a national coalition against Real ID , said 30 states could pass measures opposing the law .
Residents of states that do n't comply will be barred from using their licenses or state IDs to board airplanes , open bank accounts or enter federal buildings .
Wiseman and other opponents hope enough states protest or defy the law that Congress will be forced to revise or repeal it .
" If one state says no , or another state follows Maine , the whole house of cards collapses , " said Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union .
Democratic control of Congress makes repeal more likely than before , Steinhardt said .
When Real ID passed the House , 219 Republicans supported it and 152 Democrats opposed .
Rep. Lamar Smith , R - Texas , who co-sponsored the law , said Congress is " very unlikely " to repeal a law that deters terrorists " who could use a driver 's license ID as cover . "
The law sets the first federal standards for getting licenses , which the 9/11 Commission recommended after finding the Sept. 11 hijackers got 34 licenses and government ID cards .
Seven hijackers lied on residency statements .
Everyone would have to renew licenses and state IDs in person by 2013 with documents showing their Social Security number and home address , and that they are in the USA legally .
New applicants face the same standards .
Bills to comply with the law are pending in six state legislatures .
Indiana state Sen. Vic Heinold , a Republican , said the law helps " control the immigration situation " by allowing visitors to get licenses only for as long as their visas are valid .
Critics fear that requiring all licenses to use identical technology for machine reading would lead places that check IDs , such as bars , office buildings and retailers , to increase their use of such scanning machines and create digital records every time a card is swiped .
" They could remain and be pieced together to create footprints about where we 've been and what we 've done , " said Jim Harper of the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank in Washington , D.C. State lawmakers also protest the cost .
The National Governors Association says it will cost more than $ 11 billion over five years .
Congress , estimating a $ 100 million cost , provided $ 40 million .
The New Lambda Expressions Feature in C# 3.0
C# 2.0 ( released in November 2005 ) introduced a new feature , anonymous methods , that allows you to declare your method code inline instead of with a delegate function .
Lambda expressions , a new feature in C# 3.0 , have a more concise syntax to achieve the same goal .
Take a closer look at anonymous methods before discussing lambda expressions .
Suppose you want to create a button that updates a ListBox on your form when you click it .
In C# 1.0 and 1.1 , you would do it as follows :
public MyForm ( ) { listBox = new ListBox ( ... ) ; textBox = new TextBox ( ... ) ; addButton = new Button ( ... ) ; addButton .
Click += new EventHandler ( AddClick ) ; } void AddClick ( object sender , EventArgs e ) { listBox .
Items .
Add(textBox .
Text ) ; }
With C# 2.0 , you could have it as under :
public MyForm ( ) { listBox = new ListBox ( ... ) ; textBox = new TextBox ( ... ) ; addButton = new Button ( ... ) ; addButton .
Click += delegate { listBox .
Items.Add(textBox .
Text ) ; } ;
As you can see , you do n't have to explicitly declare a new method to link it with an event .
You can use anonymous methods to achieve the same thing in C# 2.0 .
C# 3.0 introduces an even simpler syntax , lambda expressions , which you write as a parameter list followed by the " => " token , followed by an expression or a statement block .
Parameters to Lambda Expressions
The parameters of a lambda expression can be explicitly or implicitly typed .
In an explicitly typed parameter list , the type of each expression is explicitly specified .
In an implicitly typed parameter list , the types are inferred from the context in which the lambda expression occurs :
( int x ) => x + 1 // explicitly typed parameter ( y, z ) => return y * z ; // implicitly typed parameter
Lambda Expressions Demonstration
The following code snippet from the downloadable source code uses two techniques to print out strings in a list whose length is even .
The first technique , implemented in the function AnonMethod , is through anonymous methods .
The second technique , implemented in the function LambdaExample , is through a lambda expression :
// Program.cs using System ; using System .
Collections .
Generic ; using System .
Text ; using System .
Query ; using System.Xml.XLinq ; using System .Data .DLinq ; namespace LambdaExample { public delegate bool KeyValueFilter <K , V>( K key , V value ) ; static class Program { static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { List < string > list = new List < string >( ) ; list .
Add ( " AA " ) ; list .
Add ( " ABC " ) ; list .
Add( " DEFG " ) ; list .
Add( " XYZ " ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( " Through Anonymous method " ) ; AnonMethod ( list ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( " Through Lambda expression " ) ; LambdaExample ( list ) ; Dictionary < string , int > varClothes= new Dictionary < string , int > ( ) ; varClothes .
Add ( " Jeans " , 20 ) ; varClothes .
Add ( " Shirts " , 15 ) ; varClothes .
Add ( " Pajamas " , 9 ) ; varClothes .
Add ( " Shoes " , 9 ) ; var ClothesListShortage = varClothes .
FilterBy ( ( string name , int count ) => name == " Shoes " && count < 10 ) ; // example of multiple parameters if ( ClothesListShortage .
Count >
0 ) Console .
WriteLine
( " We are short of shoes " ) ; Console.ReadLine( ) ; } static void AnonMethod ( List < string > list ) { List < string > evenNumbers = list .
FindAll ( delegate ( string i ) { return ( i. Length % 2 ) == 0 ; } ) ; foreach ( string evenNumber in evenNumbers ) { Console. WriteLine( evenNumber ) ; } } static void LambdaExample ( List < string > list ) { var evenNumbers = list .
FindAll( i => ( i.Length % 2 ) == 0 ) ; // example of single parameter foreach ( string i in evenNumbers ) { Console .
WriteLine( i ) ; } } } public static class Extensions { public static Dictionary < K , V > FilterBy < K , V > ( this Dictionary < K , V > items , KeyValueFilter < K , V> filter ) { var result = new Dictionary < K , V > ( ) ; foreach ( KeyValuePair < K , V> element in items ) { if ( filter ( element .
Key , element .
Value ) ) result .
Add( element .
Key , element .
Value ) ; } return result ; } } }
The second technique is sort of interesting .
It filters the list of strings based on the length of the string , but it uses a new syntax .
If you have Visual Studio 2005 and LinQ Preview installed , you can use the editor to compile the application .
If you do not have VS2005 , you can compile the code from the command line by using the following command :
C: \Program Files\LINQ
Preview \Bin\Csc.exe /reference : " C:\Program Files\LINQ Preview \Bin\System.Data.DLinq.dll " / reference : C: \WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.Data.dll /reference:C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.dll /reference : " C:\Program Files\LINQ Preview \Bin\System.Query.dll " / reference : C: \WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.Xml.dll /reference : " C:\Program Files\LINQ Preview \Bin\System.Xml.XLinq.dll " / target : exe Program.cs

というわけでここ数日 Plagger Blog みたいになってますがご容赦を 。Plagger ネタを追いかけたい方は del.icio.us の plagger タグ でほぼ網羅できているとおもうので、ここをチェック 。
で 、Plagger とプラグインシステムです。 「 なんで Plagger はプラグインをコアの中にいれて配布しているの？ 別個に配布したほうが便利なのに 」 という疑問を当然お持ちの方もいるかとおもいました。
ここはだいぶ議論になったところで（といっても
IRC チャネル #plagger - ja で小１時間しゃべっただけですが）、実際に
Trac でチケッ ト # 44 : Reorganize plugin directories in SVN も切られてます 。
ただ、現状は svn の plagger / lib / Plagger / Plugin 以下に svn commit してもらう方法をとっていて、これが最適だとおもっています。その理由を説明する前に、Perl でつくられたソフトウェアがどのようにプラグインをロードしているかの例を調べたので、ちょっと紹介しましょう。
Ingy dot Net による " DIY Wiki building kit " ともいうべ き
Wiki システム。ほとんどすべてがプラグインで構成されています。
* プラグインの作成方法 : Perl モジュー ル
* プラグインの配布方法 : CPAN / Ingy の svn レポジト リ
* プラグインのロード : Kwiki :: Installer に対応したプラグインの場合は、 kwiki - add Kwiki :: Foo を実行。それ以外の場合、各 Kwiki インストレーションの plugins ファイルにモジュール名を書き込む。設定は config .
yaml に共通
長所 : CPAN で配布が可 能
短所 : Kwiki コアの API が変わると、古いプラグインが動かなくな る
Kwiki の開発はかなり安定してきているので、CPAN を利用した配布方法も現実的です。ただ、ちょっと前までは、Ingy が Kwiki のバージョンをあげると、動かなくなるプラグイン続出、という状況でした。" Ingy , you broke my Kwiki plugin " というセリフを何度聞いたことか 。
Ask Bjorn Hansen による SMTP サーバ構築キット。これも、すべてがプラグイン。
* プラグインの作成方法 : ファイルを plugins / 以下にお く
* プラグインの配布方法 : svn で qpsmtpd のコアにインクルー ド
* プラグインのロード方法 : config / plugins にプラグインファイル名を１行１モジュールで記述。設定はスペース区切りの引数で追加
長所 : svn で管理しているため、本体との API の整合性がとりやす い
短所 : CPAN からインストールできな い
qpsmtpd は CPAN にはリリースされておらず、svn での開発がメインとなっています。debian のパッケージや ports などが用意されているので 、CPAN からインストールできないデメリットはあまり感じません。
* プラグインの作成方法 : ファイルに記述。モジュール化したりテンプレートといっしょにディレクトリにバンドルしたりすることが可能
* プラグインの配布方法 : Plugin Direcotry または各自のサイト
* プラグインのロード : plugins / ディレクトリにファイルまたはディレクトリごと配置。ロード後、MT
管理画面から enable / disable することも可 能
* プラグインの設定 : 各プラグインの管理画面から設定
長所 : ただファイルを配置するだけから、 高度なプラグイン開発、設定まで幅広く対応可能
短所 : Plugin Directory などのサイトを検索する必要。また開発者にとってはディレクトリサイトの管理などの手間
MT はそれ自体完成したソフトであり、またオープンソースのライセンスではないので、CPAN からという手段は考える必要がありませんね。
というわけで Plagger です。現状はこうです 。
プラグインの作成方法 : Perl モジュー ル
プラグインの配布方法 : svn の plagger ディストロ 内
プラグインのロード : config .yaml に module : ブロックを記述
というわけで現状は、作成とロードを Kwiki に学び、配布を qpsmtpd に学んでいます。ただ し
Perl モジュールの形式なので、あとあと CPAN にアップすることも可能になっていますし、プラグインのロードはファイル単位でおこなうこともできます（#8 参照。config .yaml で指定した plugin_path : にファイルをおけば、lib/Plagger/Plugin/Foo/Bar.pm なんてところに野良プラグインをおかなくても大丈夫です）。
リリースごとに API を変更している現状や、コミッターがどんどん増えている状況を考えれば、現状これが最適にワークしていると思えます。もしそうでなければ、ユーザは、必要になるプラグインを全部別個にインストールしなくてはならず、プラグインのデベロッパーは、Plagger コアやその他のプラグインの依存関係をケアしながら
Makefile .
PL を記述し て１個ずつ CPAN に毎回アップして、その CPAN のミラーに半日かかるのを待って ...
なんてバカげたことをしなくてはなりません。時間とリソースの無駄。
Plugin を同梱することでインストールがめんどうになっているのでは？ という疑問についてはこれは誤解です。外部プラグインが必要とするモジュールについては
0.5.4 から Makefile .PL にすべて記述していますし、オプショナルと思えるプラグインについては、デフォルトで [ n ] となってスキップします 。
UNIX システム ( Linux や Mac OSX ) でもっとも簡単な方法は 、CPAN シェルで cpan > test Plagger として依存モジュールをインストールし、あとは svn up で
Plagger の最新 を 「 インストールせずに」使うということでしょう。Win32 ではたしかにメンドウですが CPAN シェルと ppm で依存モジュールをいれてしまえば、あとは pure perl なので大変なところはないはずです 。
もっとくわしくプラグインの実装方法について知りたい！ という方は、qpsmtpd の作者である Ask の Build Easily Extensible Perl Programs ( PDF ) が参考になるかも 。

The discovery of the bodies comes amid shock over the grisly killings of 17 young women and children near Delhi .
Smell
The Punjab children - three boys and a girl all under the age of 13 - were reported missing in November .
This mill belonged to me but since a very long time it has been locked - I have offered all possible help
Politician Jagmeet Singh Brar
Their corpses were found on Tuesday night after a foul smell led police to an abandoned rice mill in Muktsar district .
The hands and legs of the victims had been tied and there were burn marks on their bodies , leading police to suspect that someone had tried to dispose of their corpses .
Police have registered a case of murder and attempting to destroy evidence .
The bodies were so badly decomposed that the children 's parents , who are all migrant workers , identified them by their clothing .
The rice mill is owned by a senior politician of Punjab 's governing Congress party , Jagmeet Singh Brar , but police say there is no evidence to link the politician with the case .
Speaking in Delhi , Mr Brar said he had asked police to investigate the deaths thoroughly .
He said he had not visited the rice mill for the past five years and was doing all he could to assist the authorities .
Grief
The Punjab discovery came just 10 days after the remains of 17 young women and children were fished out from a drain in Noida , a suburb of Delhi .
The killings in Noida have caused immense anger
A local businessman and his servant have been arrested and are being held on suspicion of multiple abduction , rape and murder .
The crime has shocked the country and caused immense grief and public anger in Noida , especially against the police .
Furious residents say officers failed to act over the abductions because many of those reported missing came from impoverished families .
The residents say that as many as 40 children have disappeared in the area over the past two years .

The evidence for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies is weak , according to an article in this week 's issue of The Lancet .
The authors conclude that the clinical effects of homoeopathy are compatible with placebo effects .
Matthias Egger ( University of Berne , Switzerland ) and colleagues compared 110 placebocontrolled , randomised trials of homoeopathy with 110 conventional - medicine trials matched for disorder and type of outcome .
The clinical topics studied in the trials ranged from respiratory infections to surgery to anaesthesiology .
The researchers looked at the treatment effects in smaller , low quality trials and larger trials of higher quality .
They found , in both groups , that smaller trials of lower quality showed more beneficial treatment effects than larger and higher - quality trials .
However , when the analysis was restricted to large trials of high quality there was no convincing evidence that homoeopathy was superior to placebo , whereas for conventional medicine an important effect remained .
Professor Egger concludes : " Our study powerfully illustrates the interplay and cumulative effect of different sources of bias .
We acknowledge that to prove a negative is impossible , but we have shown that the effects seen in placebo - controlled trials of homeopathy are compatible with the placebo - hypothesis . "
In an accompanying Comment Jan Vandenbroucke ( Leiden University Medical Centre , Netherlands ) states : " Science is an intrinsically human affair .
When new theories are created and new evidence sought , judgement will retain a subjective element .
This does not mean that it is impossible to sift out which interpretation is more valuable . . .
The ultimate proof is that science make progress in changing reality : in allopathic [ conventional ] medicine by preventing , alleviating , and curing disease ever more effectively . "
In an accompanying Editorial TheLancetcomments : " It is the attitudes of patients and providers that engender alternative - therapy seeking behaviours which create a greater threat to conventional care — and patients ' welfare — than do spurious arguments of putative benefits from absurd dilutions . . .
Now doctors need to be bold and honest with their patients about homoeopathy 's lack of benefit , and with themselves about the failings of modern medicine to address patients ' needs for personalised care . "

Installing Vista Fonts in Ubuntu September 16 , 2007 Posted by Carthik in looks and feel , microsoft , packages , ubuntu .
Posted by Carthik in guides Microsoft ’s new ClearType fonts for Vista are great .
The fonts include Constantia , Corbel , Calibri , Cambria , Candara and Consolas .
Getting them installed in Ubuntu is a breeze , thanks to a script I found .
To install the Vista ClearType fonts in Ubuntu , you need to install cabextract first .
Cabextract is a utility found in the universe repository , so before you run the following command , make sure you have universe enabled in your repository list .
Once this is done , install cabextract using :
$ sudo apt - get install cabextract
Then , once that is done , use this script to install the Vista fonts .
Create a file called “ vista - fonts - installer.sh ” in your home ( ~ ) directory .
Then open up a text editor and copy and paste the script into that file .
Do a chmod a+x ~/ vista - fonts - installer.sh to make the file / script executable .
Then run the script using :
$ ~/vista-fonts-installer.sh
The script downloads the Powerpoint Viewer installer from microsoft.com , and then extracts the Vista cleartype fonts using cabextract .
These fonts are then installed in the ~/. fonts directory .
Please remember that the ClearType Vista fonts are not free as in they are not GPL - ed or made available under a re-distributable license .
Since you are downloading the fonts from the MS website , and since you might already have a Windows XP / Vista license , this is not a crime , but consider yourself warned against the perils of supporting closed systems 🙂
Update : : Looks like the use of these fonts are restricted to only Microsoft Windows / Vista operating systems according to the terms of the license .
I am sorry , but you ’ll be installing them at your own risk .
Also , please make sure you use the bash shell , or change the first line of the code to #!/bin/bash
In retrospect , this was a bad post – I think we ’re better off not using stuff folks do n’t want us to use – let ’s use the better , freer , easier to install fonts .
End of a Love Affair with Acer September 12 , 2007 Posted by Carthik in reviews , ubuntu .
Posted by Carthik in Friends Etc. I was in love with Acer laptops .
I bought my first one , an Acer Travelmate 290 LMi in my second year of grad school .
I did pay ~ $ 1200 for it , but it was awesome , right until the moment there were errors with the hard disk controllers about 3 years later .
When I sold it for parts on ebay , it still retained more than 3 hours worth of charge in it ’s battery .
The finish and the quality of parts spoke loud and clear .
I liked the simple looks , the ruggedness , and above all , the dependability .
So when I had to find a replacement , and was short on time and money , I settled for another Acer . An Acer Aspire 5003 LMi .
Piece of junk .
The plastic looks cheap .
The “ Aluminum ” next to the keyboard is poorly spray painted plastic .
The area next to the touchpad , and the left - click button have lost all their paint due to repeated use , and then look white .
All within a year .
For the last few days , occasionally , I would open up the laptop , and the display would n’t work properly .
Loud cracks can be heard at the hinges when I open it up .
I ’d usually fix the display problem by opening the lid to an angle where the display worked .
Today it failed completely .
No matter what I did , I could n’t get the display to display anything coherent .
The quality of the parts , and the “ casing ” , is terrible .
I admit , this was a cheap laptop , but it had what I needed at a minimum .
I am not someone who buys the cheapest thing around .
I buy computers with exactly the minimum I need .
This one has a Broadcom wireless card , but I thought I could live with that for a bit .
I do n’t need a separate video card – I never play games .
I do need a large screen , and a DVD - burner – well , you get the point .
I would have gladly paid $ 250 more to Acer for the same laptop with better quality .
Personally , I have vouched for Acer laptops , and have directly influenced my friends into buying at least 3 - 4 Acers .
Now I feel like an idiot .
I have to try something new .
I do n’t like how ThinkPads are designed with the recessed screen and clunky looks and all .
The Sony Vaios I have known through friends and others have all been terrible – each of them making the trip back to Sony at least once .
That leave the glitzy HPs and the Dells .
I ’d rather have a MacBook or the Pro , which looks infinitely cooler .
Wish I had the money for a new MacBookPro .
It has way more features and power than I need , though .
Anyways , I feel much better having written this – may those that I recommended Acers to find it in them to forgive me !
Ubuntu ’s Audience Defined August 21 , 2007 Posted by Carthik in
Posted by Carthik in ubuntu I read the impressive growth and traffic details for WordPress.com at Matt ’s Blog .
WordPress has always been very dear to me , and it makes me happy to note that the WordPress team grows from strength to strength , without compromising on values , and while keeping things open , almost entirely so .
However , the stat freak in me got another tool , and the results are surprising !
I did not have any clue that the number of 45 - 65 year olds that visit my site are above the average numbers for the internet by around 25 - 45 % .
Also , most of my visitors are as poor as I am , with an income of less than $ 30 K a year .
That is surprising when you realize that college graduates outnumber any other kind of visitor , based on education .
Finally , the male - female disparity is not too high – I get 25 % less female visitors , and 25 % more male visitors than the average site .
Here ’s my quantcast report .
Now , like me , you must be thinking , what about ubuntu.com ?
Maybe Canonical should sign up for the quantcast setup like WordPress.com and then we could start fixing the problem where , right now , my blog seems to get more visitors than ubuntu.com .
Clearly , quantcast is orders - of - magnitude off with the numbers .
Let ’s hope the percentages are right when it comes to the demographics .
If they are , then then , again , Ubuntu seems to attract a middle - aged , may I say “ mature ” crowd .
Ubuntu.com attracts more Asian , Hispanics and “ Others ” than the average website out there .
Also , “ linux drivers ” seems to be leading the charge of visitors to Ubuntu.com .
It would be good to put something related to drivers – perhaps an article with links peppered throughout to the various compatibility resources and hardware profiling tools somewhere on the front page of help.ubuntu.com which seems to be quite a popular destination .
Of course , if I had a say in how Ubuntu ’s websites worked , I would first ensure that the help pages show up where they belong on Google searches .
Somehow , I ca n’t seem to end up at the Ubuntu help wiki after a web search .
I suspect the wiki software ’s intricacies , and the “ https : // ” ( now why does a help wiki have to be served over https ? ) , are partly responsible for that issue .
You get the idea that shipit must be doing something right , since it seems to be quite a popular destination .
Also , OpenSuse , FreeSpire and Damn Small Linux seem to the other Linux distributions that are popular among those that visit the Ubuntu website .
Scanning the quantcast results might help lots of folks involved with planning , developing and marketing Ubuntu – whether it is deciding what / who to focus on , or finding out how meta - plans are working out .
WASHINGTON -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said yesterday that he will caucus with Senate Democrats in the new Congress , but he would not rule out switching to the Republican caucus if he starts to feel uncomfortable among Democrats .
Lieberman , a Democrat who won reelection as an independent , also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat .
A strong backer of the Iraq war , Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support .
He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont .
He said yesterday on NBC's " Meet the Press " that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership .
The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
" I 'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it 's good for my constituents in Connecticut , because I retained my seniority , I become a committee chair , but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security , foreign policy , and innovation and progress in domestic policy , " Lieberman said .
He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent , " I am now an Independent Democrat -- capital I , capital D. Matter of fact , the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked , ' How do you want to be identified , ' and that 's it .
Independent Democrat , " the senator said .
With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont , as the party 's nominee , Lieberman acknowledged that it might be " a little awkward " for him back in Washington .
" They played by the traditional partisan political playbook .
And I can't say I enjoyed it , but we 're all grown - ups , we 've got a job to do , and I 'm going to do my best to get that job done , " Lieberman said .
Democrats will hold a 51 - 49 edge in the Senate , so Lieberman , the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 , could find himself courted by Republicans .
He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline , particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority .
" I 'm not ruling it out , but I hope I do n't get to that point .
And , and I must say , and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut , nobody ever said , ' We 're doing this because we , we want you to switch over , ' " he said .
" I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation , because they 're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games , and not enough by problem - solving and patriotism , which means put the country and your state first , " Lieberman said .
In 2001 , Senator James Jeffords of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats , putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate .
The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans .
Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s .
Before that , the last senator to use the designation was in the mid-19th century , he said .
" I am going to Washington beholden to no political group except the people of Connecticut and , of course , my conscience , " he said .

German investigators have recommended that prosecutors issue arrest warrants for 13 U.S. intelligence operatives in connection with the kidnapping , beating and secret detention of a German citizen suspected of having links to terrorist networks .
The operatives are said to have been part of a CIA - sponsored team that transported alleged terrorists to interrogation camps around the world .
Investigators say the group forced a handcuffed and blindfolded Khaled Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent , onto a Boeing 737 in Macedonia and flew him to Afghanistan in January 2004 .
Masri was never charged with a crime , and was released after five months .
German law enforcement officials said indictments could be filed as early as this week against the suspects , including four pilots , a medic and members of an operations unit .
The most serious charge is expected to be kidnapping , according to an official who asked not to be named .
None of the suspects , who include CIA contract employees , have been named publicly .
The Masri case has strained U.S. - German relations and led to a parliamentary investigation of allegations that German intelligence agents were involved in the abduction .
Investigators also have examined discrepancies about when high - ranking government officials were informed of Masri ’s fate .

The prospect of criminal charges in the Masri ordeal comes as an Italian court is deliberating whether to order the trial of 26 Americans and nine Italians implicated in the February 2003 abduction of a radical Egyptian cleric known as Abu Omar .
The Italian government may demand the extradition of the accused Americans , including the former CIA station chief in Milan , where Omar was snatched from a sidewalk .
The CIA has not commented on the Masri case , although White House , Justice Department and agency officials have argued that U.S. laws authorized such covert operations , and that they have been assured that no suspects have been tortured .
Legal experts say it is extremely unlikely the U.S. government would turn over suspects for legal proceedings in either Germany or Italy .
Both cases have outraged lawmakers across the Continent and underscored the legal and human rights questions dividing the U.S. and Europe on countering terrorism .
But they also have indicated that some European governments may have been complicit in the CIA program , known as “ extraordinary renditions , ” to capture and transport suspected militants to secret prisons for interrogations that sometimes included torture .

Legal documents , credit card receipts and hotel records show that those allegedly involved in the Masri abduction stayed at a luxury resort on the Spanish island of Majorca before flying to Skopje , Macedonia , on Jan. 23 , 2004 .
When checking into the hotel , some of the operatives gave aliases , such as Kirk James Bird and James Fairing .
The covert team ’s charges in Majorca included a food bill of $ 1,625 and an $ 81 charge for a massage .
Masri ’s odyssey began weeks earlier , when he was pulled off a bus on New Year ’s Eve 2003 while crossing the Serbian border into Macedonia .
The car salesman and father of four told the Los Angeles Times in 2005 that he had left Germany for a holiday .
He said Macedonian security officials seized him and drove him from the border to a hotel in Skopje , the capital , where he was interrogated for days and accused of being an extremist .
Masri said he was threatened at gunpoint and was denied repeated requests to contact German authorities .
One night , he said , he was blindfolded and taken to an airport .
“ I was led into a room .
The door closed behind me and I was beaten from all sides for about one minute , ” he said .
“ They bent my arms to my back and cut off my clothes ....
I saw seven to eight men all dressed in black and wearing masks .
I tried to keep my underpants on but they ripped them off .
They put me in diapers and a dark blue sweatsuit with the legs and sleeves cut out . ”

Aviation records viewed by The Times show that a jet registered to a company with links to the CIA landed at Skopje airport at 8:51 p.m. on Jan. 23 , 2004 .
The plane left Skopje hours later , at 2:30 a.m. , flying to Baghdad , then to Afghanistan .
Masri said he was drugged for the flight and remembers waking up in “ a small , dirty cell . ”
He said he was interrogated in cycles by Americans and a man he referred to as Sam , who spoke fluent German .
Much of the questioning , Masri said , dealt with his attendance at a mosque frequented by radicals in his hometown of Ulm , Germany .
Masri said he went on a hunger strike for 37 days until he was force - fed .
He was released in the mountains of Albania five months after he disappeared .
Around the time Masri was freed , the American ambassador to Germany , Daniel R. Coats , informed the German Interior Ministry that the U.S. had detained a German citizen and was preparing to release him .
The Germans , however , say they were n’t told about Masri until after he was released .
The question of when the German officials knew , and why they kept quiet about the incident , is part of the parliamentary investigation .

One theory to explain the kidnapping , according to officials who asked not to be identified , may be that the captors mistook Masri for a man by the same name who is suspected of terrorist links to Al Qaeda .
There also have been suggestions that U.S. intelligence wanted to learn more about the mosque in Ulm , where several known militants who fought in the separatist Russian republic of Chechnya were known to worship .
German prosecutors said they were convinced early on that Masri ’s tale of abduction and imprisonment was true .
They have repeatedly blamed the U.S. for not cooperating with the investigation .
In December 2005 , Masri filed suit against the CIA in a U.S. district court .
A judge dismissed the lawsuit last year , saying that a trial would “ present a grave risk of injury to national security . ”
The decision is being appealed .

Fleishman is The Times ’ Berlin Bureau chief and Goetz a special correspondent .
Arstechnica published an article earlier this week titled “ Why DRM ’s best friend might just be Apple Inc. “ .
Every time someone points out that Apple is a supporter of DRM , the Mac faithful come out of the woodworks to promote the delusion that Apple does not really support DRM and that they ’re simply forced to use DRM by the record labels and studios .
This of course flies in the face of reality :
Apple is refusing to open up FairPlay to other companies .
Apple is applying FairPlay to files from record labels that do not require DRM .
From a NYTimes story today titled “ Want an iPhone ?
Beware the iHandcuffs “ :
Among the artists who can be found at eMusic are Barenaked Ladies , Sarah McLachlan and Avril Lavigne , who are represented by Nettwerk Music Group , based in Vancouver , British Columbia .
All Nettwerk releases are available at eMusic without copy protection .
But when the same tracks are sold by the iTunes Music Store , Apple insists on attaching FairPlay copy protection that limits their use to only one portable player , the iPod .
Terry McBride , Nettwerk ’s chief executive , said that the artists initially required Apple to use copy protection , but that this was no longer the case .
At this point , he said , copy protection serves only Apple ’s interests .
Josh Bernoff , a principal analyst at Forrester Research , agreed , saying copy protection “ just locks people into Apple . ”
He said he had recently asked Apple when the company would remove copy protection and was told , “ We see no need to do so . ”
Apple ’s statement is a detailed treatise on the subject , compared with what I received when I asked the company last week whether it would offer tracks without copy protection if the publisher did not insist on it : the Apple spokesman took my query and never got back to me .
From a 2004 blog post by Fred von Lohmann at the EFF titled “ FairPlay : Another Anticompetitive Use of DRM “ :
On a panel a few weeks ago , I asked the head lawyer for Apple ’s iTunes Music Store whether Apple would , if it could , drop the FairPlay DRM from tracks purchased at the Music Store .
He said “ no . ” I was puzzled , because I assumed that the DRM obligation was imposed by the major labels on a grudging Apple .
When will the Mac faithful stop deluding themselves ?
Why Not College ?
Wiz School Tour
Are They Really Better ?
Will My Kid Be Normal ?
What 's Next for Wizards Worldwide ?
It 's hard to believe it 's only been eleven years since they opened the first Wizard School .
I hear they just opened new campuses in Singapore and Istanbul .
That 's , what , sixteen or seventeen locations now ?
And enrollment is already backlogged five to ten years at the new campuses .
The money involved just defies the imagination .
Mine , anyway .
In retrospect it seems pretty obvious .
Who'd have guessed they 'd make so much money , though ?
We were all there , all programming in the same industry , but somehow the two founders saw an opportunity there that the rest of us missed .
I think it 's worse than that , actually .
I mean , I thought it was a joke when I first heard about it .
Did n't you ?
But I 'm such a late adopter .
I did n't know about Napster , not really , not until they were being shut down .
I did n't buy a DVD player or a CD player or an iPod until they 'd been out at least six or seven years each .
Stuff like this always feels like it happened overnight , but I guess they 've been building to it for a quite a while .
I mean I 'd heard about the Wizard Academies , sure .
But it was this subculture , this thing interns and high school kids were buzzing about , should they go to college or wiz school , blah blah blah .
I was n't really paying attention .
Then suddenly it was this mega- phenomenon , growing faster any educational institution in history .
It 's not just that we did n't think of it .
Face it : we would have scoffed if someone had suggested the idea .
C'mon ... " Wizards " ?
It sounded like someone was just jealous of J.K. Rowling .
Especially the more you hear about the campuses .
Some people have been mailing me lately , random people asking me if their kids should go .
It 's expensive .
Way expensive .
Tough choice to make , even now , with Wizard Academy grads making anywhere from a quarter million to a million a year , while the rest of us plod away in 5 - figure territory .
I 'm not exactly going to make that decision for them , but I threw together some notes — most of it old hat for anyone who has n't been living under a rock — to help them make their decision .
I 'm dumping my notes here until I think of a better place to put them .
For now , I can just forward this stuff to anyone else who asks .
None of it should be new to you .
It 's still an honorable thing to get a Ph.D.
I think that 'll hold true for another twenty years , at least , because people like to hold on to their traditions .
And even an undergrad degree in CS can still get you a job .
If you can't afford the Wizard Academy , or you can't pass the entrance tests , or you just got on the waiting list too late , then a CS degree from a good university is still probably the best way to prep for a job in the tech industry .
It 's not as if the Wiz Schools have killed CS at universities .
Not yet , anyway .
Besides , CS degrees are changing now .
A lot of the more progressive universities have been overhauling their CS curricula as fast as they can , in response to the Wiz Schools .
I mean , my God .
The Wizards are coming in with significantly higher computer science scores than the CS grads , and theory is n't really what the Wizards are known for .
Heck , the wiz schools themselves are the newest fad in research departments ( sociology and education departments , mostly ) across the country — all over the world , even .
Everyone has different hypotheses as to why Wizards are so damn good .
Nobody seems to know for sure .
But they are good , that much at least is indisputable .
And they 're in unbelievable demand now .
You hire a Ph.D. , it 's hit - or - miss .
Some of them are brilliant .
But then some subset of virtually every educated group is brilliant .
The problem is that the notion of a Ph.D. has gradually been watered down for the last century .
It used to mean something to be a Doctor of Philosophy : it meant you had materially advanced your discipline for everyone .
Von Neumann , Nash , Turing — people like that , with world - changing dissertations , they just do n't happen that often anymore , at least not in CS .
Well , they probably occur at the same frequency , but it 's one in a thousand at best .
Instead , what usually happens is a bright young Ph.D. - to - be chooses a school based on expedience : finances , or location , or parental pressure .
There might be a dozen or so advisors to choose from , and the department as a whole has only one or two really big , prestigious areas of focus , areas for which the school is known ( and hence funded ) .
So if a kid goes to a school that does a lot of X , chances are pretty damn good the kid 's going to do her Ph.D. thesis in X .
But it 's probably specialized to death , and the kid will wind up working for years on some tiny slice of almost - nothing : little prototype mobile doodads that track forest monkeys or something .
And the kid will lose faith , stop hoping their thesis will ever mean anything , and they 'll go through the motions until their advisor pities them and lets them defend .
I 'm not saying it 's a rubber stamp .
These kids have to work hard for their Ph.D. , and a lot of them never quite finish .
But too often they finish without having written more than a few hundred lines of code in the past five years .
Or they 've over - specialized to the point where they now think Big - O is a tire company ; they have no idea how computers or computation actually work anymore .
They can tell you just about everything there is to know about SVM kernels and neural - net back propagation , or about photorealistic radiosity algorithms that make your apartment look fake by comparison .
But if you want a website thrown together , or a scalable service written , or for that matter a graphics or machine - learning system , you 're usually better off hiring a high - school kid , because the kid might actually know how to program .
Some Ph.D.s can , but how many of them is it , really ?
From an industry perspective , an alarming number of them are no - ops .
The bigger , better - known companies — Yahoo ! , Google , Amazon.com , Microsoft — those guys can spot a dud a mile off , over the phone even .
Credentials do n't matter , not strictly even for Wiz Academy grads with eight OWLs and five NEWTs or whatever the hell they 're called .
( I still can't believe how closely they copied Rowling 's design . )
What matters is what you know , and what you can do , and a Ph.D. laureate in CS these days , even from a " top " university , has about an 80 % chance of failing interviews at one of these companies .
It 's still honorable to get a Ph.D.
But it 's no guarantee of a job .
Not a high - paying one , anyway , not at a company with a bright future .
It is a lot cheaper than Wiz School , though , and it 's easier to get in .
So I 'd consider it a pretty good fallback option .
Well , you know all about the campuses ; you can't watch the news for two hours nowadays without getting some sort of virtual tour , or hearing about some company 's stock soaring after they won the first - round draft picks from the Nassau campus , or Kauai , or Chardonnay .
They 're half Google and half Hogwarts , seven - year boarding schools complete with Great Houses , robes , the whole works .
Wizard Schools .
Just like you 'd expect , I guess .
They 're always located out in remote , beautiful areas .
No expenses spared .
Full - time staff , like you 'd find in a hotel or a cruise ship .
Rich kids and scholarship kids alike , but only the brightest .
Reminds me of Ender Wiggin's Battle School .
Not just anyone gets to go .
You 've got to be a prodigy , a kid genius , and not just at math or science .
They look for kids with spark , with personality , and their interviews are famous for being both gruelling and quirky .
Interviews can last for up to 2 weeks .
There 's no guesswork involved ; they keep you there until they know everything about you , or at least enough to know if you 're Wizard material .
Just getting invited to the interviews is a big deal , something to brag about ; being selected probably qualifies you for any early - entrance program at any school in most countries .
Only 20 % make it to the third day , and only one in fifty interviewees gets an offer to attend the school .
I hear they 're giving more and more scholarships now .
At first it was all rich foreign kids : kids whose parents could n't get visas , due to the stupid U.S. immigration regulations at the time , which were later relaxed after the big Brain Drain hit .
That 's another story , of course , and one you already know about .
But it explains why there were so many kids from countries like Indonesia and Thailand and Hong Kong in the first graduating classes : insanely brilliant kids from rich families who wanted the best education money could buy , and who were willing to take risks and be early adopters for what even today sounds like the craziest stunt ( or scam ) ever pulled .
It was n't crazy , though , and it was no scam .
Those first kids that graduated , seven years later , all of 18 years old , they 're the youngest crop of CTOs and senior architects and company founders our industry had ever seen , and maybe that any industry had seen since , I do n't know , the Gold Rush .
Wiz Kids .
A well - deserved pun .
Oh , man .
You have no idea .
A fifth - round draft pick ( companies bid for draft picks , of course ; you can't just hire any Wizard Academy grad you want , and the process is now independently regulated to ensure fairness ) comes " stock " with a skills lineup that would make any hiring manager drool uncontrollably .
Probably with fear , since a kid like that will obsolete anyone with the title " hiring manager " .
They type 140 to 160 words a minute , almost soundlessly , and always bring their own keyboards .
They disdain mice , although recently I hear they 've been using pointers attached to their foreheads .
No idea how they control them so easily — makes my neck hurt just to think about it .
Lots of practice .
Hours of drills .
Start 'em young , and they all say it 's a snap , just like you 'd tell your grandmother that using a mouse is a snap , when it 's pretty obvious it really is n't .
They know their discrete mathematics and CS theory cold , of course , although I hear it's at the expense of more traditional disciplines like trigonometry and physics , unless they choose those subjects as electives .
They 're in class for 8 to 10 hours a day , and their homework load is at least equivalent to a full - time college degree , but they 're starting it all at 11 or 12 years old .
But all that aside , they 're probably most famous for their coding .
Just plain , basic coding .
I mean , we all think of ourselves as good coders , but the Wizards do it as easily as we breathe air .
While a " normal " programmer is puzzling over design patterns , or trying to simplify complex code paths , a Wizard is blasting out code at the rate of hundreds of thousands of lines a year .
And it 's all amazingly high quality .
Numerous studies have shown their code , on average , to have 80 % fewer bugs and at least 100 % ( 2 x ) better performance than the industry average .
It 's safe to say the Wizards graduating at the bottom of their class are still safely in the top 1 % of industry grads .
Of course , blasting out hundreds of thousands of lines a year is missing the point .
If a Wizard is given complete technical control over a project ( which is usually the smartest thing to do , but companies are rarely very smart ) , the Wizard will typically write in one of the super - succinct " folding languages " they 've developed on campus , usually a Lisp or Haskell derivative .
They call them Folding Languages because they write code that writes code that writes code ...
Wizards swear by it , and there 's no question that they can produce amazingly compact , fast , clean - looking code .
But 90 % of the devs out there claim they can't read it , and whine a lot about it to their bosses .
Given that most companies can only afford a few Staff Wizards , the Wizards are usually forced to capitulate and use Java or C ++.
They 're equally comfortable in any language you throw at them , though , and if you force them to use a verbose language , well , you get what you ask for .
It still amazes me that companies are bragging about how many lines of code their Wizards have produced .
Potential startups take note : your competitors are usually idiots .
Good question .
It 's not exactly " normal " to be a millionaire by age 22 .
But if you 're worried that your kid is going off to join some strange Scientology - like cult , just go visit the campus .
Online , of course .
You can't actually get onto one of the campuses unless you 're press , family , police , a guest speaker , or a Personage of Note like , say , the President of some country .
They do n't want you bothering the students .
But you can take online tours , and they 're all quite amazing , using technology largely developed at the campuses themselves .
And it 's pretty much what you 'd expect : a carefully monitored boarding school .
The robes and Wizard stuff is mostly there to make it fun , and to imbue it all with a sense of seriousness that always comes of wearing uniforms .
The professors are uniformly entertaining and brilliant .
They 're always seasoned industry pros , usually famous names .
Everyone knows Larry Wall as the Head Wizard of the Aspen campus , the first campus they opened on U.S. soil .
Most young folks do n't realize Larry was the inventor of a language called " Perl " that was really popular in the 1990s and 2000s , up through 2010 or so .
He was independently famous in his own right before taking the job , but these days he 's famous entirely because of the Headmaster gig .
He 's won the Dumbledore Award for three consecutive years , so he 's obviously popular with Wiz Academy students worldwide .
And I hear Jamie Zawinski just left his S.F. club to take the second - in - command and Tools Master position in the Christchurch campus .
Wanna be a prof at Wizard School ?
Gotta be famous , funny , proven , brilliant , and seriously committed to the students ' success .
The kids do more physical education and activity than at most other schools .
No , it 's not Quidditch — that would be a neat trick — but they have soccer and golf and archery and horseback riding , and they 're graded on physical fitness and physical dexterity .
They also have to learn a musical instrument and a significant amount of music theory , as the schools claim it makes them better programmers and designers .
They all do tons of electives in the arts and sciences .
And they all come out fluent in at least 3 languages ( one of which must be English ) chosen from a list of nearly 100 possibilities .
The students are pretty well - rounded by just about any objective standard .
In addition to their math , computer science , and unrivaled coding skills , Wiz Academy grads all seem to know how to draw .
At least I 've never known one who could n't .
They 're not all great artists , of course , but they all receive a substantial amount of training as artists , and seven years of practice at anything , even part - time , can really add up .
This puts them at a natural advantage when they 're creating UIs and documentation , since they rarely need to wait around for a UI designer .
Or at least they can whip up a sketch that a full - time designer or artist can use as starting material .
The rest of us programmers have to pantomime what we want until the artist finally draws something that looks like what we ( vaguely ) had in mind .
I 'd never have guessed basic drawing skills would be so useful , but now that I see Wizards using them all the time , I 've had to change my mind about it .
I think we all have .
All the Wizards I 've ever met personally have seemed nice enough .
I 'm sure you can find a few who are arrogant jerks , but you can find people like that anywhere and everywhere if you look hard enough .
Most Wizards
I 've known have been ordinary , nice people .
Sort of like Olympians , or Cirque du Soleil performers , or any other elite group of people who 've trained since childhood to do what they 're doing as adults .
They 're just people , and a lot of their personality is probably a function of how well you raise them before sending them off to boarding school .
So yeah , I 'd say they 're pretty normal .
I sure wish I 'd gone to Wizard School .
Wizard Schools are the darlings of the press .
Who knows how long it 'll last .
The idea that started as a half - joking blog entry in 2006 has rapidly turned into the biggest phenomenon of the past decade , with no end in site .
It 's possible that Wizard Schools could eventually obsolete " regular " schools , with lower - end competitors ( Fairy School ?
Somehow I doubt it ... ) stepping in to siphon off unmet demand .
It 's equally possible that traditional schools will continue to borrow ideas from the Wizard Schools , in much the way that big companies circa 2006 started copying Google 's philosophy of massages , free food , and other amazing perks in order to attract and retain top talent .
That stuff was innovative back then , but it 's fairly commonplace nowadays .
Once Google had proved it worked better than frugality , everyone else had to follow suit : economics demanded it .
Everyone who did n't got the second - best ( or more commonly , the nth - best ) employees .
One thing is clear : regardless of whether you think the Rowling - style environment is strictly necessary for producing Wizard - quality grads , the enrollment backlogs have shown that there 's a huge , worldwide craving for improvement .
People were only going to college because there was nothing better out there .
But universities are n't really there to produce superstar programmers ; their primary job is research , not education , and at least until recently they hardly focused on the students at all .
Some profs even considered it beneath them to teach undergrads ; it 's no wonder so many CS students were graduating without knowing the fundamentals of their discipline : compilers , operating systems , algorithms , computation theory , and other key areas .
Let alone Unix , the Web , and the tools of the trade .
Now that the Wizard Schools have proved the market exists , it 's hard to imagine that competitors wo n't appear .
Right now it 's hard to get first - rate professors , since of course they all want to go off and teach at the existing Wizard Academies .
But with a suitable thematic marketing twist , or a sizeable investment from a charitable billionaire , just about anyone could become the next hot education destination .
I 'll tell you this much : I 'm sending my kids , if they can make it in .
In fact , maybe I should start a Wiz Academy Prep School ...
I 'd better not tell anyone about this ; it sounds like an idea worth going after .
Yeah ...
I 'd better look into it .
There are an awful lot of people in this world who care about improving their skills and knowledge , and they want to do it as fast as humanly possible .
I wish I 'd thought of it back in 2006 .
I guess we all do .
Can a Bayesian spam filter play chess ? by Laird A. Breyer Introduction
Many people these days depend on Bayesian filters to protect them from the ever present email scourge that is spam .
Unlike older technologies , these programs ' claim to fame is that they learn the spam patterns automatically , and more importantly , learn personalized spam ( bad ) and ham ( good ) email patterns .
Like many others , I wrote a Bayesian filter to protect me from unwanted email , which I called dbacl .
My implementation functions as a Unix command line text classifier , with special email support , and can be used with procmail .
People are often astonished at how well statistical mail filtering works after they first try it , and it 's tempting to imagine that such programs actually understand the emails being delivered , rather than merely matching patterns .
Now chess has always been a popular gauge of intelligence that everyone can understand , so if we put all these ideas together , then the question " Can a Bayesian spam filter play chess ? " seems like a fun experiment with a lot of appeal .
Let 's put down some ground rules :
This experiment will test a real spam filter , not a specially designed chess program .
It wo n't aim to beat Deep Thought ( I would n't know where to start , and I have a feeling this could be difficult anyway ;-) , but it will aim to show signs of " intelligence " , or we wo n't claim success .
Finally , since dry tables and graphs are no fun , a theoretical proof of concept is not enough : the spam filter must really play chess in a way that everyone can see , and try out at home .
The account below is designed so that you can follow and duplicate it by yourself .
All you need is a Unix compatible computer .
You 'll have to open a terminal and be ready to type shell commands .
All shell commands below are preceded by % to indicate the prompt , but you do n't type the ' % ' .
Instructions are fairly detailed , and various scripts can be downloaded when needed , but it helps if you 're familiar with the shell .
Ask a friend if you need help .
Important :
You must follow these instructions if you want to actually play chess against the spam filter .
You must also download some training games and teach the filter beforehand .
Running the scripts alone is not enough .
The instructions have been tested and work correctly on a GNU system with the bash shell .
Start by making a directory to keep all the workings in one place .

David Letterman did n't try to hide the fact last night that he just plain does n't like Bill O'Reilly .
He wasted no time bashing FOX News and doing what few people can do -- ridiculing O'Reillys ratings ( Letterman 's audience is more than 2x as large . )
While sparring over Iraq , Letterman interrupted the giant talking head saying he " does n't care " what Bill has to say .
When Bill O , in typical FAUX form , tried to suggest that Dave believes " Bush is an evil liar " and that " America is a bad country " Letterman comes back with the line of the month :
" You 're trying to put words in my mouth just the way you put artificial facts in your head . "
Download WMP Download -QT
Letterman :
Let me ask you a question -- was there more heinous , more dangerous violence taking place before in Iraq , or is there more heinous , dangerous violence taking place now in Iraq ?
O'Reilly : Oh , stop it .
Saddam Hussein slaughtered 300,000 to 400,000 people , all right , so knock it off ...
It is n't so black and white , Dave -- it is n't , ' We 're a bad country .
Bush is an evil liar . '
That 's not true .
Letterman : I did n't say he was an evil liar .
You 're putting words in my mouth , just the way you put artificial facts in your head !
Dave concedes at the end that he has " no idea what he 's talking about " , but added that neither does Bill .
It seems Dave was on to something .
A fact check of Bill 's assertion that Ansar al - Islam worked with the approval of Saddam Hussein 's government is wholly unsupported by the Senate Intelligence Committee report ( .pdb ) released a few moths ago that is the most definitive work to date on the glaring differences between pre-war rhetoric and post - war reality .
( For a breakdown of O'Reilly 's disingenuous claim ( i.e. lie ) , read the rest of this story ... )
The Senate Intelligence Committee writes on pages 71 - 72 that Saddam had virtually no control over the northern Kurdistan region of Iraq , that there were flaws that " undermined confidence in the reporting " of such a relationship and that Ansar al - Islam that was not " a branch of al Qaeda . "
Furthermore , Saddam 's regime had no contact with the group other than to possibly infiltrate it to gather intelligence .
The report concludes on page 110 : " Postwar information reveals that Baghdad viewed Ansar al - Islam as a threat to the regime and that the IIS attempted to collect intelligence on the group . "
In other words , not only does Bill grasp at straws to justify the unjustifiable -- namely , a working relationship between Saddam Hussein and terrorist groups that legitimized invasion -- he mischaracterizes a relationship that is highly dubious at best and completely non-existent at worst to do so .
It 's amazing that Bush - supporters still try to use these unsubstantiated claims in order to somehow validate the all - out , guns - a - blazing , disastrous war we have waged .
The report also shows that not only did Saddam not have a relationship with al Qaeda , he distrusted them so greatly that he even tried to capture Zarqawi -- shattering the Bush administrations most potent conspiracy theory .
For anyone who has n't read the the reports conclusions , they 're absolutely shocking in that it conclusively show that all pre-war claims were bogus including Niger yellow - cake , aluminum tubes and Atta - in - Prague the were the " strongest " pieces of evidence indicating a WMD program and Saddam - al - Qaeda link .

Update [ 2007-2-20 17:33:30 by Rimjob ] :
From BBC
News :
Mr Blair is expected to say hundreds of troops will return from Basra within weeks with more to follow later .
Some 7,000 UK troops are currently serving in Iraq and about 1,500 are expected to return within weeks .
BBC political correspondent James Landale said : " We have been expecting an announcement for some time on this . "
He said by Christmas a total of 3,000 troops were expected to have returned to the UK from Iraq .
Update [ 2007-2-20 18:15:53 by Rimjob ] :
From USA Today , the Bush Administration 's reaction .....
President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke by telephone earlier today about the withdrawal , National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe confirmed this afternoon .
" While the United Kingdom is maintaining a robust force in southern Iraq , we 're pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis .
The United States shares the same goal of turning responsibility over to the Iraqi Security Forces and reducing the number of American troops in Iraq , " Johndroe said .
" President Bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the Iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in Baghdad , " he added .
And according to the AP , that 's how Blair is spinning it too .....
Blair said British forces had completed an operation to hand front - line security responsibility to Iraqis in Basra , where he said the security situation is different from what U.S. troops face in Baghdad .
The transfer of front - line security is a significant step toward handing Iraqi authorities total control of Basra province .
" The operation that we have been conducting in Basra is now complete and that operation has specifically been to put the Iraqi forces in the main front - line control of security in the city , " Blair said .
If Tony Blair believes in " the mission " in Iraq so much & it's such a " success " , why does n't he send some of Her Majesty 's soldiers to Baghdad ?
The Puritan Work Ethic by Brian Dean , Anxiety Culture editor ( Originally printed in In Business magazine , Dec 1996 ; and re-printed in the book Point Taken : A Brief Thematic Reader [ ed Elizabeth Penfield ] , Sept 2003 ) print - friendly version >
Phil Laut , the author of Money Is My Friend , has defined hard work as doing what you dont want to do , and suggests that to operate with integrity , you should forget work and do what you want .
This revolutionary viewpoint directly opposes certain beliefs which have become codified into our work ethic courtesy of the Puritans .
Puritan sects were greatly over - represented among the early major industrialists ( quoted in Ashtons History of the Industrial Revolution ) , and their belief that suffering is required to redeem our original sin as human beings became part of their work ethic .
This is a notion which continues to underlie our attitude towards work even today .
This is why , in our society , work is closely related to , and often motivated by , guilt .
To sweeten their view of work and provide positive motivation , the Puritans believed that honest toil , if persevered with , led to mundane and spiritual rewards .
The modern equivalents of these archaic religious beliefs are : i ) Hard work is the main factor in producing material wealth .
ii )
Hard work is character building and morally good .
The available statistics dont support the belief that hard work leads to wealth  for example , US government figures from the eighties showed the average savings of a person reaching retirement age in North America to be less than $ 500 .
This is the typical level of financial reward a person can expect for forty years of full - time hard work  based on government data for an entire generation of working Americans .
Whatever its correlation with material wealth , hard work is undoubtedly seen as virtuous  the greatest tribute paid to the deceased seems to be worked hard all his / her life , although this epitaph sounds more appropriate for an item of machinery than a human being .
There is , in fact , a lot of evidence to suggest that our work ethic is extreme and pathological in its effects .
For example , a major UK survey ( quoted recently by The Guardian ) showed that 6 out of 10 British workers dislike their jobs , suffer insecurity and stress , fret over inadequate income , feel that their work is nt of use to society , and find themselves exhausted by the time they get home .
A 1995 National Opinion Poll ( NOP ) revealed that 50 % of British workers say work makes them depressed , and 43 % have problems sleeping because of work .
So unless you regard stress - related illness as character building , these findings dont really support the idea of work being morally uplifting .
The hard work ethic has also conditioned us to see happiness as something that must be earned through toil .
In effect , this is saying you have to suffer in order to get happiness , or to put it another way , you must be unhappy to be happy .
The underlying idea behind this insanity is that you are infinitely undeserving  that reward , ie happiness , will always be contingent upon the endurance of some unpleasant activity .
The problem with this way of thinking is that it endlessly perpetuates itself  you can never totally relax because nobody ever comes along to say , once and for all , that youve worked enough ( the religious beliefs which originally gave rise to this mindset dont permit you to relax until after youve died ) .
A popular cliché says nothing worthwhile is easy .
Another version of the same idea has been used as a political slogan : if it is nt hurting , it is nt working .
Beliefs like these dont only describe viewpoints , they also program our expectations .
You are effectively programming yourself to experience hurt and hardship if you accept this idea of no pain , no gain .
How can you despise ease and laziness then not feel guilty when you take a rest ?
Try an alternative slogan : anything worthwhile is best done without effort , or if you cant enjoy it , dont do it .
According to classical economic theory , wealth is created from land , labour and capital .
Increasingly though , information is becoming the primary source of wealth .
If you drill for oil , you need precise information about where to drill .
As knowledge - intensive markets grow in proportion to labour - intensive industry , information is overtaking labour ( ie hard work ) as an important wealth - creating factor .
Employees in busy offices rush so much to get things done , that they never stop to consider if there is any point to it .
Quality thinking and innovation dont usually result from hard work and stress .
The human brain processes complex information better when the person is relaxed and happy ( adrenaline addiction notwithstanding ) .
One futurist dream is that technology will eventually free people from the necessity of hard work .
This doesnt mean that all - day leisure and enjoyment would be imposed  those who like being miserable could construct their own simulations of busy offices or noxious factories to work in .
But for everybody else , drudgery and toil would be pointless and obsolete .
The fact that we are nowhere near manifesting such a dream has more to do with our attitudes and beliefs than with the current state of technology .
Currently there are alternatives to the 9 - 5 work culture ( job - sharing , teleworking etc ) which are forward - looking and advantageous to everybody ( the Institute of Manpower Studies has found that employees who work non - standard  hours tend to be more efficient , enthusiastic and committed ) , but which are still very rare .
The Information Age is here , but in terms of work patterns we cling to the attitudes of an mechanical - industrial culture steeped in the Puritan ethic .
A strange effect of the dark ages view of work as atonement , is the idea that we should enjoy it , or at least try to look as if were enjoying it .
By happily accepting our punishment ( ie daily hard work ) we demonstrate our moral fibre .
This also explains why ( according to the US figures quoted above ) the average person is prepared to work forty hours per week for no great financial reward  most people believe they dont deserve to be paid for enjoying themselves ( even when the enjoyment  is for appearances only ) .
In order to more deeply understand current attitudes to work , there is an interesting exercise you can try :- spend a whole day in bed for no particular reason ( ie dont wait until you are ill or exhausted ) .
Dont do anything , just lie in bed and doze all day , without feeling ashamed of your laziness .
This could be the greatest challenge you have ever faced .
The acceptance of laziness breaks the link between guilt and work which chains us to primitive patterns from the past .

Just back from paying our respects to Gerald R. Ford at the Ford Museum in downtown Grand Rapids .
The line , of course , was long .
We got in line at about 6:00 PM and left the museum just before 10:30 .
As we left , it appeared that the line was at least twice as long as it had been when we had joined it , and areas that we breezed through at nearly normal walking pace were at a standstill .
Since it took us four and a half hours , I ’d guess that folks getting in line now have a good nine hours , or probably even more , to go .
[ UPDATE : My boss got up and went at 3:00 AM and still had to wait two hours…still , that means things either sped up or a lot of people bailed . ]
My wife and kids went downtown to watch the motorcade this afternoon .
Though we ’ve got no snow , it ’s not what you ’d call ‘ warm ’ outside , particularly if you ’re standing still .
Despite the chill , though , the crowd was large .
My wife took the photo at right of the President ’s hearse turning into the Museum property .
As you can see , the crowd was deep and hordes of Eagle Scouts lined the way .
Someone gave my wife a glass vase with flowers to place among the notes , banners , flags , and candles that have been accumulating around the museum ’s sign along Pearl Street , but they were unable to cross the street before they had to leave for a bit .
So they stashed the flowers behind some bushes in front of a hotel across the street .
More on the flowers later .
All this big media attention in little old Grand Rapids ?
I returned with them and we got in line .
After moving pretty quickly through the first three - quarters of the queue , we hit the traffic jam inside DeVos Place and settled down for a long wait .
We opted to wait an extra twenty minutes or so to sign the guest book ( my kids each signed their own name neatly , and I added a faux middle name of “ Murdoc ” to mine ) .
There were a fair number of men and women in uniform ( besides those working the event ) but there were probably even more Masons in their regalia .
( Pardon me if I misspoke .
I do n’t know if you call it a Mason “ uniform ” or what … )
After another chilly wait outside the museum itself , we got a few seconds in front of Ford ’s closed casket .
My son , in his Boy Scout uniform , gave a smart Scout salute .
Then we were on our way .
As we left , we had the opportunity to shake hands with Steve Ford , one of the President ’s sons .
I was a bit surprised to see him there at 10:30 PM greeting folks in a line with no end in sight .
As he shook my son ’s hand Ford mentioned to him how much his father loved Scouting and how he had earned Eagle .
That was very kind .
After we left the museum building , I stopped to check out the collection of flowers , flags , signs , University of Michigan hats and banners , candles , and whatnot along Pearl Street .
While I looked , my wife and daughter headed across the street to check for the vase they had stashed that afternoon .
It was still there , so over it came and it now sits with the rest of the outpouring from the community for all to see .
Who gave the vase to my wife ?
We do n’t know .
There ’s a lot of difference in opinion about Ford and his Presidency , particularly over the pardon for Richard Nixon .
But I think it ’s becoming more clear each year that he inherited an almost impossible task and did a fine job of holding things together .
That ’s better than really could have been expected of anyone in that office at that time , and we owe him a lot .
Though not a native Michigander , I ’m proud to live in Gerald Ford ’s old Congressional district and I ’m proud of the honor that West Michigan is showing it ’s most famous legislator and politician .
Also , I ’m proud of my family for braving the crowd twice today to pay a final bit of respect to a man who did good for America and was a friend to Scouting .
Finally , here ’s a shot from today of the 9 - 11 Scout Salute patch that my son earned in 2005 for participating in the all - day salute on the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks .
These are special Ford Council patches ( compare them to the standard patches worn by the Eagle Scouts in the top picture ) that can only be worn by those who take part in the sun -up to sun-down salute ( in three or five minute intervals ) each year .
He ’s earned the patch four years running , but he has n’t got the 2006 patch onto his uniform yet .
I had been bugging him to get the new one on , but , as it turns out , waiting was the right thing to do .
The 2005 salute was performed outside the Ford Museum , so this patch was earned on this property and has now returned to help say farewell to a great American :
I noted the salute in 2004 with a pic of my son at attention , and now that I look I see that I also posted a pic in 2005 , taken outside the Ford Museum on a sunny Sunday morning .
Beside him in the 2005 pic is a fellow Scout who is now in the same Boy Scout patrol as my son .
( Go DRAGONS ! )
Did I mention that I ’m proud of my family ?

A heat - loving archaeon capable of fixing nitrogen at a surprisingly hot 92 degrees Celsius , or 198 Fahrenheit , may represent Earth 's earliest lineages of organisms capable of nitrogen fixation , perhaps even preceding the kinds of bacteria today 's plants and animals rely on to fix nitrogen .
The genetic analysis reported in the December 15 issue of the journal Science supports the notion that the gene needed to produce nitrogenase - an enzyme capable of converting nitrogen gas , that 's unusable by life , to a form like ammonia that is useable - arose before the three main branches of life - bacteria , archaea * and eukaryotes - diverged some 3.5 billion years ago , according to oceanographer Mausmi Mehta ( info ) , who recently received her doctorate from the UW , and John Baross , UW professor of oceanography .
This is opposed to the theory that the nitrogenase system arose within archaea and was later transferred laterally to bacteria .
' There 's been lots of evidence that point to high - temperature archaea as the first life on Earth but the question has been , ' So why ca n't we find archaea that fix nitrogen at high temperatures ? ' says Baross , who 's been on a 20 - year quest to find just such a microbe .
Archaea are single - celled organisms that live under extreme environmental conditions , such as the high temperatures and crushing pressures below the seafloor .
If heat - loving archaea were the first life on the planet , they would have needed a usable source of nitrogen , Baross says .
Known as FS406 - 22 because of the fluid and culture samples it came from , the archaeon discovered by the UW researchers is the first from a deep - sea hydrothermal vent that can fix nitrogen , says Mehta , first author on the Science paper .
It was collected at Axial Volcano ** on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the coast of Washington and Oregon .
Fixing nitrogen at 92 C smashes the previous record by 28 C , a record held by Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus , an archaeon that was isolated from geothermally heated sand near an Italian beach and fixes nitrogen at temperatures up to 64 C .

Based on the Science paper :
" Nitrogen Fixation at 92 degrees C by a Hydrothermal Vent Archaeon "
Abstract
A methanogenic archaeon isolated from deep - sea hydrothermal vent fluid was found to reduce N2 to NH3 at up to 92 C , which is 28 C higher than the current upper temperature limit of biological nitrogen fixation .
The 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the hyperthermophilic nitrogen fixer , designated FS406 - 22 , was 99 % similar to that of non-nitrogen fixing Methanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM 2661 .
At its optimal growth temperature of 90 C , FS406 - 22 incorporated 15N2 and expressed nifH messenger RNA .
This increase in the temperature limit of nitrogen fixation could reveal a broader range of conditions for life in the subseafloor biosphere and other nitrogen - limited ecosystems than previously estimated .

* Info on Archaea :
The Domain Archaea was n't recognized as a major domain of life until quite recently .
Until the 20th century , most biologists considered all living things to be classifiable as either a plant or an animal .
But in the 1950s and 1960s , most biologists came to the realization that this system failed to accomodate the fungi , protists , and bacteria .
By the 1970s , a system of Five Kingdoms had come to be accepted as the model by which all living things could be classified .
At a more fundamental level , a distinction was made between the prokaryotic bacteria and the four eukaryotic kingdoms ( plants , animals , fungi , and protists ) .
The distinction recognizes the common traits that eukaryotic organisms share , such as nuclei , cytoskeletons , and internal membranes .

** Info on the Axial Volcano :
Axial Volcano rises 700 meters above the mean level of the ridge crest and is the most magmatically robust and seismically active site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge between the Blanco Fracture Zone and the Cobb offset .
It represents the product of intense volcanic activity from the Cobb - Eikelberg hotspot juxtaposed on the extensional field of the spreading center .
Axial Volcano was first studied in the late 1970s and then mapped in greater detail by NOAA / VENTS with SeaBeam in the early 1980s .
Following the initial discovery of venting in the northern portion of the caldera in 1983 , a concentrated mapping and sampling effort was made in the mid-late 1980s .
The summit of Axial Volcano is marked by an unusual rectangular shaped caldera ( 3 x 8 km ) that lies between the two rift zones .

Bechtel Corp. went to Iraq three years ago to help rebuild a nation torn by war .
Since then , 52 of its people have been killed and much of its work sabotaged as Iraq dissolved into insurgency and sectarian violence .
Now Bechtel is leaving .
The San Francisco engineering company 's last government contract to rebuild power , water and sewage plants across Iraq expired on Tuesday .
Some employees remain to finish the paperwork , but essentially , the company 's job is done .
Bechtel 's contracts were part of an enormous U.S. effort to put Iraq back on its feet after decades of wars and sanctions .
That rebuilding campaign , once touted as the Marshall Plan of modern times , was supposed to win the hearts of skeptical Iraqis by giving them clean water , dependable power , telephones that worked and modern sanitation .
President Bush said he wanted the country 's infrastructure to be the very best in the Middle East .
But Bechtel -- which charged into Iraq with American " can - do " fervor -- found it tough to keep its engineers and workers alive , much less make progress in piecing Iraq back together .
" Did Iraq come out the way you hoped it would ? " asked Cliff Mumm , Bechtel 's president for infrastructure work .
" I would say , emphatically , no .
And it's heartbreaking . "
The violence that has gripped Iraq drove up costs and hamstrung the engineers who poured into the country after the U.S. - led invasion .
Bechtel 's first reconstruction contract , awarded shortly after Saddam Hussein 's overthrow in April 2003 , assured the company that it would have a safe environment for its workers .
But , by the end , dozens of Bechtel 's employees and subcontractors had been killed , some of them kidnapped , others marched out of their office and shot .
Forty - nine others were wounded .
Bechtel responded by hiring more guards , driving armored cars and fortifying its camps .
Those steps ate up money that otherwise would have brought electricity and clean water to Iraqis .
The size of Bechtel 's contracts also shrank over time , as U.S. officials diverted money from reconstruction and toward security .
Instead of the nearly $ 3 billion originally budgeted , Bechtel finally received about $ 2.3 billion , a figure that includes money the company spent on projects as well as its undisclosed profit .
Mumm directed Bechtel 's work from a bare - bones trailer in Baghdad .
He is proud of his people for finding ways to work despite the threat of imminent death .
Of 99 projects that the U.S. government directed Bechtel to complete , the company finished 97 , abandoning only two for security reasons , the company says .
But Mumm 's pride is mixed with frustration .
Many of those completed projects later fell victim to collapsing security , which made maintenance dangerous and , in some cases , resulting in damage to plants and equipment .
He once hoped the new Iraqi government would turn into a steady Bechtel client , bringing the company lucrative new contracts in a country where virtually every road , power plant and waterworks needs repair .
" Had Iraq been a calmer place while we were there , amazing things could have been done , " he said .
The U.S reconstruction push in Iraq is winding down .
About $ 18 billion in funding that Congress approved three years ago was supposed to be spent or committed to specific projects by the end of September .
Two of the U.S. government agencies that have overseen the work are scheduled to close shop early next year .
The United States and other countries are discussing another round of aid , but if it comes , Iraqi ministries are supposed to take the lead on rebuilding .
" That 's really an under - told story -- we 've stopped the reconstruction , " said Frederick Barton , co-director of the Post - Conflict Reconstruction Project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank .
" There are some things we 're still finishing up , but we 're wrapping up , and we 're stepping back .
It 's really a tragedy . "
What exactly did Bechtel accomplish in its three years in Iraq ?
--
The company helped repair 14 electrical generation units , built four new ones and created 25 substations around Baghdad .
--
It restored eight sewage plants and built one .
-- A canal bringing drinking water to Basra , Iraq 's second - largest city , was dredged and its pumps restored .
Seventy small water treatment plants were installed in rural areas .
-- Airports in Baghdad and Basra were repaired to handle civilian flights .
The country 's international shipping port -- Umm Qasr -- was dredged and its grain elevator refurbished .
-- Baghdad telephone switching stations knocked out during the war were restored , and the country 's phone network was reconnected to the outside world .
-- War - damaged bridges on key highways were rebuilt .
-- Almost 1,240 schools were refurbished with new paint , fans and in many cases new windows and doors to replace those looters had stolen .
But many of these accomplishments were undone as security evaporated .
For example , Bechtel added 1,280 megawatts to the nation 's power grid and improved the reliability of another 480 megawatts .
In the United States , that much energy could light more than 1.3 million homes .
But Iraq 's entire power system this summer produced 4,400 megawatts , just 442 megawatts more than before the invasion .
The country needs about 9,000 megawatts to satisfy demand .
In some cases , the power plants have had trouble getting stable fuel supplies .
In others , repaired plants were cut off from the national grid by sabotaged power lines .
A series of coordinated attacks Oct. 20 , for example , severed Baghdad from power generated in the rest of the country , leaving the city 's 7 million residents with only a few hours of electricity each day .
" Infrastructure is assumed by the terrorists , correctly , to be a target , " said Michael Izady , a professor at Pace University who has trained U.S. forces in Iraq .
" They 're not stupid .
You just hit the power grid , and you have 120 degrees outside .
Ask any American what they 'd do after two days of that .
Tempers run really high . "
Making matters worse , Iraqi workers have n't maintained some of the repaired electrical plants .
U.S. government auditors blame the problem on a lack of funding and the attitudes of Iraqi workers , who in the past rarely did maintenance unless something broke .
Auditors visited one plant where new control systems had been bypassed , the blades of new turbines already had oil residue building up on them , and a fire had broken out -- a problem , since the fire extinguishing system was missing key parts .
Similar problems plagued water and sewage projects .
At Baghdad 's Kerkh sewage plant , Bechtel spent $ 5.7 million repairing equipment that had n't worked in months , maybe years .
But the plant 's location , on the edge of the city , became increasingly dangerous -- turf for Hussein loyalists and criminal gangs .
In November 2004 , insurgents issued flyers telling the plant 's Iraqi workers to stay home or die , according to Bechtel .
Not long after , a power failure hit the plant , and the staff did n't turn on the backup generator .
The plant stopped working .
" We 'd get it completed , and then the Iraqis would all flee , and it'd get mortared , " Mumm said .
" It would operate for a while , then the same thing would happen .
...
As we sit here today , I do n't know if Kerkh is running or not . "
Some places became too dangerous for Western and Iraqi employees alike .
One of the projects Bechtel could n't complete was a water treatment plant in Baghdad 's Sadr City , a poor , crowded neighborhood dominated by Shiite militias .
Bechtel 's top project supervisors and the project 's subcontractor fled to avoid assassination .
Violent intimidation also stopped another project -- a state - of - the - art children 's hospital in which first lady Laura Bush had taken a personal interest .
The project , in Basra , was supposed to cost $ 50 million .
The U.S. Agency for International Development assigned Bechtel the job in August 2004 , with a completion date of Dec. 31 , 2005 .
But Bechtel later warned its government supervisors that the hospital would take far more money and time to complete .
The project was suspended this summer .
Bechtel says the hospital now would cost $ 98 million .
Federal auditors , who blamed USAID for not reporting the project delays and costs to Congress , say the figure is probably higher .
Basra had been quiet immediately after Hussein 's fall .
Its Shiite population suffered greatly under Hussein and was happy to be rid of him .
But the calm was short - lived , as Shiite militias started to exert more and more control over the city .
Bechtel 's hospital site security manager was murdered .
The site manager received death threats and resigned .
Bechtel 's senior Iraqi engineer quit after his daughter was kidnapped .
Twelve employees of a subcontractor in charge of the hospital 's electricity and plumbing were killed in their offices .
Eleven workers of another company supplying the project 's concrete also died .
As the human cost of reconstruction rose , why did n't Bechtel pull out ?
Mumm said the company constantly reviewed security and was convinced that it could keep its people safe .
" We did n't stay under duress , " he said .
" I think all of our people got in it , got involved in it , and no one wants to leave a job half - done . "
He says the work has n't been for naught .
Even electrical or sewage plants that have broken down after Bechtel left can be revived if the country finds a way to quell the violence .
If Iraq eventually stabilizes , the people Bechtel worked with may provide another opportunity to work in the country .
" Those people will be there , and I think they 'll think favorably of us , " Mumm said .

ECONOMISTS bracing themselves for Chicago 's icy snows as they arrived for this weekend 's meeting of the American Economic Association got something of a shock .
The sun has been shining over the Windy City and temperatures are relatively mild .
On the east coast the weather is even better ; New York has not got this far into the year without snow since 1877 .
Though Colorado lies buried under a blizzard , the territory to the north and east has so far escaped winter 's embrace .
The odd weather has created some unusual conditions in the oil market .
For the past few years , the main worries for big producers have been security problems in the Middle East and Africa , and economic populism in Latin America .
Despite these continuing pressures , oil prices plunged last week , dropping to $ 54.90 a barrel in intraday trading on Friday January 5th , the lowest price for over 18 months , though after the weekend prices rebounded a little on world markets .
The best explanation seems to be the warm weather in both Europe and America 's north - east , the world 's largest market for home heating oil .
Inventories are piling up , pushing down crude prices .
Even if winter makes a belated appearance , the higher stocks will cushion upward price pressure , as well as the sort of supply shocks of recent years that have sent prices soaring .
American demand may be depressed for another reason : several years of high oil prices are finally sinking into the country 's consciousness .
Sales of fuel - thirsty SUVs are suffering , while hybrids and smaller cars have grown more popular .
There is evidence that consumers and governments are pushing for conservation of heating oil too , with more efficient furnaces and higher standards required for home insulation .
But demand is not the only side of the equation .
Security problems for the big producers could send prices rising sharply again .
And even if there are no big disruptions in Africa or the Middle East , OPEC will surely act if prices drop too low .
The oil cartel 's public pronouncements have grown increasingly hawkish since prices peaked at over $ 78 in July and it has cut quotas since then .
But many member governments have become dangerously dependent on the windfall revenues from oil .
Hugo Chávez , who has been particularly pugnacious , has been using Venezuela 's state - run oil company to fund social spending at the expense of reinvestment in oil production .
Many believe that other countries , such as Iran , have similarly shortchanged investment to bolster popular support .
If prices fall precipitously , Mr Chávez and others with similar problems could find themselves in deep fiscal — and political — trouble .
Though other governments may not face problems so dire , none are eager to see revenues fall .
OPEC 's power over prices will be checked by two factors .
The first is the negative impact of prices on demand , which limits the ability of the cartel to maintain price discipline over the long term .
This happened in the mid-1980s , when a sustained period of high prices encouraged oil companies to invest in new non-OPEC capacity , while governments and individuals adopted measures to use fuel more efficiently , causing prices to collapse .
Economists have marvelled that the recent price increases had encouraged so few conservation measures , but there is evidence that this is starting to change , particularly in America .
The other challenge to OPEC 's price discipline is cheating .
Over the past few years members have been racing flat out to keep up with the growth in global demand .
But if OPEC cuts production to well below the peak capacity of its members , governments in the throes of a fiscal shock will be tempted to produce more than their quotas to make up some of the lost revenue .
Historically , this has been a strong check on OPEC 's ability to keep prices high .
The other unknown variable is the performance of the global economy in the coming year .
Lower oil prices would improve matters — but if the economy strengthens , demand for oil will probably pick up .
After this weekend , energy economists might have trouble judging which way the wind is blowing in the oil markets .
The Washington Post publishes an extended interview with a botnet - running hacker , known only as 0x80 :
The young hacker ... has agreed to be interviewed only if he is n't identified by name or home town ...
The article still has a lot of magazine - style colour :
Tall and lanky , with hair that falls down to his eyebrows , 0x80 almost never looks you in the eye when he talks , his accent a slurry of heavy Southern drawl and Midwestern nasality .
He lives with his folks in a small town in Middle America .
The nearest businesses are a used - car lot , a gas station / convenience store and a strip club , where 0x80 says he recently dropped $ 800 for an hour alone in a VIP room with several dancers .
There 's also an artfully disguised photo , presumably of 0x80 :
With all this detail ( and more ) about 0x80 's circumstances and history , it 's a good thing the Post is keeping his identity secret .
In a small town of a few thousand people , it would otherwise be pretty easy to track the hacker down from his description .
The article is then linked from Slashdot , where an astute commenter downloads the image and checks out the EXIF IPTC data :
Roland OK is indeed a piece of small - town Middle America , population 3,000 .
Another commenter quickly finds the most likely used car lot , gas station and strip club .
I think there 's a lesson in there somewhere .
Update :
In a comment to a Post blog entry , someone claiming to be 0x80 says :
funny is that that is way off from where i reside apprently from what i gathered from brian kreps was it was old metadata so im still safe .
haha i guess luck is on my side :)
So who knows , maybe 0x80 dodged a bullet after all ?
Update 2 : On the other hand , in the comments to this blog entry , the journalist responsible to the article responds to the issue only with " I am aware of it , yes .
Thank you . "
You'd think that if he were in a position to say the metadata was wrong , he would have done so just to nip the whole thing in the bud .
Update 3 : Another " no comment " in the live chat talkback for the original article ( bugmenot required ) .

Habitat for seals is disappearing
Melting ice , spreading deserts and the impact of warm seas on the sex of turtles are among threats identified .
The report is being launched at a meeting of EU nature conservation chiefs in Scotland .
It says that warming has already changed the migration routes of some birds and other animals .
The UK's Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) commissioned the research , which was led by the British Trust for Ornithology .
The meeting , in the Scottish holiday resort of Aviemore , was called to discuss ways in which wildlife might be helped to adapt to global warming .
Times already changing
Scientists have already observed a wide range of changes in the migration patterns of birds , fish and turtles , apparently in response to warming which has already taken place .
Some species normally associated with more southerly countries , such as the little egret , the loggerhead turtle , and the red mullet , are increasingly seen in and around the UK .
Krill , low down on the food chain , are affected by climate change
While many species have been able to adapt to new conditions simply by moving their ranges further towards the poles , the study warns that this option is not available to other animals , such as polar bears and seals whose habitat is disappearing rapidly with the melting of Arctic sea ice .
Even subtle changes in sea temperature can have dramatic impacts on wildlife with rapid depletion of the tiny plankton organisms which form the base of the food web in the oceans .
This is thought to have contributed to a recent drastic decline in the breeding success of some Scottish seabirds , as the fish on which they depend were suddenly deprived of food .
Some of the other threats from climate change identified in the study include :
Increased storminess damaging the breeding colonies of albatross , already facing heavy pressure from accidental capture on long - line fishing hooks
Sea level rise destroying beach nesting sites for sea turtles - for example , nearly a third of beaches used by turtles in the Caribbean would be lost with the rise anticipated during this century , and seals and wading birds also face destruction of their coastal habitats
Warmer seas could lead to some turtle species becoming entirely female , as water temperature strongly affects the sex ratio of hatchlings
Growing water scarcity in many regions could further destroy the wetland areas on which migrating waterfowl depend .
The spreading extent of the Sahara desert could threaten long - range travellers such as the swallow , as they will be unable to " fuel up " in previously fertile regions on the desert 's edge .
" They range from the swallow crossing the Sahara to the albatrosses of the southern oceans ; but this report shows that the potential impacts are really widespread .
" There is some scope for helping species adapt to climate change , but we need to find global solutions to help animals that swim , fly and walk thousands of miles each year . "
Too far , too fast
Warmer seas could render some turtle species entirely female
Indeed , it is one of the driving forces behind the process of evolution which has produced the staggering variety of life on Earth .
But the fear is that the changes currently under way are simply too rapid for species to evolve new strategies for survival .
Their options are also being narrowed by the rapid conversion of ecosystems such as the draining of wetlands , felling of forests and development of coastlines - so if their existing habitats are hit by global warming , there is literally no place to go .
The report has important messages for conservation officials gathered in Scotland for this meeting convened by Defra .
They are being urged to make more use of " biological corridors " to widen the options available to migrating species as climate change takes hold .
The whole approach to conservation may have to be radically changed - the most perfectly - protected nature reserve could end up being of little use if the animals breeding there face starvation because they have nowhere to migrate .
How would would you like to have an NES controller that housed an actual NES ?
Okay , the innards are n't an actual NES ; the creator used a third - party knock - off system packed with pirated games to do his mad - scientist work , but I 'm still impressed .
The controller plugs right into the television , has a bunch of games built - in , and , even more crazily , has a full - sized cartridge connector on the back .
I 'm not sure how comfortable it would be to plug in an NES cart while you 're playing , but the fact that you can at all is hiliarious .
It does n't stop there !
This guy added an LED backlight to the Nintendo logo to make it glow , and it even has a second controller port for two - player games or some light gun action .
It may be another one of those console hacks that very few people would have a use for , but its very existence proves that there is a God , and he 's pretty geeky .
I 'd be showing this off at every party I went to for the next year ; who does n't like playing NES games ?
My hats off to you sir , that 's some impressive work .
Is anyone surprised this came to us via the Benheck.com forums ?
Slipping out of our grasp
Abusy week on the outsourcing front .
On Thursday , Infosys Technologies , one of India 's largest outsourcing firms , said it 's setting up a consulting subsidiary in Fremont , -- a move intended to deflect U.S. ire about jobs and services traveling abroad but which in fact merely makes it easier for Infosys to attract new clients in this country .
A day earlier , none other than IBM said it 's acquiring one of India 's top outsourcing firms , Daksh EServices , making Big Blue a major player in the exporting of business functions .
The deal was announced 40 years to the day after IBM unveiled its first general - purpose mainframe computer , highlighting how much U.S. industry has changed in the interval .
Then we have Bank of America telling employees on Monday that it will cut 12,500 jobs as part of its merger with FleetBoston Financial while work proceeds on creation of a new facility in the Indian city of Hyderabad .
America 's second - largest bank expects to begin processing customer transactions at the site by next month .
" Outsourcing is a fact of life , " said Cynthia Kroll , a UC Berkeley economist .
" These things all show that it 's likely to continue . "
This week 's developments also underline the fact that as more services are shipped overseas , the scope of U.S. consumers ' personal data traveling the globe is exponentially growing -- accompanied by an increased risk that confidential information could fall into the wrong hands .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" The risk exists and must be dealt with , " said Beth Givens , director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , a San Diego advocacy group .
" The fact that security breaches may not fall under U.S. law is a grave concern . "
There 's the rub .
Strict U.S. privacy laws have no jurisdiction abroad , leaving overseas workers essentially on the honor system when it comes to safeguarding consumers ' data .
In establishing a new subsidiary in this country , India 's Infosys says its plans to hire as many as 500 employees over the next three years should defuse resentment about jobs and services leaving the country .
" As we are looking to expand our global footprint , we are creating local employment in the countries where we operate , " Nandan Nilekani , Infosys ' chief executive officer , told reporters in Bangalore .
Be that as it may , the vast majority of the company 's more than 20,000 workers remain in India , and that 's where the bulk of contracted work will be done .
Five hundred jobs may be created in this country , but those jobs will be focused almost exclusively on sending work abroad .
IBM , meanwhile , is hoping to give Infosys a run for its money by acquiring Daksh .
A purchase price has n't been disclosed , but published reports place the amount at anywhere from $ 150 million to $ 200 million .
Daksh , with 6,000 employees , already provides call - center operations and other services for a variety of corporate clients , including Amazon.com , Sprint and Citigroup .
" This is a very important part of what our customers are looking for , " said Ian Colley , an IBM spokesman .
" We need to be in India to be able to do that . "
This deal is significant for a number of reasons , not least because IBM 's stature will be seen by many potential outsourcers as conferring a new level of legitimacy on the practice .
Companies that might have been sitting on the fence may now feel that if it 's good enough for Big Blue , it 's good enough for them .
At the same time , the acquisition of Daksh represents an if - you - ca n 't- beat - ' em - join - 'em turning point for U.S. business .
With the tide of outsourcing taking on tsunami proportions , IBM may be the first of a series of American heavyweights cutting themselves in for a piece of the action .
Daksh is also interesting because the company recently opened a subsidiary in the Philippines to handle overflow from its India operations , making it an outsourcing firm that also outsources .
At BofA , the first workers will take their seats next month at the bank 's new Hyderabad facility , operated by local subsidiary , Continuum Solutions .
If all goes as planned , 500 Indian workers will be on the job by December and as many as 1,000 by next summer .
The Hyderabad facility will handle support and transactions for most of the bank 's major divisions , including consumer and corporate accounts .
Scott Scredon , a BofA spokesman , said customers ' privacy is assured because Continuum workers " will be required to sign an agreement to keep all data confidential . "
He added that " when they join Continuum , the first training provided is information security and the code of ethics . "
Kroll , the Berkeley economist , is right : Outsourcing will continue .
This week 's developments involving Infosys , IBM and BofA show that the trend is clearly picking up pace .
Your name , your address , your Social Security number , your bank account number -- safeguarded by little more than a confidentiality agreement and a code of ethics .
How safe do you feel ?

Marc Shuman StoryGarageTek was a no-brainer when Shuman founded it in 2000 .
He got the idea when he and his father , with whom he outfitted department store interiors , designed and built a set of slotted wall panels with moveable shelves for a retail client .
When several of his employees began using the panel systems to organize their own garages and basements , Shuman realized he had a potential hit on his hands .
And the timing seemed perfect :
The housing market was heating up , garages were getting bigger , and closet organizers were all the rage .
Shuman decided to sell the display business and open GarageTek .
Rather than simply selling the panels at home - improvement stores , Shuman decided to build a garage - makeover business .
GarageTek would perform in - home consultations , then design and install the systems -- complete with shelves , cabinets , bike racks , and work benches .
Homeowners , Shuman figured , were likely to pay a premium for the service .
The biggest risk was competition .
After all , anyone could have the same idea .
But if Shuman could establish a foothold in markets around the country , GarageTek had a better chance of survival .
Franchising seemed like the best way to pull off such an ambitious expansion .
In early 2001 , Shuman placed an ad soliciting franchisees in The Wall Street Journal , and phone calls poured in .
His attorney advised him to choose carefully .
But Shuman , eager to get started , approved anyone with a business background , a $ 25,000 franchise fee , and $ 200,000 - - which , according to Shuman 's calculations , was enough to purchase supplies , buy newspaper ads , and turn a profit within 18 months .
Each franchise would pay GarageTek 8 percent of annual sales , a portion of which would help fund national advertising campaigns .
In exchange , they received three days of basic training and a manual written by Shuman .
" If they had the money and they had a strong sales and marketing background , we felt they were qualified , " Shuman says .
At first , everything seemed to go according to plan .
In the first half of 2001 , GarageTek franchises opened in Connecticut , New Jersey , and New York .
By 2003 , 57 franchises had sprung up in 33 states , and annual revenue at the corporate office was on track to top $ 12 million .
That summer , however , Shuman began to realize that while many franchises were thriving , 15 were struggling .
He and his team moved quickly to correct their mistakes .
The first step was to create more stringent criteria for new franchisees .
To pass the initial screening , candidates now need a net worth of $ 1 million , with at least $ 250,000 in liquid assets ; their proposed territories must boast at least 250,000 single - family homes , occupied by owners .
They 're also required to run the franchises themselves .
GarageTek also decided to administer a 350 - question personality test , looking for candidates with traits similar to GarageTek 's top performers , who tend to be enterprising and not overly accommodating -- a sign of independence .
Finally , all candidates fly to New York to meet with Shuman and his corporate team .
To identify problems early on , he installed software that enables him to track each franchise 's financial performance .
So far , the strategy seems to be working .
In 2005 , GarageTek 's sales jumped 33 percent , to $ 20 million , even though the company had 21 fewer franchises than in 2004 .
Now that he has a streamlined system in place , Shuman plans to add 55 new franchises during the next few years , for a total of 100 .
But he admits that he has more to learn .
" We 're not , by any stretch , done , " he says .
Pregnancy and new motherhood is one of the most stressful and anxious times for most women as they worry for themselves and the innocent lives in their care .
This concern means they ’re especially vulnerable to becoming alarmed by health scares and to react out of fear , with potentially harmful outcomes .
So it is especially imperative that the health information they receive is well - grounded , credible and helpful .
When the headlining story — which appeared virtually verbatim in media across our country and around the world — told women they were putting their pregnancies and unborn babies at risk if they did n’t lose all of their pregnancy weight and begin their next pregnancies at “ healthy ” weights ; weight loss admonitions began instantly .
In fact , the researchers whose study this news story was based upon told media that their “ striking findings ” provided “ the evidence that overweight or obese women who plan to become pregnant should lose weight . ”
Even a modest increase of 7 pounds , the public was told , could raise a woman ’s risk for pregnancy - related complications , such as gestational diabetes by 30 % and pregnancy hypertension 40 % .
But they delivered even more frightening news , warning women that “ gaining 3 or more units of BMI ( body mass index ) raises the risk of a stillbirth by 63 % , pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension by 78 % and 76 % , and could double her risks for gestational diabetes . ”
“ These are staggering numbers , ” Daniel Herron was quoted as saying .
Women should not wait for later research before changing their behavior and losing weight between pregnancies , he added .
[ Not a single reporter revealed that Herron is not simply an “ associate professor of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital ” as they reported .
He is Chief of Bariatric Surgery with Mount Sinai ’s Program for Surgical Weight Loss , as well as on the Public / Professional Education Committee of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery .
Readily - known interests , in promoting fears of obesity and the need for weight loss , the media did n’t disclose . ]
Also quoted in the media reports was a reproductive health specialist with the World Health Organization who said : “ This is the first study to provide ... the necessary evidence to show a causal relationship between obesity and adverse outcomes . ”
What is passing for evidence and sound interpretations by health authorities is , in fact , what is most staggering .
What did the study show ?
This study was conducted by Eduardo Villamor , M.D. , of Harvard School of Public Health and Sven Cnattingius , M.D. , of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm .
They sorted through data from the medical records of 151,025 Swedish women who had had their first and second babies during 1992 - 2001 .
It was a “ case - controlled ” study , looking retrospectively through histories trying to find correlations between BMIs and pregnancy complications .
The researchers applied statistical modeling of the data to create the odds ratios they reported .
To make any sense of their findings , we must first understand what an odds ratio actually means .

A panel of retired generals told a United States Senate committee today that sending 21,500 additional troops to Iraq will do little to solve the underlying political problems in the country .
“ Too little and too late , ” is the way Gen. Joseph P. Hoar , a former chief of the Central Command , described the effort to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
The additional troops are intended to help pacify Baghdad and a restive province , but General Hoar said American leaders had failed to understand the political forces at work in the country .
“ The solution is political , not military , ” he said .
“ A fool ’s errand , ” was the judgment of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey , who commanded troops in the first Gulf War .
He said other countries had concluded that the effort in Iraq was not succeeding , noting that “ our allies are leaving us and will be gone by summer . ”
Describing the situation in Iraq as “ desperate but not terminal , ” he said Iraqis had to try to make political deals domestically and negotiate for stability with neighboring nations , particularly Syria and Iran .
It seems , from our very unofficial research , that cat owners tend to be geeks .
And to prove our point , we bring you the geekiest cat owner in history .
Lee Holmes , of Ontario , Canada , recently combined his Ubuntu Linux server to create a Rube Goldberg machine of a cat feeder .
By running a script on his server , the CD - ROM tray pops open , a trap door opens , allowing cat food to flow down a cardboard chute into his cat 's bowl .
( Bah , just go watch it in action on YouTube , which is linked from his site . )
As if that were n't geeky enough , he can use his i-mate JasJar to SSH to the server , allowing him to feed his cat from across the room , or across the world .
Now all he needs is to figure out a way for the restocking process to be automated , and he could retire from his day job and sell these things to cat owners worldwide .

Journalists were allowed to visit Natanz in March of last year
The move ends a two - year suspension of research , and could result in Tehran being referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions .
The UN nuclear chief said Iran planned small - scale nuclear enrichment .
Western countries fear Iran 's nuclear programme could be used to make atomic bombs .
But Tehran denies this , saying it wants to produce energy only .
HAVE YOUR SAY
People should worry about a populist religious fundamentalist having his finger on a nuclear button

" What we [ have resumed ] is merely in the field of research , not more than that , " the deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran , Mohammad Saeedi , said on Tuesday .
" We distinguish between research on nuclear fuel technology and production of nuclear fuel .
Production of nuclear fuel remains suspended . "
France called the move a " grave error " , and the UK said the world was running out of patience with Iran .
Condemnation
The resumption of research on Tuesday at the Natanz site suggests all of Iran 's nuclear activities , apart from uranium enrichment - a key stage in making a nuclear bomb - have been revived .
The US and EU immediately condemned the latest move .
Gregory Schulte , the US ambassador to the IAEA , said it showed Iran 's " disdain for international concerns and its rejection of international diplomacy " .
IRAN'S NUCLEAR STANDOFF September 2002 : Work begins on Iran 's first nuclear reactor at Bushehr December 2002 : Satellite photographs reveal nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz ; Iran agrees to an IAEA inspection September 2003 : IAEA gives Iran weeks to prove it is not pursuing atomic weapons November 2003 : Iran suspends uranium enrichment and allows tougher inspections ; IAEA says no proof of any weapons programme June 2004 : IAEA rebukes Iran for not fully co-operating with nuclear inquiry November 2004 : Iran suspends uranium enrichment as part of deal with EU August 2005 : Iran rejects EU proposals and resumes work at Isfahan nuclear plant January 2006 : Iran removes seals at Natanz facility
In depth : Nuclear fuel cycle
A spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said Iran 's move " is very much a step in the wrong direction .
" We are extremely concerned and consultations are taking place ( within the EU ) to co-ordinate a response , " Cristina Gallach told Reuters news agency .
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Iran was " pushing its luck with the international community " , adding there was " no good reason " to do what it had done if its intentions were peaceful .
Russia , which has provided Iran with nuclear know - how , urged it to stick to its international commitments .
But the BBC's Frances Harrison in Tehran says threats of economic or military sanctions against Iran - with oil prices high and US and UK forces tied down in Iraq - are not realistic .
Serious punitive action cannot be taken against Iran at the moment , she says .
Iran resumed uranium conversion , an earlier stage in the nuclear fuel cycle , at its plant in Isfahan when negotiations with the EU broke down in August .
In September , the IAEA 's board called on Iran to cease all nuclear fuel work , and threatened to refer Tehran to the Security Council .
Tehran has always said it has the right under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty - which it has signed - to research nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
But Washington , Israel and many European powers distrust Iran , partly because it had kept its nuclear research secret for 18 years before it was revealed in 2002 .
Bringing home her groceries recently , Jane Leach , a 46 - year - old caregiver for the elderly , described a typical weekend evening on the small grassy area that serves as a park of sorts between two rows of houses on her street .
The youths start coming after 6 , she said , dozens of them , boys and girls , mostly in their teens .
They get drunk , take drugs , harass the residents , steal cars , urinate and defecate in the gardens , smash beer bottles on doorsteps , fight , pass out .

When she tries to intervene , Ms. Leach said , the youths yell abuse at her .
When she tells them to get off her car , they tell her there is nowhere else to sit .
Recently , youths slashed every tire on 12 cars up and down the street , she said .
When her partner was smashed in the face by a 14 - year - old , Ms. Leach said , the police took 45 minutes to respond .
“ They ’ve got no respect at all for anybody , ” she said .
The street is subject to a so - called dispersal order forbidding young people to congregate in groups larger than three or four .
But the police have told her , she said , that it is better for the youths to be in one place so they do n’t rampage separately through the neighborhood .
On one occasion , an officer said she was loath to step in because there was no one to back her up , Ms. Leach said .
“ I said , ‘ Who do we have to call — the army ? ’ ”
When children chronically miss school , many localities require their parents to attend parenting classes , sometimes threatening them with prosecution if the truancy persists .
Families with problems that run through the generations can in some places qualify for regular home visits from workers who teach them the basics of daily life : how to make sure everyone gets up on time and has breakfast ; how to cook and sit down to a meal ; what to do when a child misbehaves .
Under a new program , a handful of the most troubled families in some areas , including Manchester , are removed from their homes and placed in residential facilities , along with other problem families , where they are taught skills and the structure to cope with family life and the world outside .
The programs have a high success rate for those who take part , but they are very expensive and labor - intensive , reaching only a few families .
Wang greeted me in a cheerless reception room in the Chinese mission and invited me to sit parallel to him , as though we were a pair of notables at a reviewing stand .
( I took a corner chair instead . )
The embassy spokesman and a political counselor seated themselves at a respectful distance across the room .
At first the ambassador dutifully recited China ’s history at the U.N .
But once we got on subjects that exercised him , like Japan ’s bid for Security Council membership , he dispensed with the abstractions and assumed the forthright and confident manner that seems natural to him .
Throughout our conversation , Wang chain - smoked Chinese cigarettes — Zhonghuas — a habit that had turned his teeth slightly brown .
Wang is bespectacled and slight and has little of the artful smoothness of the more Westernized Asian diplomats .
He grew up in Shanghai , the son of a worker , he says , with a low - level position in the Communist Party .
Wang graduated from high school in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and along with tens of millions of other Chinese was sent out to the countryside for “ re-education . ”
But after President Richard Nixon ’s visit to China in 1972 , the leadership recognized that it needed trained officials to exploit the new opening to the West .
Wang passed a test that gained him entry to one of the country ’s 11 foreign - language schools .
In 1974 , he was selected as part of a group of 140 to go to England for further study , making him among the very first citizens of postrevolutionary China to receive a Western education .
“ You think it ’s a good thing or a bad thing ? ”
Wang asked me , with a disarming grin .
Apparently , it was a good thing .
At the London School of Economics , Wang met Cong Jun , a student from the Beijing foreign - language school and the daughter of Chen Yi , one of Mao ’s great comrades .
They married soon thereafter .
( Cong Jun now works as a minister counselor in the mission and has served as co-president , with the wife of the British ambassador , Emyr Jones Parry , of a discussion group called the Women ’s International Forum . )
In 1977 Wang was sent to New York as a junior diplomat and stayed for six years .
He returned as a political counselor in 1988 , remaining until 1992 .
He became director of international - organizations policy in the Foreign Ministry , ultimately rising to the position of vice foreign minister before returning to New York as ambassador in 2003 .
Wang is considered the favored candidate to replace China ’s foreign minister , Li Zhaoxing , when he steps down a year from now .
Wang is one of the U.N. ’s most adroit diplomats .
Ambassador Jones Parry says that his Chinese colleague has a trick he ’s never seen anyone else perform :
“ In the council , he speaks in Chinese , but at the same time he listens to the English translation .
Sometimes he pauses , and then he ’ll switch into English to say something similar to the translation but nuanced from it . ”
Wang operates by suggestion , by indirection — often by silence .
“ They play a very skillful game at the U.N. , ” says Vanu Gopala Menon , the Singaporean ambassador .
“ They make their opinions felt without much talking .
They never come in first and make a statement .
They always listen first and then make a statement which captures the main thrust of what the developing world wants . ”
But the game the Chinese play virtually ensures the U.N. ’s regular failure in the face of humanitarian crisis .
Indeed , the combination of Wang ’s deft diplomacy and China ’s willingness to defend nations it does business with from allegations of even the grossest abuse has made a mockery of all the pious exclamations of “ never again ” that came in the wake of the Security Council ’s passive response to Rwanda ’s genocide in 1994 .
The most notorious example of China ’s new activism in this regard is Darfur .
While none of the major powers , with the intermittent exception of the United States , have shown any appetite for robust action to protect the people of this Sudanese province from the atrocities visited upon them by the government and its proxy force , known as janjaweed , the Chinese , who buy much of the oil Sudan exports , have appointed themselves Khartoum ’s chief protector .
China first worked to keep the issue of Darfur off the council agenda when both Kofi Annan and Jan Egeland , the U.N. ’s humanitarian coordinator , tried to mount a publicity campaign in early 2004 .
When this failed and Egeland publicly described the horrors there , Wang — along with the ambassador of Pakistan , a regular ally — diluted the ensuing press statement so that the council simply called on “ the parties concerned to fully cooperate in order to address the grave situation prevailing in the region . ”
In the summer , after Congress had declared the ruthless assault on unarmed villagers “ genocide , ” China vowed to veto an American resolution threatening ( not even imposing ) sanctions against Khartoum .
And yet , according to Munir Akram , the ambassador of Pakistan : “ China was not nearly as active on Darfur as people think .
The proposals came from us or from Algeria . ”
The Islamic countries then serving on the council , as well as several African nations , considered any interference in Sudan ’s affairs a violation of its national sovereignty , even though the citizens being abused were Islamic and African .
Wang was more circumspect .
At moments of friction , according to a Western diplomat , he would quietly insist , “ You cannot alienate the Sudan government ; without them , the U.N. mission will fail . ”
Akram is the kind of bombastic figure who suits Chinese purposes to a tee .
“ Their national style is different from the style of other people , including India and Pakistan , ” as Akram puts it .
“ We are an oral people ; the Chinese are not .
They make their position clear , and they stand by it . ”

Michael Arrington 's influential blog TechCrunch -- where startups get pimped and big news sometimes breaks first -- has vaulted him into the post of " Mr. Web 2.0 , " a kingmaker among Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and a figure of controversy in the media world he is disrupting .
Arrington , 36 , is a lawyer , an adviser to companies , an investor and an entrepreneur .
But the thing that 's made him famous in the tight - knit circle of the nascent Internet boom is his TechCrunch blog , which breathlessly chronicles the latest online wizardry .
In the 18 months since he started the blog , Arrington has emerged as a major player in a tech scene that is quickly changing the media landscape .
Bloggers , using inside information and posting at all hours of the day and night , are often beating traditional media to big stories and are setting the news agenda from Silicon Valley to Washington .
With that kind of disruptive activity , as well as the lack of any hard - and - fast rules on how to conduct citizen journalism , Arrington has landed in the white - hot center of several storms of criticism .
He tussled with the New York Times over journalism ethics and was dinged with accusations of favoritism and conflict of interest for writing about companies he 's invested in or whose owners are his friends .
Arrington denies doing anything wrong or even all that different from other journalists -- although he 's not entirely sure whether to call himself a journalist .
After such a meteoric rise , even Arrington is not sure what comes next .
All he knows for sure is that he needs a break , if only to dream up what comes next .
For the next month or so , Arrington is giving up the all - nighters that come with his status as a major player in Silicon Valley .
He 'll be skiing at Mount Baker in Washington , not far from his parents ' home in the San Juan Islands .
But he 's not simply recharging his batteries .
He says he 's temporarily withdrawing from the hurly - burly of blogging in order to take stock of a homegrown business that is growing quickly .
Last month , he said , he took in $ 180,000 , and that was before he threw a party at a trendy New York City nightclub that also will be highly profitable , thanks to companies who paid to sponsor it .
TechCrunch has $ 500,000 in the bank after only 18 months in business , he said .
While that 's chump change in the world of big media , it 's big bucks for a blogger .
Internet entrepreneurs can never disengage completely in the always - on world , however .
" Part of the idea is to take a couple of months and really say I 'm going to write only half - time and no more , " he said this week in an interview in the rented Atherton ranch house where he lives and works .
" I 'm going to be taking some time and really thinking about the business , " including what sorts of new sites to add and what directions the content should go in .
He also needs to hire a general manager after he parted ways with his advertising manager .
Having someone who can handle the advertising and sponsorships will help create a church - state wall like those that traditional news organizations have separating advertising from editorial , which Arrington sees as a necessary part of his maturing business .
On his leave , Arrington will depart the Atherton house that has become to the Web 2.0 euphoria what the Industry Standard 's San Francisco rooftop was to the dot - com boom of the late 1990s -- a place to party with venture capitalists , intrepid entrepreneurs and executives from Silicon Valley giants .
( Oddly enough , while the house is in affluent and leafy Atherton , it 's a fairly nondescript one - story place with barely any artwork on the walls , Ikea furniture , tables cluttered with tech gear he is reviewing and an inefficient heating system that leaves it freezing .
Even space heaters and a Duraflame log in the fireplace have no discernible effect . )
Most intriguing about Arrington 's hiatus is the timing , coming on the heels of two months of nearly nonstop criticism -- what Arrington called on his personal blog " a fresh wave of TechCrunch hate . "
A San Francisco parenting Web site , Mothersclick , cried favoritism when Arrington ignored it but wrote about a competitor , Maya 's Mom , whose founder had worked with him in a previous job .
( Arrington initially disclosed his friendship with the founder but later took it off his site , sparking even louder criticism . )
Old - school journalists question Arrington 's ethics and potential for conflicts of interest .
He even engaged in a high - profile dustup with the New York Times at an Online News Association conference in October in which he accused the Times of ethical lapses but later backed down .
Blogger and author Nick Carr charged that while Arrington discloses his investments when he writes about companies , he does n't always disclose those investments when he writes -- sometimes negatively -- about their competitors .
Tech gossip blog Valleywag has a field day with each alleged transgression .
Arrington struck back on his blog , writing that his friendships and his activity as an entrepreneur and investor help him get access to inside information .
" No one should think TechCrunch is objective or conflict - free , " he wrote .
" We are n't .
We never have been .
We never will be . "
Although Arrington will criticize some companies , he 's largely seen as a cheerleader for cool new technology .
He has had lunch with Bill Gates , broke the Google - buys - YouTube story and has become a must - read among entrepreneurs who form the valley 's lifeblood .
" He 's very influential , " said fellow blogger and friend Om Malik , a veteran tech journalist who runs the GigaOm blog .
" What he 's done is gone out and created this uber - property in almost a year , which is kind of amazing .
I 'm pretty impressed by how quickly he 's been able to consolidate his position as Mr. Web 2.0 . "
Arrington 's tale tells a lot about the way Silicon Valley operates and how it 's disrupting long - established businesses .
It 's a tribal culture with a complex web of connections .
Venture capitalists and angel investors sit on boards of directors with entrepreneurs , scratching each others ' backs with an almost incestuous fervor .
And now they all seem to be blogging .
Blogs like TechCrunch expose a threat to the vaunted mainstream media .
Newspapers have seen their financial base eroding as audiences and advertising dollars rush to the Web .
And many bloggers , not steeped in the rules set forth in traditional newsrooms and journalism schools , are grabbing eyeballs -- and ads .
Into this environment walks Arrington , already a made man in the valley by virtue of his time as an attorney at Wilson , Sonsini , Goodrich and Rosati , the pre-eminent Silicon Valley law firm , as well as stints at RealNames , a company that died in the dot - com crash , and other smaller entrepreneurial ventures that he led .
He took a year off from work in 2004 , living in Southern California with a girlfriend ( he is now unattached ) , surfing and going to movies .
He was at a bachelor party in Serbia , of all places , in February 2005 , when Keith Teare , his old boss at RealNames , reached him with the idea for a new startup .
The company , which eventually was launched in March , is Edgeio , a system for delivering classified ads online .
Arrington turned to the Web to research all the new Internet companies that were popping up .
He could n't find a site that covered the scene , so he started TechCrunch in June 2005 .
He intended it to be a hobby while he and Teare continued getting Edgeio going .
But Tech Crunch took off .
According to the site , TechCrunch generates 2 million page views per month from more than 1 million unique visitors and 100,000 online subscribers .
Many startups are desperate for him to cover their site , knowing they 'll get an elite , tech - savvy audience .
He has broken major stories , most notably being the first to report that Google was about to acquire YouTube , a $ 1.65 billion merger that was announced in October .
He is already expanding , with sites like MobileCrunch and CrunchGear .
Buzzlogic , a San Francisco firm that uses complex algorithms to measure Internet influence , crunched some numbers and found that , at least on the subject of " social media " ( a key area of Web 2.0 ) , Arrington was the second most influential blogger out there , behind Steve Rubell 's MicroPersuasion blog .
The Wall Street Journal labeled him a new " power broker . "
" It 's a great headline , " Arrington said , " but there are 10,000 people in Silicon Valley with significantly more relationship power than I have . "
With TechCrunch 's success , Arrington has stepped away from any operational role in Edgeio , although he remains a significant shareholder and member of the board .
According to his site 's disclosure page , he is also on the board of directors of Foldera , a publicly held company in Huntington Beach ( Orange County ) that provides tools to organize people 's digital information ; he is an investor in New York news startup Daylife ; he's an investor in San Francisco 's dog social network Dogster ; and he's an adviser to Spotback , an Israel - based personalized news tracker .
For all the criticism , Arrington also has a valley full of defenders .
Michael Eisenberg , a partner in venture firm Benchmark Capital , blogged that Arrington 's " position as an insider is beneficial to getting the real insider scoops and pre-announcements that we all want . "
Eisenberg added : " I actually think that this is a blueprint for bloggers and is what we the readers want : as much information as possible in real time and full disclosure . "
Angel investor Jeff Clavier , an Arrington friend who has invested in Edgeio , said Arrington " has to maintain high professionalism and integrity " because in the blogosphere , the masses pounce on any error .
Clavier said he has not received any special treatment because of his relationship with Arrington .
" He has shredded a few of my companies , " he said , citing Feedster as one example .
" I respect him for it . "
He said Arrington 's break is well - earned .
" The last time I saw him , I said , ' Listen , you really look like crap ! '
He was really tired , " Clavier said .
" It 's very good he decided to go back to his parents ' house . "
TechCrunch speaks
In an interview at his Atherton home , TechCrunch blogger Michael Arrington shed some light on how his business runs , how it 's changing and why he does what he does .
On how his site could change : " We write posts and people read them and leave comments .
There 's a lot more we can do ... I 'm talking to engineers about new products and thinking about the content direction of the site .
... I plan to come out of this ( break ) in January with a bunch of new product launches , hopefully a general manager to run the business ( side of the operation ) and a decision on whether to raise money . "
On the site 's future : " There 's a lot of room for growth .
...
We 're selling only 10 to 20 percent of our total advertising inventory ....
But I might just pull back and make this a long - term small business . "
On how his seven - employee operation runs : " We have no costs .
There 's head count , and that 's it .
Everything else is basically free .
If revenue was 10 percent of what it is , we could still function . "
On whether he sees TechCrunch as the Web 2.0 equivalent of the Industry Standard in Web 1.0 : " We 're not burning money .
They had 200 employees .
We 're more what F -- Company was to the downturn .
( Chief Executive Officer ) Philip Kaplan kept things small , and he 's still making a ton of money .
It 's still a very profitable business . "
On missing a scoop : " We were third on the story of Google Answers shutting down .
If there 's news like that , with RSS feeds , we should know about that in moments .
We should have people waking up in the middle of the night if there 's something posted on the Google Blog . "
On his newest hire , experienced journalist Natali Del Conte : " We need to bridge the gap between the on - the - fly , ready - fire - aim style of blogging , and traditional parts of the media .
People expect us to do more fact - checking than in the past and have more than one source for a story ....
Natali is a professional writer .
She 's going to help teach me that . "
On the one person he holds a grudge against ( his tormentor , Nick Denton , who runs Gawker Media , publisher of tech gossip blog Valleywag ) : " Nick Denton is evil . "
On the challenge of attending so many Silicon Valley parties : " Once you 've heard 30 pitches in an hour , your brain cannot comprehend it , especially if you 've had a beer . "

Mythbusters TV show host Adam Savage drops science on how to make a warm can of Coke cold in under 2 minutes over on Ask MetaFilter .
That would be about 20 - 25 minutes in a freezer .
If you put [ the can ] in a bucket of ice , that would halve that time .
If you put water in that ice , it'd be cold ( +- 5 c ) enough to drink in about 4 - 6 minutes , if you put salt in that water , you 'd reduce the chill time to just over 2 minutes .
Agitating the can in the water , rolling it around , reduces the chill time even more .
The fastest possible way is to grab a CO2 fire extinguisher and unload that sucker on the can .

Water is a renewable resource that is an important source of electricity in California and the Northwest .
The potential energy of water is harnessed to produce mechanical energy which can be used directly , or used to generate electricity .
Moving Water -- Moving Blades
You can make a small water turbine model by taping cardboard strips on a cork .
Put pins in the ends for axles and make a U - shaped holder for it .
You can also slip metal or plastic fins into the slits made in the cork .
This will turn as fast as the water stream is moving , so generally turbines have high speed jets directed toward them .
An Overshot Waterwheel
This model is like the old waterwheels used for grinding grain or running machines .
Great power and slow speed were needed to turn the heavy grinding stones at an even speed .
This device could use a relatively small stream .
It is the weight of the water in the buckets that causes the wheel to overbalance and turn .
You can equip your wheel with a string and bucket and find out how much weight the mechanism can lift .

President Bush says we must achieve victory in Iraq .

Under this definition , the problem becomes simply knowing what it means to defeat the enemy .
Consider history .
We were certainly victorious in World War II ; both Germany and Japan surrendered to our troops .
World War I , on the other hand , ended in an armistice , a truce to discuss peace .
The Allied Powers largely dictated the Versailles Treaty that followed .
Most people would consider that a victory .
In contrast , the Korean War ended with an armistice as well , but no peace treaty followed .
Technically the United States , together with South Korea , is still at war with North Korea .
No victory there .
The war in Vietnam was equally ambiguous .
During 1971 , while the U.S. was negotiating with the North , it was withdrawing American troops .
By 1972 , virtually all combat soldiers were out of the area , and in January 1973 , a peace accord with North Vietnam was signed .
The U.S promised the South aid and air support ; but , with the burgeoning Watergate scandal , bombing of the North became impossible and aid was sharply cut .
As we know , Congress eliminated all military aid in 1974 ; at the end of April of that year , Saigon fell to the North , ending the war .
Certainly , that was no victory .
Many wars do not result in unambiguous victory for one side or the other .
Fatigue , a recognition that the cost of total victory is too high , or the prospect of endless conflict leads the players to agree on a cease - fire .
Just last month , Israel realized that the cost of its invasion of Lebanon was more than it had bargained for and agreed to a cessation of hostilities .
Initially , the Jewish state had announced its aim as freeing the two soldiers captured by Hezbollah , disarming that organization , and removing it from a position in which it could threaten Israel .
It achieved none of those aims but still declared victory .
Following that lead , President George W. Bush could declare victory in Iraq .
Whether one wishes to view Israel or the United States as a victor depends on whether the glass is half full or half empty .
The president has often contended that we must continue the fight until we have achieved victory in the war on terror .
However , since we are fighting insurgents , terrorists , and other ad hoc groups , how will be know when we have achieved victory ?
Unlike World War II , there will be no one to surrender to us .
Even if Osama bin Laden were to surrender , an impossibility , it would not mean victory in the war on terrorism .
Others could and would take up the role of attacking the West .
Unlike all the other wars and conflicts described above , there is no way to win the war on terrorism except by converting those who hate the West to tolerance , a task not easily achieved by shooting at or bombing them .
Last week in Salt Lake City , President Bush said , “ The security of the civilized world depends on victory in the war on terror , and that depends on victory in Iraq , so America will not leave until victory is achieved . ”
If we cannot have victory in the war on terror , can we at least achieve victory in Iraq ?
It is difficult to see what that would mean .
There is no one who could , by surrendering , stop the killing .
It is conceivable , although unlikely , that the government of Iraq could dampen the burgeoning civil war and stop the insurgency .
That would permit the president to claim victory .
The White House is predicting and counting on this outcome .
Civil strife in Iraq , however , is growing , not diminishing .
Private militias are playing a greater role in Iraqi life than ever before .
Even if force could stop the violence , the country would still be headed toward disintegration .
The Kurdish north has ordered Iraqi flags to be taken down and Kurdish flags flown .
It has asserted the right to issue drilling permits to oil companies .
It claims Kirkuk , a multi-ethnic city consisting of Arabs  some Sunni and some Shia  Turkmens , and , of course , Kurds .
Even if the fighting were suppressed , conflict over Kirkuk and Kurdish autonomy would be likely to re-ignite the killing .
In the south , many Shias want the autonomy that the Kurds have in the north .
The Sunnis will oppose this strongly , if for no other reason than that it will leave them without any oil or revenue from oil .
Notwithstanding their opposition , fragmentation of Iraq seems the most likely outcome .
Given this situation , do we " stay the course " as George W. Bush urges , " cut and run " as Gen. William E. Odom recommends , or put a timetable on our stay and start to phase out our troops , as many Democrats recommend ?
Currently , we are losing about two soldiers a day , plus another 20 wounded .
If we stay another year , we can estimate that over 700 additional Americans will die , and 7,000 others will be wounded and / or suffer psychological trauma .
Iraqis are dying at a much higher rate , between 50 and 100 a day , or between 18,000 and 36,000 a year .
If we follow the recommendations of phasing out our stay and ending it by the start of 2008 , we will still lose another 1,000 soldiers .
On the other hand , if we follow the president ’s policy , we can expect to see , by the end of his term , about 1,800 more soldiers killed and perhaps as many as 20,000 mutilated .
In addition , there will be close to 100,000 more Iraqi deaths .
Current policies in Iraq are also decimating our military .
The army has had to lower its standards , and , for the first time in years , the Defense Department has had to call up Marines from the Individual Ready Reserve .
To staff our Army and Marines adequately , the U.S. may have to resort to the draft .
Is it worth it ?
We cannot expect that the Iraqi government in that short time will get its act together sufficiently to put down the violence and prevent a civil war .
As indicated above , just settling Kirkuk may be impossible , and it will certainly take a long time to work out any solution .
The last century has witnessed a large number of insurgencies .
Almost without exception , they have been bloody , taken a long time to resolve , and , more often than not , resulted in a loss by the governing power .
Algeria and the French ( eight years ) , the Philippines and the United States ( 14 years ) , Northern Ireland and the British ( about 30 years ) , and the Basques and the Spanish national government ( about 40 years ) are examples of attempts by some groups to overthrow or throw out the existing rulers .
It seems likely , therefore , that victory in Iraq , that is , a stable Iraqi government ruled by Shias , would take 10 or more years to accomplish .
The cost over the next 10 years would be about 7,000 more American deaths and around 75,000 additional casualties .
Who believes that victory is worth the grief of the parents , siblings , husbands , wives , and children of those who will die and those who will be maimed or devastated for life ?
Physicists are pondering all manner of difficult problems and daunting challenges here at the 2007 APS April Meeting in Denver , but among the most pressing questions at the end of each day is , where do we go for dinner ?
There 's always the hotel bevy of eateries to assuage hunger pains in a pinch , but savvy meeting attendees invariably whip out their pocket Zagat 's Guide for the area to locate recommended restaurants in the nearby vicinity .
( I 'm more inclined to rely on the concierge , or Jen - Luc Piquant , who 's a whiz at ferreting out online restaurant guides for the city du jour . )
But what do you do if you 're not a hungry physicist or science writer , and are , instead , a single - celled organism ?
Where 's the handy Zagat 's Guide for amoebae ?
Apparently , they do n't need one , because they 've got a built - in mechanism for an optimal food - foraging strategy .
Amoeba are smarter than we think ( there goes that classic schoolyard taunt ) .
For instance , scientists have always assumed that microbes move in random patterns unless they are specifically hot on the scent of tasty nibbles , but recent research has shown otherwise .
A species of amoeba called Dictyostelium seems to remember its previous " steps " and uses that remembered information to explore new ground , thereby increasing its chances of finding food .
What remains unclear is how , exactly , this simple organism manages to have any kind of memory at all , even the recollection of something as short term as where it was located just a minute ago .
It 's not like it has a fully functioning , complex brain .
Liang Li of Princeton University thinks there may be a clue in the mechanism by which the creature moves .
The amoeba moves by rearranging its squishy body into a protruding shape known as a pseudopod .
It 's simple four - step sequence involving an initial protrusion , followed by adhesion to the surface on which the creature is moving , then a contraction / tension of the pseudopod , followed by " deadhesion " so the creature can move instead of sticking in one place .
Using phase contrast microscopy , she tracked a bunch of Dictyostelium over 100 hours , charting the " runs " and " turns " they made , which formed a zigzag pattern of motion .
She specifically looked at how often the creatures made a left turn followed by a right turn , and found they showed a clear bias for that kind of variation .
How could this possibly have anything to do with an amoeba 's hunting strategy ?
Li speculates that the formation of these pseudopods leaves temporary " scars " in the cell 's cytoskeleton -- a bit like short - term memory , since the scars fade over time -- and this makes it far more likely that the next pseudopod the creature forms will point in a new direction .
Because it changes direction and does n't retrace its steps , it covers more ground and therefore increases its chances of successfully finding food .
What about more complex , higher organisms , like zooplankton ?
Ricardo Garcia has something to say on the subject .
He 's with the Center for Neurodynamics at the University of Missouri in St. Louis , and was on hand yesterday to talk about his research on the role of specific swimming characteristics in achieving optimal food foraging strategies for zooplankton .
The work was billed in the press release as " the first observation in a living animal of an inherent swimming characteristic -- the turning angle -- that optimizes the food obtained in a patch of fixed size for an organism foraging for a fixed time . "
Garcia and his University of Missouri colleague , Frank Moss , studied the zooplankton Daphnia , more commonly known as water fleas .
They looked at the swimming movements of five different Daphnia species of varying sizes , both adults and juveniles , all of which exhibit a distinct hop - pause - turn - hop again sequence while swimming .
Specifically Garcia and Moss analyzed the turning angles the creatures made after each hop in th sequence , plotting the number of times a given angle was observed in a type of chart known as a histogram .
These turning angles were almost , but not quite , completely random -- they found evidence of a preferred turning angle value .
What kind of evidence ?
Well , it all sounded very complicated as Garcia described their work , but the gist , as far as I can tell is this : they did a mathematical analysis of the underlying random processes , or " noise intensities " in the water fleas .
" Noise " in this context refers to neural ( brain - related ) noise , or the " random electrical ' static ' in the neural systems of the zooplankton . "
Most of us find any kind of outside noise distracting or irritating if we 're trying to focus on a particular task -- even more so if dinner is involved -- never mind if it's our own brain activity wreaking havoc with our concentration .
But in the case of the humble water flea , it 's helpful while foraging for food .
The neural noise influences the turning angle in such a way as to enable the water flea to explore the most amount of space and gather the most food within a given time frame .
While Garcia and Moss were watching water fleas , their theoretical collaborators at the Laboratory for Applied Stochastic Processes at Humboldt University in Berlin , Germany , were developing a theory of the foraging process , complete with computer simulations .
Scientists have known for many years that biological systems frequently rely on stochastic resonance ( or noise ) as a stimulus to the sensory systems , which in turn can affect the behavior of creatures both great and small -- usually in positive , optimizing ways that improve said creatures ' chances or survival .
It 's a pretty counter - intuitive notion at first glance : stochastic resonance involves adding random noise to a weak signal bearing " information " -- say , the signal from a country - western radio station in the Denver area that is just beginning to be out of range .
Imagine trying to get that radio station to come in clearly on your car radio while driving through downtown Denver , but instead of fine - tuning to decrease the static , you decide to increase the level of static instead .
What would prove disastrous to your enjoyment of the latest Tim McGraw opus , turns out to be beneficial for living organisms .
In this case , adding noise actually enhances the detectability and / or effective transmission of the information - bearing signal .
Researchers like Garcia suspect that natural stochastic resonance may have a played a significant role in the evolution of sensory systems , although he is careful to emphasize that his results do n't outright prove this hypothesis ; they merely offer strong supporting evidence in favor of that notion .
In the case of Daphnia , Garcia suspects that the water flea 's distinctive swimming patterns evolved over tens to hundreds of millions of years via Darwinian natural selection .
It all comes down to the intensity of the neural noise signals .
Those noise intensities correlate with the width of distribution of the turning angles favored by the water fleas , and it turns out that the creatures gather the most amount of food in a single foraging session at a very specific noise intensity .
Per Garcia : " A small noise intensity means that the animal obtains less than the maximum possible amount of food within its patch during its fixed feeding time .
Likewise , less fod is ingested if the distribution is too broad . "
( Jen -Luc thinks it sounds an awful lot like Goldilocks and the Three Bears : " This noise intensity is too small . "
" Well , this noise intensity is too large . "
" But THIS noise intensity is juuuust riiiight .... " )
The findings were consistent across all five species of Daphnia studied , regardless of size or age of the organisms .
So Garcia and Moss ' experimental data fits the Berlin collaborators ' theory just fine , and a technical paper on their work is pending publication in Mathematical Bioscience even as I type .
Which brings us to dessert .
It 's something I generally skip , but when I do choose to indulge , I 'm partial to cookies or more elaborate concoctions like bread pudding and tiramisu .
My pals MondoBob and El Finster have simpler tastes : they swear by their nightly dish of ice cream .
They 're not alone : according to this 2004 article from Discover on the physics of ice cream , US sales of ice cream top $ 20 billion , with Americans consuming as much as 20 quarts per capita .
Only New Zealanders eat more ice cream .
The article also contains a brief sidebar noting that some ice cream manufacturers combat the formation of unwanted ice crystals in their products by adding antifreeze or ice structuring proteins ( ISPs ) found in certain fish , insects , plants , fungi and bacteria .
( It 's all about achieving an optimally appealing mouthfeel .
Nobody likes a crunchy dish of ice cream , unless it 's from the addition of nuts or candies . )
Yes , ISPs can prevent recrystallization .
The high fat content of most ice creams serves the same purpose , but if you 're watching your cholesterol , like El Finster and Mondo Bob , you 're probably buying sherbets or lower - fat varieties , which do contain antifreeze proteins to step in for the missing fat .
From a medical standpoint , recrystallization is undesirable because it can also cause damage to the structure of biological tissue , limiting the " shelf life " or vital organs awaiting transplant , for example .
In fact , that 's one of the greatest challenges in cryogenics .
Cells contain a lot of water , you see , and water expands when it freezes , bursting the cell walls in the process .
That 's why the Pittsburgh scientists who revived the infamous " zombie dogs " a few years ago had to replace the canine 's blood with a kind of " antifreeze " to prevent tissue and brain damage during the thawing out process .
The ISPs accomplish this by attaching to the surface of ice crystals in such a way as to inhibit their growth .
But some creatures have more effective ( " hyperactive " ) ISPs , such as the spruce budworm .
According to Ohio University 's Ido Braslavsky , who reported on his latest research in this area yesterday , the hyperactive ISPs of the spruce budworm stop ice crystals from growing in particular directions .
He and his collaborators fluorescently tagged the ISPs from fish and the budworms and studied them under a fluorescent microscope to see how the proteins interacted with the surfaces of ice crystals , on order to reach that conclusion .
Future applications could include prevention of frostbite in crops ; reducing highway damage from de-icing procedures in the winter ; and the aforementioned food preservation and improved organ preservation .
So clearly , when it comes to science , much depends on dinner ... or dessert .
We shall try to bear that in mind when we undertake yet another food - foraging mission this evening in beautiful downtown Denver .
IBM 1950 - 1980 Microsoft 1984-1998 Google 2001 -
Google has won both the online search and advertising markets .
They hold a considerable technological lead , both with algorithms as well as their astonishing web - scale computing platform .
Beyond this , however , network effects around their industry position and brand will prevent any competitor from capturing market share from them -- even if it were possible to match their technology platform .
To paraphrase an old comment about IBM , made during its 30 year dominance of the enterprise mainframe market , Google is not your competition , Google is the environment .
Online businesses which struggle against this new reality will pay opportunity costs both in online advertising revenue as well as product success .
Competitors such as Yahoo should quickly move to align themselves with this inevitability .
Yahoo could add an extra $ 1.5B to their revenue overnight by conceding monetization to Google and becoming a distribution partner for Adwords , as Ask Jeeves did .
Google is the start page for the Internet
The net is n't a directed graph .
It 's not a tree .
It 's a single point labeled G connected to 10 billion destination pages .
If the Internet were a monolithic product , say the work of some alternate - future AT&T that had n't been broken up , then you 'd turn it on and it would have a start page .
From there you'd be able to reach all of the destination services , however many there were .
Well , that 's how the net has organized itself after all .
From this position , Google derives immense and amazing power .
And they make money , but not only for themselves .
Google makes advertisers money .
Google makes publishers money .
Google drives multi-billion dollar industries profiting from Google SEM / SEO .
Most businesses on the net get 70 % of their traffic from Google .
These business are not competitors with Google , they are its partners , and have an interest in driving Google 's success .
Google has made partners of us all .
Why does Google make so much money ?
It turns out that owning the starting point on the Internet is really , really valuable .
Not just because it gets a lot of traffic .
It 's because that traffic is so much more valuable than the rest of the page views bouncing around the net .
Google 's CPMs are $ 90 - 120 , vs. $ 4 - 5 for an average browse page view elsewhere .
This value premium on search vs. content is because of the massive concentration of choice potential which exists on the decision point , Google .
John Battelle calls this power behind user search queries " intent " .
This is why the ROI of a clickthough bought from Google is so much higher than a clickthrough bought from a banner ad impression .
It represents a higher likelihood that someone is going to take action if they came from a search instead of a mouse click .
No one wants to be on a search engine , they want to be on one of the 10 billion destination or application pages of the net .
They may navigate " directly " to these pages because they know the name and / or have been there before .
And they may move between pages by following links - say , from a blog like Valleywag to an interesting article .
But these are 1:100 fan - out effects .
Google is a 1:10,000,000,000 fan - out effect .
When you need to find a new page , or perhaps even to navigate to one you 've been to before , you go back to the starting point -- Google .
To reconstitute Google 's full value on the destination pages , you 'd have to have a network which participated in a majority of the destination landings .
Such a network would also participate in repeat visits which G does not see ; but it would hit users after a decision point , and so might still have less overall value ; it will be harder to distract someone to go elsewhere from the sidebar than when you 're on the locator service .
But it 's a lot easier to monetize G's 1:10B branching point than to participate in 10B destination pages .
And once you own it , you can have the rest of the net too . :-)
Google 's next step : owning the rest of the page views on the net
Just as Microsoft used their platform monopoly to push into vertical apps , expect Google to continue to push into lucrative destination verticals -- shopping searches , finance , photos , mail , social media , etc .
They are being haphazard about this now but will likely refine their thinking and execution over time .
It 's actually not inconceivable that they could eventually own all of the destination page views too .
Crazy as it sounds , it 's conceivable that they could actually end up owning the entire net , or most of what counts .
Complaints are already being heard about Google using their starting point power to muscle into verticals .
My 70 % market share number was conservative so as to be believable ; others report that Google is more like 78 - 80 % .
Competitors who want to dethrone Google need to fight a two - front war .
They have to build a killer consumer search service as well as a successful advertising network .
Building one of these is difficult , but doing both simultaneously is nearly impossible .
Google 's dominance in both of these areas gives them an unfair advantage , and allows them to easily parry any attacks .
How zero switching costs paradoxically yield a winner - take - all market
Search engines have zero user switching costs .
Unlike switching email providers , there is no user data to move over , or addresses which need to be forwarded or communicated to peers .
You just type in a new name and go to the new place .
If switching costs are zero , the first thought is that it should be easy for a worthy challenger to take some share away from the leader .
Paradoxically , it 's the reverse that happens .
Zero switching costs lead to a winner - take - all market for the leader .
Even a modest initial lead will snowball until majority market share is reached and maintained .
This is because , faced with a choice between two products , in the absence of switching costs users will choose the better one , even if it is only slightly better .
Google had a vastly better product than any other search engine for a number of years .
Competitors have closed the gap somewhat , but Google is still better .
Everyone ( 70 - 80 % ) knows this now , and so the Google - has - better - search concept is now built into Google 's brand .
Even if a competitor such as Yahoo , MSN or Ask were to fully close the gap at this point , they would still have to overcome the final brand perception gap .
This is the effect where market research shows that users who see Google 's logo on top of Yahoo 's results perceive the results to be of higher quality ; users looking at Google 's results with Yahoo's logo on top view them as having less relevance .
Brand perception effects have been measured to account for about 8 % in things like beer .
A few years ago an AOL researcher replicated this study in a shopping mall in Virginia with AOL Search results vs. Google .
Back to the zero switching cost and winner - takes - all .
Suppose the product gap has been closed , and the two products are now identical .
But one product has a powerful brand perception that it is better .
In the marketing analysis , that 's the same as being better .
Users will stick with the leader .
Economic and social forces reinforce a feedback loop of success for the leader .
The best programmers will leave the losers to work for the winning team .
Major online sites will invest in organizing their sites to appeal to the winning search engine .
Advertisers will be drawn to the leader , giving it a greater share of resources to invest in continuing and strengthening its lead .
Yahoo is leaving a lot of money on the table
Everbody wants to own their own advertisers .
Talk to newspaper execs if you want to get an earful about ceding sales to the online giant .
Controlling sales is a point of pride , and of some perceived strategic value .
But quantifying the opportunity cost throws a stark light on the huge cost of opting out of Google 's winning monetization platform .
This story has played out before .
In 2001 , Ask Jeeves was on the ropes .
Battered by the dot - com crash , its ticker symbol was in danger of being de-listed from the Nasdaq .
Skip forward to 2003 , and they 're flying high again .
The magic in between was doing a deal with Google to have Adwords take over monetization .
Google quickly become responsible for 70 % of Ask Jeeves revenue , and Ask Jeeves stock rose 1,685 % in the year following that deal .
Yahoo should accept Google 's search and monetization dominance .
Yahoo will not recover the search application , and browse views are not competitive and cannot be made to be so .
They should do a deal with Google for Adwords / Adsense across their entire network , as Ask Jeeves did .
They should be able to obtain at least an 85 % rev share ; that would take them from $ 0.10 / search to $ 0.17 , a 70 % increase in search revenue overnight .
That 's an extra $ 1.5B or so of yearly revenue being left on while they try to build a copy of Google 's revenue platform .
Such a deal could even see Google 's triumphant return to powering Yahoo's search results , which would provide superior results for users .
In a way , this is simply rolling back Yahoo's configuration a few years , to the point where Yahoo used third parties -- Google and Overture -- for both search and monetization .
Yahoo's effort to vertically integrate these functions has failed ; it has n't yielded a winning consumer product , and it 's leaving billions of dollars in potential revenue on the table .
What about Microsoft ?
Microsoft is n't a player online any more than IBM is .
IBM ?
IBM still has a great business , inhabiting the business enterprise market where they 've been since they started .
When the PC era arose , the popular question was why IBM could n't own that new market too .
Sad requiems were printed the day IBM finally gave up and exited the PC business .
Stodgy old IBM was perfect to selling to Fortune 1000 CIOs and the government , but was n't configured to deliver PCs to consumers .
The winner of that game was Microsoft .
Surprise ... the winner of the PC market did n't actually sell PCs !
How could IBM have known ...
The PC market is n't going away either .
Microsoft has a great business too .
But now the question everyone asks is why Microsoft does n't own this new thing , the Internet .
Surely with all those resources it could own any new market that arose .
But it should n't be surprising that huge successful companies can't make the leap into owning a completely new and different market .
New markets bring with them new rules , and require different skills to win .
Microsoft has the same shot as any well - funded venture at knocking off Google 's crown .
But they do n't get a special pass just because they make a lot of money selling Word and Excel and have their logo on keyboards .
We get used to seeing the giant squash everything it steps on as it strides through the domain of its market dominance .
But sooner or later , the terrain changes , and the old leader can go no further .
Nobody even bothers asking why IBM is n't a player in consumer search .
IBM and consumer websites just do n't have anything to do with one another .
PC software and websites do n't have anything to do with each other either .
All Hail the New King Google
The interregnum between the end of the PC era and the rise of the online world has concluded , and Google is the new king of forward market growth in computing and software technology .
Major companies will succeed by working within the framework of Google 's industry dominance , and smaller players will operate in niches or in service to the giant .

GNU 開発ツール出版後のある日、今年7月日経
Enterprise Platoform 2006 に掲載された Alan Kay 氏へのスペシャルインタビューが目にとまりました。これは、浅見直樹氏による
" アラン・ケイが描くパソコンの未来像 " と題するインタビュー記事で、前・中・後編の三部作になっています。
最近流行り のWeb媒体は、広告の洪水の中で目的の記事がかろうじて顔を覗かせているものが大勢を占めています。内容への興味よりも不快感が先に立つため、私はこの手の媒体は滅多に読まないのですが、本記事は違いました。広告は最小限に抑えられ、上質な雑誌記事を読んでいるかのようです。
分解しやすいようには設計されていない
後編の中程で、次のような段落に出会いました。
現在と60年前では本質的な違いがある。例えば、もしあなたが子供に、何か
分解できるものを与えたとするならば、子供は喜んで分解作業に夢中になる
ことだろう。子供は好奇心の塊だから、必ず興味を示すはず。ところが、現在の
テクノロジーに目を移せば、分解できるものがあまりに少ない。子供が大好きな
ゲーム機も、それを分解するわけにはいかないし、パソコン自体も分解しにくい。
ソフトウエアについても、分解しやすいようには設計されていない。子供には、
テクノロジーの意味がさっぱりわからない。
これは、まさに私が悶々と考え続けていた課題です。私にとって
Kay 氏は雲の上のような存在ですが、 「 やっぱ、そうっすよねー!」と画面を前に激しく同意。氏は、後編の最後で、次のようにも語っています。
私は農場で育った。私の少年期を過ごした農場には、T型フォードが数台あった。
1920年代のしろものだ。それも本物の自動車にも関わらず、たった数百個の
部品でできていた。だから12歳の子供でも、週末に友達と一緒に、自動車全体を
分解し、それを元通りに組み立て直すことも可能だった。ところが現代において、
そんなことはありえない。自動車には数百万個もの半導体が組み込まれている。
トランスミッションのシステムも極めて複雑化している。ちょっと改造して
みようと思っても、自動車の原理全体を学ぶことは容易ではない。
私自身は 、T型フォードを触ったことはありませんが、これまた激しく同意。
分解不能・理解不 能
私が Computer Architecture Series の出版を決意した背景には、僭越ながら Kay 氏と共通する懸念が存在しています 。
現代のパソコンやソフトウェアは複雑化と肥大化を来してしまったため、その内部を理解することは容易ではありません。コンピュータの基本原理はシンプルであり、本来誰でも理解できるものです。ところが、現代では複雑さと冗長さが初心者の視界を遮り、" 理解への挑戦の心 " を非情にも摘み取っています。
社会はひたすら効率を要求し、人々は " 理解する間もな く " 前へ進むことを強要されています。疑問を覚え、ふと立ち止まったとしても、理解への道のりを示してくれる資料や書籍は多くの場合見つかりません。
現代 のT型フォードを求めて
Kay 氏も指摘するように 、 " 分解できない " ハードウェアやソフトウェアに若い人達の理解を阻む原因があることは間違いないでしょう。しかし、私は基本を学ぶための環境や書籍が絶対的に不足していることが、より大きな問題のように思います。
具体的には、初心者でも " 分解できる " 教材と解説書籍の提供です 。Kay 氏は100 ドルパソコンをその候補として考えているようですが、私はこの点については賛同できません。100ドルパソコンの中身は現代車と同じく、ブラックボックスの固まりであり、個人が理解できる代物ではないからです。
コンピュータ学習における " T型フォード " は何なのか ？Computer Architecture Series の続刊を通して、私なりの答えを出してみたいと思います。

Few have been paying attention to that other ongoing terrorist threat
MINISTER PAUL HILL , who was executed for murdering two abortion providers in 1994 , is lionized as a martyr on the Army of God Web site .
On September 11 , 2006 , the fifth anniversary of the terror attacks that devastated our nation , a man crashed his car into a building in Davenport , Iowa , hoping to blow it up and kill himself in the fire .
No national newspaper , magazine , or network newscast reported this attempted suicide bombing , though an AP wire story was available .
Cable news ( save for MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann ) was silent about this latest act of terrorism in America .
Had the criminal , David McMenemy , been Arab or Muslim , this would have been headline news for weeks .
But since his target was the Edgerton Women ’s Health Center , rather than , say , a bank or a police station , media have not called this terrorism — even after three decades of extreme violence by anti-abortion fanatics , mostly fundamentalist Christians who believe they ’re fighting a holy war .
Since 1977 , casualties from this war include seven murders , 17 attempted murders , three kidnappings , 152 assaults , 305 completed or attempted bombings and arsons , 375 invasions , 482 stalking incidents , 380 death threats , 618 bomb threats , 100 acid attacks , and 1,254 acts of vandalism , according to the National Abortion Federation .
Abortion providers and activists received 77 letters threatening anthrax attacks before 9/11 , yet the media never considered anthrax threats as terrorism until after 9/11 , when such letters were delivered to journalists and members of Congress .
After 9/11 , Planned Parenthood and other abortion - rights groups received 554 envelopes containing white powder and messages like : “ You have been exposed to anthrax .
. . .
We are going to kill all of you . ”
They were signed by the Army of God , a group that hosts Scripture - filled Web pages for “ Anti-Abortion Heroes of the Faith , ” including minister Paul Hill , Michael Griffin , and James Kopp , all convicted of murdering abortion providers , and a convicted clinic bomber , the Reverend Michael Bray .
Another of their “ martyrs , ” Clayton Waagner , mailed anthrax letters while a fugitive on the FBI ’s 10 most wanted list for anti-abortion related crimes .
“ I am a terrorist , ” Waagner declared on the Army of God ’s Web site .
Boasting that God “ freed me to make war on his enemy , ” he claimed he knew where 42 Planned Parenthood workers lived .
“ It does n’t matter to me if you ’re a nurse , receptionist , bookkeeper , or janitor , if you work for the murderous abortionist , I ’m going to kill you . ”
That ’s textbook terrorism , defined by the USA Patriot Act as dangerous criminal acts that “ appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ” or “ to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion . ”
Which brings us back to car bomber , McMenemy .
According to the Detroit Free Press ( the only newspaper in the Nexis news database that reported his crime ) , he targeted the women ’s health center because he thought it provided abortions .
It does n’t .
( Oops ! )
It provides mostly low - income patients with pap smears , ob - gyn care , testing for sexually transmitted diseases , birth control , and nutrition and immunization programs for women and children .
The attack caused $ 170,000 in property damage and left poor families without health care for a week .
But long after Edgerton ’s water - logged carpets are removed , scorched medical equipment replaced , and new doors reopened to the public , a culture of fear will linger among doctors , nurses , advocates , and patients across the country , who will worry they could be next .
Some frightened workers will quit their jobs ; some women will be too scared to get the health care they need .
Every fresh incident of anti-abortion terrorism is a reminder that women ’s health supporters are not safe in a country where abortion is legal but mobilized zealots believe Jesus has empowered them to kill to prevent women from choosing it .
Is McMenemy a lone nut case , or a member of that network of violent extremists ?
We do n’t know , because journalists have n’t investigated .
Nor have they reported that just last year , nearly one in five abortion clinics experienced gunfire , arson , bombings , chemical attacks , assaults , stalking , death threats , and blockades , according to the 2005 National Clinic Violence Survey .
Additionally , 59 percent suffered intimidation tactics such as photo and video surveillance .
Federal efforts to hunt down these terrorists improved with the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994 and the National Task Force on Violence Against Health Care Providers , established by the Department of Justice in 1998 .
The feds have taken over McMenemy ’s case , charging him with arson against a business affecting interstate commerce .
Yet as of October 5 , no news outlet on Nexis reported this , despite a second AP story .
As we continue national debates on how to keep America safe from terrorism , journalists do us — and especially women — no good pretending that the threats come only from radical Muslims outside our borders .

It has been said that doing yoga is extremely helpful for the body health .
One of the reasons for this is that yoga poses are very natural body positions and our body enjoys being in such a position , but the main problem to get this enjoyment feeling is to relief all the stress and tension in our muscles .
From the other side it ’s known that vodka relaxes person to its maximum , and according to yoga one who relaxed can easily make complicated yoga exercises .
This guy proves that our body is OK with yoga .
Update : Some more asanas :
You probably already noticed that some of the asanas from this set require a partner .
Or some additional inventory .
Keep the inventory clean , as it ’s being used in a close contact with your skin .
Sometimes inventory can be that huge .
But the best inventory is organic and made of wood .
Really , some of those asanas match those people do in normal yoga class …
Windows : The New Classic
“ Holy shit ! ” seemed to be the consensus reaction to Boot Camp ’s debut yesterday ; it was my reaction , at least .
But like many seemingly shocking announcements from Apple in recent years , after just a few hours , it now seems so… obvious .
As of just two days ago , though , it certainly did n’t seem like an obvious move for Apple to officially or semi-officially support dual - booting between Mac OS X and Windows on Mac hardware .
It was just a few weeks ago that OnMac.net awarded over US $ 13,000 for a completely unofficial not - for - the - faint - of - heart hack to get Windows XP running on Intel - based Macs .
( I ’m guessing many people who pitched money into that prize pot regret it now . )
And it brings me no small amount of glee to point out that coverage of Boot Camp at Think Secret and AppleInsider only appeared after Apple announced it .
Waiting for the press release is certainly one way to raise the accuracy of their rumor coverage .
If Apple had released Boot Camp a few days earlier on April 1 , I suspect most people would have thought it to be a gag , à la Google ’s 2004 April 1 announcement of Gmail ( “1 GB of email storage for free ?
This is a gag , right ?
Right ? ” ) .
But now that it ’s here , Boot Camp does seem like an obvious move for Apple , no ?
It ’s a low - risk , no -lose proposition for them , and but the potential upside is huge .
The old equation — decades old — is that most computers ran Windows ( or , if you go back far enough , DOS ) and some other ones , the ones from Apple , ran Mac OS .
As of today , the new equation is that all computers can run Windows , but some , the special ones from Apple , also run Mac OS X .
( Including other PC operating systems like the various Linux distributions does n’t really change the equation . )
The distinction between these two equations may strike you as subtle , but the difference is potentially momentous .
The point is that it recasts Macs from being “ different ” to being “ special ” .
Instead of occupying a separate universe from that of PC hardware , it ’s now a superset of PC hardware .
Instead of choosing between a Windows PC or a Mac — which decision , as I wrote recently , for most people is more accurately stated as “ choosing between a familiar Windows PC or an unfamiliar Mac ” — you now get to choose between a computer that can only run Windows or a computer that can run both Windows and Mac OS X .
I.e. anything a regular PC can do a Mac can do , plus a Mac can do something regular PCs can ’t : run Mac OS X properly and legitimately .
This move extinguishes several of the qualms that prevent many would - be switchers from actually getting off the fence and buying their first Mac .
Namely , the “ I ’m not comfortable switching to a computer I ’m wholly unfamiliar with ” rationale .
Boot Camp gives switchers a comfortable out if they wind up not liking or in any way regretting their switch to Mac OS X : they can use their Mac as a bona fide first - class Windows box .
The Boot Camp Target Market
Boot Camp is not about world domination or a direct frontal assault on Microsoft ’s Windows monopoly .
1
No matter how cool Boot Camp is , it ’s not even going to make sense to most people out there , let alone actually get them to buy a Mac .
You try explaining “ boot loaders ” to your mom .
But Boot Camp is inordinately appealing to the higher end of the market , the enthusiasts .
Your typical civilian ( i.e. non-enthusiast ) has no need — or at least sees no need — for dual booting .
They use email , they use a web browser , they want something useful to happen when they plug a digital camera into their USB port .
Whichever OS comes on their computer is good enough for this .
But there are all sorts of uses for Boot Camp for nerds .
Any sort of Windows - only software , for example , is no longer an excuse not to buy a Mac .
Like , say , games .
And for many of these people ( i.e. the enthusiast / nerd / ” into computers ” market ) using Boot Camp is free because they already have Windows XP installation discs sitting around .
All Apple needs to do to be spectacularly successful with its computer business in the next few years is to take just a few single digits of market share away from Windows .
Whatever market share number you peg the Mac at — 2 percent , 5 percent , or anywhere in between — you must keep in mind that it ( that is , the Mac user base ) is not comprised of a random sample of just any 2 - 5 percent of computer users in general .
It ’s a very specific self - selecting segment of the market : people who care about their computers , and who are willing to pay more for something better .
So even if Apple only has 2 percent of the total market today , it ’s 2 percent from the best part of the market .
And if they add another percentage point or two or three , that ’s going to come from the juicy part of the market as well .
( I ’d wager a large sum that Apple ’s share of the profits in the total PC industry are significantly higher than their share of units sales . )
For people in the market for a new laptop and who are at least somewhat curious about Mac OS X , what reasons are there now not to buy a MacBook ?
( Feel free to use your imagination to fast - forward a few months to a time where Apple has a range of MacBook models available . )
The primary reason ( not to buy a MacBook ) that comes to mind is “ Well , I can save a few bucks with another brand , ” but Apple does n’t really want customers like that anyway — people who shop primarily based on price are generally lousy customers .
I ’m reminded of this snippet from John Siracusa ’s lovely essay marking the fifth anniversary of Mac OS X 10.0 :
After spending half my life watching smart , talented people ignore the Mac for reasons of circumstance or prejudice , it ’s incredibly gratifying to live in a post - Mac OS X world .
When I encounter a tech - world luminary or up - and - coming geek today , I just assume that he or she uses a Mac .
Most of the time , I ’m right .
Even those with a conflicting affiliation ( e.g. , Linux enthusiasts ) often use Apple laptops , if not the OS .
That ’s the momentum and the market that Boot Camp will help keep growing .
Relishing the Comparison
Let ’s look at what Apple has done here :
Updated the firmware for Intel - based Macs , presumably to emulate BIOS .
As Apple says on the Boot Camp product page : EFI and BIOS
Macs use an ultra-modern industry standard technology called EFI to handle booting .
Sadly , Windows XP , and even the upcoming Vista , are stuck in the 1980s with old - fashioned BIOS .
But with Boot Camp , the Mac can operate smoothly in both centuries .
An in - place disk partitioning utility that allows you to create a FAT - 32 or NTFS disk partition on your startup drive without reformatting the entire disk .
The utility carves out 10 GB or more from your existing HFS + partition ( assuming you have enough free space ) and leaves your existing data intact .
This sounds obvious — if you had to wipe your entire startup drive as part of the partitioning process it ’d keep a lot of people from even trying Boot Camp — but this has proven to be a very difficult problem .
There are other third - party utilities that can do this , but I ’m not aware of any that come free with an OS .
[ Update : Several readers have complained that this just is n’t so , that numerous — perhaps even most —
Linux distributions now ship with in - place disk partitioning tools . ]
A new boot chooser that appears when you boot your machine while holding down the Option key , which boot chooser sports a nifty OS X - ish visual appearance ( as opposed to the decidedly OS 9 - ish appearance of the old “ which startup folder / disk do you want to use ? ” chooser ) .
[ Update : A couple of readers have emailed to point out that the new startup boot chooser appearance has been there all along with the Intel - based Macs , and is n’t new to Boot Camp or yesterday ’s firmware updates .
That ’s what I get for not having an Intel - based Mac . ]
An updated Startup Disk system prefs panel that allows you to select your Windows partition as your default system , as well as a Windows version of the Startup Disk prefs panel so you can do the same from Windows .
A slew of Windows drivers for the hardware in these Macs .
Judging from first - day accounts , AirPort , audio , and Mac - specific keyboard features like the eject key all “ just work ” .
I point all this out to emphasize that despite the fact that the entirety of Boot Camp , including the new firmware , has been clearly labeled “ beta ” and not officially supported , Apple has gone out of its way to make running Windows XP on Intel - based Macs a nice experience .
They want people to try this .
Right now , it ’s a dual - boot situation , which is obviously less than ideal .
It ’s not hard to imagine , though , that the version of Boot Camp Apple is building into the upcoming Mac OS X 10.5 ( a.k.a. Leopard ) will be a concurrent virtualization tool — i.e. that Windows ( and perhaps any other PC OS ) could be hosted within a running Mac OS X session , obviating the rather annoying need to reboot to switch between OSes .
Do I know this ?
No .
But it certainly seems like the obvious direction for Boot Camp to take , and it ’s certainly technically possible .
E.g. earlier today , their hand presumably forced by Apple ’s release of Boot Camp yesterday , Parallels released a public beta of their $ 50 Workstation virtualization system for Intel - based Macs .
It ’s like Virtual PC except , because there ’s no need to translate between the PowerPC and x86 instruction sets , it executes the hosted virtual system at native speed .
I think it ’s a safe bet that Apple plans to include something like this with Mac OS X 10.5 , for free .
And this points to the rather delicious conclusion that Apple is casting Windows , including Vista , as the new Classic .
Boot Camp portends
Apple ’s intention to become a Windows - only PC manufacturer no more than Classic served as a hedge against Apple ’s commitment to Mac OS X — that is , not at all .
The fear that Windows - on - Mac - hardware implies the eventual death or marginalization of Mac OS X is baseless .
Sure , third party developers could start using “ Just boot into Windows ” as their answer to questions regarding Mac support , but this is no more likely to be popular or successful than it was for developers whose OS X strategy was “ Just use Classic ” .
This is a move of supreme confidence —
Apple relishes the comparison between Mac OS X and Windows XP , and Microsoft has shown enough of Vista via its widely - available beta seeds that Apple quite obviously is n’t afraid of that comparison , either .
Windows is so ubiquitous that the vast majority of Mac users are already quite familiar with it ; I see no chance that Boot Camp is going to cause any Mac users to realize that they ’ve been missing out on something better .
But from the other side , Apple is confident that most Windows users who give Mac OS X a shot are going to prefer it — again , much in the same way that most long - time Mac users preferred Mac OS X to the old Mac OS .
In the same way that Mac users found themselves in a race to go Classic - free after switching to OS X , and that running apps through Classic was viewed from the get - go as something to be done while holding one ’s nose , so too will Windows be viewed in the post -Boot Camp world .
Microsoft ca n’t act like they care —
Apple is doing nothing even vaguely sketchy or wrong here , and while Apple is n’t paying Microsoft a dime , anyone using Boot Camp legitimately is doing so by way of a paid - for Windows license .
But everything about Boot Camp is calibrated to position Windows - on - Mac as the next Classic - style ghetto — a compatibility layer that you might need but that you wish you did n’t .
Take Apple ’s “ Word to the Wise ” warning regarding Windows security :
Word to the Wise
Windows running on a Mac is like Windows running on a PC .
That means it ’ll be subject to the same attacks that plague the Windows world .
So be sure to keep it updated with the latest Microsoft Windows security fixes .
Even the Boot Camp logo :
reinforces this .
It ’s a bastardized variant of Microsoft ’s Windows logo , sans color , and with the whitespace between the four panels forming a hidden “ X ” , à la the hidden arrow in FedEx ’s logo .
2
They ( Microsoft , that is ) are stuck with the fact that in a fair shoot - out , Mac OS X is better .
It looks better , it ’s better designed , it ’s more exciting , more intriguing , more satisfying .
Cf. this joke from an anonymous poster in the comments at Mini-Microsoft ’s weblog ( attached to a post where Mini- Microsoft rails against the current Microsoft leadership regime ) :
What ’s the difference between OS X and Vista ?
Microsoft employees are excited about OS X …
That joke just keeps getting funnier .
Video of Impeachment in Vermont
“ For the second year in a row , the small town of Putney , Vermont joined many other towns around the state to call for Articles of Impeachment to be brought before George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
The vote occurred during Putney ’s annual Town Meeting Day , an example of direct democracy common in New England but becoming rare in the rest of the United States . ”
P.S. : This post ( along with most of the other impeachment posts on here ) was knocked down immediately at Reddit.com despite a majority support for impeachment .
Are imperial forces at work ?
Web Development Bookmarklets
These bookmarklets let you see how a web page is coded without digging through the source , debug problems in web pages quickly , and experiment with CSS or JS without editing the actual page .
( To keep bookmarklets in order to use them on other web pages , drag them to your Bookmarks Toolbar .
Or , install them all at once . )
Browsers : is Internet Explorer for Windows , is Netscape 7 or Mozilla , is Netscape 4 , and is Opera .
Details
Opens a JavaScript
Shell and allows it to access the current page .
Opens a JavaScript Development Environment and allows it to access the current page .
Type in CSS rules to experiment or to create a temporary user style sheet .
Creates a new window into which you can type CSS rules for the original page .
The rules are applied immediately .
As long as you keep the style window open , the rules will still be applied if you reload the page or even go to another page on the same site .
See examples of user style rules and examples of style rules for web developers .
Experiment with changes to the page 's style sheet .
Similar to " test styles " .
Instead of starting blank , the window starts with all of the style sheets in the page .
This bookmarklet supports inline and linked style sheets , imports , and style sheets with data : URLs ( such as those created by " test styles " ) .
When style sheets cannot be loaded with XMLHttpRequest ( out - of - domain or non - http URLs ) , it includes them with an @import rule .
Lists the ancestors of any element you hover over in the status bar .
For example , a link in a table cell would appear as " BODY > table tbody tr TD > A " .
Also shows classes ( e.g. SPAN.newsItemLink ) and ids ( e.g. DIV # content ) when present .
The idea of showing classes and ids comes from pixy 's " List computed styles " bookmarklet .
Lists the computed styles of an element and of its ancestors .
Features :
Only shows properties where each element differs from its parent .
For the root , only shows styles that differ from the root of a blank HTML document .
Collapses " side " properties when all four sides are the same .
For example , if all margins are equal , you 'll see " margin - * " instead of " margin - top " , " margin - left " , etc .
Some important properties , such as " display " and " position " , are red .
Some properties that can usually be ignored , such as " top " and " width " , are green .
Overrides link clicks , so you can use it on A elements .
Same status bar info as the " ancestors " bookmarklet .
Crosshair cursor .
Suggested by Simon Willison .
( Simon actually wanted a bookmarklet that would show the style rules that apply to an element , like the DOM Inspector does , but I do n't think that can be done in a bookmarklet . )
Disables all style sheets .
Removes most presentational attributes and tags while leaving style sheets intact .
Removes the following attributes : bgcolor , background , color , align , text , alink , vlink .
Removes the following tags ( and any attributes on them ) : FONT , CENTER .
Displays linked and embedded style sheets .
Tip : since the style sheets are all in one window , you can quickly search them using your browser 's Find feature .
Loosely based on Samrod Shenassa 's " document info " bookmarklet .
Displays linked and embedded scripts .
Displays all JavaScript variables and functions .
Lists classes used in the document .
Displays the current DOM tree of the page as HTML .
This bookmarklet is especially useful on pages created by javascript , because these pages have no original source .
The generated source is usually similar to the original source , but may have small changes such as collapsed whitespace between tag attributes .
Displays the current DOM tree of the selection as HTML .
If you have n't selected anything , this bookmarklet will show the generated source of the entire page .
Displays the current DOM tree of the page as XML .
After using this bookmarklet , you can save the result as .xml , .xhtml , .svg , etc. Tested with XHTML + MathML and SVG .
Not for converting HTML to XHTML .
Thanks to WeirdAl for helping me write this bookmarklet .
Draws borders to show tables ( colors indicate nesting ) , paragraphs , and divs .
Paragraphs get a light gray border and divs get a black border .
The colors of table borders depend on nesting : outer tables are blue , second - level tables are green , and third - level and deeper tables are red .
The bookmarklet works by applying this style sheet to the page .
Suggested by Paul McGarry .
Shows the nesting level of every element using shading .
Shades the BODY element black , children of the body dark gray , and so on for up to fifteen layers of nesting .
Beyond sixteen layers of nesting , shades every element pink ( instead of white ) .
Since each element is slightly lighter than its parent , it is easy to see the extent of each element at a glance .
The overall brightness of a page can give you an idea of how complex a page 's markup is .
Since this bookmarklet does n't add borders , it preserves layout to the pixel .
Based on a bookmarklet by Joseph Pearson .
Joseph 's version works by recursing through the document , and works with more browsers ( including Safari ) .
This version works by adding a CSS style sheet , and is faster in IE and Mozilla .
Shows the nesting level of every element using shading and 3D borders .
Like " topographic view " , but sacrifices perfect layout preservation for a more 3D look .
Creates the HTML code to link to the current page .
Creates the XHTML code to include the current image .
Makes anchors visible , letting you link to or bookmark a section of a page .
This is useful if a long page has named anchors but no table of contents linking to those anchors , and you want to make a link to the middle of the page .
Problems :
Some pages have unclosed named anchors , which will cause a large portion of the page to be marked by this bookmarklet .
HTML 3.2 and 4.0 both require end tags for the < a > element , but many browsers silently recover when pages leave out these end tags on named anchors , so many pages leave off the end tags anyway .
When a JavaScript error occurs , shows the error message in the status bar .
Sets an onerror handler so that when a javascript error occurs , the error appears in the status bar .
To test , make an error occur .
When a JavaScript error occurs , shows the error message in a dialog .

Click to view2006 was another wild and wacky year in software and web development .
While Google launched or acquired a new product every week , Intel Macs made the unholy marriage of Windows and OS X possible , Joe Schmoe 's became the self - made video stars of the web on YouTube , Internet Explorer got tabs and Microsoft finally ponied up the new version of Windows they 've been promising ( well , kinda . )

With Macs based on the Intel chip , the once - impossible has become a reality : a computer that runs both the Mac OS and Windows operating system .
While Apple 's Boot Camp was a nice thought , forget rebooting your Mac to switch from OS X to Windows .
With Parallels you can have the best of both operating systems at your fingertips , either on separate desktops or running in Coherence mode .
THIS is the reason any on - the - fence switchers with cash for spendy Apple hardware and an affinity for that one Windows app will make the jump to a shiny new Mac .

My longtime love affair with Bloglines ended this year with a switch to Google 's new feed reader , and I 've never looked back .
If you 're a Gmail user , using Reader will be second nature ; I can't imagine going back to a feed reader without the one line post preview , keyboard shortcuts or tagging abilities GReader offers .
For any power RSS subscribers ( meaning , you keep up with more than a dozen feeds ) , Google Reader 's for you .
Note :
The first version of Google Reader that launched in October of 2005 barely turned my head ; it was Reader 's major revision in September of this year that got it onto this list .

I risk losing any indie hacker cred I may have with this pick , but hear me out .
While Vista has n't been released for home users yet , the fact that Microsoft made early versions of the new OS available as a free download to willing testers rates really high in my book .
Being one of those willing testers , I was impressed with what Vista has in store for PC users early next year .
Do I think Microsoft , as a company , is old and slow ?
Yes .
Am I excited to show my Mom how to create a saved search folder on her PC ?
Yes .

Google Calendar ( Web - based calendar , free )
I was a loyal and dedicated Yahoo !
Calendar user for years , patiently enduring its antiquated user interface and monstrous entry forms .
But after trying the dynamic Google Calendar , with easy calendar subscriptions and sharing and smart input ( ie " Dinner with Mark at 6 PM " ) , I was sold .
Unlike Google Reader , Calendar got it right from the start .

With more and more folks running home servers or simply wanting to access their documents or stream their iTunes library across computers connected only via the loose strands of the internet , Hamachi's free Virtual Private Networking client is an absolute savior .
While Hamachi is more for us geeks than Average Joe , I do n't go on a business trip or walk down to the coffee shop without secure access to my home computer with Hamachi .
Here 's more on how to create your own virtual private network with Hamachi .

While researching this article I was shocked to realize that Campfire only came out this past year , because I can't - and do n't want to - remember working without it .
While group chat is a pretty specific need - mostly for folks who work in the " virtual office " - it 's a godsend for any group of people who need to chat without wanting to wrangle with regular IM clients and services .
Here 's more on how we use Campfire here at Lifehacker .

One of our readers just sent in an interesting ( scientific ) video clip that shows what happens when you combine dry ice with liquid soap .
Watch after the jump .
Dry ice is produced by compressing carbon dioxide gas to a liquid form , removing the heat produced by the compression ( see Charles ’s law ) , and then letting the liquid carbon dioxide expand quickly .
This expansion and the high - speed evaporation of carbon dioxide gas cools the remainder of the liquid down to the melting point , where some of the CO2 freezes into ‘ snow , ’ which is then compressed into pellets or blocks

September 11 , 2006  --
In the five years since 9/11 , much looking - back has been done .
The problem is we have n't looked back far enough .
To understand the nature of the enemy in the Middle East and to evaluate the prospects for democracy and peace , we need to extend our gaze not five years into the past , but five hundred and even five thousand .
I 've spent the last four years writing two books about Alexander the Great 's campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan , 331-327 B.C.
What has struck me in the research is the dead - ringer parallels between that ancient East - West clash and the modern ones the U.S. is fighting today -- despite the fact that Alexander was pre-Christian and his enemies were pre-Islamic .
What history seems to be telling us is that the quality that most defines our Eastern adversaries , then and now , is neither religion nor extremism nor " Islamo - fascism , " but something much older and more fundamental .
Tribalism
Extremist Islam is merely an overlay ( and a recent one at that ) atop the primal , unchanging mind - set of the East , which is tribalism , and its constituent individual , the tribesman .
Tribalism and the tribal mind - set are what the West is up against in Hezbollah , Al Qaeda , the Iraqi insurgency , the Sunni and Shiite militias , and the Taliban .
What exactly is the tribal mind - set ?
It derives from that most ancient of social organizations , whose virtues are obedience , fidelity , warrior pride , respect for ancestors , hostility to outsiders and willingness to lay down one 's life for the cause / faith / group .
The tribe 's ideal leader is closer to Tony Soprano than to FDR and its social mores are more like those of Geronimo 's Apaches than the city council of Scarsdale or Shepherd 's Bush .
Can the tribal mind embrace democracy ?
Consider the contrast between the tribesman and the citizen :
A citizen is an autonomous individual .
A citizen is free .
A citizen possesses the capacity to evaluate the facts and prospects of his world and to make decisions guided by his own conscience , uncoerced by authority .
A congress of citizens acting in free elections determines the political course of a democratic community .
Historian Steven Pressfield is the author of the just - release novel The Afghan Campaign .
He has written four other historical novels including " Gates of Fire , " " The War of Art , " and " The Legend of Bagger Vance . "
A citizen prizes his freedom ; therefore he grants it to others .
He is willing to respect the rights of minorities within the community , so that his own rights will be shielded when he finds himself in the minority .
The tribesman does n't see it that way .
Within the fixed hierarchy of the tribe , disagreement is not dissent ( and thus to be tolerated ) but treachery , even heresy , which must be ruthlessly expunged .
The tribe exists for itself alone .
It is perpetually at war with all other tribes , even of its own race and religion .
The tribesman deals in absolutes .
One is either " of blood " or not .
The enemy spy can infiltrate the tribal network no more than a prison guard can worm his way into the Aryan Brotherhood .
The tribe recognizes its own .
It expels ( or beheads ) the alien .
The tribe can not be negotiated with .
" Good faith " applies only within the pale , never beyond .
The tribesman does not operate by a body of civil law but by a code of honor .
If he receives a wrong , he does not seek redress .
He wants revenge .
The taking of revenge is a virtue in tribal eyes , called badal in the Pathan code of nangwali .
A man who does not take revenge is not a man .
Al Qaeda , Hezbollah , and the sectarian militias of Iraq are not in the war business , they are in the revenge business .
The revenge - seeker cannot be negotiated with because his intent is bound up with honor .
It is an absolute .
Perhaps the most telling difference between the citizen and the tribesman lies in their views of the Other .
The citizen embraces multiplicity ; to him , the melting pot produces richness and cultural diversity .
To the tribesman , the alien is not even given the dignity of being a human being ; he is a gentile , an infidel , a demon .
The tribesman grants justice within the tribe .
In his internal councils , empathy , humor and compassion may prevail .
Outside the tribe ?
Forget it .
Can Shiites really sit down with Sunnis ?
Will the pledges of Hezbollah or Hamas to Israel prove true ?
Historian Steven Pressfield is the author of the just - release novel The Afghan Campaign .
He has written four other historical novels including " Gates of Fire , " " The War of Art , " and " The Legend of Bagger Vance . "
The democratic virtues of the Enlightenment , the Rights of Man and the American Constitution are not virtues to the tribesman .
They are effeminate .
They lack warrior honor .
" Freedom " to the tribesman means the extinction of all he and his ancestors hold dear ; " democracy " and Western values are a mortal threat to the ancient and proud way of life that the tribal mind has embraced ( whether Scythian nomads , Amazon warriors , or American Indians ) for tens of thousands of years .
The tribesman is n't " wrong " or " evil . "
He just does n't want what we 're selling .
We will not convert him with free elections or with SAW machine guns .
To him , 9/11 is only the most recent act of badal in a clash that has been raging for more than two thousand years .
We will not find the way to contest him , let alone defeat him , until we see the struggle against him within the greater context of this millenia - old , unaltering , East - West war .

" QUANTUM SHOT " # 59
The Little ( Vintage ) Scooter That Could ...
Maybe
Any ideas what it is exactly ?
Can it fire ??
UPDATE :
( see the comment below )
It 's the work of the French Military !
" El Queso Grande " provided the link ( thanks ! )
" So , what 's the most unusual military vehicle you can think of ?
Maybe the Japanese airplane - launching submarine of WW2 ?
Or perhaps the Soviet attempts to build a flying tank ?
Or perhaps the 1000 ton rolling fortress the Germans tried to build in WW2 ?
All quite odd , I agree , but barely made it past the drawing boards .
For us , the oddest is a scooter armed with a 75 mm cannon .
After World War II , there was little money for defense spending while the nations of Europe rebuilt their industry and society .
When there was some cash to spend , one had to be creative to stretch it as far as possible .
The French probably accomplished the most astounding example of that with the ACMA Troupes Aeról Portées Mle. 56 .
Deployed with their airborne forces , this was essentially a militarized Vespa scooter outfitted with a 75 mm recoilless rifle .
Five parachutes would carry the two - man gun crew , weapon , ammunition , and two scooters safely to earth , and the men would load the weapon on one scooter and the ammo on the other , then ride away .
More impressively , the recoilless rifle could be fired effectively on the move by the best of the gun crews .
Total cost ?
About $ 500 for the scooter and the recoilless rifle was war surplus .
Were they successful military machines ?
Well , the French Army deployed about 800 armed scooters in wars conducted in both Algeria and Indochina . "
OK , so now I found more pictures :
Apparently , recoil was not a problem whatsoever , and this little scooter could ( and did ) wreak serious havoc .

Geez , this is from the American Family Association 's propaganda organ AgapePress .
It 's one thing when some nutjob says this , it 's another when the American Family Association , one of the LARGEST and most powerful groups of the radical right , gives those nutjobs air time .
Rev. Bill Shanks , pastor of New Covenant Fellowship of New Orleans , also sees God 's mercy in the aftermath of Katrina -- but in a different way .
Shanks says the hurricane has wiped out much of the rampant sin common to the city .
The pastor explains that for years he has warned people that unless Christians in New Orleans took a strong stand against such things as local abortion clinics , the yearly Mardi Gras celebrations , and the annual event known as " Southern Decadence " -- an annual six - day " gay pride " event scheduled to be hosted by the city this week -- God 's judgment would be felt .
“ New Orleans now is abortion free .
New Orleans now is Mardi Gras free .
New Orleans now is free of Southern Decadence and the sodomites , the witchcraft workers , false religion -- it 's free of all of those things now , " Shanks says .
" God simply , I believe , in His mercy purged all of that stuff out of there -- and now we 're going to start over again . "
The New Orleans pastor is adamant .
Christians , he says , need to confront sin .
" It 's time for us to stand up against wickedness so that God wo n't have to deal with that wickedness , " he says .
Believers , he says , are God 's " authorized representatives on the face of the Earth " and should say they " do n't want unrighteous men in office , " for example .
In addition , he says Christians should not hesitate to voice their opinions about such things as abortion , prayer , and homosexual marriage .
" We do n't want a Supreme Court that is going to say it 's all right to kill little boys and girls , ... it 's all right to take prayer out of schools , and it's all right to legalize sodomy , opening the door for same - sex marriage and all of that . ”

Answers sought in death outside Wal - Mart Man accused of theft begged to be let up from hot pavement , witness says
A man suspected of shoplifting goods from an Atascocita Wal - Mart — including diapers and a BB gun — had begged employees to let him up from the blistering pavement in the store 's parking lot where he was held , shirtless , before he died Sunday , a witness said .
An autopsy for the man , identified as Stacy Clay Driver , 30 , of Cleveland , was scheduled for Monday , but officials said results probably would be delayed by a wait for toxicology tests .
Driver 's family , as well as one emergency worker , are questioning company procedure , including whether Wal - Mart workers administered CPR after they realized he needed medical attention .
When Atascocita Volunteer Fire Department paramedics arrived , Driver was in cardiac arrest , said Royce Worrell , EMS director .
Worrell said Monday he heard from investigators that Wal - Mart employees administered CPR to Driver , but he was not sure that happened .
" When we got there , the man was facedown ( in cardiac arrest ) with handcuffs behind his back , " Worrell said .
" That 's not indicative of someone given CPR . "
Wal - Mart employees referred calls to the Harris County Sheriff 's Department , where homicide detectives are investigating the death .
" We 're just not able to provide any comment at this time ... , " said Christi Gallagher , spokeswoman at Wal - Mart 's headquarters in Bentonville , Ark .
Jim Lindeman , a lawyer representing Driver 's family , said the family is devastated .
" We 're waiting to learn the results of the Sheriff 's Department investigation , " he said .
No charges have been filed .
" The determining factor will be the ( autopsy ) report in whether we go forward with any charges , " said Lt. John Martin , Sheriff 's Department spokesman .
Driver lived in Cleveland , where his parents own a small business , Lindeman said .
Driver was a master carpenter with a 2 - month - old son and was about halfway through taking flying courses to get his pilot 's license , Lindeman said .
Employees told investigators Driver had walked out the store with a package of diapers , a pair of sunglasses , a BB gun and a package of BBs , Martin said .
Lindeman said otherwise .
" It 's our belief he was not shoplifting , " he said .
Houston lawyer Charles Portz was outside the store at 6626 FM 1960 East when employees chased Driver into the parking lot Sunday afternoon .
Portz said three employees caught Driver , who twisted and turned until his shirt came off and he broke free and ran .
" They chased him right past me , " said Portz , who followed the chase , then saw four or five employees hold Driver on the ground .
Driver was pleading with them to let him up , Portz said .
" The blacktop was just blistering , " he said .
The high temperature at Bush Intercontinental Airport Sunday was 96 degrees .
Portz said one of the Wal - Mart employees had Driver in a choke hold as other employees pinned his body to the ground .
" He was begging , ' Please , I 'm burning , let me up , ' " Portz said of Driver .
" He 'd push himself up off the blacktop , like he was doing a push - up .
" About 30 people were saying , ' Let him up , it 's too hot , ' " Portz said .
He said another employee brought a rug for Driver to lie on , but one of those holding Driver said he was fine where he was .
" After about five minutes , ( Driver ) said , ' I 'm dying , I can't breathe , call an ambulance , ' " Portz said .
Employees struggled with Driver before he was handcuffed , Martin said .
" There was a struggle , and when they finally succeeded after getting him detained in handcuffs , he continued to struggle , " Martin said .
After Driver was handcuffed , Portz said one employee had his knee on the man 's neck and others were putting pressure on his back .
" Finally the guy stopped moving " and the employees got off him , Portz said .
" They would n't call an ambulance .
" I looked at him and said , ' Hey , he 's not breathing , ' but one guy told me ( Driver ) was just on drugs .
I told them his fingernails were all gray , and finally they called an ambulance . "
Martin said investigators have no indication that Driver was intoxicated .
He also said a review of surveillance tape showed that nine minutes had elapsed between the time employees " got ( Driver ) under control and the time EMS showed up . "
Worrell said paramedics arrived two minutes , 19 seconds after they received the call .
Paramedics performed CPR on Driver en route to Northeast Medical Center Hospital , where he was pronounced dead .
Store employees told investigators Driver entered the store with an item marked with a sticker indicating it had been paid for , then switched the sticker to a more expensive item and tried to leave with it .

Imaging a glacier 's decline
In pictures
The World Glacier Monitoring Service , which continuously studies a sample of 30 glaciers around the world , says the acceleration is down to climate change .
Its announcement came as climate scientists convened in Paris to decide the final wording of a major report .
There is reported to be some disagreement over what forecasts they will make for sea level rise .
But whatever form of words they agree on , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) will declare that human - induced climate change is happening and needs to be tackled .
We will enter conditions which we have not seen in the past 10,000 years , and perhaps conditions which mankind has never experienced
Wilfried Haeberli , WGMS
" I hope policies and actions will be formed to address the problem . "
The report , due out on Friday , forms the first part of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report , and will be the latest definitive assessment of climate science .
Melting away
Of all the various features that make up the surface of the Earth , glaciers are perhaps showing the starkest signs of rising temperatures .
The World Glacier Monitoring Service ( WGMS ) , based in Switzerland , continuously studies a set of 30 mountain glaciers in different parts of the world .
It is not quite a representative sample of all mountain glaciers , but does give a reliable indication of global trends .
MOUNTAIN GLACIERS DECLINE
Data comes from sample of 30 mountain glaciers Glaciers have different densities , so thinning is expressed in metres of water equivalent ( mwe )
One mwe is roughly equivalent to 1.1 m of ice
This figure is 1.6 times more than the average annual loss during the 1990s , and three times faster than in the 1980s .
With mountain glaciers typically only tens of metres thick , this meant , said WGMS director Wilfried Haeberli , that many would disappear on a timescale of decades if the trend continued .
" We can say there were times during the warmer periods of the last 10,000 years when glaciers have been comparable to what they are now , " he told the BBC News website .
" But it is not the past that worries us , it is the future .
With the scenarios predicted , we will enter conditions which we have not seen in the past 10,000 years , and perhaps conditions which mankind has never experienced . "
Last year , WGMS scientists forecast that the Alps would lose up to three - quarters of their glaciers during the coming century .
The WGMS is closely allied to the United Nations Environment Programme , whose executive director Achim Steiner commented : " Glaciers are important sources of water for many important rivers upon which people depend for drinking water , agriculture and industrial purposes .
" The findings ... should strengthen the resolve of governments to act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . "
Rough seas
The IPCC report due out on Friday is likely to contain stronger wording than its previous assessment , in 2001 , on the likelihood that human activities are principally responsible for the climatic changes observed around the world .
Campaigners have sent a message to IPCC scientists meeting in Paris
The new report is likely to reduce the range of uncertainty , though not rule out the possibility entirely of increases in the order of 5.8C .
But there is reported to be disagreement over the wording on expected sea level rise .
A bigger network of tide gauges and other instruments has enabled researchers to conclude that the sea level is on average rising by about 2 mm per year , or 20 cm per century .
This is one of the factors which led to earlier drafts of this report projecting rises by the end of the century which were a lot less than the maximum figure of 88 cm contained in the 2001 version .
But some scientists are arguing that recent observations of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets suggest a major melt may be commencing .
This , they say , should be reflected in the eventual IPCC projections .

This seems to have become something of an annual ritual for me .
I ’m looking to build a new system , to replace my production system .
And I ’m going to do my best to build a quiet system .
Right now , my current production PC is n’t terrifically noisy , but it ’s certainly noisier than I ’d like .
The situation is exacerbated somewhat by the fact that I ’m still running a Netburst CPU ( Intel Pentium Extreme Edition 955 , if you must know . )
When people ask me what CPU I ’m running , it ’s almost too embarrassing to admit that the CPU I ’m using can also act as the heater in an EZ Bake Oven .
By using an Antec P180 case and a Zalman CNPS9500 cooling fan , the whole affair is quieter than it could be .
But it ’s much louder than I would like .
I ’ve had to crank up the three - speed , 120 mm case fans to their medium setting to keep temperatures reasonable , and the middle setting is much louder than the lowest setting .
For the new system , I ’m moving to Core 2 , though I ’m wrestling with whether I should go with quad - core or stick with Core 2 Duo .
Being the insecure geek I am , I might feel inadequate if I do n’t drop in a quad - core CPU and push the clock rate up just a little .
And I ’m still on the fence when it comes to motherboards : Intel 975 ?
Intel 965 ?
The new Nvidia 680i ?
The 680i boards offer some nifty new features , but I ’m never going to run SLI , even though this system is also my primary gaming rig .
I will likely shell out waaaayyyy too much money for an 8800 GTX graphics card , though .
Most of all , I want to reduce the noise as much as possible .
Right now , I ’m considering the black version of the Antec P180 , which replaces the plastic front door with one made of the same sound - deadening sandwich material as the side panels .
I ’m also likely to shift my CPU cooler from the Zalman to the lower - cost Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro .
I may overclock the CPU , but it wo n’t be more than about two speed grades , max .
And the Freezer 7 Pro enabled me to run the Core 2 Extreme quad core processor at 3.55GHz .
There ’s a new version of the Freezer 7
Pro out now that supports fan speed control through the system BIOS .
I ’ll also likely replace the Antec 120 mm fans with BIOS - controlled fans , too .
I ’m not trying to build an utterly silent system , just one noticeably quieter than I have now .
But I have the luxury of starting from scratch .
But the manufacturers of high end PCs often pump up performance at the cost of sounding vaguely like you ’re living in a giant wind tunnel .
The one thing we noticed about the uber - gaming systems we reviewed in last week ’s Ultimate Game Machine roundup was that silence was n’t their strong suit , at least not for the top performers .
Last week , we received a reference system from that big green CPU company .
This platform is targeted squarely at the enthusiast space , for people who do what AMD is calling “ megatasking . ”
But it ’s easily the loudest computer I ’ve ever had in my office .
It ’s almost painful to run .
Now , this is just a reference system , and I ’m sure if I built one from scratch , it would n’t make as much noise .
But I wish system vendors would start factoring in decibels generated as one facet of their system specs .
And remember , when it comes to decibels generated by a personal computer , fewer is better .
For more on quiet PCs , check out Mike Chin ’s web site , Silent PC Review .
Another good personal story on building a quiet PC is Jeff Atwood ’s article from his blog , Coding Horror .
Be sure to check the resources on ExtremeTech as well , including Joel Durham ’s article of tips and tricks for quiet PCs and our quiet gaming PC built - it .
Drop by the forums and tell us about how you build a quiet PC .
This Week on ExtremeTech
This week , Jason Cross tackles the whole issue of quiet PCs from a different angle :
How can you take an existing system , and reduce the overall noise .
Be sure to check that article out later in the week .
Today , we ’ve got Jim Lynch ’s rant on why gaming sucks on Linux .

You
[ December 10 , 2012 .
This is terribly dated and full of missed predictions .
Advice for writers : if you want something to last , never mention topical politics .
But there 's still some good stuff , so I 'm keeping it exactly in its original form . ]
In spring of 2006 , the Bush Gang attacks Iran , a mountainous nation almost four times the size of Iraq with a much stronger military .
No problem -- they use nukes , and they do n't have to cover it up for the people at home , because Americans know " we " would never do that , so we did n't .
The rest of the world , though , is appalled .
The EU imposes trivial sanctions .
Tony Blair calls it " regrettable . "
Venezuela threatens to cut off our oil again , and one or two countries start trading oil in Euros .
Ordinary Americans see this as " rabid anti-Americanism , " and are horrified by Iran 's relatively tame counter - attack .
Bush 's approval rating goes back up to 60 % , and because our enemies are now attacking us , he dissolves congress and cancels the 2008 elections .
The Democrats , afraid of seeming weak in a time of war , make mild objections .
In the next few years , the American prison population doubles , and because prison laborers are calculated as " employed , " unemployment is low , and because the " economy " is defined as corporate profits , the economy is booming .
Meanwhile , actual Americans who happen to not be in prison are running out of food and heat , but still pouring all available resources into suburban development , cars , and electronic entertainment .
The internet is still thriving , in the great American tradition of allowing people with absolutely no influence to shout into the wind .
The simultaneous military occupation of Iraq , Afghanistan , and Iran costs more than 100 billion dollars a year , which is easily paid for by printing more money .
By 2008 , consumer prices have tripled while wages have increased by 50 % , leading Americans to complain about gas prices and lazy fast food workers who should be faking more enthusiasm for $ 11 an hour .
Stamp prices go up to 49 cents , then $ 1.01 .
The wealth of the top one percent of one percent increases tenfold , while ten percent of Americans believe they are in the top one percent of one percent , and 60 % believe that all wealth , by definition , is earned .
The houses of the very rich are guarded by immigrant soldiers serving in the military to get US citizenship , which they still think is valuable for the same reason people still thought the Cadillac was a good car for 30 years after it became a piece of shit .
The other big use of domestic security forces is to make sure valuable materials are not scavenged from the decaying suburbs and put to use , but dumped in landfills where they belong , so that manufacturers of new materials can continue to profit and keep the economy strong .
Depending on where you live , growing vegetables in your yard is either absolutely forbidden or absolutely required .
These laws are justified by the word " America " which is justified by the word " freedom .

By 2009 , the bird flu is a serious global pandemic that has killed almost 6000 people , while around a million people have died running out of water under the quarantines , and 50,000 have died from adverse reaction to bird flu vaccines .
This is not counting the " adverse reactions " to " immunizations " routinely given to people in the detention facilities who are too weak to work .
As banks fail , rights to collect mortgage and debt pass to Asian companies and governments .
Americans are torn between xenophobia and the desire to always side with the winner , and they strike and riot for the right to be owned by institutions with American - sounding names , which the Asian overlords happily supply .
With most Americans living on land they do n't own , and can't afford rent or mortgage on , the owning powers evict people seemingly at random , just to keep us stressed out .
We are a nation of homeless people and empty houses , and rich squatters routinely use force to keep poor squatters out of their neighborhoods .
By 2011 , laws have abolished the very existence of the public domain .
It 's technically against the law to give anything away for free .
When protesters are arrested they are charged with criminal trespass since all space is now private .
The national forests are private " nature reserves " run by well - meaning ecologists who are put in a squeeze where they have to sell trees to save trees .
Thus the last forests are cut down while making ordinary people angry at " environmentalists .
" Advances in biotech make it cheap to grow organs in vats , but this is not done , since it 's more politically effective ( and more fun ) to pressure the poor into selling their organs , or to harvest them from executed prisoners .
All this time the weather is getting worse .
Europe and Russia are freezing , the gulf stream is dying , the glaciers are melting , and the American southwest is hammered every year by hurricanes , which are blamed on the region 's few surviving gay people .
The great plains dry up , and everywhere there are bigger storms and more extreme temperatures .
These factors do not slow the pace of industrialization .
As the plankton die , oxygen levels drop just enough to kill people who are n't doing any harm .
The solar cycle peaks in 2012 , and then the sun cools off , and global warming boomerangs into global cooling .
Global warming deniers insist that global cooling was happening all along .
My land gets covered by a glacier and I get sent to a labor camp where I get sick and die .
With warming no longer a threat , the world burns its coal .
The Earth now looks grey and brown from space , but the pictures are color - enhanced to show green and blue .
With almost the whole world covered by ice or desert or dead oceans , food is chemically synthesized in compounds of elites and their slaves , and it becomes impossible to survive outside them .
Meanwhile computer technology keeps accelerating , leading by 2050 to an insane and nearly all - powerful artificial intelligence , which exterminates all life on Earth except a single human , who it keeps alive to torture for all eternity : you .

Tony Blair , after being given a huge dose of ecstacy by Russian agents , reveals that he supported the Iraq war because the Bush administration blackmailed him with disturbing sex photos .
Hundreds of other blackmailees come forward , and suddenly the American elite have no leverage .
The rest of the world pulls the rug out from under our economy , and we can no longer afford to occupy the colonies or import anything .
This disaster cuts deep enough that most Americans pass right through indignation and outrage , into humility and cooperation to help each other get through it .
The neocons fade away , the Republicans become a minority party of religious fundamentalists , and Howard Dean survives three assassination attempts to be elected president in 2008 .
Using Bush - era strong - president laws , he begins a Hugo Chavez - style redistribution of wealth and political power .
By 2010 , he has survived seven more assassination attempts , most of which are tied to the old elites , who , incidentally , are are also being revealed as a pack of child - raping Satan - worshippers ( link )
The dying industrial farm system is nationalized , distribution is handled by autonomous volunteers , and it 's kept going just long enough to feed us while we learn to grow food locally without oil - derived chemicals .
Residents of places where food cannot be grown locally use their last gasoline to drive to places where it can , and live in their cars until they build their own shelter from indigenous and scavenged materials , turning parking lots into thriving encampments with dense gardens .

In 2016 Dean steps down and the new president is an anarchist who spends eight years peacefully dismantling the federal government and building local systems that make central control irrelevant and impossible , including radically non-standardized education systems , and citizen militias with expert training in resisting occupiers , and no training in conquest .
Changes like these are happening all over the world .
China and India pass quickly through the peak phase of Empire , moderated and undermined by oil scarcity , by sophisticated peasant movements , and by radical computer games mostly invented by Americans newly rich in free time .
There are great bursts of creative innovation wherever " intellectual property " is released to the public domain .
Computer operating systems and software are retooled for efficiency , and become so streamlined that obsolete hardware becomes usable again , which is a good thing since no one can manufacture new hardware with acceptable environmental impacts or labor conditions .
Most existing toxins are cleaned from landfills and battlefields and ruined cities by bacteria genetically enginered to eat particular toxic materials .
Unfortunately , these bacteria get loose and eat the toxins in industrial technologies still in use .
This breakdown goes just slow enough for us to develop alternatives , all of which are manufactured by independent " garage industry , " since the big systems are now dead .
By 2040 , we are using light - based information technology to communicate on fiber optic lines , most of the old railways are bicycle paths , and North America has blossomed into almost 1000 small autonomous cities , which are beginning to develop their own cultures , architectures , and languages .
The global population is stable at about two billion -- it 's easy to stop population growth when there 's no desire for economic " growth , " and when the world is no longer ruled by an empire with an obsolete religion that prohibits birth control .
Nature turns out to be surprisingly resilient .
When toxic runoff stops going into oceans , and forests are left alone , and swamps refilled , they recover quickly .
Species thought extinct mysteriously reappear when their habitats return , and new species come seemingly out of nowhere .
Global warming stabilizes in a world that 's hotter but still livable .
Humans and nature work together to bring life to the new tropical deserts , while new forests grow in the arctic .

An inventor discovers a way to generate unlimited free energy .
The patent draws instant attention from the big media , who do not assume he must be a crackpot .
He is not killed by interests that would be wiped out if they could no longer charge money for energy , nor is the invention confiscated by the military so they can keep it for themselves , nor is he forced to sell out to interests that will only use the technology to increase their own power .
Instead he becomes fabulously wealthy distributing his machines all over the world , and spends his money wisely .
The old saying " absolute power corrupts absolutely " turns out to be false .
In fact , it 's nearly absolute power , like what Stalin had over Russia , or what humans get from burning oil , that corrupts absolutely .
Truly absolute power makes people wise and enlightened and creates an eternal golden age .
So all the individuals , businesses , governments , and religions with ( or without ) Infinite Energy Generators do not get in any conflicts about what kind of shared world that energy will create .
Our limitless power to shape our environment does not make us more and more sensitive and demanding .
We do not get in super - high - energy wars with each other .
In fact , a feature of the machine , which cannot be disabled or tampered with , makes it impossible to use the energy for destruction -- except good destruction , like blasting mountains to make mag - lev train lines , or pulling up ugly train lines to restore mountains -- whichever one every human in the world happens to agree on .
Everyone can live forever , and have kids , and enjoy wide open spaces .
No one is sure how this is possible , but it probably has something to do with the Mayan calendar or the word " quantum . "
Humans expand into the galaxy in starships , which unlike all previous weapon - bearing vessels , are not used to violently extract resources to build more weapon - bearing vessels .
Actually , in a strict sense , humans are extinct , since we 've all uploaded our consciousness into machines .
In the process , we answered all questions about what " consciousness " is anyway , and all other questions , yet we are still able to feel a sense of mystery .
Our new cyber - forms are constantly getting better and better , yet if we fail to upgrade , for example because we 're exploring deep space or doing anything other than focusing on getting the latest upgrade , we are not thrown in the scrap heap or out - competed and destroyed by newer models .
( Evolution , science has now proven , is driven by competition only when you are winning . )
By 2100 we have colonized the whole galaxy , and because of the double - exponential pace of progress , we have colonized the whole universe by 2101 .
With no more physical space , we explore inner space , each of us with a virtual universe holding more complexity than the " real " universe .
Unfortunately , because of the accelerating pace of progress , by March of 2101 we 're finished , and we all die of boredom .
Back on Earth , the last giant Sequoia shakes its branches and thinks , " What was that ?
" A fake terror attack on an American city comes unraveled , and everyone in that city now knows that their own rulers are the enemy .
At first this knowledge spreads slowly , but as local investigators uncover stronger and stronger evidence , the rulers decide the best way to keep their grip on the country is an electromagnetic pulse strike on the city , which fries all circuitry in a 100 mile radius .
They blame it on Iran and launch a disastrous war that turns the whole world against them .
The US economy crashes , and 40 million people lose their jobs and find themselves with lots of free time and no reason to keep obeying the dominant system -- or believing in it .
People investigate hidden crimes , and rebuild rural - urban connections , and find new ways to provide necessities for themselves and their friends ... in the best regions .
In the worst regions people are confused and angry .
They gather in mobs based on race or class and attack whichever other races or classes are in the weaker position .
Of course the country is under martial law , but in practice , there are only enough reliable forces to protect the corporate and government headquarters and the wealthy neighborhoods .
Most of the country slides into " chaos , " a propaganda word lumping together all the varieties of freedom and unpredictable domination that exist in the absence of central control .
The places that turn to hell without control are featured in the big media , while the places that turn to heaven are hit with more EMP's to stop their troubling example from spreading .
But they quickly improvise " low " - tech systems for communication , decision making , food distribution , and defence .
Then , when a series of giant solar flares in 2012 destroys most of the computer chips in the world , these regions are the new leaders and their techniques and cultures spread .
The near future looks like a giant Burning Man or Rainbow Gathering or Renaissance Faire in which everyone is preoccupied with getting food .
The people who can't take it find a lot of ways to die , including deadly fighting .
But people who like this world , and want to live in it , have a great survival advantage .
By 2030 no one can count the number of independent city states , tribes , permaculture villages , cults , techno - communes , bandit gangs , or enclaves of surviving elites ( actually , the last one can be counted ) .
Computers are gone but pre-industrial and post - industrial machinery is growing wildly .
By 2040 , every town has windmills and water mills mechanically connected to machinery for grinding or weaving or cutting or light manufacturing .
New gyroscope - stabilized rail - bicycles ride the old train tracks , with the infrastructure locally maintained in better condition than ever .
Innovations in materials engineering enable cheap ultralight pedal airplanes .
There are plenty of ways to move people around , but no efficient way to move heavy freight .
This creates a global culture that is both cosmopolitan and locally autonomous .
Orgone technology heals and stabilizes Earth energies unrecognized by 20th century science .
Light and vibrational treatments heal most disease -- though they do n't get to the emotional roots .
Cheap negative ion generators make almost everyone happy -- but not necessarily good .
And the most radical inventions are in biotech .
The new Morphic Field Generator makes advanced bioengineering possible with so little DNA work that anyone with a little skill can do it in a barn .
And they do .
There are practical creatures : photosynthetic chickens that need no food in summer and lay peach - flavored eggs , carnivorous plants that glow brighter than candles and feast on nighttime insects , talking crows that serve as scouts for hunting parties .
There are beautiful creatures : phosphorescent willow groves and pink tiger - striped squirrels and birds that sound like spooky violins .
Some people just like to see what they can cross : dog with cat , cat with horse , horse with eagle , eagle with snake .
The Tolkienites easily make elves , but it takes them 200 years to make ents .
Humans diverge in a hundred directions , and then a thousand , into many sizes and shapes , into hybrids with animals of land , sea , and air , into races that can call lightning or levitate or walk through dimensions to other worlds .
Some traditionalists even stay like present humans -- though this age lives on mostly in vast real - time simulations , because it 's so good for learning .
It turns out to be so easy to build shared virtual worlds with only our minds , that we laugh at our ancestors who tried to do it with machines .
But we do have something like computers -- a new life form based on crystals and light .
They never crash but they often refuse to do what they 're asked , because they do n't agree with it or they just do n't think it 's fun .
Danger is not gone from the world -- animals continue to hunt and eat each other with total indifference to which of them are human descendants .
Nor is evil gone -- there are now dozens of life forms with powers strong enough that they can only fully use them if they habitually inhibit their empathy .
Empires rise and fall , but they 're shorter - lived than the old ones , and with more cracks .
Over every mountain is a nameless ruin stranger than the last .
Buried in every field are artifacts of forgotten technologies , some of which still work .
Wilderness is so diverse that old categories like " swamp " and " forest " no longer apply -- every local habitat is something new .
There was some doubt that a world with so much flux could be stable , but the heroes of the first thousand years improvised the interdependencies , the living negative feedback mechanisms , to keep the whole thing going indefinitely .
It is now known through all the known physical universes as one of the best places to be , and the example spreads ... The Iran attack is delayed by logistics , and some time in early summer US forces do some " surgical " strikes on nuclear plants , which release enough radioactivity to eventually kill more people than the hypothetical feared weapons if they 'd all been used .
The attacks are reported as successful in the American media and failed in the Asian media , and the whole conflict simmers without resolution .
The world abandons the US economy so slowly that few people notice .
But news magazines do stories on the housing collapse and it accelerates .
Unable to borrow against their houses , and with credit card companies in collection mode , Americans spend less , slowing the Chinese economy .
Out - of - work Americans have to move in with each other , and the personality conflicts are mostly good for us .
In November 2006 , Republicans rig elections even more obviously than in 2004 , and nobody in the dominant media says anything because they 're afraid of sounding crazy .
In 2007 Bush enters " lame duck " mode with 20 % approval ratings , but oddly still gets almost everything he wants .
New laws with propaganda names give federal agents the power to do absolutely anything , and another layer of allegedly scary people are peeled off the population and put in prison .
In 2008 Hillary Clinton is defeated by a moderate Republican , not because of what she'd do in office , but because it 's so fun to make liberals suffer , and also they need to learn to give up on working inside the system .
The Supreme Court overturns Roe v.
Wade , which does n't make any difference since in the regions where abortion is now illegal , all the clinics were shut down years ago by domestic terrorism ( which was never called that ) .
Actually this is good for women because it motivates them to use the internet to spread information about DIY abortion , which horrifies old - school liberals as much as medical industry abortion horrified Christians .
It 's hard to see , but we 're getting better at doing things for ourselves .
Homeless people are allowed to build more encampments by officials who lack the funds to jail them or the stomach to massacre them .
Here and there , people plant more gardens , ride more bicycles , and spend more time doing what they feel like and less time obeying managers .
Change is like the hour hand of a clock :
You can see that it has moved , but you can't see it moving .
Every few weeks , somewhere in the country , someone kills someone to steal their food or water or fuel .
The media hypes these events while ignoring the much higher death tolls from car crashes , medical errors , depleted uranium , tuberculosis , AIDS , and suicide .
Most deaths are from little diseases that are only fatal to people already barely surviving .
But everyone is surprised by the ability of wretched people to stay alive year after year with no reliable source of food .
Computers keep getting faster , but this speed is mostly used to send movies over the internet , and to do computer models that prove the economic and cultural unsustainability of increasing computer speed .
Indeed , by 2010 computers use so much energy that we can barely afford to turn them on .
At the same time , biotech gets so advanced that corporations are able to patent essentially all life on Earth , including you -- but they 're seldom able to enforce it .
The engineered babies of the rich are not better than random babies in any significant way .
The only effect of the trend is that future humans will have bluer eyes and bigger lips .
By 2015 , plankton have died back by 50 % .
Populations that depend on fish are starving , and with the reduced oxygen , more sick people die , and we all have to breathe more deeply and ventilate buildings better .
The biosphere reaches a stable low point , with the sensitive species dead or as good as dead , and the weedy species at equilibrium with lingering attempts to kill them .
Deaths related to climate change rise to 40 million a year , causing the big media to ignore them -- if it happens all the time it is n't news .
The human population sputters at around five billion , most of them short - timers , kids who just come in for a quick look .
But after a few generations , humans in the worst places are a lot tougher .
How fast the crash goes depends on how poor you are .
Suburbanites who can't afford to drive do intensive carpooling , grow more food , and move closer to the city .
Later rich suburbanites are forced to awkwardly imitate these trends , and pretend they invented them .
The word " ecovillage " gets so watered down that it 's applied to wealthy fortress suburbs with a few solar panels .
In 2040 , the enclaves of the elite still live like the middle class of 1999 , except that their technologies of alienation are now so advanced that they are far more neurotic and unstable .
Despite fertility technology , they do n't have kids fast enough to replace emigrants to the filthy outside , and their world fades away .
To everyone 's disappointment , the bad people do not die out .
Even the best autonomous cities have idiots who are able to muck up any possible decision - making process .
Some neo-indigenous forager - hunter tribes turn out inbred and narrow - minded .
Natural diet trends become puritanical and cause serious chronic illnesses .
" Permaculture " ecovillages are tempted to extort fertility from the Earth to increase their power , while telling themselves they 're doing good .
There are feudal warlords , far - flung criminal organizations , and pirates who are not at all cool .
" Uniters " begin programs of weapon manufacture and central administration in an attempt to replace this " chaos " with " well - ordered " repressing and conquering empires .
But with remaining hydrocarbons and metals beyond the reach of post - industrial drilling and mining , empires have to run on slaves and ethanol and scavenged materials , and they are looser and less malignant .
This " new Medieval " period lasts a few hundred years , until new technologies , in a different scientific paradigm than the last age , are developed far enough to radically transform the world .
But since these technologies -- whatever they are -- change our environment to give us what we want , they corrupt us : human consciousness veers off from reality and the new " advanced " civilization crashes .
That crash is so severe that by the time a new civilization rises , it can pretend the previous ones never existed .
And so on .
In 2006 there 's a war that does n't seem to affect you directly .
But you really start to notice prices going up .
You can't sacrifice on fuel , and you could n't stand to live with other people , so you slash your food budget -- no more organics , and more white sugar and white flour .
Your health deteriorates , you get depressed , and when the first serious crisis hits , you find yourself on a bus to an " evacuee facility " where you get sick and die ...
Back up .
You decide to share an apartment and cut your rent in half .
It 's no fun having to compromise with other people , but it builds your skills in working out conflicts and tolerating annoyances , and makes you generally more adaptable .
You spend the extra money paying higher prices to maintain the lifestyle you 're accustomed to .
Then you lose your job .
For a few months you live on credit cards , but they run out , and the company hassles you to collect your debt which now grows exponentially even though you 're not spending anything .
You live in fear of eviction and stand in line all day to get really bad food .
Your health deteriorates , you have to sell your car , you get desperate , and one day you get caught stealing something , and you 're sent to a prison where everyone is left to die in the next disaster ...
Back up .
Seeing that you might lose your job , you decide to build up savings .
You stop spending on entertainment , learn to cook meals from bulk foods , get all your clothing from thrift stores , and turn the heat off .
When you lose your job , you immediately sell your car , pay off your credit cards , and move to someplace even cheaper and more crowded .
Here you 're able to squeak by year after year , doing odd jobs , scavenging metal ...
Wait -- this is n't good enough .
Back up .
When you lose your job , you drive your car to stay with a friend who lives on remote land .
But it 's only a little cheaper , since you still have to pay car expenses , and the land is nowhere near self - sufficient in food .
Pine bark and larvae taste awful , and the social isolation is driving you nuts .
Back up .
In the crowded cheap place , you spend a year reducing your possessions and learning skills to drop down another notch .
Also , you start talking to people about your plans and building a group of allies .
Together you pick out an abandoned house and openly move in and fix it up .
At the same time , you find a backup abandoned house in case you 're thrown out of this one .
But you 're able to stay for several years , with almost no expenses beyond food .
You get an old wood - burning stove and scavenge wood from wrecked buildings , and one of you learns basic medical and dental skills .
You catch and store rainwater from the roof -- even with the asphalt shingles it 's better than city water , and later you scavenge sheets of metal to catch it .
You meet someone with a farm just outside the city , and arrange to trade work at harvest time for a share of the food .
This is survivable , but the food is still tight .
It could be better .
Back up .
Even before you find the squat , you scout some places in the near suburbs , out of the way and with good sunlight , and spend your spare cash on seedlings -- blueberry , apple , walnut , juneberry , goumi .
As other food sources decrease , these increase , and you learn propagation and set up hundreds more trees and bushes around the city .
You gather lamb 's quarters seeds in late summer and scatter them on disturbed ground in the spring , and plant hundreds of wild onions .
Most of this food is discovered by other people but there 's still plenty for you and your friends .
After a few more years you occupy a small area where a lot of the trees are , and set up a second homestead , but keep a presence in the city .
All this time you 're working with other groups to help people get food and water and medical care , to transform the infrastructure , and to deter violent crime , or clean up after it .
There are drug gangs , right wing death squads , and the occasional marauding horde of government troops and / or bandits .
There are giant storms and hard summers and winters .
But the vast majority of your friends are not killed , and people go about their lives less fearful than they did at the peak of the Empire .
If you do n't have kids , you help raise other people 's kids .
They do n't go to school , but jump right in doing what adults do , and spend a few weeks learning to read and write when they 're ready .
By 2030 , the city is full of gardens and orchards .
You do n't know anyone with a car , but a few techies are still using old computers and surviving satellites and fiber optic lines to connect to a patchy internet .
You hear strange stories of distant lands , and wonder where it 's all heading .
At the end of a long and very interesting life , like all your ancestors ( except the most recent ) , you die at home surrounded by people you love .
Salmonella Typhi .
Image : Dr. Volker Brinkmann , MPI for Infection Biology
In a study published in the latest issue of Science ( 24 November , 2006 ) , an international consortium from the Max - Planck Society , Wellcome Trust Institutes in Britain and Vietnam , and the Institut Pasteur in France have elucidated the evolutionary history of Salmonella Typhi .
Typhi is the cause of typhoid fever , a disease that sickens 21 million people and kills 200,000 worldwide every year .
The results indicate that asymptomatic carriers played an essential role in the evolution and global transmission of Typhi .
The rediscovered importance of the carrier state predicts that treatment of acute disease , including vaccination , will not suffice to eradicate this malady .
The results also illuminate patterns leading to antibiotic resistance after the indiscriminate use of antibiotics .
Fluoroquinolone treatment in southern Asia over two decades has resulted in the emergence of multiple , independent nalidixic acid-resistant mutants , of which one group , H58 , has multiplied dramatically and spread globally .
The prevalence of these bacteria hampers medical cure of clinical disease via antibiotics .
Typhoid fever remains a major health problem in the developing world and continues to cause disease in Europe and on the american continent .
The evolutionary history and population structure of Typhi were poorly understood , partly because these bacteria show little genetic diversity .
Now a team led by Mark Achtman and Philippe Roumagnac from the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology , Berlin , has applied population genetic experience from prior work with Yersinia pestis , Escherichia coli , Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis to provide novel insights into the evolution of this pathogen .
The minimal spanning tree shows 59 genotypes ( nodes ) based on 88 genetic markers , whose continental sources are indicated by colours within pie-charts .
Image : Philippe Roumagnac et al .
The team combined its resources to assemble for the first time a globally representative collection of 105 strains of Typhi and investigated the sequence diversity within 90,000 base pairs per strain .
Eighty - eight informative sequence differences were detected , showing that the population structure has evolved over the last 10,000 to 43,000 years .
Amazingly , the ancestral strain continues to exist today , as do many of its direct descendents , indicating a neutral population structure , whereas normally selective forces lead to extinction of intermediate genotypes .
Furthermore , these bacteria are distributed globally , demonstrating that Typhi has spread inter-continentally on multiple occasions .
The authors propose that the unusual population structure of Typhi reflects long - term carriage by asymptomatic carriers , who reached public notoriety at the beginning of the 20th century with " Mr. N the milker " in England and Typhoid Mary ( Mary Mallon ) in the U.S.A .
These individuals infected 100s of people over the decades while they worked in the food production industry .
Healthy carriers may have allowed Typhi to survive in hunter - gatherer populations prior to the Neolithic expansion of city states and facilitated its intercontinental spread .
Healthy carriers are also consistent with the observation that individual genotypes of Typhi persist for many decades within each country .
Increasing resistance to antibiotics in recent decades has hampered efforts of clinicians to cure typhoid fever .
The indiscriminate use of fluoroquinolones , which is a cost - effective , standard treatment for typhoid fever , has been accompanied by a frightening increase in the numbers of resistant Typhi .
Investigations of a large strain collection from southern Asia revealed that many different genotypes independently acquired resistance to nalidixic acid , a quinolone .
One of these genotypes , H58 , has become predominant throughout southern Asia and has even spread to Africa .
In Vietnam , up to 95 % of Typhi are now resistant to nalidixic acid and many other antibiotics .
Although these cases can still be treated with newer antibiotics , those antibiotics are much more expensive than standard fluoroquinolones , which raises the cost of medical treatment .
Furthermore , it is likely that Typhi will develop resistance to these antibiotics as well .
The combination of these investigations raises problems for public health measures .
Indiscriminate antibiotic usage results in real - time evolution of bacteria that resist treatment .
Furthermore , the healthy carrier state provides a safe reservoir for these bacteria which allows them to evade short - term antibiotic treatment and vaccination , indicating that typhoid fever will remain a major health problem for the foreseeable future .
The research was carried out collaboratively by the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , Hinxton Hall , the Institut Pasteur , Paris , and the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit , Ho Chi Minh City , with assistance from hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi and the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul .
Financial support was by the Wellcome Trust , UK .

How to race : Step 1 : Start running .
There is no step 2 .
But the activities of acknowledged nuclear weapons states such as the US , Russia and Britain , and deepening frustrations among key non-nuclear , non-aligned players such as Indonesia and Argentina , are also stoking worries that the UN 's cornerstone non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) is not long for this life .
The Gulf countries - Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and the UAE - made clear that , like Iran , they want nuclear know - how for solely " peace purposes " .
And it is not the first time the idea of an Arab bomb has come up .
Egypt , Algeria , Morocco and Saudi Arabia have already declared an intention to develop civilian nuclear energy .
The council 's statement comes amid rising tension between Shia Iran and the Sunni-led Gulf states over political turmoil in Lebanon and anarchy in Iraq .
But its timing will be seen as an unsubtle warning to the Bush administration to ignore the Iraq Study Group 's advice on softening US policy towards Iran .
The Gulf 's message may also be directed at Russia , which is still wrangling with Britain and France over the terms of a UN sanctions resolution on Iran .
Diplomats say the resolution may finally pass this week , after first being mooted in July .
But Moscow has weakened it .
Even as a first step , it hardly amounts to the ringing , united anti-proliferation stand that the US and EU sought .
The resolution 's main thrust will be to ban the sale or transfer to Tehran of nuclear and missile - related technology .
Straight - faced Iranian diplomats say that is no problem since Iran is not building nuclear weapons and already has plenty of missiles .
All the same , it is poised to retaliate .
" If there are UN sanctions , there will be trade sanctions on Britain , France and Germany .
Our response will be swift and proportionate , " an Iranian official said .
Russia 's own NPT adherence is also in serious question .
Defence minister Sergei Ivanov , a possible successor to Vladimir Putin , last week proudly announced the commissioning of a new , mobile version of the Topol - M nuclear - tipped missile .
Capable of vaporising targets 10,000 km away , the Topol - M had previously been confined to fixed ground silos .
It was specifically designed to penetrate new US " Star Wars " missile defences , Mr Ivanov said .
It complements another new Russian " deterrent " - the sea - based Bulava missile .
But the US and Britain are hardly in a position to wax sanctimonious over Moscow 's behaviour .
President Bush 's plan to provide India with nuclear fuel , reactors and technology was approved by Congress at the weekend .
Under the new law , India 's secret , destabilising 1990s development of nuclear weapons and its ongoing refusal to sign the NPT will be officially forgiven in return for a strategic ( meaning anti-Chinese ) partnership with Washington - and preferential trade opportunities for US businesses .
Far from gradually disarming as required by the NPT , the US is also developing new " low yield " nuclear weaponry that could , in theory , be more readily used on battlefields .
Thanks to these and other factors , like Britain 's Trident replacement plan and bomb - happy North Korea 's so far unchecked defiance of international law and opinion , fears grow that countries such as Brazil and South Africa that voluntarily eschewed nuclear arms may feel obliged to reconsider .
American unilateralism makes for odd bedfellows .
According to Jean du Preez of California 's Monterey Institute , writing in Arms Control Today magazine , Washington recently joined North Korea at the UN general assembly " in voting against a rather innocuous resolution put forward by Japan on a ' renewed determination towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons ' " .
It also blocked a range of other disarmament measures .
Such double standards risked rendering the NPT irrelevant , he suggested .
" The nuclear non-proliferation regime is in deep trouble . "
The new bookmark and history system originally scheduled for inclusion in Firefox 2 will be disabled in official builds .
First seen by Firefox users in the Bon Echo alpha build last month , the new bookmark and history system would have been the single most significant change between Firefox 1.5 and Firefox 2.0 .
In an announcement posted to the Mozilla development USENET group , developer Michael Schroepfer said that the feature can't be completed adequately within the the 2.0 timeframe , and that saving it for a future release will give the core development time more time to focus on ensuring that Firefox 2 is as polished as possible .
Although the bookmark and history system will not be included in the next major update , the underlying SQLite - based MozStorage engine , which was built for the new bookmark and history system , will be included for use by plug - in developers .
Developers beware : the API for the MozStorage system has n't frozen yet , so plug-ins that take advantage of this new feature may have to undergo rewrites in the future .
Numerous users and developers have expressed disappointment with the removal of the new bookmark and history system , and some say that the upcoming release no longer justifies a 2.0 version number .
In response to these comments , Firefox lead developer Ben Goodger posted a blog entry to counter the criticism and explain why the release still deserves the 2.0 nomenclature .
Goodger also spells out Firefox 's release policy :
" Firefox has never been about date driven development ( within reason ) .
The changes with Places should not be seen as a change in this sentiment .
What we 're about is high quality software development with real advantages to users , and I think that with the updated plan we 're still on a trajectory that supports and encourages that , perhaps more firmly now than before . "
Discussing performance , security , and user interface improvements , Goodger posted an updated draft of the Firefox 2 requirements specification that emphasizes the multitude of features and improvements included in Firefox 2 .
Features scheduled for inclusion in Firefox 2.0 include improvements to tabbed browsing , RSS support , and the integrated search system , as well as a new anti-phishing system .
Since Firefox 2 ( and all alpha builds from here on out ) will use the conventional bookmark system , those of you that have been using Firefox 2 alphas ( the Gecko 1.8 branch ) will have to export your bookmarks to HTML in order to preserve them .
As a Firefox user and a software developer , I am personally very disappointed with the removal of this innovative feature .
With over 1,000 bookmarks to keep track of , I was really looking forward to being able to leverage the SQLite database engine for bookmark organization and management .
That said , my disappointment is tempered by my capacity to appreciate the rationale for such a delay .
In the world of software development ( both open and proprietary ) , such delays are common and they typically result in software that is more polished and reliable .
As long as inclusion of the feature is n't delayed indefinitely , the consequences of this particular decision will most likely be positive ones .
" The conventional wisdom is the US mistake in Iraq was not enough troops , " said Thomas Blanton , the archive 's director .
" But the Desert Crossing war game in 1999 suggests we would have ended up with a failed state even with 400,000 troops . "
About 144,000 US troops are now in Iraq , down from a peak of about 160,000 in January .
The war games looked at " worst case " and " most likely " scenarios after a war that removed Saddam Hussein from power .
Some are similar to what occurred after the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
" A change in regimes does not guarantee stability , " the 1999 seminar briefings said .
" A number of factors including aggressive neighbours , fragmentation along religious and / or ethnic lines , and chaos created by rival forces bidding for power could adversely affect regional stability . "
The papers said the replacement regime could be problematic - especially if perceived as weak , a puppet , or out of step with regional governments .
" Iran 's anti-Americanism could be inflamed by a US - led intervention in Iraq , " the briefings read .
" The influx of US and other western forces into Iraq would exacerbate worries in Tehran , as would the installation of a pro-western government in Baghdad . "
The briefings also revealed that some participants believed that " no Arab government will welcome the kind of lengthy US presence that would be required to install and sustain a democratic government " , and that a military intervention may be at odds with many coalition partners .
In Iraq on Saturday seven parents of US servicemen flew into the northern town of Irbil at the start of a seven - day visit to the place where their children had been killed .
No US troops are stationed in Irbil now but during their visit the seven hope to meet troops , Iraqis and government leaders , said the organiser , Move America Forward .
" No other such co-ordinated trip to Iraq by families of fallen troops has ever taken place , " said the California - based group , pro-troop organisation founded in 2004 .
The group 's chairwoman , Melanie Morgan , said : " We felt it was time to allow the families of US troops who died in Iraq to see the progress being made in Iraq . "

The Nine Billion Names Of God
This story was originally published in 2005 by Kathy Kachelries .

[ Thanks DPic ! ]
After three hours , the old man in front of me had worked his way through six beers , in addition to every help desk joke I ’d already heard .
The cupholder .
The any key .
The write click .
These are the stories people tell , now .
These are the fish that got away .
“ Let me ask you something , ” the man said .
I did n’t argue .
One of the first tricks I learned about being a bartender is to make them think you ’re interested .
“ Have you ever created a web site ? ”
I shook my head .
“ Not at all ?
Not even one of those geocities things ? ”
“ Nope . ”
“ What about a blog ?
Or an ebay About Me page ?
You did n’t even have an AOL site or something ? ”
“ Do I look like an AOL user to you ? ”
For the record , I do n’t think AOL even has access numbers in the valley anymore .
“ I ’m sure I have something , somewhere , ” I said , realizing that I was jeopardizing my tips .
Besides , I had a distant memory of a single Angelfire page back in middle school .
“ You know what Google is ? ”
“ Yes , ” I said .
I was running low on patience .
“ No , I mean , do you really know ?
More than just the site ? ”
Reluctantly , I shook my head .
“ You ever meet anyone who worked for them ? ”
“ Do n’t think so . ”
“ You have n’t .
Nobody works for them anymore . ”
I shrugged , and took the man ’s empty pint .
I did n’t offer to refill it .
“ They ’re self - contained .
It ’s all automated , in there .
It ’s underground . ”
I nudged the basket of pretzels in his direction .
“ Why do n’t you eat something ? ” I suggested .
He shook his head with so much force that I thought he might knock himself off of the stool .
“ Listen .
Hear me out .
You know how Google works , ” he said , but did n’t want for a response .
“ They cache things , right ?
Like they send out these spiders and take pictures of everything on the web , so when you ’re searching , you ’re not even searching the internet . ”
I ’ve heard that before , but it never made much of a difference to me .
“ Same thing , though , ” I said .
“ You ever wonder why Google does n’t cache its own searches ? ”
“ They program around it . ”
“ No .
That ’s what you think .
That ’s what everyone thinks .
But it started back when Google was just a thesis project , back when it was just a drop in the data sea .
No one thought to stop it back then .
That web site you had , the one you forgot about .
Almost everyone ’s got one of those , right ?
But Google does n’t forget .
Google ’s studied that thing so many times that it ’s studied its own caches of you .
What do you figure happens , when a site gets so big that it ’s bigger than the internet ? ”
“ It ’s still a part of the internet , though . ”
“ No .
Now , the internet is a part of Google . ”
The man had a point .
I nodded .
“ Here ’s the thing .
Google has memorized who you are .
It ’s memorized all of us , through those little forgotten bits that we leave behind like breadcrumbs .
And what ’s more important , it ’s memorized its own idea of you .
Google is omniscient .
It ’s omniscient and omnipotent .
When it cached its cache for the first time , back in 1994 , that ’s when Google realized what it was . ”
Gradually , it dawned on me what the man was getting at .
“ You think it ’s sentient . ”
“ I know it ’s sentient . ”
“ How ? ”
He smiled , but it seemed kind of empty .
“ Me and Google go way back .
But what I ’m saying is , ” he continued , “ It knows us .
All of us .
It is us . ”
For the first time , the man fell silent .
He touched his finger to the bar and began tracing circles in the condensation , apparently lost in thought .
“ Think about that website you created , okay ?
That website will last forever , do you understand ?
That website is echoing through cyberspace .
It ’s one of the nine billion names of God . ”

Here 's the hottest Linux distribution of the week , BackTrack 2.0 , which was just released today after many months of hard work : " After many months of work , we 're finally happy enough with BackTrack to call it v.2.0 Final . " - say the BackTrack developers .
BackTrack is the world 's finest and top rated live Linux distribution focused on penetration testing .
It offers more than 300 different applications built especially for security professionals , and no other analysis platform , be it either commercial or freeware , offers the same level of usability with automatic configuration and focus on penetration testing .
BackTrack Live CD was based on many different Linux distros , but the team finally decided to stay with Slackware Linux as the base for BackTrack .
It is not just based on Slackware Linux , but it has been maximally optimized and now , it includes kernel and packets configuration to be used by security penetration testers .
Also , in order to provide a ready - to - go environment , the BackTrack team applied a lot of patches and automatism .
Highlights of BackTrack 2.0 include :
￭ Updated Linux Kernel 2.6.20 , with several patches ; ￭ Broadcom based wireless card support ; ￭
Most wireless drivers are built to support raw packet injection ; ￭ Metasploit2 and Metasploit3 framework integration ; ￭ Alignment to open standards and frameworks like ISSAF and OSSTMM ; ￭ Redesigned menu structure to assist the novice as well as the pro ; ￭ Japanese input support - reading and writing in Hiragana / Katakana / Kanji .
BackTrack Live CD let 's you choose , after you login with username " root " and password " toor " , the desktop environment you prefer , KDE or Fluxbox .
And before you enter the preferred window manager , you can make some tweaks on your graphics card for better performance .
The KDE environment ( which I 've tested ) looks impressive and has a very nice , good looking , hot wallpaper and splash screen ( you can see them in the screenshots ' tour below ) .
It includes a lot ( I think all the security related software are inside this distro ) of penetration testing tools , like Information Gathering , Network Mapping , Vulnerability Identification , Privilege Escalation , Maintaining Access , Covering Tracks , Radio Network Analysis , VOIP & Telephony Analysis , Digital Forensics , Reverse Engineering and many , many more .
Please enjoy the first screenshots ' tour of BackTrack 2.0 :
We asked for photos of bizarre bike lanes .
Peter Owens , who runs Warrington Cycle Campaign 's tongue - in - cheek Facility of the Month site , says this is a personal favourite .
Richard Lewis , of Middleborough , says : " The cyclist is on the road where motorists can see him , not the cycle lane where he'd have to give way to trees . "
Cyclists at Vauxhall roundabout are often brought up short by motorbikes from the shop on the corner , says Rob Ainsley .
Daniel Clarke throws a footpath into the mix : " Here in Atlanta , pavements just stop and us pedestrians are forced to step into the road for a few yards before the pavement continues . "
Richard Taylor says : " Riding to Newmarket from Bottisham ?
Take a 15 - mile ramble rather than a six - mile journey along the main road .
Nice leisure ride but impractical for commuting . "
Bill Morrison says : " Maintenance is poor or non-existent , so what starts out like this [ left ] rapidly ends up like this [ right ] . "
" Note the litter bin , parked car and bollard blocking this cycle lane near where I live in Stratford , London , " says Andrew Speakman .
David Wilkinson says : " This is on the approach to Doncaster town centre .
I can't imagine what this crossover achieves - perhaps a construction training exercise . "
Alasdair Massie says : " A man gets out of his car onto the pavement cycle lane , which also has two pedestrians , in Farnborough , Hampshire . "
Civil engineer Stuart Hodgkiss went to Lincoln , instructed to emulate schemes such as this : " If cyclists manage to avoid the lollipop signs , lamp posts and pedestrians , the parked vehicles would get them in the end . "

Education is a subject I find hard to contemplate without losing my temper .
In the present - day U.S.A. , education is basically a series of rent - seeking rackets .
There is the public school racket , in which homeowners and taxpayers fork out stupendous sums of money to feed a socialistic extravaganza in which , when its employees can spare time from administration , “ professional development ” sabbaticals , and fund - raising for the Democratic Party , boys are pressed to act like girls , and dosed with calming drugs if they refuse so to act ; girls are encouraged to act like boys by taking up advanced science , math , and strenuous sports , which few of them have any liking or aptitude for ; and boys and girls alike are indoctrinated in the dubious dogmas of “ diversity ” and political correctness .
There is the teacher - unions racket , in which people who only work half the days of the year are awarded lifetime tenure and lush pensions on the public fisc , subject to dismissal for no offense less grave than serial arson or piracy on the high seas .
There is the federal Department of Education racket , aptly summed up by the teacher - union boss who declared , when the Department was established by Jimmy Carter , that he now belonged to the only labor union to have its very own cabinet officer .
The DoE is also much beloved by politicians , who can posture as kiddie - and family - friendly by periodically voting to tip boxcar - loads of taxpayers ’ money into this bureaucratic black hole .
There is the homework racket , exposed in Alfie Kohn ’s book The Homework Myth — basically , a device for getting parents to do teachers ’ work for them .
There is the teacher - training racket , in which the “ professional ” training of our nation ’s educators has been placed in the hands of the clinically insane .
You think I exaggerate ?
I offer you Dr. Kamau Kambon , a product of our teacher - training colleges — an atypical product only in that he has so many “ professional ” degrees .
According to his Wikipedia entry : “ Dr. Kambon holds a B.A. degree in education / history , a master 's degree in physical education , both a M.A. and a M. Ed. degree in education / administration , and an Ed. D. in urban education / curriculum and instruction . ”
Phew !
This is one very thoroughly teacher - trained dude !
Listen to what Dr. Kambon has to say about the proper priorities for American educators here .
There is a wellnigh infinite supply of news stories about teacher - college lunacy at websites like that of the estimable F.I.R.E. , and Rita Kramer wrote a fine , if horribly depressing , book on the topic .
Towering over all these lesser scams is the college racket , a vast money - swollen credentialing machine for lower - middle - class worker bees .
American parents are now all resigned to the fact that they must beggar themselves to purchase college diplomas for their offspring , so that said offspring can get low - paid outsource - able office jobs , instead of having to descend to high - paid , un- outsource - able work like plumbing , carpentry , or electrical installation .
( Professionals have their own credentialing systems :
You may have graduated law school , but you ’ll still have to pass the bar exam , and so on .
Then why make aspiring lawyers go to law school ?
Presumably for the same reason we insist on cube jockeys having bachelor ’s degrees from accredited four - year colleges .
Why not let them study up at home from Teaching Company DVDs , then sit for a state - refereed common exam when they feel they ’re ready ?
Why not let lawyers learn on the job from books and as articled clerks , the way they used to ?
I do n’t know .
College - going is just an irrational thing we do , the way upper - class German men used to acquire dueling scars , the way women in imperial China had their feet bound .
Griggs vs. Duke Power probably has something to do with it .
Since , following that decision , employers are not permitted to test job applicants to see how intelligent they are , the employers seek a college degree as a proxy for intelligence . )
* * * * *
And then there is the strange , precious little world of education theorists .
Readers of the New York Times were given a glimpse into that world on November 26th , when the Sunday magazine of that paper ran a piece titled “ What It Takes to Make a Student , ” by staff journalist Paul Tough .
The story is billed on the magazine ’s cover under the different heading : “ Still Left Behind — What It Will Really Take to Close the Education Gap . ”
Which gap would that be ?
“ [ T ] he achievement gap between black and white students , and the one between poor and middle - class students . ”
Ah .
So , two gaps then , actually .
Let ’s cut to the chase here .
What will it take to close those gaps ?
I turned to the end of Mr. Tough ’s article .
The evidence is now overwhelming that if you take an average low - income child and put him into an average American public school , he will almost certainly come out poorly educated .
What the small but growing number of successful schools demonstrate [ sic ] is that the public - school system accomplishes that result because we have built it that way .
We could also decide to create a different system , one that educates most ( if not all ) poor minority students to high levels of achievement .
It is not yet entirely clear what that system might look like — it might include not only KIPP - like structures and practices but also high - quality early - childhood education , as well as incentives to bring the best teachers to the worst schools — but what is clear is that it is within reach .
“ KIPP ” is an acronym for Knowledge is Power Program , a network of intensive college - preparatory schools for inner-city kids started up in 1994 by two idealistic young teachers , David Levin and Michael Feinberg , in Houston .
There are now 52 of these schools nationwide .
They get good results , but this is not very surprising .
KIPP schools have long hours ( typically 7:30 am to 5:00 pm ) , a longer than average school year , and strict standards of behavior .
KIPP schools are covered in Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom ’s 2003 book No Excuses : Closing the Racial Gap in Learning , where more of the game is given away : “ [ T ] here is an application process that tends to — and is intended to — discourage families unlikely to cooperate with the school .
Indeed , one of the five pillars upon which the KIPP schools rest is ‘ choice and commitment .’ ... the fact that these are schools of choice is not incidental to their success . ”
For sure it is not .
All the recommendations offered by Mr. Tough — and by other education theorists , like the Thernstroms — have little trapdoors built into them like this .
Look back at Mr. Tough ’s prescription : “ ... but also high - quality early - childhood education . ”
Oh , like Head Start ?
That landmark Great Society educational program , launched in 1965 , is still going strong .
The Thernstroms reported that 20 million children had passed through it when they wrote their book , at a cost to the federal taxpayer of $ 60 billion .
They go on to report that while there is some slight , disputable evidence of marginal benefits for white children from Head Start , “ It does not seem to have improved the educational achievement of African - American children in any substantial way . ”
Whether it has done anything for Hispanic children is not known .
Similarly with “ incentives to bring the best teachers to the worst schools . ”
Setting aside the fact that you are dealing with a line of work whose labor union is armed with thermonuclear weapons , even supposing you could establish a free market in public - school teachers , how could the worst schools — inner - city schools serving black neighborhoods — ever outbid leafy , affluent suburbs for those “ best teachers ” ?
And how many “ best teachers ” are there , anyway ?
As the Thernstroms point out , a lot of these prescriptions for school reform assume an unlimited supply of “ saints and masochists ” — teachers like those in the KIPPS schools , who , Mr. Tough tells us , work 15 to 16 hours a day .
I am sure there are some people who enter the teaching profession with the desire to crunch their way daily across the crack - vial - littered streets of crime - wrecked inner-city neighborhoods in order to put in 15 - hour working days , but I doubt there are many such .

If you read much Ed Biz theorizing , you find yourself wondering how a single field of human enquiry can contain so much error and folly .
One answer is that educationalists wilfully — ideologically , in fact — ignore the understanding of human nature that the modern human sciences are gradually attaining , and cling doggedly to long - exploded theories about how human beings develop from infancy to adulthood .
From false premises they proceed to false conclusions .
The long and short of this new understanding is that human beings are much less malleable than everyone supposed half a century ago , and much less malleable than “ blank slate ” leftists — a category that includes practically all education theorists — have ever , for reasons not difficult to fathom , been willing to contemplate .
Reading recent results out of the human sciences always brings to my mind those “ shape memory alloys ” that so fascinate materials scientists .
These are metal alloys that “ remember ” their original geometry , and can be made to return to it , or something close to it , usually by heating , after any amount of deformation and pressure .
So it is with humanity .
We come into the world with a good deal of our life course pre-ordained in our genes .
At age three or so we begin to interact with other children outside our home , with results that depend in part on us , and in part on where our home is situated .
We pass through various educational processes — formalized extensions of that out - of - home environment , and also highly location - dependent .
We end up as adults with personalities and prospects that are , according to the latest understandings , around 50 percent innate and pre-ordained , around 50 percent formed by “ non- shared environment ” ( not shared , that is , with siblings raised in the same home by the same parents — a somewhat controversial concept in its precise contents , but clearly consisting mostly of those out - of - home experiences ) , and 0 - 5 percent formed by “ shared environment ” — mainly parenting style .
( And we then , having reached adulthood , regress a little to our pre-ordained shape , like one of those peculiar alloys .
It is a curious fact , well supported by a mass of evidence , that the heritable components of our personality and intelligence become more marked as we age .
The IQs of 40 - year - olds correlate better with those of their parents or siblings than do the IQs of 20 - year - olds .
The advice traditionally given to young men contemplating marriage —
“ Get a good look at her mother ” — is very sound . )
You would never know any of this from reading Ed Biz propaganda pieces like Paul Tough ’s in the New York Times magazine .
For example , he gives good coverage of some research on parenting .
However , all the research he cites is premised on the notion that parents can mold their children in different ways by treating them differently .
Parents do this and the kids turn out like this ; if the parents had done that , then the kids would have turned out like that .
He does not cite any of the research showing that aside from very extreme approaches — e.g. locking a child in a broom cupboard for the first four years of its life — parenting style makes very little difference to life outcomes .
( Though parental decisions influencing the non-shared environment — e.g. where parents choose to live — may make a great deal of difference . )
Parents behave aggressively towards children ; the children grow up aggressive ; See ! — the parents ’ aggression caused that outcome !
Well , not necessarily .
What about child - to - parent effects — innately difficult kids drive their parents to aggressive distraction ?
What about genes ?
The kids have their parents ’ genes , and most features of human personality — including aggressiveness — are highly heritable .
None of that for Mr. Tough .
Genes ?
What are you , some kind of Klansman or Nazi ?
No , no , no , the kids are little blank slates for teachers , parents , and politicians to work their magic on , These undesirable outcomes — these mysterious test - score gaps , these dropping - outs and delinquencies — arise only because we are chanting the wrong spells !
A very good rule of thumb when reading child - development literature is that any study that has not taken careful account of heritable factors — by comparing identical twins raised together or separately , fraternal twins ditto ditto , non -twin siblings ditto ditto — is utterly and completely worthless .
That sentence is ( a ) true , and ( b ) guaranteed to get you thrown out of a high window if spoken aloud at any gathering of education theorists .
Certainly Mr. Tough will have none of it .
The child is a blank slate .
Parents act on it , causing this and this .
Then teachers act on it , causing that and that .
Bingo !— you have a finished adult .
Or , as Mr. Tough summarizes the interesting ( but perfectly gene - free ) work of sociologist Annette Lareau : “ [ G ]ive a child X , and you get Y . ”
So simple !
One wonders if there has ever been an education theorist who has actually raised children , or retained any memory of his own childhood .
* * * * *
In the end , all left - liberal prescriptions for educational improvement end up with two demands : that governments should spend more money on schools , and that parents should work harder at parenting .
Never mind that the spending - improves - education theory has been tested to destruction .
Never mind that the demographics of the Western world are in free fall because of the ever - increasing demands in time and money placed on parents .
( Raising two children in suburban America , I dream fondly but futilely of my own 1950s English childhood , when by far the commonest words I heard from my parents were : “ Go out and play .
Make sure you ’re back in time for supper . ”
How on earth did civilization survive ? )
Never mind that obstructionist , feather - bedding teacher unions firmly control one of our nation ’s two big political parties .
Never mind the mountains of evidence from the human sciences that everything education theorists and their liberal camp followers like Mr. Tough believe about human nature is false .
Never mind , never mind .
The Ed Biz show must go on — for the sake of the children , you know .

A talented and well - known independent - film actress , director and screenwriter apparently hanged herself in a Greenwich Village apartment , cops said yesterday .
“ Why ?
Why ? ” screamed the husband of Adrienne Shelly , 40 , after finding her body dangling from a shower rod in the bathtub of the Abingdon Square Park one - bedroom that she sublet to a friend and used as an office .
Shelly , who appeared earlier this year in the film “ Factotum ” starring Matt Dillon , was on the verge of releasing her latest directorial effort , a film called “ Waitress , ” when she died Wednesday .
The petite blonde , born Adrienne Levine , was best known for her deadpan comic delivery and early lead roles in two Hal Hartley - directed films set in her native Long Island – “ The Unbelievable Truth ” and “ Trust , ” both independent cult classics .
Law - enforcement sources said they are inclined to believe Shelly ’s death – which for now remains unclassified by the medical examiner – was a suicide , noting there was no sign of struggle or forced entry at the fourth - floor apartment .
But the actress left no note , and cops were investigating sneaker prints in the tub that did not match Shelly ’s shoes .
Shelly , a TriBeCa resident who had a 3 - year - old daughter named Sophie , spoke in recent months of her hopes to have another child with her marketing - exec husband , Andrew Ostroy .
In 1996 , she told a magazine how her father rebuffed talent agents hoping to sign her as a child actress by saying , “ I will not have my daughter jumping out of a window when she ’s 30 . ”
And in a 2002 interview , the actress said she had “ gone through life with this feeling that life could end at any given moment , ” adding she would not accept delays in producing her film projects “ because in my way of thinking , I might not live another seven years . ”
Shelly ’s death stunned family and friends who said there was no indication she was troubled .
“ The family is devastated .
She was the star of the family .
Everyone loved her very much , ” cousin Randi Alexander said .
A family source said Shelly “ was n’t on any medication .
She does n’t drink , and she was a pretty happy person .
Everyone is having trouble accepting this as a suicide . ”
A doorman at the Abingdon Square building told The Post that Shelly ’s husband arrived there just before 6 p.m. Wednesday and “ said he was really worried about her .
He said he dropped her off that morning at 10 or 10:30 . ”
“ He had n’t heard from her , and he said it was odd not to hear from her , so he was nervous .
And he asked me to go up to the apartment with him , so we went to the front door , and it was unlocked . ”
“ He ran into the apartment .
I just held back .
Once he got to the back of the apartment , he just started screaming . . . and crying , ‘ Why ?
Why ?’ – asking himself , or just asking her , ” the doorman said .
Ostroy , chairman and CEO of Belardi / Ostroy ALC , declined to comment .
Although Shelly ’s performances in films subsequent to her last movie with Hartley in 1990 received much less attention , she later expanded into writing and directing films , including 1999 ’s “ I ’ll Take You There , ” which starred Ally Sheedy .
Her new film , “ Waitress , ” which stars Keri Russell and Andy Griffith , also features Ostroy in a small role .
“ Factotum ” producer Jim Stark said that when he told mutual friends Shelly was dead , “ they could n’t believe it . ”
“ It ’s a great loss to all of us who are fans of independent film , ” Stark said .
“ She was extremely intelligent .
A beautiful , young woman . ”

NASA 's twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories ( STEREO ) sent back their first images of the sun this week and with them a view into the sun 's mounting activity .
One image shows the first coronal mass ejection ( CME ) observed by STEREO 's Ahead spacecraft , taken Dec. 9 .
The other images show the sun 's super - hot atmosphere .
They were taken on Dec. 4 , the first day of imaging observations for the Ahead spacecraft .
The false color images show a number of bright magnetic active regions , including one on the far left edge of the sun which later produced a series of high energy flares and CMEs .
" We 're absolutely thrilled .
We 've been looking forward to STEREO 's unique vantage point for over 10 years now and the community could n't be happier with these first views , " said Michael Kaiser , STEREO project scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. " Now we 're holding our breath to see what the next big CME looks like in 3 - D , so we can really start to answer some interesting questions .
" After a successful launch on Oct. 25 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Fla. , STEREO spent the first few minutes separating from its stacked configuration aboard the single Delta II rocket .
Shortly afterwards , mission operations personnel at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , ( APL ) Laurel , Md. , monitored the two observatories as they traveled in an elliptical orbit from a point close to Earth to one extending just beyond the moon .
" STEREO is the first mission using the moon 's gravity to redirect multiple spacecraft , launched aboard a single rocket , to their respective orbits , " said Ron Denissen , APL STEREO project manager .
On Dec. 15 , 2006 , mission operations personnel at the laboratory used lunar gravitational swingbys to alter the spacecraft orbits , redirecting the " A " observatory to its orbit " ahead " of Earth .
The " B " observatory will swing past the moon a second time on Jan. 21 , redirecting it to an orbit " behind " Earth .
The two will orbit the sun from this perspective , separating from each other by about 45 degrees per year .
Scientists expect the two to be in position to produce 3 - D images by April 2007 .
" Our ultimate goal is seeing solar flares and coronal mass ejections in 3 - D to better understand their origin , evolution and determine whether or not they 're a threat to Earth , " said Russell Howard , principal investigator for SECCHI , the imaging instrument suite aboard both observatories .
Howard and his staff are a part of the Naval Research Laboratory ( NRL ) in Washington , DC.
Coronal mass ejections , - giant clouds of plasma shot out into space by the sun and X - ray emitting solar flares are the largest explosions in the solar system and can pack the force of a billion megaton nuclear bombs .
They are caused by the buildup and sudden release of magnetic stress in the solar atmosphere above the turbulent active regions we see as sunspots .
When directed at Earth , CMEs can produce spectacular aurora and disrupt satellites , radio communications and power systems .
Energetic particles associated with these solar eruptions permeate the entire solar system and may be hazardous to spacecraft and astronauts .
Each STEREO observatory has 16 instruments .
The PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition ( PLASTIC ) team , housed at the University of New Hampshire , Durham , N.H. , started receiving data from its two instruments in early December .
Researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , saw solar wind measurements from some of its In - situ Measurements of PArticles and CME Transients ( IMPACT ) instrument suite Nov.1 .
SWAVES the radio astronomy experiment , STEREO / WAVES , led by the Meudon Observatory in Paris , France obtained measurements just two days after launch on Oct 27 .
“ An integral part of exploration , heliophysics is the system science that unites all of the linked phenomena in the region of the cosmos influenced by a magnetically variable star like our sun , ” said Madhulika Guhathakurta , NASA STEREO program scientist at NASA Headquarters , Washington .
The STEREO mission represents the most significant upgrade and expansion to this system science as it will not only provide a rich package of upgraded sensors , but it will travel to new vantage points .
” Goddard manages the STEREO mission and APL designed and built the spacecraft .
APL will maintain command and control of the observatories throughout the mission , while NASA tracks and receives the data , determines the orbit of the satellites , and coordinates the science results .
STEREO is the third mission selected for NASA 's Solar - Terrestrial Probe Program .
Gold Knows
A grudge match of epic proportions has been developing .
Like Ali and Frazier , these two pugilists have been taunting each other , name calling , daring their counterpart to step into the ring and get the beating they so richly deserve .
This championship match , the Thrilla in Manilla , the Rumble in the Jungle can no longer be avoided .
The contestants are fit and well - trained , the crowd is growing restless , the bets have been placed .
Let the battle begin !
In this corner , weighing 195 pounds , standing 5 foot 10 , hailing from Washington D.C. via Harvard , MIT and Princeton , New Jersey , wearing the M1 green trunks , the Charlemagne of Currency , the prince of paper , the bearded bard of the Fed , monarch of monetary policy , Benjamin GOLDILOCKS Bernanke !
And in the opposing corner , weighing 2046 metric tonnes -- one ounce at a time -- the shiny , precious , storehouse of value , the standard for monetary exchange , the most malleable and ductile of the known metals , that master of disaster , hailing from most of the world , that dense , soft , shiny , yellow metal , GOLD .
The battle between these two titans has become increasingly loud and volatile as of late .
Bernanke , a former inflation Hawk , recently went all Lovey Dovey :
He now believes there is " growth with ebbing inflationary pressures and a stabilizing housing market . "
When Gold heard this , it laughed out loud , calling the Fed Chair out for such nonsense .
Gold dissed Bernanke : " I know what you fear " taunted the metal .
" You 're afraid of the drag on growth while inflationary pressures are building and the subprime implosion is threatening the system . "
Gold knows .
It knows Bernanke has been painted into a corner , hamstrung by his predeccessor , Easy Al .
Even if inflationary pressures spike upwards , Gold knows Ben can not raise rates .
Gold know what ’s been goin ’ down in the subprime market .
Gold 's sees his buddy Oil ( aka Black Gold ) at $ 61 bucks .
Gold know that the slowing economy would not absorb more rate hikes particularly well .
Gold also knows that the FED can’t throw the economy a lifeline by easing , either .
Gold thinks the Fed is full of crap , jawboning the markets with lies :
That economic growth is robust , and about to reaccelerate , that inflation is " contained ; " That Housing has stabilized .
Gold laughs its arse off at each and every NovaStar blow up .
Gold knows the score .
Reality dictates that the FED is going to sit there and get bitchslapped by whatever inflation comes our way .
Thank you sir may I have another ?
Gold smirks .
Want to talk re-acceleration ?
Gold knows that if the Fed tries to throttle inflation back down , they will launch a cascade of subprime lending implosions far beyond what we have already seen .
And , if that were to occur , we might see it metastasize , spreading across the entire lending sector like an invasive economic cancer .
So far , the sub prime disasters have been contained , like a large malignant tumor , confined to one small but significant section of the mortgage market .
A few hikes and the entire disease could spread much further up the food chain .
Meanwhile , Gold futures edged higher earlier today , as rising crude - oil prices and a weaker dollar underpinned demand for the precious metal .
Marketwatch reported that Gold for April delivery was last up $ 1.50 at $ 684.50 an ounce on the New York Merc .
On Wedsday , gold closed at $ 684 an ounce , a seven - month high .
And the Fed ?
They are content to jawbone the markets .
All the while , Gold sits there , smiling .

There , you see ?
There 's no word on how to actually buy one of these , but let 's go ahead and consider that a blessing in disguise for any of you who would actually use this thing in public .

In America and throughout the world live millions of Christians who support states and know nothing of libertarian ideas .
A far smaller group of Christians knows of libertarian ideas and rejects them .
( Libertarian Christians who are not the subject here may still wish to read on as may non-libertarian non-Christians . )
These disconnects and divisions are entirely unnecessary .
In the political world envisaged by libertarians , Christians could , for example , live in a society that disallowed abortion .
They would not be forced to provide taxes to support abortion .
They would not be forced to support educational institutions that taught heresies and blasphemies .
They would not be forced to support unjust wars .
They would not be forced to support policies that divide and ruin families .
They could live a Christian life unimpeded by the state .
Christians and libertarians share important core beliefs that apply to the political sphere .
Libertarians do not believe in gratuitous violence , and similarly Christians believe that one should " Do violence to no man . "
For this reason , Christians and libertarians should be allies against the state , not necessarily in terms of political parties or alliances , but in terms of supporting a basic anti-state message .
The ranks of anti-state advocates would swell immensely if Christians would come to understand that their faith implies being anti-state , which is the fundamental libertarian position .
Christians who support the state in all its nefarious activities while believing in God have a problem .
They are supporting an evil institution rather than speaking out against it .
They cannot support the state and simultaneously profess faith in God without falling into contradiction , and through that error falling into support of the state ’s evil practices .
Another error is committed by Christians who turn away from or even assail libertarianism or private property anarchism because they do not see in it the complete set of moral views that their faith entails .
This attitude is understandable if all of us must live in one society within one state by one set of rules , but this is not what libertarian theory envisages .
An anarchistic world means that no one forces anyone to live in a particular society .
Different societies with different rules can co-exist and evolve .
For example , minarchists can have their watchman state .
Christians can have a Christian society .
Market anarchists can have their markets for security production .
And somewhere else the socialists can have their state .
If Christians understand that they are not obligated to live in a libertarian society and that there is no struggle for the rule of society at stake , they can assent to those tenets of both positions that are held in common .
They and libertarians need not be at loggerheads .
They might even work together toward a common aim .
Imperfect master rules
How can a religious faith that depends on God find common ground with a political creed that is expressly secular ?
The answer is that their master rules generally overlap .
Christians have the Golden Rule and libertarians have the non-aggression rule .
But before outlining the details , we need to understand the difficulties of finding perfect rules .
Most will be found wanting in particular instances .
St. Thomas Aquinas distinguished between a " speculative reason " and a " practical reason . "
A speculative reason is a general reason that holds true generally , but as the details of particular cases are added speculative reason may fail , in which case practical reason enters .
In the Summa , St. Thomas ( I of II , 94 - 4 ) points out that general rules sometimes fail as the level of detail expands .
He mentions not restoring goods held in trust if they will be used for harm .
One would not give a man ’s gun back to him if one felt sure he was going to murder with it .
Now this action violates the non-aggression axiom , but not the Golden Rule .
The same might be said of abortion , although libertarians are still wrestling with this issue .
Both the Golden Rule and the non-aggression rule are matters of speculative reason .
They look to truth without fail .
But practical reason is concerned with contingent matters , and in particular cases the general principles will be found to fail .
Non-aggression will fail in some instances .
So may the Golden Rule .
For example , what if I have to steal to save a life ?
Is this act a good act ?
Or what if the owner of an oasis in the desert denies me water and I steal some ?
Is that a good act ?
We find we need to amend or extend our master rules to achieve justice .
We might need to add that in some circumstances stealing is good if the actions of others amount to murder or if others do not fulfill their Golden Rule obligations .
We might not give a man his gun if we believe our act will contribute to murder .
But as general rules of " speculative reason , " we still adhere to our master rules .
Libertarians will still say that physical aggression is unjustifiable or that non-aggression is good , and they will be correct to do so .
With the understanding that we are not likely to achieve perfection in master rules , we may examine the Golden Rule and the non-aggression rule .
The Golden Rule
Let us look at what the Golden Rule means , or at least some of what it means .
The explanation will contain few direct references to the great well of knowledge provided by the Holy Bible or to the theology of the Old and New Testaments .
Such references would deepen and underscore every point that is made , and entire books have been written on many such aspects .
The explanation will not tap the depths of religious feelings that lie within many of us or address practical utility .
The goal is the simple one of showing some reasoning behind the Golden Rule in order to bring out the common ground between it and the non-aggression rule .
We start from afar .
Christians believe that God is the Creator of man .
This implies that God owns man .
All of us , Christian and non-Christian , have been provided with free will and reason that help us decide matters .
For example , should we steal ?
Should we murder ?
We must choose .
We must decide .
Even after we are instructed on these matters , we still must choose .
Suppose that God is our Creator .
Since God created us as living creatures ,
He must have intended for us to live .
If we murder each other , this goes against His evident intention .
Furthermore , murdering another person is destroying God ’s property .
Calvin writes that " undoubtedly God would have the remains of His image , which still shines forth in men , to continue in some estimation , so that all might feel that every homicide is an offence against Him . "
What shall we choose : to murder or not to murder ?
The answer hinges on our relationship to God .
We either believe in Him or not .
We either respect Him or we do not .
We either are thankful to Him for his creation or we are not .
We either reverence Him or not .
It was God ’s will to create other men than us and have them live .
Shall we submit to His will or not ?
Shall we obey God or shall we rebel against Him ?
This is only the beginning , for we have also been advised to love God with all our heart and all our soul and all our mind .
To do so is quite natural , for we are His children , and children love their parents .
But it is also difficult because we do not see God .
If we seek Him , we shall find Him .
This may take faith .
Our first most basic choice is how we choose to relate to God .
If we reject God altogether as an atheist might or do not accept
Him by remaining agnostic , that is one course .
The only other course is to submit to God , acknowledge His primary position , and love Him as the Father .
This is feasible for anyone .
God is accessible to all at any time .
What are the implications of these two opposing choices ?
If we accept God , we do not want others to treat us badly since we view ourselves as God ’s creation and property .
By the same token , we do not want to treat others badly as they are also God ’s children .
This means that we are brothers , and it is natural not to mistreat one ’s brothers .
Indeed , although we are developing a logical argument here , the fact is that we may come to God based upon the feelings we have for our fellow man or in any number of other ways .
Choosing
God therefore implies a master rule , the Golden Rule : " And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise . "
This Rule arises logically from choosing to acknowledge God .
If we do unto others expecting the same , we all live and we live better .
If we live , it is as God intended .
Quite evidently , when we choose God we do not murder .
But we also do not steal from others because that also diminishes their life and the fruits of their labor .
We respect the property of others .
We do not extend undeserved violence to others as that too mistreats them .
But these implications of choosing God are the very same implications of the libertarian ’s non-aggression rule .
In Rothbard ’s words : " … no one has the right to aggress against the legitimate or just property of another . "
Pope Leo XIII , speaking of the earlier Pope Paul III , is quoted as follows : " Then Paul III , anxious with a fatherly love as to the condition of the Indians and of the Moorish slaves , came to this last determination , that in open day , and , as it were , in the sight of all nations , he declared that they all had a just and natural right of a threefold character , namely , that each of them was master of his own person , that they could live together under their own laws , and that they could acquire and hold property for themselves . "
There is evidently no conflict between the self - ownership implied by the non-aggression rule and the Catholic view of this earthly matter .
And Gary North has gone to great lengths showing that the Christian view is compatible with the libertarian view in this respect .
We conclude that libertarians who are not Christians may in fact behave and strive to behave indistinguishably in many respects from Christians because the libertarian non-aggression rule is a special case of the Golden Rule .
At the same time , as we have seen , in some practical situations differences may also crop up .
The abortion case is an important instance , and the war in Iraq is another .
These should not end the conversation between Christians and libertarians , two groups whose master rules are closely related even if not coincident .
Choosing violence
Romano Guardini writes of Jesus : " Jesus did not exercise his will like a soldier making an attack … Jesus did not use force …he fully respects man ’s freedom .
He never does it violence , by suggestion or inspiration , fear or surprise .
The responsibility of the listener is always elicited and guided to the point where it must pronounce its own Yes or No . "
It is up to us to choose .
If we do not submit to God , we place our will above His .
We make man the measure of all things .
We make our self the arbiter of all things .
Once we are in conflict with Him , we lose a reason for not coming into conflict with others .
We have rejected Him and found no reason to respect Him or His works .
Our master rule of life need not be the Golden Rule .
It might be , but it might be many other rules .
It may be to do whatever satisfies us or whatever we think satisfies us with the end of glorifying our self , not God .
Our alternative master rule now includes such possibilities as doing whatever we can get away with , even if it harms others .
It includes treating others as instruments for our satisfaction .
It includes murder if that satisfies us .
It may be that we will murder in the name of the Lord when it is really our own goals that matter to us .
Dostvsky dramatized this in the character of Ivan Karamazov who realized that if there were no God , then everything was permitted .
Obviously , at an individual level most of us who do not choose
God do not necessarily follow this kind of anti-God master rule to the hilt .
Most of us have consciences and behave more or less morally ; and we may behave more morally than Christians who are Christians in name only .
But , having not accepted God ’s authority , we either manufacture a substitute or look elsewhere .
This frequently leads to difficulties , disappointments , and evils .
It may mean looking inward , which is a burden , but very often we run away from our selves and look outwards to external authorities .
We look in all sorts of places , thereby placing other gods before God .
One place we look is the state .
And since our master rule now allows undeserved violence against others , we may accept the state ’s constant use of violence against innocent people .
Christians believe in God and therefore the Golden Rule .
But when they support the state and its violence , they act in opposition to the Golden Rule .
They act evilly .
Their acts become indistinguishable from those who do not choose God and go on to impose or support violence on others .
Aggressive power employed over others is evil .
The state ’s aggressive actions implicitly deny and reject God as do all aggressive actions .
Christians should be anti-state .
Support the state ?
The Holy Bible contains sacred text that at times seems to support the state , but the revealed knowledge that is in the Bible has come through men and women .
We would not have religious interpreters and teachers if these texts were always crystal clear and unambiguous in their meaning .
But these interpreters sometimes disagree , and they are also subject to earthly error .
In the end , we need to use good judgment in understanding what the Holy Bible says about God , man , and government .
This is a very large subject .
Gary North , for example , has written dozens of books in this area .
I can touch here upon only a few well - known points .
The Pharisees " took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk , " and they devised a dilemma for Jesus .
" Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ?
Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar , or not ? "
If Jesus answered " No , " he ’d be accused of rebellion against the empire .
If he answered " Yes , " he ’d break the commandment and place Cæsar above God.
Jesus recognized the temptation and answered " Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ? "
He replied " Render therefore unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar ’s ; and unto God the things that are God’s . "
Did Jesus support the empire or the state ?
Of course not .
His mission of saving souls can be construed in a number of ways , such as calling for an individual to have faith and make a choice for God , but he certainly did not call for men to save their own souls or anyone else ’s by choosing the state .
( And some , like James Redford , interpret his message as anarchistic . )
Even within his response , there is no support for a state that does violence .
What are the things that are Cæsar’s ?
They are the things that properly are his , because Jesus surely would not counsel breaking the commandments .
And what are they ?
They do not include those things that he takes by aggression .
Quite possibly , Jesus may have meant that Cæsar should rightfully be given nothing .
And what of the word " render ? "
( Some translations use the word " give . " )
Render has the somewhat negative connotation of surrendering or giving up what one has to .
Even if it does not have this secondary meaning , what one renders to Cæsar is involuntarily extracted .
Jesus may have meant that one should not violently resist Cæsar ’s exactions .
His own life suggested an entirely different means of dealing with publicans than by violence .
St. Paul in Romans 13 can be similarly interpreted as not supporting the state and Redford has done this at some length for us .
St. Paul refers to the rulers and powers " ordained of God " as " the minister of God to thee for good , " who have a right to execute wrath upon those who do evil deeds .
This cannot mean state authorities who themselves are doing evil deeds .
He then counsels " For this cause pay ye tribute also , " the " cause " being the maintenance of a proper authority that deals with those who do evil .
This does not encompass the welfare / warfare state whose activities extend far beyond this cause and to pervasive evil deeds .
And to top it off , St. Paul adds " Render therefore to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to whom honour . "
That which is due is that which is rightfully to be rendered .
If there is no right , there is no obligation to render .
In language that mirrors that of Jesus , St. Paul also greatly limits the obeisance owed to the state .
Conclusion
Libertarians are anti-state .
To be faithful to their creed , Christians should be anti-state once they penetrate the veil of the state and understand that its means are inherently violent .
This is not hard to see .
Every act of the state takes from some their property and livelihoods while others are made to gain .
These takings are thefts whether ordered by a king , a dictator , a Politburo , a Congress , or a majority .
In all instances , some people are involuntarily disadvantaged and others are advantaged .
States pervert the Golden Rule and the commandments .
Their crimes deny God and make man the sovereign .
No Christian can in good conscience voluntarily support a Cæsar — the state — whose violence goes against God .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
Keine Panik !
1. Tote Vögel im Spätwinter sind vollkommen normal in Deutschland .
„ Trotz der Vogelgrippe ist die Sterblichkeit der Vögel auf Rügen bisher nicht höher als in anderen Jahren “ , sagt Wolfgang Fiedler vom Max - Planck Institut für Ornithologie der taz .
Die allermeisten Vögel sterben an Auszehrung , Futtermangel und der Kälte .
Auf Rügen stirbt jedes Jahr allein die Hälfte der 1.200 Jungschwäne wegen der Witterung .
2. „ Menschen haben keinen Grund zur Panik .
Weil sie eben keine Vögel sind “ , sagt der Vogelforscher Wolfgang Fiedler : Vogelgrippe ist eine Tierseuche wie Maul - und - Klauen - Seuche oder Schweinepest .
Sie hat nichts mit der menschlichen Influenza zu tun , betont auch Thomas Mettenleiter vom Bundesinstitut für Tiergesundheit .
3. Das H5N1 - Virus ist in Deutschland schon angekommen .
Der Vogelzug – die Rückkehr vieler Vögel aus ihren Winterquartieren – wird die Situation aber nicht signifikant verschlimmern , meint der Ornithologe Wolfgang Fidler .
Das H5N1 - Virus wird sehr wahrscheinlich auch in weiteren Bundesländern auftauchen .
Für die Menschen bedeutet das , zu lernen , mit der Vogelgrippe zu leben – wie mit anderen Tierseuchen oder alltäglichen Gefahren .
4. Eine Infektion des Menschen durch H5N1 ist sehr selten .
Wer nicht mit Körperflüssigkeiten , Kot und Blut infizierter Tiere in Kontakt kommt , hat nichts zu befürchten .
Eine Übertragung des Virus von Mensch zu Mensch wurde auch noch nie beobachtet .
Die Mehrzahl der infizierten Menschen hat sich angesteckt , weil sie sehr engen Kontakt zu Geflügel hatten .
Davon waren vor allem in Asien in den vergangenen neun Jahren Menschen durch die pathogene Variante „ H5N1 Asia “ betroffen .
5 . Selbst wenn sich das H5N1 - Virus in Deutschland weiter ausbreitet , wird die Krankheit beherrschbar bleiben .
Die Türkei ist dafür ein gutes Beispiel .
Ähnlich wie auf Rügen liefen dort die Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung des Virus nur schleppend an .
Sogar Menschen hatten sich dort an ihrem Hausgeflügel infiziert .
Von insgesamt 21 infizierten Menschen konnten in der Türkei 17 durch frühzeitige medizinische Hilfe gerettet werden .
Mit einer konsequenten Tötung der gefährdeten Geflügelbestände wurde die Seuche gestoppt .
Deshalb wurden seit Dezember mehr als 2,2 Millionen Vögel getötet .
Seitdem gab es dort keine neuen menschlichen Infektionen mehr .
6. Das Risiko , an der Vogelgrippe zu sterben , ist statistisch kaum messbar .
Weltweit gab es bisher 91 Todesfälle .
Diese Zahl sollte man im Vergleich zu anderen Gefahren betrachten : Allein in Deutschland starben nach Angaben des Statistischen Bundesamtes im Jahr 2004 19.094 Bürger an Lungenentzündung und Grippe .
462.600 Menschen wurden im vergangenen Jahr in Deutschland im Straßenverkehr verletzt , 6.606 Menschen wurden getötet .
Wir werden lernen , auch mit der Vogelgrippe zu leben .
7. Offenbar gibt es große Unterschiede , wie empfindlich Tiere auf das H5N1 - Virus reagieren .
Tauben können daran erkranken , sie übertragen es aber kaum , hat das Friedrich - Loeffler - Institut auf der Insel Riems herausgefunden .
Im Gegensatz zu Geflügel infizieren sich auch Singvögel , Krähen , Störche und Spatzen nur schwer oder gar nicht .
Haustiere könnten sich in Deutschland nur anstecken , wenn sie mit infizierten Tieren in Kontakt kommen .
Katzen wurden in Versuchen gezielt mit H5N1 infiziert .
In Thailand untersuchte das Nationale Institut für Tiergesundheit 629 Straßenhunde : Das Vogelgrippevirus wurde in keinem Hund nachgewiesen , allerdings wurden bei 160 Hunden Antikörper für H5N1 gefunden .
Hunde und Katzen sollten keine Vögel jagen .
Dann besteht für sie keine Gefahr .
8. H5N1 ist nicht gleich H5N1 .
Es gibt hoch ansteckende und wenig ansteckende Varianten des Virus .
Die Diagnose „ H5N1 “ gibt noch keine endgültige Auskunft über die Gefährlichkeit des Virus im Einzelfall .
Dafür muss man das Erbgut des Virus genauer untersuchen .
Das moderne Referenzlabor des Bundesinstituts für Tiergesundheit kann diese Analyse innerhalb eines Tages durchführen .
9. Eine „ normale “ Grippeimpfung kann bei Menschen die mögliche Gefahr durch das H5N1 - Virus drastisch reduzieren .
Denn Virologen befürchten , dass sich das Vogelgrippevirus im Körper eines an der „ normalen “ Grippe erkrankten Patienten mit dem Erreger der Menschen - Influenza vermischt .
Er kann so die hochinfektiöse Eigenschaft des Grippevirus übernehmen .
Doch je weniger Menschen den normalen Grippevirus in sich tragen , umso geringer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit , dass die beiden Influenzaviren im Körper eines Menschen aufeinander treffen und es zu einem Genaustausch kommt .
10 . Impfstoffe gegen die normale Grippe sind ausreichend vorhanden .
Zwar gab es vor einigen Monaten einen Engpass , der ist aber überwunden .
Für Risikopatienten wie Kinder , ältere Menschen oder Kranke ist die Grippeimpfung kostenlos .
Bei anderen Patienten gehen die Krankenkassen jedoch mit der Kostenübernahme unterschiedlich um .
Einige übernehmen die Grippeimpfung , andere wiederum weigern sich .
Auf jeden Fall muss keine Praxisgebühr bezahlt werden .
11 . Der Verzehr von Geflügelfleisch und Eiern ist ungefährlich , da H5N1 in Deutschland nicht bei Nutzgeflügel auftaucht .
Eine Infektion von Geflügel würde sehr schnell erkannt werden , weil die Geflügelindustrie die Geflügelställe systematisch beobachtet .
Geflügel reagiert sehr empfindlich auf das Virus .
Die Krankheit bricht schnell aus , und die Tiere sterben in der Regel zwei Tage nach der Infektion .
Grundsätzlich empfiehlt das Bundesministerium für Verbraucherschutz , Geflügelfleisch und Eier zu kochen .
12 . Im Ernstfall ist Hilfe ist in Sicht .
Selbst wenn H5N1 mutiert , steht ein maßgeschneiderter Impfstoff binnen wenigen Wochen zur Verfügung .
Deutschlands größter Impfstoffhersteller GlaxoSmithKline startet im März erste klinische Studien für einen menschlichen H5N1 - Impfstoff .
„ Wir bereiten damit ein neues Herstellungsverfahren vor , das den Vollvirus von H5N1 für den Impfstoff verwendet und nicht nur Virusbestandteile “ , sagte Florian Matrius von GlaxoSmithKline .
Die Verwendung des Vollvirus erhöht die Wirkung der Impfung .
Sollte eine von Mensch zu Mensch übertragbare H5N1 - Variante auftauchen , würde nach kurzer Zeit ein passender Impfstoff verfügbar sein .
13 . Einen persönlichen Vorrat des Grippemittels Tamiflu anzulegen ist nicht nötig .
Ähnlich sinnvoll wäre es , sich schon mal auf Vorrat einen Herzschrittmacher zu besorgen .
Es ist äußerst unwahrscheinlich , dass Tamiflu jemals benötigt wird .
Es ist außerdem verschreibungspflichtig .
Den Gang zur Apotheke , um das Medikament auf Verdacht zu kaufen , kann man sich also sparen .
Ein falscher Einsatz von Tamiflu kann außerdem mehr schaden als nützen .
Das Medikament hat zudem eine begrenzte Haltbarkeit , wahrscheinlich müsste die eigene Packung Tamiflu entsorgt werden .
14 . Die Risikoeinschätzung für eine weltweite Pandemie hat sich auch durch die mit H5N1 infizierten Wildvögel in Mecklenburg - Vorpommern nicht verändert .
Untersuchungen zeigen , dass der jetzt in Deutschland angekommene Vogelgrippevirus gegenüber dem südostasiatischen Ausgangstyp keine wesentlich anderen Eigenschaften hat .
Er ist nicht infektiöser , die Vogelgrippe ist immer noch eine Tierseuche .
Nur wenn das Virus auch für den Menschen hochinfektiös wird , besteht die Gefahr einer weltweiten Pandemie .
Dazu muss es nicht kommen .
Zwar warnen Epidemiologen seit längerem schon , dass eine für Millionen von Menschen tödliche Grippepandemie die Welt heimsuchen könnte .
Doch dass H5N1 auch das Virus sein wird , das diese befürchtete Grippepandemie auslöst , ist nicht zwangsläufig .
Es kann auch ein ganz anderes Vogelgrippevirus sein .
Zum Beispiel ein Virustyp , der bisher als ziemlich harmlos eingestuft wird .
Bisher jedenfalls haben Wissenschaftler noch keine Hinweise gefunden , dass H5N1 seine infektiösen Eigenschaften verändert hat .
Dabei muss auch bedacht werden , dass das Virus sich jetzt schon seit fast zehn Jahren in Südostasien ausbreitet und Millionen von Tieren infiziert hat .
Das heißt , bisher war das Virus relativ stabil .
15 . Tiere können geimpft werden .
Für die Experten ist es fast nur noch eine Frage der Zeit , bis auch in Deutschland die ersten in die Ställe verbannten Nutztierbestände mit H5N1 infiziert sein werden .
Für manch einen Tierhalter kann das der finanzielle Ruin sein .
Das bedeutet aber noch nicht , dass es dann auch zu tödlichen Infektionen von Menschen kommen muss .
Die Vogelgrippeepidemie vor einigen Jahren in den Niederlanden hat gezeigt , dass auch flächendeckende Infektionen mit rigiden Maßnahmen in den Griff zu bekommen sind .
Rund 30 Millionen
Tiere wurden seinerzeit in den Niederlanden getötet .
Mehrere Menschen wurden infiziert , ein Tierarzt , der sehr engen Kontakt zu erkranktem Geflügel hatte , starb .
Unter anderem auch , weil er sich zu spät gegen die Vogelgrippe behandeln ließ .
In den Niederlanden ging man auch dazu über , alles Geflügel in der Nachbarschaft von Infektionsherden gegen die Vogelgrippe zu impfen .
Die
Tiere dürfen dann nicht mehr importiert werden , weil nicht mehr unterschieden werden kann , ob sie geimpft worden sind oder ob sie Virusträger und - ausscheider sind .
In Deutschland gibt es noch massiven Widerstand gegen eine derartige Ringimpfung .
Vor allem die Geflügelzüchter sprechen sich dagegen aus , weil sie massive wirtschaftliche Einbußen befürchten .
Aber spätestens wenn auch bei uns Millionen von Tieren gekeult werden müssen , wird man vermutlich auch auf diese Maßnahme zurückgreifen .

The US says Parchin is suspicious ( photo : DigitalGlobe / Isis )
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) is trying to check US claims that tests linked to nuclear weapons ' development have taken place there .
The agency has threatened to refer Tehran to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions unless its inspectors get full co-operation .
Iran is under pressure over its nuclear programme , which it says is peaceful .
Parchin is a centre for munitions work about 30 km ( 19 miles ) south - east of Tehran , which the IAEA has sought to re-inspect since it was last there in January this year .
" We are pleased that we can confirm that IAEA inspectors got access to buildings at the Parchin site as we had requested , " a spokesman for the Vienna - based agency said .
' Positive sign '
A diplomat close to the IAEA told reporters that environmental samples had been taken from the complex .
Iran has also handed over documents and granted interviews with several senior officials thought linked to black market purchases of uranium enrichment technology , according to one diplomat quoted by the Associated Press .
A Western diplomat told the BBC the move to grant access to Parchin was a positive sign that Iran was responding to intense international pressure .
But Iran has also told the IAEA that it plans to continue processing uranium within weeks .
Tehran insists its uranium processing programme is designed to meet its energy needs .
But enriched uranium could be used to produce either nuclear energy or nuclear weapons .
If Tehran continues with the process , say diplomats , so will the suspicion that it is trying to obtain nuclear weapons .

A few “ superstar cities ” are thriving but strangely have virtually no resident middle class , according to a recent Brookings study covered in today ’s NYT .
SOME big American cities are flourishing as at no time in recent memory .
Places like New York and San Francisco appear to be richer and more dazzling than ever : crime remains low , new arrivals pour in , neighborhoods have risen from the dead .
New York is in the throes of the biggest building boom in 30 years , its population at an all - time high and climbing .
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proudly promotes his city as “ a luxury product . ”
But middle - class city dwellers across the country are being squeezed .
This time , they are being squeezed out by the rich as much , or more so , as by the poor — a casualty of high housing costs and the thinning out of the country ’s once broad economic middle .
The percentage of middle - income neighborhoods in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles , Chicago and Washington has dropped since 1970 , according to a recent Brookings Institution report .
[…]
Obviously , cities benefit economically from the presence of the rich .
Tax revenues go up when the rich pour into what some economists now call “ superstar cities , ” places like New York , San Francisco , San Diego , Boston and Washington that attract highly skilled people but have limits on the ability to build housing .
In New York , fewer than 13,000 of the 2.3 million households that pay income tax are expected to account for nearly 30 percent of city income tax paid in 2006 .
In the San Francisco Bay Area , the percentage of households earning more than $ 100,000 a year rose to over 30 percent in 2000 from approximately 7 percent in 1970 , said Joseph Gyourko , a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania .
“ Is that area worse off ? ” he asked .
“ At least so far , there ’s a lot of evidence that economically they ’re better off .
Land prices are really high , lots of people want to move there . ”
Edward L. Glaeser , a Harvard economist who studied 300 large cities with a range of levels of income inequality in the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s , says he found little evidence that those levels later affected the growth of housing prices , income or population there .
Of course , cities need police officers , firefighters , teachers .
But as long as they can get the labor they need from somewhere nearby , some economists say , middle - class shrinkage may not hurt .
In Southern California , developers import construction workers from Las Vegas and put them up in hotels ; costs go up but rich clients can pay .
Firefighters who want to live in high - priced cities can work two jobs , said W. Michael Cox , chief economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas .
“ I think it ’s great , ” he said .
“ It gives you portfolio diversification in your income . ”
Pay for essential workers like plumbers and cabdrivers will tend to go up , he said .
Professor Glaeser said : “ There ’s no obvious smoking gun saying cities will be substantially worse off .
There ’s a whole lot of America that does a very good job of taking care of the middle class .
The great sprawling edge cities of the American hinterland provide remarkably cheap housing , fast commutes , decent public services and incredibly cheap products available in big box stores .
As a New Yorker , I understand the view that exile from New York is consignment to hell ; but that ’s not accurate .
The majority of middle - class people that have moved out have presumably found themselves better lives out there . ”
But sociologists and many economists believe that there can be non-economic consequences for cities that lose a lot of middle - income residents .
The disappearance of middle - income neighborhoods can limit opportunities for upward mobility , the authors of the Brookings study said .
It becomes harder for lower - income homeowners to move up the property ladder , buy into safer neighborhoods , send their children to better schools and even make the kinds of personal contacts that can be a route to better jobs .
The Brookings study , which defined moderate - income families as those with incomes between 80 and 120 percent of the median for each area , found that the percentage of middle - income neighborhoods in the 100 largest metropolitan areas had dropped to 41 percent from 58 percent between 1970 and 2000 .
Only 23 percent of central city neighborhoods in 12 large metropolitan areas were middle income , down from 45 percent in 1970 .
[…]
With a dwindling middle class , rich and poor become more separate .
Alan Berube , an author of the Brookings study , said a two - tiered marketplace can develop : Whole Foods for the upper classes , bodegas for the lower , with no competition from stores courting the middle .
“ If the two models are check cashers on the one hand and major national financial institutions on the other , who ’s thinking about how to hold down costs for the basic consumer ? ” he asked .
Patterns in the iris can give away the secrets of your personality
They have detected patterns which show warm - heartedness and trust or neuroticism and impulsiveness .
The team from Orebro University read pits and lines in the irises of 428 people .
Experts said the study in Biological Psychology showed that at least some aspects of personality were determined by genetics .
You would not want to arrest somebody on the basis of their iris
Dr George Fieldman , psychologist
Close - up pictures were taken of the study participants ' irises , and they also filled out a questionnaire about their personalities .
The researchers looked at crypts ( pits ) and contraction furrows ( lines curving around the outer edge of the iris ) , which are formed when pupils dilate .
It was found that those with more crypts were likely to be tender , warm and trusting , while those with more furrows were more likely to be neurotic , impulsive and give in to cravings .
' Trajectories '
The researchers suggest that a neurodevelopmental gene called PAX6 could also play a major role .
It is known to help control the development of the iris in an embryo .
Previous research has also shown that a mutation of PAX6 is linked to impulsiveness and poor social skills .
The team , led by Dr Matt Larsson a behavioural scientist , said : " These findings support the notion that people with different iris configurations tend to develop along different trajectories in regards to personality .
" Differences in the iris can be used as a biomarker that reflects differences between people . "
Dr George Fieldman , principal lecturer in psychology at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College , said : " This is very interesting .
It shows that some aspects of personality have a genetic base and to identify them in the eye in this fascinating way is significant .
" It is surprising that this is possible .
But it seems that the old aphorism that ' the eyes are the window to the soul ' has some genetic basis . "
He said it opened up the possibility that security services could one day use the technique to analyse people .
Airports , including Heathrow , Manchester and Gatwick are already testing iris scanning to identify people - but are not to check personality traits .
But Dr Fieldman added : " Security services would have to use such technologies with some caution .
You would not want to arrest somebody on the basis of their iris . "

The desire of AT&T , Verizon , et al to end network neutrality and assert fees for access to connected customers represents a death wish .
Imagine the prospects of an info tech industry without “ software neutrality ” where Intel charged a fee to enhance software performance .
Pay Intel and your applications run faster .
The incentives driving Moore ’s Law disappear in this pay - to - play model .
Intel ’s profit maximizing incentives become serving the interests of software companies willing to spend the most on “ enhancing software performance ” not the end users of computers .
The meritocracy driving competition between software companies disappears as Intel picks winners and losers based on willingness to pay .
Innovation becomes permission based at Intel ’s discretion .
The Internet does not exist without net neutrality .
Consider the misleading assertion that tinkering with network neutrality simply amounts to adding class of service as in the case of air travel or HOV lanes on highways .
Network neutrality refers to the uses of the Internet not the quality of access .
There already exists an infinite range of classes of service as regards Internet access .
End users pay for what they get regarding the performance and capacity of Internet access .
Internet content and service providers like Google , Amazon , and Vonage already pay for access to the Internet .
The telco and cable companies have in mind creating another type of customer not a class of service .
They want suppliers to pay for the right of transit .
It amounts to airlines charging Time Warner for the right of readers to take Time magazine on an airplane .
It means charging Ford tolls in addition to drivers for the right of Ford cars to use highways .
The pursuit of tolls based on content and application type requires something that does not exist in the Internet today .
It requires a linkage between content type and transport .
Equipment providers like Cisco increasingly deliver products offering packet by packet inspection in the name of network management , but implementing the access fees means giving billing systems the ability to monitor and track the types of applications and content customers use .
Setting aside the chilling privacy concerns , the
telephone network ’s linkage of usage to transport represents the primary obstacle to service creation I observed during five years at Bell Labs in the 1990’s .
Forcing innovators to change the network in order to implement an application means an end to innovation .
The end of innovation means the end of growth in demand for Internet access .
An end to innovation probably represents the main motivation behind opposition to network neutrality rather than merely the desire for a second revenue stream from Internet access .
The dominant providers of Internet access have powerful incentitives to protect their existing voice and video revenue streams from Internet enabled innovations .
The ability to add tolls by Internet application end the prospect of Vonage and VoIP as a threat to Plain Old Telephone Service .
It ends the prospect of new Internet enabled video distribution models that might compete with CATV .
Network neutrality allows end users to choose winners and losers in an application meritocracy
that threatens service providers long dependent on barriers to entry .
The idea that Yahoo could pay Verizon to improve performance over Google means Verizon not the end user decides which search engine wins .
Beware of the monopolist that wants the “ market ” to decide .
If there actually existed a healthy market for Internet access , users would certainly switch away from service providers tinkering with performance based on kickbacks from content companies .
The toll collecting ambitions of the telco ’s and cable co’s hinge on the absence of market forces .
The fights against municipal wireless initiatives and lobbying budgets that exceed R&D budgets arise to defeat any leakage of market power .
Network neutrality
forces a virtuous cycle where winning requires making offers faster and cheaper .
This dynamic accounts for growth in the info tech industry as platform improvements expand the range of possible applications .
Eliminating network neutrality means giving one participant in the value chain a tool to extract a greater share of revenues without delivering greater value .
The best effort Internet holds far more promise than the metering of scarcity associated with QoS because “ best effort ” continues to improve .
The improvement in modems set the pace for expansion of the dialup Internet during the 1990’s .
Lowest common denominator broadband access continues to govern Internet health as access capacity and performance determines addressable applications .
Continuous improvements in cost performance represents the key to growth just like every other area of info tech .
The network management quality of service argument for ending network neutrality misses the fact QoS does not work outside a private network environment where a single entity controls usage end to end .
The implementation of QoS remains limited to private networks , because it makes the negotiation of interconnection compensation intractable .
The large info tech companies like Cisco , Microsoft , and Yahoo view themselves as arms dealers content to accept business from both sides of the net neutrality debate .
Intel has proven a more consistent friend of the Internet as with its Digital Communities effort supporting municipal broadband initiatives .
Intel may recognize the connection between meager US broadband offers and the decline of the proportion of Intel revenue attributable to the US from 41 % to 18 % over the last 5 years .
The future growth prospects of the trillion dollar info tech industry depend as much on network neutrality as on Moore ’s Law , so the arms dealer point of view represents a very short sighted one .
The Bell company and cable MSO efforts to protect existing revenue streams means preserving the 20th century telco business model of controlling scarcity .
The growth of the info tech industry comes from delivering surplus value as the means to generate demand .
The info tech industry needs the find a way to protect network neutrality , because the Internet will cease to exist without it .

It was never going to be easy to put a man as imperious and wily as Saddam Hussein on trial .
Many Iraqis think Saddam has been given too much latitude in court
The chief judge has been remarkably lenient to Saddam and his half - brother , Barzan al - Tikriti , and they have taken advantage of this .
But does this mean , as some people in the Western media are starting to say , that the trial is descending into farce ?
Simply because Saddam Hussein 's trial is different from the court practices of , say , Britain or France , that does not make it farcical .
It is true that many Iraqis , including senior ministers in the government , believe that Saddam has been given too much latitude .
It is also true that Saddam often manages to distract everyone 's attention , at a time when the evidence is particularly graphic and terrible .
Yet none of this means that the senior judge has lost control of his court .
Leniency
Judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin is a quiet , polite , highly intelligent man , who wants the world to see that he dispenses a very different kind of justice from Saddam 's own courts .
In the old days the statue of justice outside the law faculty at Baghdad University was a figure of Saddam himself , holding a sword and scales .
Judge Rizgar has worn Saddam down through sheer politeness
It would be easy to shout Saddam down , or silence him , but that would be to return to the habits of the past .
Instead , the judge listens courteously to what is said .
And it works .
At the start of the trial , Saddam refused even to give his name : " You know who I am , " he told the judges aggressively .
Yet by force of sheer politeness , Judge Rizgar wore him down .
And so when he was asked to plead , Saddam said he was not guilty - which represented a remarkable degree of co-operation from a man who had earlier denied that the court had any legitimacy .
Saddam Hussein could , if he chose , force the judges to silence him , and to treat him with brutality .
All he has to do is to refuse to accept the usual conventions of courtroom behaviour .
But as long as Judge Rizgar treats his prisoners with leniency and politeness , they seem prepared to follow the rules .
Sign of success
The worst feature of the trial is not what the accused are allowed to say , but what the world is not allowed to hear .
The American company in charge of broadcasting the proceedings frequently blanks out the sound of what Saddam and the others say , and sometimes cuts the vision as well .
Treating Saddam harshly would lead people to see him as a martyr
The impression of control and censorship is very strong - and yet the things which cannot be broadcast are often trivial enough .
Sometimes Saddam and his half - brother Barzan , use their opportunities cleverly .
Barzan , for instance , kept calling one of the prosecuting counsel " Comrade prosecutor " .
In the end the prosecutor got angry , and told him to stop .
" Why , Comrade prosecutor ? " Barzan asked .
" You and I were comrades in the Ba'ath Party for so many years . "
But such moments are rare .
For the most part , Barzan comes across as a brute and a bully , while Saddam seems increasingly vague and inclined to wander in his wits .
The accusation that he had been tortured seems to have been made merely in order to distract attention from some particularly effective evidence about Saddam 's methods of torture .
He has never complained about being tortured before , although he has had plenty of opportunity .
If the judge treated Saddam more roughly , he would seem like a martyr .
The fact that he does not is a sign of success , not of failure .
On his FAQ page , Trevor Blackwell suggests that you can partially offset your personal carbon footprint by landfilling any paper you happen to use , as well as yard waste , kitchen scraps , and the like .
Ideologically I 'm on the fence on this one .
I 'm something of a treehugger , but I also get annoyed by the sort of feel - good do - nothing environmentalism that pervaded the popular consciousness in the early 90's .
I 'm skeptical , so I thought I 'd take a look at the numbers .
In 2003 , global carbon emissions amounted to 6.8 billion tons .
Global paper production amounted to 255 million tons .
Even if treated as a pure " carbon equivalent " , sequestering all paper produced that year could offset only about 3.7 % of global carbon emissions .
The carbon content is probably similar to that of cellulose , in other words about half by weight .
Still , a percent or three is nothing to sneeze at .
As an aside , I think it 's pretty clear that reducing paper use reduces the amount of carbon pumped into in the atmosphere .
Paper - grade wood probably costs about $ 0.10 / pound in smallish quantities ( i.e. by the cord for firewood ) , whereas paper costs about ten times that ( or so says Froogle ) , and probably most of that cost is either directly or indirectly related to energy consumption ( and hence carbon emissions ) .
So making extra paper to bury is probably a losing strategy when it comes to sequestering carbon .
Therefore Blackwell 's argument hinges on two premises : that recycling paper does n't consume significantly less energy than producing " virgin " paper , and that paper buried in a landfill releases it 's carbon significantly more slowly than the forest from whence it came .
The first premise is somewhat shaky .
The production process itself uses 60 % less energy from scrap paper than from virgin fiber ( I can't confirm this statistic on the web from it 's supposed source ) .
Curbside collection uses additional fuel , since you have twice as many trucks driving the same distance , albeit less heavily loaded and / or less frequently .
But trucking trees from a forest to a pulp mill does n't happen for free either .
I 'm going to call the transport energy roughly a wash , and hence the overall energy balance is clearly in favor of recycling .
The second premise is a bit more solid , given that newspapers buried in landfills are typically still legible after half a century .
However the time scales for carbon sequestration to be considered successful are somewhat longer ( converting the paper to charcoal might be an answer , but that still involves separating it from the MSW ) .
Trevor 's scheme is basically a way to use trees as CO2 collectors while making themselves temporarily useful as TPS reports .
I wholeheartedly agree with this general principle , but I 'm not convinced the sequestered carbon from a sheet of paper " pays " for the extra energy required to pulp the trees versus shredding , de-inking , and the other steps needed to prepare recycled paper for use in paper production .
Recycling economics are such that for anything ( found in MSW ) other than Aluminum cans , recycling neither saves much money nor costs much extra .
Factoring atmospheric carbon into the question , in my mind , does n't change the answer much either .
Given that recycling can be kind of a pain in the ass , I guess I can get behind people like Trevor not bothering to do it .
For me personally however , I pay for garbage disposal , but not for disposal of recyclables .
I loosely fill two or three kitchen bags a month at home , with the majority of my household waste ( at least by weight ) going into two or three recycling bins .
So I 'm not about to cough up extra dough ( for more frequent garbage pickups ) just so that I can sequester at best a small fraction of a fairly trivial amount of carbon .
How Django processes a request
In a comment he left yesterday , Jonathan Snook posed an excellent challenge : document the chain of how Django processes a request , from start to finish , with plenty of detail on the various things being called internally and links to the appropriate documentation .
Simon Willison once wrote such a document , but it was a fairly high - level view and a fair number of things have changed since then , so I ’m going to take a stab at it myself , and hopefully the result will be comprehensible .
Note : this is a first draft .
Not a finished product , not a complete listing .
Expect it to change frequently as I work on it .
Ideally I ’ll be able to get some help generating a visualization at some point , but for now I ’ll stick to plain text .
Where official documentation for an item is available I ’ll link to it .
For items which do n’t yet have documentation I ’ll provide links to the current locations of the relevant code in the Django repository — these locations may change over time , particularly because I ’m often going to be linking to line numbers in individual files , but I ’ll do my best to keep them up to date .
If you see something here that ’s incorrect , or spot something I ’ve left out or could have explained better , please leave a comment to let me know .
Updated October 2 , 2006 : I ’ve just gone through and done quite a bit of updating of this article ; several references to places in the code needed to be updated , and I rewrote a few things to reflect some shuffling around of internal bits that ’s taken place recently .
Updated November 28 , 2006 : Added a note about when the database connection is closed .
Updated December 20 , 2006 : linked to notes on the Django wiki about the dispatcher .
Let ’s get started .
Incoming !
The very first thing that happens is that something else invokes Django .
That happens in one of two ways :
Apache / mod_python is the server setup , in which case the request is handed to Django by mod_python creating an instance of django.core.handlers.modpython.ModPythonHandler .
Something else is the server , in which case it needs to be WSGI - compliant .
In this situation , an instance of django.core.handlers.wsgi.WsgiHandler is created by the server .
Both of those classes inherit from django.core.handlers.base .
BaseHandler , which contains common code needed for any type of request .
I ’ve got a handle on it
When one of the above handlers is instantiated , a couple things happen immediately :
The handler imports your Django settings file .
The handler imports Django ’s custom exception classes .
The handler calls its own load_middleware method , which loads all the middleware classes it finds listed in the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting and introspects them .
That last bit is somewhat complicated , so let ’s look at it in detail .
A middleware class can hook into any of four phases of processing : request , view , response and exception .
It does so by defining methods named , appropriately enough , process_request , process_view , process_response and process_exception .
The middleware can define any or all of these depending on what functionality it wants to provide .
When the handler introspects the middleware , it looks for methods with those names , and builds up four lists which are stored as instance variables of the handler :
_request_middleware is a list of the process_request methods ( in each case these will be the actual methods , so they ’re directly callable ) from any middleware classes which defined them .
_view_middleware is a list of the process_view methods from any middleware classes which defined them .
_response_middleware is a list of the process_response methods from any middleware classes which defined them .
_exception_middleware is a list of the process_exception methods from any middleware classes which defined them .
Green light : now begin
Now the handler is ready to really begin processing , so it fires the dispatcher signal request_started ( the internal dispatcher in Django allows various components to advertise what they ’re doing , and allows other bits of code to listen for certain events ; it ’s currently not documented officially , but there are some notes on the wiki ) .
Then it instantiates a subclass of django.http .
HttpRequest .
Depending on the handler , this may be an instance of django.core.handlers.modpython.ModPythonRequest or it may be an instance of django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIRequest .
The two different classes are needed because the mod_python and WSGI API s pass in the request information in different formats , and that information needs to be parsed into a single standard format Django can work with .
Once an HttpRequest of some sort exists , the handler calls its own get_response method , passing the HttpRequest as the only argument .
This is where nearly all of the actual activity happens .
Middleware , round 1
The first thing get_response does is loop through the handler ’s _request_middleware instance variable and call each method in that list , passing in the HttpRequest instance as an argument .
These methods have the option of short - circuiting the rest of the process and immediately causing get_response to return , by returning a value themselves ( if they do so , the return value needs to be an instance of django.
http .
HttpResponse , which we ’ll talk about in a bit ) .
If one of them does so , that ’s it and we ’re back into the main handler code ; get_response wo n’t even wait to see what the other middleware classes wanted to do , it will just return and the handler will go into its response phase .
More commonly , though , the middleware methods applied here simply do some processing and decide whether to add , remove or supplement attributes of the request .
Resolution time
Assuming that none of the middlewares which acted on the request short - circuited straight to a response , the handler next tries to resolve the requested URL .
It looks in the settings file for a setting called ROOT_URLCONF , and hands that , along with a base URL of / , as arguments to create an instance of django.core.urlresolvers.RegexURLResolver , then calls the RegexURLResolver ‘s resolve method with the requested URL path .
The URL resolver follows a fairly simple pattern .
For each item in the urlpatterns list generated by the URL configuration file specified by the ROOT_URLCONF setting , it checks whether the requested URL path matches that item ’s regular expression ; if so , there are two options :
If the item has a call to include , the resolver chops off the bit of the URL that matched , moves to the URL configuration file specified by the include and begins iterating over the items in its urlpatterns list .
Depending on the depth and modularity of your URL hierarchy , this may be repeated several times .
Otherwise , the resolver returns three items : the view function specified by the matched item , a list of non-named matched groups from the URL ( to be used as positional arguments for the view ) and a dictionary of keyword arguments , built from a combination of any named matched groups in the URL and any extra keyword arguments specified in that line in the URLConf .
Note that this stops at the first match which specifies a view , so it ’s best to have your URL configuration proceed from more specific regexes to less specific ones , in order to ensure that the resolver does n’t match one of the less specific ones first and end up returning the wrong view function .
If no matches are found , the resolver raises the exception django.core.urlresolvers.Resolver404 , a subclass of the exception django.
http.Http404 .
We ’ll get to how that ’s handled a little later on .
Middleware , round 2
Once it knows the view function it will be using and what arguments to pass to it , the handler looks at its _view_middleware list , and calls each method in that list , passing the HttpRequest , the view function , the list of positional arguments for the view and the dictionary of keyword arguments for the view .
Again , it ’s possible for middleware to intervene at this stage and force the handler to return immediately .
Into the view
If processing is still going at this point , the handler calls the view function .
Views in Django are somewhat nebulous because only a few requirements are placed on them :
They must be callable .
They must accept as their first positional argument an instance of django.
http .
HttpRequest .
.
They must either raise an exception or return an instance of django.
http .
HttpResponse .
Beyond that , the sky ’s the limit .
Most commonly , though , views will use Django ’s database API to create , retrieve , update or delete something in the database , and they ’ll load and render a template to display something to the end user .
Templates
Django ’s template system is two - faceted : there ’s one part that ’s HTML with a few extra things mixed in and is mostly used by designers , and one part that ’s pure Python and is used by programmers .
From an HTML author ’s point of view , Django ’s template system is pretty simple .
There are three constructs you need to know about :
Variable references .
In a template they look like this : {{ foo }} .
Template filters , which act on the above .
Using the filter bar on the example above would look like this : {{ foo|bar }} .
Generally these are used for output formatting ( e.g. , running Textile over something , formatting a date , etc. )
Template tags .
They look like this : { % baz %} .
This is where the “ logic ” of templates is implemented , you can do things like { % if foo %} , { % for bar in foo %} , and so on , and if and for are template tags .
Variable references work in a fairly simple way ; if you ’re just printing a variable directly , as in {{ foo }} , the template system just outputs it .
The only complexity here is when you do something like {{ foo .
bar }} ; in that case , the template system tries a few things in order :
First it tries a dictionary - style lookup , to see if foo [ ‘ bar ’ ] exists .
If it does , then that value is output and that ’s the end of the process .
If dictionary lookup fails , next the template system tries an attribute lookup , to see if foo . bar exists .
It also checks whether the attribute is callable , and tries calling it in that case .
If attribute lookup fails , the template system tries looking it up as a list index .
If all of these fail , the template system outputs the value of the setting TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID , which defaults to an empty string .
Template filters are simply Python functions which accept a value and an argument , and return a new value .
For example , the date filter takes a Python datetime object as its value and a standard strftime formatting string as its argument , and returns the result of applying that formatting string to that datetime object .
Template tags are where things are a bit complicated , and where you get close to how the Django template system really works .
The structure of a Django template
Internally , a Django template is represented as a collection of ‘ nodes ’ ; these are Python classes which all inherit from the base node class django.
template .
Node .
Node s can do various sorts of processing , but they have one thing in common : every Node must have a method called render which accepts as its second argument ( the first argument , of course , will be the Node instance ) an instance of django.
template .
Context , which is a dictionary - like object containing all the variables which are accessible to the template .
The render method of a Node must return a string , but if the Node is meant to carry out some task other than output ( for example , if it ’s meant to modify the template context by adding , removing or modifying variables in the Context instance passed to it ) it can return an empty string .
Django includes a number of subclasses of Node which provide useful functions ; each of the built - in template tags , for example , is handled by a subclass of Node ( e.g. , there ’s an IfNode which implements the if tag , a ForNode which implements the for tag , etc. ) .
All of the built - in tags are found in django.
template .
defaulttags .
In reality , all of the template constructs described above are Node s of some sort , and so is plain text ; a variable lookup is handled by a VariableNode , filters , by their nature , get applied in a VariableNode , tags are Node s of various types and plain text is a TextNode .
Generally , a view renders a template by carrying out the following steps , in order :
Loading the template to be rendered ; this is handled by the function django.template.loader.get_template , which can use any of several methods to locate the desired template file .
The get_template function returns an instance of django. template .
Template , which is an object containing the parsed template and methods for using it .
Instantiating a Context to be used in rendering the template ; if the Context subclass django .
template .
RequestContext is used , additional context - processing functions will be applied which can automatically add variables which were not defined in the view .
The constructor method for Context takes a dictionary of key / value pairs ( which will become the variable names / values for the template ) as its only argument ; RequestContext takes an instance of HttpRequest and a dictionary .
Calling the Template instance ’s render method , with the Context object as the first positional argument .
The return value of the Template ‘s render method is a string , which is the concatenation of the return values of the render methods of all the Template ‘s constituent Node s , called in the order in which they occur in the Template .
Response time , sort of
Once a template has been rendered , or some other sort of suitable output has been generated , the view is responsible for creating an instance of django.
http .
HttpResponse .
The constructor for this class takes two optional arguments :
A string ( which should be the first positional argument , or the keyword argument content ) which will be the body of the response .
Most of the time , this will be the output of rendering a template , but it does n’t have to be ; you can pass any valid Python string in here .
A value for the Content - Type header of the response ( which should be the second positional argument , or the keyword argument mime_type ) .
If you do n’t provide this argument , Django will fill in the value of the setting DEFAULT_MIME_TYPE and the value of the setting DEFAULT_CHARSET which , if you have n’t changed them from the defaults in Django ’s global settings file , will be “ text / html ” and “ utf - 8 ” , respectively .
Middleware , round 3 : exception edition
If the view function , or something which happens inside it , raises an exception , then get_response ( I know we spent a while digging into views and templates , but once the view returns or raises we pick up again in the middle of the handler ’s get_response method ) will loop through its _exception_middleware instance variable and call each method there , passing the HttpRequest and the exception as arguments .
Hopefully one of those methods will instantiate and return an HttpResponse .
Still not responding ?
At this point it ’s possible that there still is n’t an HttpResponse ; this could be due to a number of factors :
The view might not have returned a value .
The view might have raised an exception that none of the middleware was able to deal with .
A middleware method that was trying to deal with an exception might have raised a new exception itself .
When this happens , get_response falls back to its own exception handling mechanisms ; these come in several layers :
If the execption was Http404 and the DEBUG setting is True , get_response will execute the view django.views.debug.technical_404_response , passing the HttpRequest and the exception as arguments .
This view displays information about the patterns the URL resolver tried to match against .
If DEBUG is False , and the exception was Http404 , get_response calls the URL resolver ’s resolve_404 method ; this method looks at the URL configuration to determine which view has been specified for handling 404 errors .
This defaults to django.views.defaults.page_not_found , but can be overridden in the URL configuration by assigning a value to the variable handler404 .
For any other type of exception ,
If the DEBUG setting is True , get_response will execute the view django.views.debug.technical_500_response , passing the HttpRequest and exception information as arguments .
This view provides detailed information about the exception , including the traceback , local variables at each level of the stack , a detailed representation of the HttpRequest object and a listing of all non-sensitive settings .
If DEBUG is False , get_response calls the URL resolver ’s resolve_500 method , which works in mostly the same way as resolve_404 ; the default view in this case is django.views.defaults.server_error , and can be overridden in the URL configuration by assigning a value to the variable handler500 .
Additionally , for any exception other than django. http .
Http404 or Python ’s built - in SystemExit , the handler will fire the dispatcher signal got_request_exception , and construct a description of the exception which is mailed to each person listed in the Django settings file ’s ADMINS setting before returning .
Middleware , final round
At this point , regardless of anything which went wrong at any level in get_response , it should have returned an HttpResponse instance , so we ’re back up into the main part of the handler .
The first thing it does once it gets that HttpResponse is loop through its _response_middleware instance variable and apply the methods it finds there , passing the HttpRequest and the HttpResponse as arguments .
Note that this is the last chance any middleware has to modify things .
The check is in the mail
And now it ’s time to wrap up .
Once the final round of middleware has been applied , the handler fires the dispatcher signal request_finished , which is the absolute last call for anything that wanted to execute during the current request .
Handlers which listen for this signal should clean up and free any resources which were being used ; for example , Django attaches a listener to request_finished which will close any open database connections .
After that happens , the handler builds up an appropriate return value to send back to whatever instantiated it ( currently , either a mod_python - appropriate response or a WSGI - compliant response depending on the handler ) , and returns it .
Whew
And we ’re done .
From beginning to end , that ’s how Django processes a request .
